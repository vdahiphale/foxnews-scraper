We are focusing on just who is getting through those checkpoints in Kabul right now, as we get reports of protesters outside the airport and Taliban forces firing on them.  So much we don't know. This much we're just getting to know, a story in The Wall Street Journal that Vladimir Putin had rejected a role for U.S. forces near Afghanistan at that recent summit with President Biden. The argument at the time and the pitch for the president at the time was to see if he could establish a base of operations outside landlocked Afghanistan. It never happened.  And now we're beginning to understand why it was such an important issue.  Could that have been a sign of the angst the administration had ahead of this pullout from Afghanistan and the collapse that has followed? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  We're still keeping on top of the exodus that is now picking up some steam in Kabul. That is the good news. The bad news is, we're not quite sure who is picking and choosing who gets through that perimeter, if anyone, for the time being. Let's go to Jennifer Griffin with the very latest on what's happening -- Jennifer.",

To my next guest, who was warning back in June of last year, under another president, be careful what you wish for, you could get a lot more than you planned for. I'm talking about Joe Lieberman, who co-wrote an intriguing opinion piece in The Washington Post, along with Jack Keane, warning about an abrupt departure from Afghanistan, saying at the time: \"The U.S. military is in Afghanistan today fighting deadly enemies who continue to plan and prepare to kill Americans at home. The troops withdrawn prematurely, Americans, not just Afghans, will suffer the consequences.\" The senator and former vice presidential candidate joins me right now, Joseph Lieberman. That was a different president, a different plan. This is the present president with a different plan from that one. But, in both cases, you were concerned about how we leave.

That's why I think this thought that President Trump had and the policy that President Biden has now implemented to move us out of Afghanistan altogether together militarily was just not worth it.  We had it in a balance, 2, 500, 3,000 troops mostly involved not in counterinsurgency, not in nation-building, but in focusing on keeping the Taliban, who are terrorists, out of power and keeping Al Qaeda and ISIS out of Afghanistan and the region, to the extent that we could. And as General Keane I said in that op-ed last year, if we pulled out, we would surrender to an enemy, the Taliban, we have largely defeated. And that's, of course, exactly what's happened. I'm not surprised that President Biden asked to discuss with President Putin establishing another base outside of Afghanistan to do a lot of the things our troops were doing in Afghanistan, because it's absolutely necessary to regional security and the protection of Americans from terrorists. But what I am surprised that is that President Biden would somehow give President Putin a veto over that decision. If we had a friendly country in that region that wanted to take a base of operations for us and locate it within the country, we should have done it, which is just what Putin would have done if the roles were reversed.",

Incidentally, all my years in the Senate, going to Afghanistan, talking to the American military, they felt that the Afghan soldiers were really courageous fighters. And they liked fighting alongside them. And now I think when we left, and we pulled back airpower, which they really relied on in holding the Taliban back, they thought it was over. And so, naturally, they gave in. And I think the government in Kabul felt that it's -- as President Ghani apparently said, he would or ended up being hung. And he wasn't going to hang around for that to happen. So, over a period of time, over the last months, I think it was very clear, and, frankly, going back to the Trump administration, what a bad deal that was being negotiated with the Taliban in Qatar.

Those doses should be overseas where variants emerge, not right here right now.",

Numbers USA is an organization that advocates for less immigration. Their deputy director told us today -- quote -- \"Rather than address asylum abuse at the border, this administration is throwing open the gates.

This much we're just getting to know, a story in The Wall Street Journal that Vladimir Putin had rejected a role for U.S. forces near Afghanistan at that recent summit with President Biden. The argument at the time and the pitch for the president at the time was to see if he could establish a base of operations outside landlocked Afghanistan. It never happened. And now we're beginning to understand why it was such an important issue. Could that have been a sign of the angst the administration had ahead of this pullout from Afghanistan and the collapse that has followed? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.

And they had a six-month and 90-day assessment. And the fact is, they chose to ignore the intelligence community. And he ignored his top generals, by the way, in my judgment.

We're -- you can't negotiate with the Taliban. I talked to Mike Pompeo this morning, former secretary of state. And the idea that somehow this is Trump's fault and that President Trump -- that his February agreement had something to do this, what Pompeo told me was, they were in constant contact.

Now, despite calls from Congress, there are no plans for the military to go outside of the airport into Kabul and other regions to help evacuate some of those stranded Americans and our allies, as, by the way, the British are doing, although in a much narrower capacity. A credible source, though, tells me the State Department is now looking into non-military ways to stage and move Americans and others who are stranded around Kabul. I asked the State Department about this, and the information that this is an alternative to sending military forces into Kabul for the rescues. They did not dispute that information, Neil."

The troops withdrawn prematurely, Americans, not just Afghans, will suffer the consequences.\" The senator and former vice presidential candidate joins me right now, Joseph Lieberman. That was a different president, a different plan. This is the present president with a different plan from that one. But, in both cases, you were concerned about how we leave.

That's why I think this thought that President Trump had and the policy that President Biden has now implemented to move us out of Afghanistan altogether together militarily was just not worth it. We had it in a balance, 2, 500, 3,000 troops mostly involved not in counterinsurgency, not in nation-building, but in focusing on keeping the Taliban, who are terrorists, out of power and keeping Al Qaeda and ISIS out of Afghanistan and the region, to the extent that we could. And as General Keane I said in that op-ed last year, if we pulled out, we would surrender to an enemy, the Taliban, we have largely defeated. And that's, of course, exactly what's happened. I'm not surprised that President Biden asked to discuss with President Putin establishing another base outside of Afghanistan to do a lot of the things our troops were doing in Afghanistan, because it's absolutely necessary to regional security and the protection of Americans from terrorists. But what I am surprised that is that President Biden would somehow give President Putin a veto over that decision. If we had a friendly country in that region that wanted to take a base of operations for us and locate it within the country, we should have done it, which is just what Putin would have done if the roles were reversed."

But I would say that, certainly, I felt that a collapse -- I didn't know whether it would be days or weeks of the Afghan army and the government if we pulled out what would happen. And if you relied on something else, you were relying on something that was a wish, not based on a fact, because it was clear that we were providing moral support by just being there to the government, certainly, of Afghanistan, and to the military. Incidentally, all my years in the Senate, going to Afghanistan, talking to the American military, they felt that the Afghan soldiers were really courageous fighters. And they liked fighting alongside them. And now I think when we left, and we pulled back airpower, which they really relied on in holding the Taliban back, they thought it was over. And so, naturally, they gave in. And I think the government in Kabul felt that it's -- as President Ghani apparently said, he would or ended up being hung. And he wasn't going to hang around for that to happen. So, over a period of time, over the last months, I think it was very clear, and, frankly, going back to the Trump administration, what a bad deal that was being negotiated with the Taliban in Qatar. But, certainly, the last several months, the Biden administration was sending signals to the Afghan government and military, we're getting out of here, if at all possible. And that made them very nervous, and I think hastened the collapse that has occurred."

Is there any chance at all they will be able to get out, at least that number, especially when we're finding out it's not the U.S. calling the shots on who gets through that perimeter, but the Taliban? Danny Coulson is here, the former FBI deputy assistant director. You have seen these types of things about getting people out of harm's way. But this is tens of thousands of people who want that, Danny. But the latest intelligence we're getting is that we're not going to that perimeter the Taliban has set up.

And the hardest thing about rescuing people is knowing where they are and who they are. And we don't have a clue. We're in a nonpermissive situation, where we have chaos created by our own lack of planning. And now we're using that same chaos as an excuse for failure. And I don't know -- I don't how we get out of this. I'm not so sure it's tactically possible. I would look to buying them out, paying whatever it takes to get them out of there.

And this is a terrible situation, lack of planning, artificial deadlines on when we're going to do it, which is probably the biggest mistake. And now we have all these people that need rescuing.

But if it's much more than that, roughly, you're talking 30 days, 60 days. Again, the higher the count goes for those who want out, then it gets conceivable that this drags into the fall.

So, it may make sense for certain populations to reduce the risk of that mild common cold symptoms. But the way in which it was universally recommended, that was the concern. Let's wait for the data. By the way, the whole reason we're talking about breakthrough infections is that those two doses were too close together in the Pfizer and Moderna rollout. When -- the closer vaccines are, the shorter the interval, the less powerful the immunity is. And it's been studied. With Pfizer at three months, if the doses are three months apart, it's 3.5 times stronger immunity. And that's what I did."

Hopefully, we're going to see better therapeutics in the fall to help us with that, like Molnupiravir. That phase three trial is going to read out shortly after great phase two data. And I think it's something we need to just keep in mind is something that we're going to have to manage. We will not be able to booster our way out of mild infections. And, right now, we have got 200 million booster doses in storage that the U.S. government has pre-purchased after Moderna convinced the government they may need it.

And I think part of the problem is, we have messaged the idea of efficacy or protection with one term. There's really two levels. There's a protection against death and disability. That's always been our battle. And then there's the protection -- protection against mild illness. And that wanes. And we have always known that was going to be the case.

Attorney General Merrick Garland saying, announcing this -- quote -- \"Today marks a step forward in our effort to make the asylum process fairer and more expeditious. This rule will both reduce the caseload in our immigration courts and protect the rights of those fleeing persecution and violence.\" But there are plenty of critics who say that this is simply going to allow a lot more immigrants to get in. Numbers USA is an organization that advocates for less immigration. Their deputy director told us today -- quote -- \"Rather than address asylum abuse at the border, this administration is throwing open the gates. This rule will further bog down the system, grant asylum to those with non-meritorious cases and actually grant parole to aliens who by law should be detained.\" Now, as you take a look at the live pictures from our drone team, Neil, I think everybody would agree that this does -- and everybody does agree, in fact, that this will in fact speed up the asylum process.

Foreign fighters will go to Afghanistan to receive training. Al Qaeda is already there. The Haqqani Network is there. ISIS is there. All these groups will now be able to train, will be able to use U.S. captured equipment, and will be trained by soldiers that were trained by the Afghan -- by U.S. special operations, meaning former soldiers. There's a television special operations group walking the streets right outside of the airport that is dressed like U.S. special operators. They took the equipment, they took the uniforms, and they're walking around like they're U.S. special operators. And they happen to be Taliban special forces. Iran has deployed Afghans from Afghanistan to Syria, to Iraq, to Iran to put down protests inside of Iran. And they hope to utilize their proxies.

And to allow Putin to weigh in on where American forces go in former Soviet Republicans that want nothing to do with Putin, yet Putin still has more of a say than the United States, that is pathetic. That's not leadership. And that is -- that is dreadful."

The SecDef can do things. General Milley can do things. The United States military can do things. They need to either own up for this or tell -- and tell Biden that he needs to change his policy, or they should resign. The United States military should not be told what it can and can't do by the Taliban. And it certainly shouldn't be told what it can and can't do by Vladimir Putin."
