As you know, this speech was initially slated for tomorrow, but Pelosi rescinded her invitation due to the partial government shutdown, which has now ended.  And we'll have a lot more on that coming up in just a few. But first, the 2020 Democratic presidential primary already turning into a circus, Senator Kamala Harris formally launching her campaign where she took shots at the president and pushed a radical agenda.",

I just think it's really interesting to look at what happened on the left. And when President Obama was talking about this fundamental transformation of America, so many of us were saying this is going to be a creeping normality, little by little of more and more government in your face, and everyone was saying no, no, no, he really wants Obamacare.  And I said, no, he doesn't. He wants Medicare for all. And he's instituting Obamacare because he knows is going to fall and that's what people like Bernie Sanders are going to rush in with.

So, in terms of who would support him -- you also have a shrinking number of people who identify as Republican. So when you say, oh, Republicans still support Trump overwhelmingly, although it's drifted a little bit, it's a smaller group. But if you take away a percentage of the people who are opposed to Trump to back an independent like Schultz who has lots of money, that's big trouble. And that's why I think you see Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, saying he will not run as an independent.

All right, the British paper The Daily Telegraph issued a humiliating apology on Saturday, admitting an article titled \"The Mystery of Melania\" was full of fake news about the first lady. They took it back and paid her substantial damages. There's no point in recounting the story's lies. They're the same stuff you heard many times before, part of a larger industry built on unknown sources and bitter bias. And it shows you the kind of year the media is having, and it's only been three weeks. But you have the Buzzfeed debacle, the Covington smear, layoffs at clickbait mills like Buzzfeed and \"Huffington Post.\" CNN mocked for pretending they stumbled onto Roger Stone's arrest. And now you've got this brutal Telegraph humbling. These events have one thing in common: accountability. It's new, and it's good for everyone, especially you, because you may not know how false the Melania coverage is, but you can bet she does. And that's the point. You never know what fake news is until it's about you. Ask anyone who's ever been the subject of a story. Unless they're vacuous actors pumping a socially conscious film, it's never, ever good. It's why, love him or hate him, Trump's war with fake news makes the past two years' worth it. His disruption has exposed the hidden levers in so many dark guards: from trade to immigration to copy editing and fact-checking. So if only one result from the Trump era is that -- is the media thinks that twice before destroying someone for fun and profit, then I'd call that a win. Wouldn't you? All right.

And the reason that they can't talk about quality is because what makes quality better in these industries is actually the free market which they actively oppose. I just think it's really interesting to look at what happened on the left. And when President Obama was talking about this fundamental transformation of America, so many of us were saying this is going to be a creeping normality, little by little of more and more government in your face, and everyone was saying no, no, no, he really wants Obamacare. And I said, no, he doesn't. He wants Medicare for all. And he's instituting Obamacare because he knows is going to fall and that's what people like Bernie Sanders are going to rush in with.

So, in terms of who would support him -- you also have a shrinking number of people who identify as Republican. So when you say, oh, Republicans still support Trump overwhelmingly, although it's drifted a little bit, it's a smaller group. But if you take away a percentage of the people who are opposed to Trump to back an independent like Schultz who has lots of money, that's big trouble. And that's why I think you see Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, saying he will not run as an independent. And you -- I think -- maybe it was Greg who mentioned, you know, what happened with Ross Perot back in '92. You can go back to people like John Anderson or come forward to people, you know -- it just strikes me that you see these people, like in 2000, you know, people said --"

So, what the Democrats are saying is why would you run? You can't win anything, in the Electoral College you can't win. But what this could possibly be -- and I think we may be shaping up for this is one of those realigning elections in American history. And you have these like in 1912 with the progressive party actually got more votes than the Republican Party for president in that election.

It's like when you're really into a band that you really like until you find out that, like, Joy Behar likes the band, so now you hate the band. That's the Democrats with immigration policy. They were like all for everything that's Trump's for, but now he's for it they're like, ah, nope, we're against it. And so, it's a personal thing.

And I think -- I mean, really, if we want to go to the heart of the matter this should have been -- we're talking about last year's fiscal year spending that we're still arguing over. We haven't even gotten to this year yet. So we have a whole another fight, you know, on all of that. And so, I do think that this sort of stuff should be done in the regular order. In August, they canceled the senate recess in order to get all these things through. They got to vote 75 percent done. They didn't get it all done. So I don't think any of these members of Congress should get paid. They shouldn't get home. When they have these fights, it's affecting real people. There are real friends of mine who are in the federal government, with children, who are going without paychecks.

So there are people on the Republican side who are running for this, but she's the one who's been elevated, as you said, and been given this big platform. And until Democrats start to realize -- look, just tonight, while we're on here, there's a -- there's a bill that's going through the Senate that Marco Rubio has been pushing that is a bit that is anti-BDS, which is the sanctions against Israel. Schumer was able to get rid of the vote because he said, \"Well, it's during the shutdown.\" All of these senators are going to start to be put on record, and they are afraid of the base, which is now becoming increasingly anti-Israel, increasingly hostile.

And her new owner saw the commercial, was drawn to her. So she has been adopted into her forever home and I believe she has been adopted before it brought back, which made me very sad.
