New reports that the actor received a threatening letter and was disappointed that there wasn't more outrage over it. Then, may have concocted the attack story to gain attention. This is coming from a CBS reporter in Chicago where Smollett claims this attack happened. It is just one of many new twists unfolding tonight.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story\" that has some drawing some comparisons to the Tawana Brawley case back in the 1980s. More on that as we look back in a moment with Geraldo Rivera. But first, let's go straight to Mike Tobin who is live in Chicago tonight with the very latest here. Hi, Mike.",

Police no longer consider Jussie Smollett to be a victim of a hate crime or anything.  They're still not ready to call him a suspect of a hoax. What police now say with a bit of redundancy is that they have developed new information in the case and they want to get Smollett in for some follow-up questions. And Kavanaugh, who's doing crisis P.R. for Smollett and his new legal team, says they won't submit to the follow-up today. While many of the legal experts say, Smollett should not submit to this follow-up ever because police just want to catch him in a lie.  A prominent Chicago attorney Steve Greenberg, says there are two ways to play this.",

One of them was a personal trainer for Smollett. Here is a part where we start going to unnamed sources. One source tells me, they were paid $3,500 to participate in the hoax attack with the promise for follow-up money. Many outlets have reported the follow-up payment was supposed to be $500.   Leaks say, they rehearsed the attack. An apartment where the brothers stay in Wrigleyville was raided. Leaks say police have recovered a receipt for a purchase of a rope. A magazine that was used to create this letter -- to said that life-threatening letter to the \"EMPIRE\" studio. That WBBM is now reporting that it could have been the first step in this.  But all you can get on the record right now through official police sources is that they develop new evidence and they want to get Smollett in for that follow-up interview.

Orlando, and the shooting in the Pulse nightclubs, that's the wolf. Charlottesville and the incidents around Pittsburgh and the synagogues. Those things are the wolf.

That someone who is just lying for whatever personal reason, he denigrates and diminishes those with legitimate complaints.   I lived through Tawana Brawley, I was a good friend of Al Sharpton's at the time. I was slated to be his character witness if you believe it in the defamation lawsuit against him in the 1990s, 10 years after the fraud in which the teenager claimed to have been held for four days, kidnapped, repeatedly raped, found smeared with feces, with graffiti -- racist graffiti written all over and it turns out that she engineered the whole thing.  That really puts a cloud of suspicion overall of these -- a more legitimate charges. It is a tragedy. This fellow, if it appears the trajectory we're going on now, he's going to be charged with filing a false police report at the state level, if indeed he sent that letter or engineered the sending of that threat letter to his studio. He also has a federal mail fraud charge. These things are taken very seriously, but what this person has apparently done. And again, I rush to judgment when I heard the charge, I was debating a buddy of mine who is saying MAGA hats are all inherently racist. I was saying, \"No, it's not true. It's in the heart of the wearer.  And then, this happened a couple of days later. I demanded an investigation. The first thing I see they show the perpetrators, the alleged perpetrators, two black guys. So, I say, what the -- what the hell is going on here? And you know, look at this with a much more discerning eye, when I did, what turns out is someone who for whatever sick reason has in a sloppy conspiracy apparently. You know, use this you know use this -- you know, the sacred memory of the victims that your other guests sites today for whatever personal aggrandizement or whatever it is, I think it's sickening.",

The Jalisco is run by El Mencho, that's El Chapo's main rival. And with El Chapo now headed to prison for life, the Sinaloa cartel is seen as vulnerable. And experts say we can expect turf battles and a dramatic increase in violence in cities like Juarez and Tijuana that sit just across the border from the U.S. For example, investigators say that surveillance and communication intercepts show that in just a few months the Jalisco Cartel and the six illegal immigrants trafficked in 30 kilos of cocaine and more than 2,000 grams of methamphetamine, first into Texas then to Georgia and finally across the border with North Carolina. The street value of that hall alone is in the millions and there apparently is also evidence the drug money was smuggled to Florida. Now, of the six subjects, Oscar Rangel-Gutierrez appears to be the leader. He and his parents both have homes in North Carolina. Regulo Rangel-Gutierrez, Rigoberto Rangel-Gutierrez, and Raul Rangel- Gutierrez were also arrested. It's unclear if those men are related. Rodolfo Martinez and Francisco Martinez were also taken into custody. Federal authority says the big tip came from a confidential source who spent years working in the Jalisco New Generation Cartel transporting large amounts of money. And it is also very notable that in the just past four months there had been six or seven major drug bust in and around Charlotte, North Carolina, which have also led to the arrest of six members of the brutal and violent MS-13 gang.

I think the issue with climate change, for example, -- as I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill in the Congress. That's right. Democrats and Republicans coming together on a carbon tax and we take all the money and we give it right back to the American people in a dividend. That's the kind of solution that I can get done. I think we should have universal health care in this country, but I don't think we should get there by making private insurance illegal. That's a crazy approach, right? So, I want to do things that matters to everyday Americans with their education, with their health care, create jobs and communities that have been left behind. We've seen a tremendous hollowing out economically of jobs in this country. You know, last year, Martha, in our country, 80 percent of the money for startup companies went to 50 counties out of over 3,000 in this country. And I'm a former entrepreneur. I started two companies and took on public on the New York Stock Exchange. So, I know how to create jobs.

New reports that the actor received a threatening letter and was disappointed that there wasn't more outrage over it. Then, may have concocted the attack story to gain attention. This is coming from a CBS reporter in Chicago where Smollett claims this attack happened. It is just one of many new twists unfolding tonight. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story\" that has some drawing some comparisons to the Tawana Brawley case back in the 1980s. More on that as we look back in a moment with Geraldo Rivera.

Police no longer consider Jussie Smollett to be a victim of a hate crime or anything. They're still not ready to call him a suspect of a hoax. What police now say with a bit of redundancy is that they have developed new information in the case and they want to get Smollett in for some follow-up questions. And Kavanaugh, who's doing crisis P.R. for Smollett and his new legal team, says they won't submit to the follow-up today. While many of the legal experts say, Smollett should not submit to this follow-up ever because police just want to catch him in a lie. A prominent Chicago attorney Steve Greenberg, says there are two ways to play this."

One of them was a personal trainer for Smollett. Here is a part where we start going to unnamed sources. One source tells me, they were paid $3,500 to participate in the hoax attack with the promise for follow-up money. Many outlets have reported the follow-up payment was supposed to be $500. Leaks say, they rehearsed the attack. An apartment where the brothers stay in Wrigleyville was raided. Leaks say police have recovered a receipt for a purchase of a rope. A magazine that was used to create this letter -- to said that life-threatening letter to the \"EMPIRE\" studio. That WBBM is now reporting that it could have been the first step in this.  But all you can get on the record right now through official police sources is that they develop new evidence and they want to get Smollett in for that follow-up interview. Martha?"

But there were also an additional thousand police agencies participating in the hate crime reporting. So, there's no actual benchmark that we have that solid from 2016 to 2017. In any case, we're talking at most of 7,000 reported hate crimes that is a minuscule amount in a country of this size."

It is an ideology that is coming out of the universities that says that the fundamental characteristic of America, especially in the Trump-era, is racism, bigotry, lethal hatred. This is overdetermined. We saw this a month ago with the -- an equal hoax about the Covington Catholic school boys that was also greeted as modern-day lynching. As anybody who wears a MAGA hat is by definition out to kill blacks. This is now what America's elites are committed to believing regardless of the falsity of the evidence."

But everyone, they wanted to believe Jussie Smollett right away. But I know that if these facts are not right, and Jussie Smollett has done the wrong thing, then he has to take his lumps. And this is not a Jussie Smollett apologize to it, this is about him being accountable if the facts come in that he orchestrated this particular incident. But that's not really the point here. We're focusing on one particular incident with one particular actor. And we're saying, OK, if the boy cried wolf that means the wolf doesn't exist. But we all know the wolf does exist. Just as the boy cries wolf and there is -- you know, no particular incident in this case. It does mean that the wolf still exists. So, what is the wolf? Orlando, and the shooting in the Pulse nightclubs, that's the wolf. Charlottesville and the incidents around Pittsburgh and the synagogues. Those things are the wolf. So to say that those crimes don't exist or they're not on the rise or to refute the FBI data that through 2015 through 2017 that these incidents have been on the rise, that's not true."

But Geraldo, how dangerous is that kind of game in this environment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIVERA",
      "utterance": "Well, the danger is that because racism is ugly and real. That someone who is just lying for whatever personal reason, he denigrates and diminishes those with legitimate complaints. I lived through Tawana Brawley, I was a good friend of Al Sharpton's at the time. I was slated to be his character witness if you believe it in the defamation lawsuit against him in the 1990s, 10 years after the fraud in which the teenager claimed to have been held for four days, kidnapped, repeatedly raped, found smeared with feces, with graffiti -- racist graffiti written all over and it turns out that she engineered the whole thing. That really puts a cloud of suspicion overall of these -- a more legitimate charges. It is a tragedy. This fellow, if it appears the trajectory we're going on now, he's going to be charged with filing a false police report at the state level, if indeed he sent that letter or engineered the sending of that threat letter to his studio. He also has a federal mail fraud charge. These things are taken very seriously, but what this person has apparently done. And again, I rush to judgment when I heard the charge, I was debating a buddy of mine who is saying MAGA hats are all inherently racist. I was saying, \"No, it's not true. It's in the heart of the wearer. And then, this happened a couple of days later. I demanded an investigation. The first thing I see they show the perpetrators, the alleged perpetrators, two black guys. So, I say, what the -- what the hell is going on here? And you know, look at this with a much more discerning eye, when I did, what turns out is someone who for whatever sick reason has in a sloppy conspiracy apparently. You know, use this you know use this -- you know, the sacred memory of the victims that your other guests sites today for whatever personal aggrandizement or whatever it is, I think it's sickening."

And I was so horrified about what had happened to this young girl. And you know, she said she was gone for four days, she had been raped by these young men. And the entire country became completely wrapped up in this story. When I heard that it was fake, that it was made up, it sort of pulled the rug out from underneath. You know, the whole process of feeling -- you know, you felt like you had given your gut, your sympathy to this person who was faking it. There's something that is just inherently wrong, Kwame, with doing that to people. With ripping through their emotions."

Here now Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Legal and Political Analyst and author of the Russia Hoax, Harry Houck is a retired NYPD first-grade detective, and Juan Williams co-host of \"The Five,\" Fox News political analyst.

Because you know, other than the one statement which was, well, the President had it accepted what Putin had said about North Korean missiles, all right, well that's up to the president.

When Rosenstein asked McCabe about the cabinet, I said to myself, did McCabe have a conversation with somebody in the cabinet? I mean, how would this conversation you know, or this question come to be at that time? Now, why would Rosenstein asking about the cabinet and how many votes we would have? And it also tells me that Rosenstein also has that on his mind and that maybe they both have talked about that before or both have conferred with people that were part of the president's cabinet. And we would tend to think that the president's cabinet would be behind the president 100 percent. But that question alone was very disturbing."

And in addition to the idea that Flynn was doing such work and that we know that there was a problem in terms of Sessions having contact with the ambassador and the like, then you come to the idea that wait a second, this is dramatic to my mind. In the 60 Minutes interview he says, when he's told about North Korea's ability to attack the United States on the basis of American intelligence agency says oh no, Vladimir Putin told me that's not a problem. Well, if you I were there, you'd say, oh my God."

The Jalisco is run by El Mencho, that's El Chapo's main rival. And with El Chapo now headed to prison for life, the Sinaloa cartel is seen as vulnerable. And experts say we can expect turf battles and a dramatic increase in violence in cities like Juarez and Tijuana that sit just across the border from the U.S. For example, investigators say that surveillance and communication intercepts show that in just a few months the Jalisco Cartel and the six illegal immigrants trafficked in 30 kilos of cocaine and more than 2,000 grams of methamphetamine, first into Texas then to Georgia and finally across the border with North Carolina. The street value of that hall alone is in the millions and there apparently is also evidence the drug money was smuggled to Florida. Now, of the six subjects, Oscar Rangel-Gutierrez appears to be the leader. He and his parents both have homes in North Carolina. Regulo Rangel-Gutierrez, Rigoberto Rangel-Gutierrez, and Raul Rangel- Gutierrez were also arrested. It's unclear if those men are related. Rodolfo Martinez and Francisco Martinez were also taken into custody. Federal authority says the big tip came from a confidential source who spent years working in the Jalisco New Generation Cartel transporting large amounts of money. And it is also very notable that in the just past four months there had been six or seven major drug bust in and around Charlotte, North Carolina, which have also led to the arrest of six members of the brutal and violent MS-13 gang.

But they think it's a good idea to take fencing down. I've literally, I mean, we have debates about how effective a wall is, but I've never talk to a single American voter who is in favor of actually less wall or less fencing along the southern border. Most people do view this as a crisis of some sort, a humanitarian crisis for the people who are trying to cross the border, among other things. And they want to do something about it.

All right, coming up next, a story exclusive with the first Democrat to declare that he is running for president and why he is campaigning against the ideas that are very popular in his party right now, like Medicare for all and the green new deal that we were just talking about. Twenty-twenty presidential candidate from Maryland, John Delaney, up next."

Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney says no to Medicare for all, no to the green new deal and no to those who pushed Amazon out of New York City. So, he is bucking his own party, potentially the way to win the nomination? Here now exclusively, John Delaney, former congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Sir, good to have you with us today. Thank you very much for being here."

      "utterance": "So, when you look at this field, you have a lot of people who have some pretty decent name recognition, they spent time in the Senate, ran for Senate. In Beto O'Rourke's case if he gets in, but a lot of people don't know who you are and in most of the polls that we've seen you barely register. So how do you plan to turn that around?"

      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I just opened my sixth office here in Iowa, I'm sitting here in Waterloo, Iowa. We've got more people on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire that the other campaigns. We've got a big campaign here. So, Martha, I'm pursuing that kind of old-fashioned early state strategy where you are in coffee shops and people's living rooms and you're telling them what your plans are and I'm introducing myself to them. And we are getting a lot of enthusiasm on the ground here in Iowa and New Hampshire. So, to some extent I'm playing a bit of a different game. Right? I'm not necessarily playing the national media game right now, I am playing the Iowa, New Hampshire early state strategy. I've done over 300 events in these early states, we have a lot of supporters on the ground here. And we've got a good size team. I just, like I said, I just opened my office here in Waterloo."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So how do you keep that, you know, the long-term picture as these other people get in and they are going flood Iowa as well. And I understand what you're saying about your strategy, that you realize --"

      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- I would imagine that you are kind of an underdog in this thing and you don't have a lot of name recognition. The other thing is though, that, you know, we're hearing a lot about how diverse the candidate needs to be for the Democratic side. That that's a major. We heard Cory Booker say the other say, you know, I will definitely pick a woman if I am the nominee because that will give the balance that might take it needs. You are, you know, a middle-aged white male, what kind of -- how -- what do you have to offer to that equation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "So, listen, I think the diversity in our party is terrific. I think our party right now at this moment in time really represents the American people. You know, I'm not a person of color and I'm not a woman as you correctly recognized there. And so, I can never fully appreciate all of the issues people of color and women have had to deal with in this country. But I do believe at the end of the day what the Democratic Party is going to look for is the person who they think is the best leader, who has the best vision for the country. I'm running as a pragmatic idealist. There's big things I want to do to make this world better, but I actually want to get them done. I want to find common ground. I want to bring people together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What is number one on your list? We know you don't like the green new deal, you don't like Medicare for all. What's the number one thing that you -- what's your mission?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Well, so, it's not that I don't like those things, right. I like the fact that people are trying to create universal health care, I like the fact that we're dealing with climate change. I just have better ways of doing them. Right. I think the issue with climate change, for example, -- as I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill in the Congress. That's right. Democrats and Republicans coming together on a carbon tax and we take all the money and we give it right back to the American people in a dividend. That's the kind of solution that I can get done. I think we should have universal health care in this country, but I don't think we should get there by making private insurance illegal. That's a crazy approach, right? So, I want to do things that matters to everyday Americans with their education, with their health care, create jobs and communities that have been left behind. We've seen a tremendous hollowing out economically of jobs in this country. You know, last year, Martha, in our country, 80 percent of the money for startup companies went to 50 counties out of over 3,000 in this country. And I'm a former entrepreneur. I started two companies and took on public on the New York Stock Exchange. So, I know how to create jobs. So, I'm focused on jobs, I'm focused on health care, I'm focused on education, opportunities for people's kids. These are issues that matter to the American people."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What about the idea that you might be running as a potential vice-presidential candidate? What do you say to that? There's a lot of women who are in the field. Is that something that you would consider?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "I'm running for president. So that's my goal. I am the right person for the job. I believe I have the right vision for the country. And importantly, I'm very focused on bringing this country together. I think one of the central issues we face as a country is how terribly divided we are. how Americans has been increasingly pitted against Americans. So, I think we have to get back to this notion of common purpose that we're all in it together. There are some big things we need to do but we have to do them together. And there's obvious solutions for all the issues we face as a country right now, whether it's health care, climate change, jobs, pharmaceutical prices, but we got to solve them together."

George Mendonsa planted that famous kiss on a pretty stranger to celebrate. He later became a fisherman in Rhode Island that's where he died at the age of 95. We thank him for his service and his exuberance on that day. That is \"The Story\" for Monday, the 18th. We'll see you tomorrow night. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
