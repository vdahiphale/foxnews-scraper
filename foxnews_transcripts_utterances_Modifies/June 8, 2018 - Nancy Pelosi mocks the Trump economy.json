It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert, a battle on trade playing out north on the border. We're awaiting President Trump's bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit. The two have been going back and forth over tariffs and on twitter. We're also expecting the president to sit down with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, and we're going to bring you that as soon as it happens. In the meantime, President Trump is causing controversy by calling on Russia to be reinstated into the G7. You may recall Russia was ousted after its annexation of Crimea in 2014.",

And, one of the things about this that the Republicans just need to be a little bit concerned about is that the president's numbers are better, the generic ballot is better, but the Democrats are highly motivated to register new voters. I didn't know this until the other day. In the Virginia election for the gubernatorial race last November, more Republicans turned out to vote then in the history of the country in Virginia. And still, Ed Gillespie lost by nine points. One of the things that happened is 12 percent of the voters in that election had never voted in a gubernatorial election before.

My doctors tell me their best estimate is that I have only a few weeks left to live. This is the final verdict. My fight is over.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" This is a Fox News alert, a battle on trade playing out north on the border. We're awaiting President Trump's bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit. The two have been going back and forth over tariffs and on twitter. We're also expecting the president to sit down with French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, and we're going to bring you that as soon as it happens. In the meantime, President Trump is causing controversy by calling on Russia to be reinstated into the G7. You may recall Russia was ousted after its annexation of Crimea in 2014."

He said as soon as we finished the trade negotiations, we're all going to in love again. And so, who says this? It's the most transparent administration ever. He tells you how things work because he hides nothing and that keeps everybody, in a weird way, off balance, because they're not use to him speaking his mind. People should not be worrying about this controversy, or that Canada is upset, or Europe's upset, they're always upset at our actions. They love a good obedient liberal who strives to be Europeans. That's why they like President Obama, because President Obama wants that smaller footprint that Europe had. They hated Bush, they hated Reagan, so they're supposed to hate Trump, that's the way it's. And for our press, it's interchangeable if you're -- basically right for Europe. So that's why this is being presented this way. The fact is, this is completely normal."

It could be that NAFTA will be a different form. It could be with Canada, with Mexico, one on one, much simpler -- mush easier thing to do. I think better for both countries. But, we're talking about that among other things. But, the relationship is probably better, as good or better than it's ever been.

He goes in, his personable company, he's able to sit down with you and change the dialogue, change the rules of the game. People are just not used to it. But, guess what, it's producing different results that are fantastic for the United States, and he's able to work well with this other leaders."

And, on a larger scale, you get people like Macron, or France saying, oh, the United States wants to go alone. They want isolation. So, we can be the G6 and we will swipe deals. And remember, the U.S. really needs allies to take on China. So, we are putting ourselves in -- I guess from the Trump position of America first."

I'm a free trader, so I have problems with tariffs, even though I look in this -- I think there's some potential here. But I consider myself a free trader. However, I count the achievements, ISIS, North Korea, perhaps, economy, Paris accords, Iran, Gorsuch. That's 6, OK, 6 out of 7 or 8 major items. I could almost forgive this if it's not an actual full on trade war because you've got the 6 out of 7, and I think that's why farmers and others might be trusting him or grinning and bearing it. By the way, the E.U. does imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. car imports, it's like, I think, 4 times ours. The European pays that, so that's what happens, your citizens pays the tariffs. If they can just roll it back to 2.5, which is where we are, that's pretty good. Everybody wins."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the ultimate goal. It's a bunch of bluffing right now. When we slap tariffs on stuff, they have higher tariffs than we have on everything. Like you just said, cranberries for instance. Cranberries, they have almost a 20 percent tariff on cranberries in the E.U. So, the cranberry farmers here in the United States, they, you know -- it's not as competitive there in the European market."

If we use tariffs correctly in a reciprocal manner, 2.5percent, it works. The problem is when it's not balance, having said that, I'm a free trader, so I have to watch to see this. My favorite part that we haven't talked about it is Trump skipping the climate meeting. I mean, he said, you know what, I don't think I have to meet with these sanctimonious Euro yahoos who are going to tell me about how important the carbon offset credits are.

When you see an economy that's booming like this, you see the women, minorities, blacks, all more engaged in the economy. You see the numbers in terms of jobs available, record low unemployment. This is something that America wanted. This is why he was elected. And, you see here somebody like Nancy Pelosi seems completely out of touch, doesn't make any sense, one gap after the next. If that's the future, right, of the Democratic Party, they're in big trouble going into the midterm elections and going into 2020. That's the problem.

And, one of the things about this that the Republicans just need to be a little bit concerned about is that the president's numbers are better, the generic ballot is better, but the Democrats are highly motivated to register new voters. I didn't know this until the other day. In the Virginia election for the gubernatorial race last November, more Republicans turned out to vote then in the history of the country in Virginia. And still, Ed Gillespie lost by nine points. One of the things that happened is 12 percent of the voters in that election had never voted in a gubernatorial election before.

In his statement, Charles writes, \"I have been uncharacteristically silence this past 10 months. I had thought that silence would soon be coming to an end, but I'm afraid I must tell you now that fate has decided on a different course for me\". My doctors tell me their best estimate is that I have only a few weeks left to live. This is the final verdict. My fight is over. I am grateful to have played a small role in the conversations that have helped guide this extraordinary nation's destiny. FOX NEWS and 21st Century Fox executive chairman, Rupert Murdoch also releasing a statement, \"Charles has been a profound source of personal and intellectual inspiration for all of us at Fox News. His words, his ideas, his dignity, and his integrity will resonate within our society and within me for many, many years to come\". Greg, let me got to you first. I used to love it when you would say, Crowd Hammer."

But, you know, what if they say, what is that shiny thing I see behind it Charles? Sometimes, I guess, the camera would catch an edge of the metal on the chair. But, I think he was very proud of that by the way. But it's a little bit like FDR in a wheelchair. You know, it's not central to the argument, and this is a man of tremendous intellect.
