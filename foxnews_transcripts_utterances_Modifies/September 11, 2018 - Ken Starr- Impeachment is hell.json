      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "This is a winning issue for Republicans and the necessary security measure for America at this perilous moment. On this 9/11 anniversary, just look at what we spent to protect ourselves. According to the Stimson Center report, since 9/11, the U.S. has spent at least $2.8 trillion on counterterrorism, 15 percent of our discretionary budget goes to fund counterterrorism efforts across the government.   In 2017 alone, Congress dedicated $175 billion to fight terrorism. And that doesn't count for the trillions that was spent in wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the work we've done in Syria and Pakistan. A Brown University study estimates that the total cost of all that war since 9/11 through this year could be a staggering $5.6 trillion. So we lay out all this money to enforce other country's borders, but we can't afford $20 billion to enforce and fortify our own? Our porous border remains one of our greatest national security threats. Since fiscal year 2001, there have been more than 11.6 million illegal border crossings along our southern border.  And in just the last few days, the border patrol in the Rio Grande Valley reports that they have arrested in the United States eight MS-13 and 18th Street gang members. Five sexual predators, some wanted by authorities, and of course they frustrated drug smuggling attempts at the same time. Well, that is just a few days and only one region of the border.  How do these people get into our country? And might a wall stop the flow of illegals who pose a criminal and possible national security threat to our citizens? Well, I disagree with the good people the president referenced earlier. Now is the time to talk about the wall and to awaken citizens to the ongoing threat posed by an open border. And particularly on 9/11, we should remind people of the horror visited upon us by five hijackers who overstayed their visas. It is a whole separate issue. And think of this, as of 2017, we have over 700,000 people here on expired visas. That is even separate from the wall. This is total madness. All of this, but controlling our border, who comes in, and who goes out of the country should be one of our top priorities. If not, our number one priority. This summer, Reuters found that immigration was the top issue for voters going into the midterms. If Republicans want to really motivate their base to turn out and vote and win in some of those -- win over some of those security moms in the process.   Give them what they want. Fund the wall immediately. Attach it to one of those spending bills going to the president at the end of the month. Now I know people are worried about a government shutdown. But this isn't -- this isn't a small deal.  If this isn't done now, Mitch McConnell, I am telling you, if they are not smart enough to know this at this point, they are never going to know it, and this wall will never be built. And that is the \"Angle.\" Joining us now the reaction is Univision anchor Enrique Acevedo along with Jason Owens, deputy chief border patrol for the Laredo, Texas border sector. Great to see both of you. Enrique, let's start with you here. This is just a few of the facts. This is Border Patrol facts along our southwest border.  Fiscal year '17, we've had 415,191 border apprehensions. Fiscal year '16, 563,000, '15, 444,000, '14, 569,000, '13, 489,000. So, this is what, Enrique, our Border Patrol are up against. So why not make their job easier by having a physical barrier in place to lighten their load so they can look for the bad guys?",

Now you referenced some MS-13 members and gang members. I can tell you in my sector alone, one of nine along the southwest border, we have already caught almost 50 known gang members this year alone.   Over 770 criminal aliens that have been deported and came back after committing violent crimes, murder, assault, rape, you name it.

These are folks that mostly, all of them actually, innocent people on airplanes or in buildings, were firefighters, police officers, and emergency first responders, who just try to go in and make a difference and help people and get them out of harm's way. I have known at least I would say between five to ten of the firefighters, good friends of mine, whose kids grew up and went to military academies, all with the idea of going in the military, serving the country, serving to honor their father. And most of those fathers were really special guys. The best of the best we had, and we had some really great people. So I would really doubt that if you ask any of those kids graduating from the Naval Academy or West Point or the kids who went on the job to honor their parents or their fathers, how they felt about the police officers and the firefighters. I think you might get a very different version of the politics of just disagreeing with the president, who we should be working to help, no matter what our opinions are and comparing them to a grave threat from a foreign nation.",

It's hell to go through for the American people. Even though there are very strong feelings on one side and then on the other side, that is not our system. We have impeachment in the constitution. It's an important last resort.

That is when the bridge will close for good here. One of the locals came up to me and said you are not planning to stay through the storm, are you? And I look at him, and he said, not a good idea. When the locals tell you to get out, it is probably a good idea to get out. Part of the reason is the storm surges expected to be after 13 feet which would take it above the garages and into the first floors of most of the structures on this strip of land. The other big concern here, of course, the wind, which is expected to be at least a Cat three, somewhere between 111 and 129-mile-per-hour winds. The structures here, the new ones, are rated about 130, so there are some builders watching this very closely and homeowners of course as well, very nervous tonight. The other big issue, Laura, is the rain, which could be two to three feet, up to four feet, not just along the coast but inland.

      "utterance": "This is a winning issue for Republicans and the necessary security measure for America at this perilous moment. On this 9/11 anniversary, just look at what we spent to protect ourselves. According to the Stimson Center report, since 9/11, the U.S. has spent at least $2.8 trillion on counterterrorism, 15 percent of our discretionary budget goes to fund counterterrorism efforts across the government. In 2017 alone, Congress dedicated $175 billion to fight terrorism. And that doesn't count for the trillions that was spent in wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the work we've done in Syria and Pakistan. A Brown University study estimates that the total cost of all that war since 9/11 through this year could be a staggering $5.6 trillion. So we lay out all this money to enforce other country's borders, but we can't afford $20 billion to enforce and fortify our own? Our porous border remains one of our greatest national security threats. Since fiscal year 2001, there have been more than 11.6 million illegal border crossings along our southern border. And in just the last few days, the border patrol in the Rio Grande Valley reports that they have arrested in the United States eight MS-13 and 18th Street gang members. Five sexual predators, some wanted by authorities, and of course they frustrated drug smuggling attempts at the same time. Well, that is just a few days and only one region of the border. How do these people get into our country? And might a wall stop the flow of illegals who pose a criminal and possible national security threat to our citizens? Well, I disagree with the good people the president referenced earlier. Now is the time to talk about the wall and to awaken citizens to the ongoing threat posed by an open border. And particularly on 9/11, we should remind people of the horror visited upon us by five hijackers who overstayed their visas. It is a whole separate issue. And think of this, as of 2017, we have over 700,000 people here on expired visas. That is even separate from the wall. This is total madness. All of this, but controlling our border, who comes in, and who goes out of the country should be one of our top priorities. If not, our number one priority. This summer, Reuters found that immigration was the top issue for voters going into the midterms. If Republicans want to really motivate their base to turn out and vote and win in some of those -- win over some of those security moms in the process. Give them what they want. Fund the wall immediately. Attach it to one of those spending bills going to the president at the end of the month. Now I know people are worried about a government shutdown. But this isn't -- this isn't a small deal. If this isn't done now, Mitch McConnell, I am telling you, if they are not smart enough to know this at this point, they are never going to know it, and this wall will never be built. And that is the \"Angle.\" Joining us now the reaction is Univision anchor Enrique Acevedo along with Jason Owens, deputy chief border patrol for the Laredo, Texas border sector. Great to see both of you. Enrique, let's start with you here. This is just a few of the facts. This is Border Patrol facts along our southwest border. Fiscal year '17, we've had 415,191 border apprehensions. Fiscal year '16, 563,000, '15, 444,000, '14, 569,000, '13, 489,000. So, this is what, Enrique, our Border Patrol are up against.

What we have right now is not enough to fully secure the border. We had nearly 20,000 men and women in the U.S. Border Patrol, almost 2,000 in Laredo sector alone. It's not enough. We still have people getting through. We still have things that are coming across our border that we don't know about. If we want to have a secure border, if we want to truly protect this country and what it stands for, these are things that we need. And the subject matter experts that have done is job for decades on end, are telling you, we need a wall, we need infrastructures. We need roads to be able to respond. We need cameras to be able to detect the traffic that's coming across and we need the brave men and women out there to able to do the job right."

And we can find $25 billion over a period of time to pay for a physical barrier? It's not everything, but it's a statement and it will stop a lot of the flow. We saw in Operation Gatekeeper in the San Diego sector. That cut down Border Patrol - - border crossings by 89 percent. That was started under Bill Clinton and then ultimately expanded under George W. Bush. So Enrique, Mexico has the right to protect their borders, Guatemala has the right to protect their heirs, every country has that inherent right, that sovereign right to control who comes in and know what their intentions are.

This is taxpayer money that has been used to militarize our border at a great cost for a once dynamic border communities and immigrants, human rights. Instead of being part of a broader strategy, border enforcement has become the only strategy. So I think that is where we have to, you know, really look at what has been going on over the last 50, 60 years. Why don't we invest more in finding the root causes of immigration? Why wait until people are at our door and try to build a wall to try to solve something that has to do with structural issues, like poverty, violence, things that we are seeing in Central America --"

Well, we are dealing with a lot of violence, as I noted in \"The Angle\" just in this last week, MS-13, 18 Street gang members, among the most vicious -- not just in the United States, but in the world -- have been apprehended crossing the border. The problem without having a wall is the flow is so great, tens of thousands coming across every month, that you can't catch everyone. The wall slows down the flow. And you brought up the issue of militarizing the border, Enrique. I want to read this. This is a quote from an op-ed that you wrote recently, \"Militarizing the border is something enemies would do, not friends and strategic partners. Immigration is an economic issue and it won't be solved by having more armed guards at the front door. A 2,000-mile wall won't seal the border, it will suffocate it.\" I will let Jason deal with that. Are you a part of the militarization strategy, you and your agents, Jason, and doesn't that hurt, according to Enrique, the relations between Mexico and the United States?"

And along with providing border security, our job is to facilitate lawful trade and travel. That is a very important mission and it serves both sides of the border. One of the things that I think is important to remember is we are not just talking about the flow, the volume of traffic coming across, but what that traffic consists of. Now you referenced some MS-13 members and gang members. I can tell you in my sector alone, one of nine along the southwest border, we have already caught almost 50 known gang members this year alone. Over 770 criminal aliens that have been deported and came back after committing violent crimes, murder, assault, rape, you name it. These are the types of folks that were coming across that represent a threat to us. That's the ones that we are concerned with. We need to know about, we need to know that they are coming across and we need to be able to stop them. A wall helps us do that. It also perpetuates lawful trade and travel because it takes the criminal element away. If they cannot exploit a weak and porous border, they have no reason to exist and both sides of the border, both communities thrive."

Borderless world, open borders, open markets, free thought, whatever their lingo is.

It would be much better for Mexico. Much better. All right, gentlemen, we are out of time, but thank you so much. Great segment.

Being at the ceremony this morning, it was one of the family members got up and he was begging politicians and the press to stop politicizing September 11th, to stop using families as fodder for, you know, opinions on one side or the other. These are folks that mostly, all of them actually, innocent people on airplanes or in buildings, were firefighters, police officers, and emergency first responders, who just try to go in and make a difference and help people and get them out of harm's way. I have known at least I would say between five to ten of the firefighters, good friends of mine, whose kids grew up and went to military academies, all with the idea of going in the military, serving the country, serving to honor their father. And most of those fathers were really special guys. The best of the best we had, and we had some really great people. So I would really doubt that if you ask any of those kids graduating from the Naval Academy or West Point or the kids who went on the job to honor their parents or their fathers, how they felt about the police officers and the firefighters. I think you might get a very different version of the politics of just disagreeing with the president, who we should be working to help, no matter what our opinions are and comparing them to a grave threat from a foreign nation."

Senator Angus King in Maine, he compared Russian election meddling, Tom, with 9/11. Let's watch. SEN. ANGUS KING, I—MAINE: They used airplanes into the towers.

And if these politicians would do their job that they swore to do, we wouldn't have half of these issues that we have. I don't know how they take paychecks and go home every night. I don't understand how somebody takes an oath and then just doesn't do their job. That doesn't happen with firefighters and police officers and soldiers. If you don't do your job as a soldier, you pay a price. With these politicians, they are not doing their job. They haven't done their job as far as immigration or any of these issues for 20, 25 years. So, I am not really too hopeful on them doing it now."

For answers, let's bring in former House Speaker Newt Gingrich who has a great series about all of this on his website, Gingrich Productions.com that everyone should check out. Newt, let's talk about this. First, on the wall, I can tell you, my radio listeners plastered me with calls today after we learned that nine spending bills that will be delivered to the president, at the end of this month. No funding for the wall. Not a penny. Zero. After that was one of the key campaign promises of President Trump, and he has expressed his repeated desire to have that thing built."

I think the contrast between Democrats who want open borders, which would flood the country with people, and the president's desire to control our border is pretty dramatic. I would not recommend that he close the government. I don't think we are in a position to explain it and I don't think it gets us very far. But I think he ought to keep pushing for it and I think after the election, confident they'll have an additional continuing resolution at some point. And then I think he can be much tougher. But I think between now and the election, he's begun to draw a really big contrast of the speech he gave in Montana. He began to draw the right contrast between, as he put it, Democrats who want to abolish ICE and Republicans who want to abolish MS-13. I think he needs to continue at that level, keep pushing. I will be a little surprised if he doesn't get some things done because I know with my own conversations with Mick Mulvaney, the director of the budget, they do have some money and they are in fact building parts of the wall right now."

It's $72,000 per illegal immigrant, $94,000 per illegal immigrant child in the United States. I mean, this is a huge amount of money we threw around, including in other countries, which, I know we have to spend but most voters hear this, like, why can't you fund the money -- find the money to build this wall? And it's going to stick in the craw of our voters. I'm telling you. It is a sticking point and I'm glad the president is pushing for it, but we need that money.

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "No. I think he's half right. We have to turn out the base. The president has to convince people to vote. If we don't have the base, we lose. It's not complicated. But in addition, if we pose -- if we pose a choice between an open borders Democrat, for example, Gavin Newsom's proposal in California to give free health care to every illegal immigrant who comes to California, that is so crazy. That you can win a huge block of people who aren't normally your base, but they are sure not going to vote to have their tax money go to encourage people from the whole planet to come to California for health care. So, I think we have issues that could actually win this election and dramatically broaden our base. But I would agree with Steve. We have to turn out the base.

This is the guy who told us you get to keep your doctor. You get to keep your health insurance. This is the guy who said there was a red line in Syria and exactly one year later said he never said there was a redline in Syria. Barack Obama is a left-winger who spent his entire career denying reality. One simple example, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs under Obama. We've already gained 400,000 under Trump. I like that choice. I think if you want to go back to Obama, higher unemployment, fewer jobs, more food stamps, let's have that debate.

And remember, I've got a piece I'm writing right now on all the things people said about Lincoln. Lincoln was far more constantly attacked than Trump has ever been and I think we ought to put this in context. These two things are trivial.

He's out with a new book today titled \"Contempt, A Memoir of the Clinton Investigation.\" And we are also joined by former U.S. attorney and FoxNews contributor Andy McCarthy. Gentlemen, it's great to see you. Judge Starr, let's go to you first. I remember 1998 like it was yesterday and all that was happening at the time. Bill Clinton at the time had about a 40 percent approval rating, 42 percent, mid-40s. But after he was impeached, his rating approval numbers started going up, up, up. Is that part of what you're thinking may happen here if the Democrats actually go for the brass ring on impeachment? KEN STARR, AUTHOR, \"CONTEMPT\": It could very well happen, because the American people, and part of the message in my book is be careful what you ask for, because I do think impeachment is hell. It's hell to go through for the American people. Even though there are very strong feelings on one side and then on the other side, that is not our system. We have impeachment in the constitution. It's an important last resort. And the country did not feel, as a whole, that Bill Clinton, for all of his crimes, and he committed crimes, and we proved that he committed crimes, that he should actually be removed in his last year and a half in office. We have elections in the country, and those elections mean something. Midterms coming up. Why in the world are the Democrats -- some of the Democrats -- seriously discussing impeachment?

I have been in investigations where people -- I don't know that they used this phrase as clumsy as a press leak strategy -- but there are sometimes that you have to have a strategy because you are being killed by leaks and you are trying to tamp down on them. Then there is another way of looking at it, which has never been my preferred way as a prosecutor, but there are prosecutors who endorse this, and that is this idea of tickling the wires, this idea that you take information that you have from your investigation, leak it to the press so that it gets out, and then as you monitor your wires, see if the people who are mentioned in the stories say and do things that are indicative of consciousness of guilt or concealing evidence and the like.

It's worth mentioning that such an alleged effort was clearly a failure. It should raise questions whether there was a serious effort at all.\" And finally, Andy, on the issue of impeachment, you are very skeptical about the idea that the Democrats would either have enough people to vote for impeachment, members, or that they would be able to get any Republicans on board, enough to get at that critical level."

      "utterance": "And now an important \"Ingraham Angle\" follow-up. Last night we discussed how the NFL is fumbling the current Anthem protests, promising millions and millions of dollars to leftwing social justice groups. We are now joined by former New England Patriot Matt Light. The offensive tackle was on the executive committee of the Players Association. He joins us tonight with exclusive insight into what is happening among the NFL, the Players Association, and this recently formed Players Coalition that has gotten such a huge chunk of cash. So Matt, question to you. First of all, it's great to see you. What do you make of the NFL offering almost $90 million to what some are saying is just a buyout or buy off of this Anthem protest? Will it work?"

      "speaker": "MATT LIGHT, SUPER BOWL CHAMPION",
      "utterance": "I think anytime you give a group that much money, you hope a lot of good comes out of it. And I think that's exactly what the players expect to happen with this money that has been allocated toward these issues that have become such a hot topic. And I don't have a problem with the players banding together and trying to come up with a message and affect change. But I do have a problem with the overall spirit and the tone of what has been going on in the National Football League. And, quite honestly, for a lot of former players, it's a very difficult topic to bring up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I would imagine if you are a player who is not wild about the Anthem kneeling and just think it distracts from the game and it's the wrong place, wrong time for the kneeling, as good as the intentions are for some of these players, I bet they are intimidated of speaking out. I bet a lot of the players are afraid to speak out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIGHT",
      "utterance": "And that is the real story, Laura. There is a problem when you have two different viewpoints but they are not opposing. We have one group, like myself, and like you, and a lot of viewers, and like most Americans, and by the way, the overwhelming majority of the players in the National Football League, who feel like kneeling is disrespectful, for a million reasons, right. And on the other side, you have people that want to make a difference and help those. Those aren't two opposing views. Those are two people that are trying to express what they think about this current situation that should really have never happened. And it wouldn't have happened if we had better leadership."

He said, I will call the White House and I'm happy to work with the White House on criminal justice reform. To me you can get a lot accomplished working together instead of pointing fingers, and I've probably been guilty of that myself from time to time. But there are a lot of good players who want to help their communities. They can do that, and they are doing that already before Kaepernick, after Kaepernick. So I think it has all gotten muddled up. And one of your former teammates said something interesting today, I want to play the bite. This is Devin McCourty on 9/11 and the protests. Let's watch."

He gets down in the weeds, whatever the topic of conversation is, whatever he wants to do, he goes full tilt into it. Now, I was quick to come out and say that I didn't appreciate when the Patriots knelt last season. And I caught a lot of flak for that. And I still feel that way. I don't feel like that's a respectful way to do things. I don't feel as though if you have a cause that you should be able to put your teammates in harm's way, so to speak --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No, but you're expressing your viewpoint, Matt. You're talking about a group of people who -- they are expressing their viewpoint. Fine, causing some controversy, but that's fine. But there are a whole bunch of other players, because we've heard from them, who don't want any part of this and just want to go out and play a great game and to do the Anthem and go home to their families."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIGHT",
      "utterance": "That's the overwhelming majority of people, Laura. And listen, we need to start naming these things. If it's social injustice, talk about who it is that needs to be out of the police force. Be very specific. And we need our leaders, we need Roger Goodell and DeMaurice Smith to stand up and make a difference."

    {
      "speaker": "LIGHT",
      "utterance": "It is up to us to do it. If we don't do it, no one will. So yes, we have to hold them accountable, and I hope that the players do the same thing."

There is new information on what may be ahead now for the millions of Americans and our past. Fox News's Rick Leventhal has a live report from the ground in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, next."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Laura, there is more than 5 million people now under hurricane watches and warnings including most of the folks along the North and the South Carolina borders, and that includes Wrightsville Beach, which is under a mandatory evacuation order. And pretty quiet tonight. It seems like a lot of folks have heeded the warnings and gotten out. The folks who are still here have to get out before tomorrow morning. That is when the bridge will close for good here. One of the locals came up to me and said you are not planning to stay through the storm, are you? And I look at him, and he said, not a good idea. When the locals tell you to get out, it is probably a good idea to get out. Part of the reason is the storm surges expected to be after 13 feet which would take it above the garages and into the first floors of most of the structures on this strip of land. The other big concern here, of course, the wind, which is expected to be at least a Cat three, somewhere between 111 and 129-mile-per-hour winds. The structures here, the new ones, are rated about 130, so there are some builders watching this very closely and homeowners of course as well, very nervous tonight. The other big issue, Laura, is the rain, which could be two to three feet, up to four feet, not just along the coast but inland. A slow-moving storm could dump a lot of water, create a lot of flooding and a lot of problems for the next few days, perhaps even weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Rick, what is the sense about the move of the storm up the coast? Is it going to stall out over the outer banks in Wrightsville and go inward, inland? Is it going to come up the coast?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "It all depends on what the storm does last minute. We've seen these things turn and confuse and confound the forecast, but right now, this thing, the models all seem to show it coming straight across the Atlantic right into the Carolina coast. And once it gets inland then it starts making its way north."

Past hurricane survivors are speaking out with their stories. Bianca Ambrosio is a survivor of deadly 2012 Hurricane Sandy. She chose not to evacuate. She joins us now, very briefly, to tell us about what led to the decision. Ambrosio, this is crazy how big the storm is. What can you tell our viewers about how important it is to heed these warnings?"

Water rose up to our floor in our home. We didn't know what to expect. This is my mother cleaning the basement. It was a very scary time for my grandparents and me. Thank you."

But when you're talking about wind and wind this powerful and water this high, this is going to be a deadly storm. It would be great if somehow that didn't happen, but it will be a deadly storm. And how critical is it for people to get out as fast as possible with their papers, their pets, and that's about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AMBROSIO",
      "utterance": "I would say, get out as soon as possible, bring your pets, get your cars, leave, because three cars were submerged under water. Trees were falling on houses. My friend has a true business, was able to do emergency work. But I would get out now before it gets bad because people were in bad trouble."

So many difficult natural disasters over the years, and on this anniversary of 9/11, we remember the past natural disasters, and we've got to employ those lessons of how we deal with this next threat to the mainland. Up next, a moving last bite."
