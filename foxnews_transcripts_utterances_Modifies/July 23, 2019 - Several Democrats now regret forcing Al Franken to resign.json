It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” The Democrats are desperately pinning their Trump impeachment hopes on former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony tomorrow. While they're obsessively clinging to the collusion narrative that's already been debunked, President Trump shrugging off the left's Mueller mania. Instead, he's focusing on what really matters, the battle for 2020. With Democrats distracted, the president is using the moment to relentlessly hammer his opponents as far-left socialists.",

So tomorrow, Robert Mueller will be saying a lot of things, maybe not saying so many things. The DOJ said today that he's the one who ask for the letter to confine what he's supposed to be saying, which is what's already in the report. We're also hearing he's going to submit his report for the record. But when it comes to 2020 and President Trump, he's winning on issues that really matter.   There's a new merit poll out today showing that his approval rating is as high as it's been. The number of people who are voting against him has gone down. The number of people who are voting for him has gone up. And all of the issue that Democrats are talking about on the campaign trail, health care for illegal aliens, Medicare for all, support for that among independent voters especially has gone way down.

They're gonna create a repeat surprise in 2020 based on preference deception. If you take the politically correct climate and now you add this constant race smear and this collusion thing, they're going to create an illusion of uniformity.   Because if everyone you know said Trump is evil, then no one is actually going to say the truth because they don't want to be -- they don't want to confront you while you're having these confrontational, you know, tantrums.

Yep, an actual headline said, someday, a turtle may end up with a Trump-branded straw in its nose. Wow. Who knew reptiles did coke. So Trump saw this absurd crusade as a perfect opportunity for the new Republican Party, one that finally understands the power of fun and the muscle of mockery. Long the turf solely owned by the smirking left. The script's been flip. It's now the left the left who shriek like nosy neighbors and the right who are laughing out loud.

They could have easily been charged with obstruction disorderly harassment, but because of the viral video now, everybody has a phone. It's like instant replay in sports. You make a decision and it's just going to get blasted all over the world in a loop and there is going to be less contest because bad camera angles and you're never going to win that argument and you're always going to be judged and you're always going to look bad. So, the mayor doesn't want a problem like that. And the police departments in the communities don't want a problem like that. So instead they hand back. But it's also this. There is less respect for authority figures in this country. I've seen parents get cursed out by their children in public. You've seen flight attendants be punched. We've seen ICE agents be disrespected. Teachers body slammed in schools, so it starts at home because parents aren't teaching young people how to respect their authority figures. Brownsville, Brooklyn where this happened. It's like one of the most dangerous streets in all of New York City. They had; I think it was 13 murders just in one precinct last year.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” The Democrats are desperately pinning their Trump impeachment hopes on former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony tomorrow. While they're obsessively clinging to the collusion narrative that's already been debunked, President Trump shrugging off the left's Mueller mania. Instead, he's focusing on what really matters, the battle for 2020. With Democrats distracted, the president is using the moment to relentlessly hammer his opponents as far-left socialists."

So tomorrow, Robert Mueller will be saying a lot of things, maybe not saying so many things. The DOJ said today that he's the one who ask for the letter to confine what he's supposed to be saying, which is what's already in the report. We're also hearing he's going to submit his report for the record. But when it comes to 2020 and President Trump, he's winning on issues that really matter. There's a new merit poll out today showing that his approval rating is as high as it's been. The number of people who are voting against him has gone down. The number of people who are voting for him has gone up. And all of the issue that Democrats are talking about on the campaign trail, health care for illegal aliens, Medicare for all, support for that among independent voters especially has gone way down. So he's winning on that. And tomorrow is just gonna be a show that we've seen before."

No problem. We used to say about the liberals and the left, but when we do it, fine. Look, you guys are all saying, it's Democrats who are obsessing. The one who is obsessing is President Trump, this is a witch hunt he tweets. He keeps saying, oh, this is ridiculous. Ridiculous. Oh, yeah, he says this is a second bite at the apple. What a waste of time. Don't do it. You know, this is, to me, I just don't understand. You guys, and I just heard it from Katie, no collusion, no obstruction.

You're like civil war reenactors for the losing side. You'd dress up every day to play the losing side hoping for a different outcome. You're holding mock hearings as though this is a high school rendition of Fiddler on the Roof. It is so pathetic and laughable. Look, the Democrats face the same problem that their parent company, CNN, does. In times of prosperity, how do you gin up conflict? And they only have two clubs in their golf bag, that's Russia and that Trump is a giant orange monster. So I have a prediction for 2020 because of all of this media fakery. They're gonna create a repeat surprise in 2020 based on preference deception. If you take the politically correct climate and now you add this constant race smear and this collusion thing, they're going to create an illusion of uniformity. Because if everyone you know said Trump is evil, then no one is actually going to say the truth because they don't want to be -- they don't want to confront you while you're having these confrontational, you know, tantrums. So this is why Brexit surprised Europe, and why Trump surprise the world in 2016. As they keep ginning up this hysteria half the people are going to move to the other side just like they did before."

The Trump straw targets key liberal weaknesses. They're strident humorlessness and misplaced priorities, and pokes them right in the eyes. The crusade to ban plastic straws is yet more proof of how liberals try to distract us from the harm they've done to our cities, our law enforcement, our job markets, and our border. Maybe no one will notice what they did to the humans of downtown L.A. and other Democratic hellholes if they save a turtle from a straw. Yep, an actual headline said, someday, a turtle may end up with a Trump-branded straw in its nose. Wow. Who knew reptiles did coke. So Trump saw this absurd crusade as a perfect opportunity for the new Republican Party, one that finally understands the power of fun and the muscle of mockery. Long the turf solely owned by the smirking left. The script's been flip. It's now the left the left who shriek like nosy neighbors and the right who are laughing out loud. The paper straw is a perfect symbol. A failed soggy replacement for something that work just fine. A paper straw is socialism to capitalism's sturdy plastic. How funny is it that the straw's purpose it to suck. So you think the left would do that well. Wrong. They even suck at sucking.

Why doesn't she look at some of the sexual harassment lawsuit settlements in Congress the taxpayers have to play for? No. She was a headache for the Bush administration, slimed CIA agents let Obama off the hook, and now she's back helping Trump -- helping people who hate Trump. This is what happens here with Democrats. They only care about due process for Democrats. Whenever there's an accusation against a Republican it's conviction.

So, Jesse in 2016 there was a case of a Chicago police officer, a female and she was beat almost to death because she didn't want to react to the suspects who were beating her, because she feared backlash in the public sphere.

But there were massive amounts of riots and then police departments pulled back all over the country within the midst of paladins and you saw a spike in violent crime. They could have easily been charged with obstruction disorderly harassment, but because of the viral video now, everybody has a phone. It's like instant replay in sports. You make a decision and it's just going to get blasted all over the world in a loop and there is going to be less contest because bad camera angles and you're never going to win that argument and you're always going to be judged and you're always going to look bad. So, the mayor doesn't want a problem like that. And the police departments in the communities don't want a problem like that. So instead they hand back. But it's also this. There is less respect for authority figures in this country. I've seen parents get cursed out by their children in public. You've seen flight attendants be punched. We've seen ICE agents be disrespected. Teachers body slammed in schools, so it starts at home because parents aren't teaching young people how to respect their authority figures. Brownsville, Brooklyn where this happened. It's like one of the most dangerous streets in all of New York City. They had; I think it was 13 murders just in one precinct last year. So, it said these guys who are saving lives in the community are being humiliated like that. What if that gunshots went off; they'd be the first ones there to respond?"

In this case, no one has said that these policemen were doing anything wrong. They're arresting someone and apparently with good reason otherwise, we would have heard about it by now. So, what you have is a bunch of juvenile jerks I think abusing these officers as human beings and I feel for the officers. I mean to me it's the police that demonstrated extraordinary restraint in this situation. And by the way I disagree with my colleagues here. I think the cops are to be saluted for demonstrating that kind of restraint because--"

With one case going as high as a million dollars and businesses are fighting back, they range from doctors' offices to theme parks and we'll take the other side of this because we've turned into a culture of complaint where everything is a hardship. Oh! My God, I went to this restaurant and they were closed on Labor Day, one star. I had a delicious meal, but the chef didn't come out and kiss my ring, one star.
