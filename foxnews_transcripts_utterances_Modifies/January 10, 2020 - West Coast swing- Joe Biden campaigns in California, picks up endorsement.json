They also apparently tried to hide problems from federal regulators and ridiculed those responsible for designing and overseeing the jetliner. The aircraft has been grounded following two catastrophic crashes. Late this afternoon, the FAA announced a fine of more than $5 million, alleging Boeing failed to prevent the use of defective parts on the 737 MAX.

Since his resignation, Abdul-Mahdi condemned the American strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, as well as the Iranian retaliatory ballistic missile attack against U.S. troops in Iraq.

Employers added an average of roughly 175,000 jobs per month compared to about 223,000 per month in 2018. The Trump administration, says hiring slowed because the number of people seeking work has fallen with the steady rise in employment.

However, Justice Department officials tell Fox the investigation is not yet officially closed. There is movement tonight in the impeachment standoff. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, says she will begin the process of transmitting articles of impeachment to the Senate and electing impeachment managers next week.

Everybody was gone for the holidays, the House of Representatives, it was out for a couple of days in the Clinton trial impeachment it was three weeks before they came over to the Senate. I think that's been a much to do about nothing. I think there has been legitimate questions about Senate procedures. And it could be appears pretty clear now that Senator McConnell has got his procedures in place that he wants to go forward with and that those will be voted on and they will abide by those as soon as the articles get over. And I think that will be coming over very soon."

There are a number of witnesses with firsthand information that I think that American people deserve to hear from. I think there are documents that are out there that haven't been seen to test some of the witnesses that we have heard, as well as those that I'd like to see called. So, I'm going to vote for witnesses. If there is a plan that gives forward that doesn't have that on the front end, I'll probably vote against that. But there will be another opportunity during this trial to vote for additional witnesses. And I will once again vote for here -- to here at least two or three witnesses, maybe as many as four, but certainly two or three."

You're up for reelection, and there are some who think you're in the toughest position of any Democratic senator during this impeachment trial process considering the substantial support President Trump has in your State of Alabama. He won the state by almost 28 points in 2016. And most voters in Alabama, at least, according to recent polls, suggest that impeachment does not fly there, about 54 to 39. That's why I said, problem."

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Bret, and I appreciate that. But the fact to the matter is the real problem, as you say, is that too many people both in the media as well as colleagues in the House In the Senate, they only look at this through a political lens and a partisan lens. I'm not doing that. I think if you go back and look at everything I have said from the very beginning of this process, it's to follow my oath to do my duty to take that oath very serious about impartial justice. And to do that and not look at this through a partisan lens. And so, from that standpoint, the only problem that I have is a problem I want to make sure that I do the right thing. I want to make sure that I examine all the evidence that we have in front of us, and vote in a way that I think is consistent with my obligations as a senator."

The very intelligence community that the president keeps attacking. We have been commending for a long time, and we are still commending them for the work that they did in this operation, and no one is going to missed Soleimani. No one is mourned Soleimani in his death, not by any stretch. And the president last night, I think was also a little bit misleading. No one was asking for a warning. But I do think it's appropriate in a measure that significant and that serious, to at least, give the members of Congress and the Gang of Eight a heads up on what was going on. With regard to the War Powers Act, this is not about what happened in the past. It is not about President Trump. It's about whether or not Congress ought to be able to have its constitutional role, and that is to be involved in any military escalation. It does not mean that the president can't take unilateral action to protect American interest in a defensive mode, but what it means is before we escalate with military action, he should come to Congress. That's what's the Constitution requires. And that's what this War Powers Act is -- War Powers Resolution is going to say."

First, here is with some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago is documents released by congressional investigators indicate Boeing employees raised doubts among themselves about the safety of the 737 MAX jet. They also apparently tried to hide problems from federal regulators and ridiculed those responsible for designing and overseeing the jetliner. The aircraft has been grounded following two catastrophic crashes. Late this afternoon, the FAA announced a fine of more than $5 million, alleging Boeing failed to prevent the use of defective parts on the 737 MAX. Fox Richmond as Virginia lawmakers vote to ban firearms at the state capitol and a legislative office building. Newly empowered Democrats in the General Assembly say the move is needed to protect public safety. Republicans have voiced opposition to such a ban and some GOP lawmakers routinely carry guns into the capital there. And this is a live look at Houston from Fox 26. A rainy Houston. One of the big stories there tonight, the graduation ceremony for a new group of NASA astronauts. The agency says that 13 graduates will be eligible for missions to the moon, and ultimately to Mars.

We saw the death of a U.S. contractor. There was plenty of reason for the United States to take him out. It's a good thing that they did. It was a smart decision by President Trump, I think. The problem is the president is having a difficult time convincing people about the nature of the threat because he had lied so many times throughout his time in office.

A lot of Democrats are talking about the concern, a lot of people are discussing things as if Iran is really standing down. Are they? Soleimani was a terrible man, a terrorist. Two administrations, George W. Bush and President Obama, both chose not to take him out because they thought strategically it would be a mistake. Secondly, you have terrorists out there that are going to use this to recruit, sadly. We're going to have cyberattacks, possibly. We have to worry about Navy attacks."
