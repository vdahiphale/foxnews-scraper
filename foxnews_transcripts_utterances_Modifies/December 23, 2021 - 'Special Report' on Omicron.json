They decided to make a political point by denying and rejecting every single policy position that the Trump administration took, including Operation Warp Speed and the way that they handled the pandemic. Here we are 12 months later, after President Joe Biden said that the testing shortage was a travesty, and you have a backup in testing, you have a shortage of treatments for the virus if you are to get it, even if you are vaccinated, and people can't get the booster shot on time like the administration has been telling people to do for weeks now. The messaging again from the CDC director is very unclear when it comes to whether they were prepared for this. The timeline shows they knew about this variant six weeks ago, and yet only today the president comes out to talk about how they are going to ramp up testing. This administration was given Operation Warp Speed and a playbook on how to handle a year of a pandemic on a silver platter, but they decided to make it political and therefore rejected it. And that's not just bad politics, it's bad policy. And now they are seeing the ramifications of that without having their own plan to have this private-federal partnership to getting tests out to people. And sending people tests in the mail is just another bureaucratic way of doing this.",

      "sentences": "Amy, clearly, Joe Biden won in large parted because he said he was going to get the coronavirus under control. He wasn't Donald Trump, and he was going to do it differently. For the political threats that this administration faces, whether it was Afghanistan or crime or the border or the economy and inflation, really how he handles coronavirus is the biggest, isn't it? AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": Well, how he handles coronavirus is the biggest because it also impacts what the economy does and how people view his handling of the economy. The interesting thing when you look at the polling right now is it is true opinions about Joe Biden's handling of coronavirus have dropped, and dropped pretty significantly since the beginning of the year. But they are still above water. They are still in the 50-plus percent approval rating range. That certainly is a lot better than, say, where President Trump was at the end of his tenure on this issue. Where he is really deeply under water now is the economy. And of course, it's almost impossible to separate the two of these. And the more that people feel panicked or anxious about the coronavirus, the less likely they are to go out, to spend money, to do the things that we know spur the economy. I think what's also really important was the issue of the schools. The president made it really clear today that schools should not be closing. But that goes back to the point about testing. And this becomes to me the biggest challenges. It's not simply can you get a test either by at a free place or get one in the mail. It's how can you get consistent testing for students for schools so that they don't have to shut down or have students learn remotely if someone, whether a staff member or a student, becomes infected with the virus.",

      "sentences": "Right. Ben, that's the question. I played that soundbite with Joe Biden in December of 2020 saying it's a travesty we don't have the testing necessary 10 months later, and now fast forward to today, he said nobody saw Omicron coming, even though the CDC director said they were prepared. BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I realize that the bureaucrats are going to spin this and maintain that they were prepared, but I think a lot of questions should be asked as was even being asked today in this impromptu press conference the president said that he wasn't supposed to be doing, about why testing wasn't ramped up earlier. There has been a clamor for inexpensive, widely available, ideally at home testing that people can do in order to know whether they have the possibility of infecting others around them. That is something that absolutely should have been ramped up from the beginning. I think it's a failure now of both administrations that did didn't happen earlier. Look, I actually like some of what the president had to say today, particularly when he said that we shouldn't panic about this. I hear a lot of panic on cable news, but I didn't hear it from the president today. And when he said what, as Amy cited, about schools needing to remain open. That's going to create, I think, some tension with those who are in the panicky community on his left flank. But I do think that the significant failure that I think happened once again with these remarks is treating those who are unvaccinated for whatever reason that they are, as if they are part of some outgroup, that they are the others, that they ought to be blamed for the situation that we're in today, even though we see every day the news about one person after another who is fully vaccinated, even those who have boosters, who are nonetheless being diagnosed as actually testing positive for this new widespread variant, which I think we can be very grateful for as it seems to be not as deadly as others. Those are all things that I think the president has an opportunity to unite the country on. To this point he hasn't been able to do that, and I think it would really take a significant change in direction in the new year for him to be able to accomplish that feat.",
