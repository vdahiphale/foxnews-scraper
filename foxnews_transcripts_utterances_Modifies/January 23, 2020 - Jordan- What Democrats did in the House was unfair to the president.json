      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another really busy Washington tonight. An \"Ingraham Angle\" exclusive investigation we brought you last night. Well, we brought you details of a secret 2016 meeting between Obama administration officials and Ukrainian prosecutors. The topic was the Biden family and Burisma, and the article The New York Times was going to write on the subject was - ha, curiously never published.  Judging by the reaction we got, we touched the nerve. Tonight, we'll bring you part 2 of our expose, including details of how Ukrainian official at that 2016 White House meeting went on to help the DNC hurt the Trump campaign.  But first, day 3 of the impeachment trial is nearing its end, and just like last night, we're going to fact check the arguments. We have exclusive insight from Congressman Jim Jordan; White House spokesman Tony Sayegh will lay out the President's defense.  And Senator Marsha Blackburn, who sat through hours and hours and hours of oral arguments is here to tell us why the tone of the House Impeachment Managers, she thinks, is really hurting their case. So after listening to the oral arguments today, I think it is pretty clear that House Democrats are operating under the assumption that they can make just these tremendous leaps of logic, contradict the public testimony of their own witnesses, and in some cases, just outright lie.  That - thinking about this, I think, their new maxim seems to be if at first you don't persuade lie, lie again. And since the rest of the media they're not interested in fact checking Democrats, they only fact check Trump, right? We decided we would do it. So, first, Adam Schiff and his merry band of impeachment managers took to leveling new charges against President Trump.",

So instead of challenging him on his ideas or at the ballot box, they hope to remove him from office. That's what it all comes down to. Do the American people ultimately have a say in U.S. policy through the officials they elect? Or are we all just happy to let career bureaucrats on the seventh floor of the State Department tell us what's best, because they have a PhD at the end of their name? None of them were elected. President Trump was. He does foreign policy. He's the Chief Executive Officer of the United States. If he wants to fire Marie Yovanovitch, he can do so for any reason. If he wants to fire any other Under Secretary, he can do so for any reason. Even Democrats should be alarmed by the stupidity of these arguments.  Joining me now is Congressman Jim Jordan of the House Judiciary Committee. He is also a member of President Trump's impeachment defense team. Congressman, did Democrats really believe that these types of assertions - I'll just focus on one for a moment.

Adam Schiff is the guy who told us that the Nunes memo wasn't accurate. That turned out to be false. We had Mr. Horowitz's report last month. Adam Schiff said the FISA process was just fine. Mr. Horowitz told us they lied to the FISA Court 17 times. Adam Schiff said we're going to hear from the whistleblower and we have not spoken, our staff has not spoken with the whistleblower. Both of those things were wrong, but of those statements are wrong.   So it shouldn't surprise us, some of the things he and Nadler and his team are now asserting. The facts are solidly on the President's side, the constitutional principle is on the President's side.

Last night THE INGRAHAM ANGLE showed you State Department e-mails from last year that no one in TV had brought you before. These e-mails centered on a January 2016 meeting between Obama administration officials and Ukrainian prosecutors about how the efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine might be imperiled by Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma - might have been a conflict there. Now, remember, all those folks were checked into the White House by the person who many say, is the whistleblower who sparked this entire impeachment circus. Well, we kept digging, and tonight we have a new development to share with you. One of the Ukrainians who attended that 2016 White House meeting is a man named Andrii Telizhenko, a political officer in the Ukrainian embassy. Curiously, his name also pops up at a 2017 POLITICO piece that detailed efforts by Ukrainian officials to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign. Written by the same reporter Ken Vogel, who after initially pursuing it, didn't write that story about that White House 2016 meeting. Hmm. According to POLITICO, Telizhenko aided DNC operative, Alexandra Chalupa in her mission to hurt Trump's campaign by trying to find connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia. But according to Telizhenko he didn't do this willingly. He claims he was forced into helping Chalupa and to help her go after Trump. Here's what he told POLITICO in 2017. \"We had an order not to talk to the Trump team, because he was critical of Ukraine and the government and its critical position on Crimea and the conflict. I was yelled at when I proposed to talk to Trump. The Ambassador said not to get involved, Hillary is going to win.\" Well, we reached out to the State Department officials included in the May 2019 e-mails that we revealed last night, and we asked these questions. Do they know why Ken Vogel decided not to publish that story after all; did he follow up with any other correspondence explaining why he didn't write the story or perhaps with other questions? What was the State Department's focus in that January 2016 meeting with all of those Ukrainian officials? And why did the person that we think is a whistleblower - hmm - why did he arrange this meeting? As of this moment, we've received no response to our questions. We, however, are not stopping our call for more documents, the e-mails, the text messages, the voicemails, anything that sheds light on what certainly looks on the surface to be a concerted effort to save the Bidens from political embarrassment, and then her President Trump along the way. Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Fox News Contributor and Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Mollie for a conspiracy theory, there sure are a lot of facts to back up the notion of Ukrainian election meddling.",

You have Alexander Chalupa openly bragging about how she coordinated between Ukrainian government officials and the Democratic national committee to get negative information about Paul Manafort into the public sphere and she succeeded. If you really care about election meddling from foreign governments, you have two examples in the Hillary Clinton campaign. She sourced the dossier to Russian officials. She secretly funded that. And you have people at the DNC funneling her, a contractor at the DNC, funneling the DNC and the Clinton campaign information from Ukraine, getting stuff out into the media, and they really did unseat Paul Manafort as chairman of the Trump campaign.

It was matter of fact. And then all these liberal fact checking outlets like \"PolitiFact,\" they checked it out and said basically it was true. And David Merkel from the Atlantic Council had Ukrainian ties, they even admitted it. So there was no controversy over any of this until the Russian collusion heated up as a way of removing Trump. And then they got word, and they thought, wow, if we're going to go after Russian collusion, we have our foot prints all over the Ukrainian collusion, and all of a sudden, anybody that took them at their prior word was considered as conspiracists. All of it, Laura, begs the question is why would they want to have witnesses called, because Hunter Biden is the key to this, and everybody knows he had no expertise in oil or the Ukraine, that Ukraine was corrupt and that his dad was not only vice president but point man on Ukraine.

There was more breaking news today. The Justice Department made a huge admission, Adam Schiff, I wonder how he dealt with this, regarding the warrant they got to spy on Carter Page. The DOJ conceding that two of its Page FISA orders that Adam Schiff, by the way, said were all fine, were not valid. The court understands the government to have concluded in view of the material misstatements and omissions that the court's authorizations and docket numbers 17375, 17679, were not valid. Victor, here's my question. Only two were not valid? This whole thing was not valid.",

But they were so naive that when they were told that this was all part of an opposition research project, they didn't ask who is the opposition, as if there's anybody other than Hillary Clinton. So I think the real subtext here is the FISA court in general and the particular judges involved in particular are really culpable, and they've almost eroded all support for FISA courts. I think a lot of conservatives who thought they were an essential tool in the anti-terrorism effort now are thinking it's not worth the risk anymore because they're so politicized, and they're the ones that are just as culpable as the DOJ and FBI.",

Of course, that was totally made up, completely made up. But that shouldn't surprise us because everything about this has been made up. Schiff met with the whistleblower and lied about it. The entire Russian collusion hoax they now bring back was built on a lie, not to mention the entire media narrative, the way they have been representing this has been one lie after another.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another really busy Washington tonight. An \"Ingraham Angle\" exclusive investigation we brought you last night. Well, we brought you details of a secret 2016 meeting between Obama administration officials and Ukrainian prosecutors. The topic was the Biden family and Burisma, and the article The New York Times was going to write on the subject was - ha, curiously never published. Judging by the reaction we got, we touched the nerve. Tonight, we'll bring you part 2 of our expose, including details of how Ukrainian official at that 2016 White House meeting went on to help the DNC hurt the Trump campaign. But first, day 3 of the impeachment trial is nearing its end, and just like last night, we're going to fact check the arguments. We have exclusive insight from Congressman Jim Jordan; White House spokesman Tony Sayegh will lay out the President's defense. And Senator Marsha Blackburn, who sat through hours and hours and hours of oral arguments is here to tell us why the tone of the House Impeachment Managers, she thinks, is really hurting their case. So after listening to the oral arguments today, I think it is pretty clear that House Democrats are operating under the assumption that they can make just these tremendous leaps of logic, contradict the public testimony of their own witnesses, and in some cases, just outright lie. That - thinking about this, I think, their new maxim seems to be if at first you don't persuade lie, lie again. And since the rest of the media they're not interested in fact checking Democrats, they only fact check Trump, right? We decided we would do it. So, first, Adam Schiff and his merry band of impeachment managers took to leveling new charges against President Trump."

There's a process that you have to go through with any piece of documentary evidence. It's called - well, let's go to law school for a moment. It's called the chain of command. We have no idea what that is all about, we have no idea what some of the references in there are all about, and Adam Schiff is trying to intuit the whole thing for us. No thanks.

So instead of challenging him on his ideas or at the ballot box, they hope to remove him from office. That's what it all comes down to. Do the American people ultimately have a say in U.S. policy through the officials they elect? Or are we all just happy to let career bureaucrats on the seventh floor of the State Department tell us what's best, because they have a PhD at the end of their name? None of them were elected. President Trump was. He does foreign policy. He's the Chief Executive Officer of the United States. If he wants to fire Marie Yovanovitch, he can do so for any reason. If he wants to fire any other Under Secretary, he can do so for any reason. Even Democrats should be alarmed by the stupidity of these arguments. Joining me now is Congressman Jim Jordan of the House Judiciary Committee. He is also a member of President Trump's impeachment defense team. Congressman, did Democrats really believe that these types of assertions - I'll just focus on one for a moment. We could have put together a very long montage of the number of times the word conspiracy was used and none of this is in an article of impeachment. Yet, they can under the Senate rules, say hearsay defamation, and they can just get away with it."

Remember, Adam Schiff is the guy who told us for two years I had more than circumstantial evidence, President Trump worked with the Russians to influence election. That wasn't true. Adam Schiff is the guy who told us that the Nunes memo wasn't accurate. That turned out to be false. We had Mr. Horowitz's report last month. Adam Schiff said the FISA process was just fine. Mr. Horowitz told us they lied to the FISA Court 17 times. Adam Schiff said we're going to hear from the whistleblower and we have not spoken, our staff has not spoken with the whistleblower. Both of those things were wrong, but of those statements are wrong. So it shouldn't surprise us, some of the things he and Nadler and his team are now asserting. The facts are solidly on the President's side, the constitutional principle is on the President's side. And the unfair process is another great argument that White House can make, because what they did in the House was very unfair to the President."

We're going to we're going to use it where we need to, but I want other European allies to share in the burden. And oh, by the way, Ukraine, Ernst & Young said, was one of the three most corrupt countries on the planet. You got a new guy who was a TV personality, who wins election with an overwhelming majority, running on corruption and the President simply said, let's check him out. Let's see if he's the real deal.

But there were Democrats saying, they thought that the Chief Justice would rule on executive privilege dispute at the Senate trial.

It follows the information, not the individuals, so that if an individual purports or is forced or attempt to convey information, that is privileged, the President can assert that whether or not the person is currently employed by the government or not.

But in the Harriet Miers situation in 2008, there was a ruling on different shades of executive privilege and rejecting the proposition that it was absolute.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "24 hours ago we brought you an explosive story and judging by the responses we got, well, it seemed to strike a nerve. Last night THE INGRAHAM ANGLE showed you State Department e-mails from last year that no one in TV had brought you before. These e-mails centered on a January 2016 meeting between Obama administration officials and Ukrainian prosecutors about how the efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine might be imperiled by Hunter Biden's ties to Burisma - might have been a conflict there. Now, remember, all those folks were checked into the White House by the person who many say, is the whistleblower who sparked this entire impeachment circus. Well, we kept digging, and tonight we have a new development to share with you. One of the Ukrainians who attended that 2016 White House meeting is a man named Andrii Telizhenko, a political officer in the Ukrainian embassy. Curiously, his name also pops up at a 2017 POLITICO piece that detailed efforts by Ukrainian officials to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign. Written by the same reporter Ken Vogel, who after initially pursuing it, didn't write that story about that White House 2016 meeting. Hmm. According to POLITICO, Telizhenko aided DNC operative, Alexandra Chalupa in her mission to hurt Trump's campaign by trying to find connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia. But according to Telizhenko he didn't do this willingly. He claims he was forced into helping Chalupa and to help her go after Trump. Here's what he told POLITICO in 2017. \"We had an order not to talk to the Trump team, because he was critical of Ukraine and the government and its critical position on Crimea and the conflict. I was yelled at when I proposed to talk to Trump. The Ambassador said not to get involved, Hillary is going to win.\" Well, we reached out to the State Department officials included in the May 2019 e-mails that we revealed last night, and we asked these questions. Do they know why Ken Vogel decided not to publish that story after all; did he follow up with any other correspondence explaining why he didn't write the story or perhaps with other questions? What was the State Department's focus in that January 2016 meeting with all of those Ukrainian officials? And why did the person that we think is a whistleblower - hmm - why did he arrange this meeting? As of this moment, we've received no response to our questions. We, however, are not stopping our call for more documents, the e-mails, the text messages, the voicemails, anything that sheds light on what certainly looks on the surface to be a concerted effort to save the Bidens from political embarrassment, and then her President Trump along the way. Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Fox News Contributor and Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Mollie for a conspiracy theory, there sure are a lot of facts to back up the notion of Ukrainian election meddling."

      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it's just amazing. You have what appears to be this coordinated effort between media Democrats and some people in the bureaucracy to keep people from having any discussion about Ukrainian meddling, much less a thorough investigation. And when you go back to that POLITICO article from 2017, it is amazing. People speak openly. You have Alexander Chalupa openly bragging about how she coordinated between Ukrainian government officials and the Democratic national committee to get negative information about Paul Manafort into the public sphere and she succeeded. If you really care about election meddling from foreign governments, you have two examples in the Hillary Clinton campaign. She sourced the dossier to Russian officials. She secretly funded that. And you have people at the DNC funneling her, a contractor at the DNC, funneling the DNC and the Clinton campaign information from Ukraine, getting stuff out into the media, and they really did unseat Paul Manafort as chairman of the Trump campaign. Whatever you think about that, that's really impressive work that they did."

VDH, going back to these emails, the State Department officials didn't know what to do last may when they were approached by Ken Vogel about that meeting at the White House in January of 2016. The campaign was already heated up, Trump was ahead, but you didn't know what was going to happen. But the Ukrainian officials were brought into the White House, checked in by the person many think is the whistleblower. And they had some big meeting about something, but apparently according to Vogel and his inquiries, it was about their investigation of Burisma and potential wrinkle since Hunter Biden was on that board."

And there were Ukrainian officials that were writing op-eds about how unpalatable Trump would be if he were elected. The thing about the Vogel article, Laura, is it was almost jocular. It was matter of fact. And then all these liberal fact checking outlets like \"PolitiFact,\" they checked it out and said basically it was true. And David Merkel from the Atlantic Council had Ukrainian ties, they even admitted it. So there was no controversy over any of this until the Russian collusion heated up as a way of removing Trump. And then they got word, and they thought, wow, if we're going to go after Russian collusion, we have our foot prints all over the Ukrainian collusion, and all of a sudden, anybody that took them at their prior word was considered as conspiracists. All of it, Laura, begs the question is why would they want to have witnesses called, because Hunter Biden is the key to this, and everybody knows he had no expertise in oil or the Ukraine, that Ukraine was corrupt and that his dad was not only vice president but point man on Ukraine. Why would you want him to get out there and testify in this tangle of lies when his father is a frontrunner in the Democratic primary? It doesn't make any sense."

Adam Schiff, you might remember, demanded that we hear from the whistleblower until that precise moment when it was revealed that he had coordinated with the whistleblower, then he changed his tune. Let's go back to the original Adam Schiff plan, talk to the whistleblower, find out more about why he was so concerned about people finding out about Hunter Biden's role in Burisma and why that became something so alarming to him and why he wasn't more alarmed by Hunter Biden's role to blow the whistle on that a few years ago."

If they think it's not even worthy, if it doesn't meet the standards that you need, they're not even going to bother with witnesses. But if they're going to bother with witnesses and they think they're going to get away with not calling Alexandra Chalupa and Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and the ICIG, the inspector general, who has had some rough testimonies that we still haven't gotten word from. These are things, if we're really going to do this, let's do it, and let's really get a full exploration of the entire sordid Biden drama and how bureaucrats coordinated with each other to get us to this point."

Everyone in this room was like, you've got to be kidding me, four to five months, guys. Get your supplies, get your canteens, because we're going to be here a long time. There was more breaking news today. The Justice Department made a huge admission, Adam Schiff, I wonder how he dealt with this, regarding the warrant they got to spy on Carter Page. The DOJ conceding that two of its Page FISA orders that Adam Schiff, by the way, said were all fine, were not valid. The court understands the government to have concluded in view of the material misstatements and omissions that the court's authorizations and docket numbers 17375, 17679, were not valid. Victor, here's my question. Only two were not valid? This whole thing was not valid."

    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, it was all invalid. And what is striking is we knew that the FBI and members of the DOJ under Obama were corrupt. They were really trying to destroy U.S. citizens by improperly and probably illegally surveillance them. But we always thought the FISA court justice is were merely deluded or they were given false information. But they were so naive that when they were told that this was all part of an opposition research project, they didn't ask who is the opposition, as if there's anybody other than Hillary Clinton. So I think the real subtext here is the FISA court in general and the particular judges involved in particular are really culpable, and they've almost eroded all support for FISA courts. I think a lot of conservatives who thought they were an essential tool in the anti-terrorism effort now are thinking it's not worth the risk anymore because they're so politicized, and they're the ones that are just as culpable as the DOJ and FBI."

They didn't do anything about it.

There is some chatter that what the Republican senators might do is make him into a de facto witness during the question and answer session here, in other words, directing questions through Chief Justice John Roberts towards Adam Schiff.

      "utterance": "Senator Blackburn, you always criticized Democrat impeachment witness Lieutenant Colonel Vindman on Twitter, and then his lawyer shot back late tonight saying that a member of the Senate would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice. So apparently a member of the military can never be criticized. What's your response?"

      "speaker": "BLACKBURN",
      "utterance": "We honor the service of every man and woman in uniform. But here's the thing, you look at what his commanders, Vindman's commanders, have said, and he has a problem with his judgment. That has been pointed out. He had one commander that said he is a political activist in uniform. He has had problems with going outside of his chain of command, which is exactly what he did here. And I talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis. They have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. What we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here. We want to be certain the president is treated fairly. We want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do like putting more judges on the federal bench."

So if you're a member of the military who likes Trump, then you can be criticized morning, noon, and night. But if you are Vindman, who clearly thinks Trump shouldn't be there, then you can never criticize him or ever say anything."

It is to control, to redo 2016 and to preempt what is going to happen in 2020. This is what this is about, they hate the guy so much. Donald Trump has done nothing wrong. We are going to make certain that we move this this process. And I will tell you this. What we are hearing from Tennesseans, he is in a better position than ever. He is going to be re-elected president of the United States in 2020."

Matt, these same media figures were embarrassed by Schiff over the Russian collusion disaster. So they are making a little change here?"

He knows the material so well because he's been saying the same lies over and over again. This has been going on for years. There is nothing here. We watched this all in the House. He is literally reading the same stuff in the Senate. It's just like, please."

And I had to be prodded by the capitol police because I fell asleep. And there is a rule on the back of the ticket that you can't sleep. I'm not making it up. I actually did fall asleep. But there is a mellifluous way he speaks, it's very soothing in a way when you take the content out. Is this moving the needle?"

      "utterance": "Not at all, no. You can start to see the ratings drop tremendously. You even have some people in the media completely misrepresenting and making up what's actually happening inside and outside of the chamber. You had a CNN political analyst who said that he heard two Republican senators saying, a few Republican senators saying, what Adam Schiff is doing is really changing my mind. Of course, that was totally made up, completely made up. But that shouldn't surprise us because everything about this has been made up. Schiff met with the whistleblower and lied about it. The entire Russian collusion hoax they now bring back was built on a lie, not to mention the entire media narrative, the way they have been representing this has been one lie after another. And it's too bad. I don't think it's moving the needle, but it is hard to watch our founding institutions really disrespected like this in front of our very eyes."

When you can convince a jury that is sitting in the room and you can't convince the people watching on TV, you've got to appeal to the jury of people not yet born, hoping that maybe they will go along with you and see the wisdom of your words."

The thing about this that I love is that Bernie and Klobuchar, when I was spying -- when I was watching them as I was in the gallery, when I was awake, I was awake for some of it, but they are shifting in their seats. They're listening with one ear. They want to get to Iowa. These Democrats, they know how this will end. They want to get to campaigning. Bernie is on the rise, Matt."

There is no drama here. There is nothing of interest here. It is what it is. They've been trying to get Trump the whole time he's been in office. This is just the next chapter in that play. By the way, Laura, this is going to happen the whole year. And they're going to lose more and more Americans who think this is a waste of time."
