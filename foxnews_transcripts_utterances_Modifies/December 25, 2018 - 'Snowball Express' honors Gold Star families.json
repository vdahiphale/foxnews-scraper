      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is a Special Christmas Edition of “The Ingram Angle, from Washington.” Coming up tonight how the liberal killjoys are trying to ruin everything that's good about this holiday season, from classic Christmas songs, threw it off the Red-Nosed Reindeer, it goes on and on, and I have a reality check for them. Raymond Arroyo takes us behind the scenes of a special holiday trip for hundreds of Gold Star families and speaks to the catalyst behind it all. Hollywood actor Gary Sinise, the heartwarming story you will not want to miss takes us far away from politics. Plus, my friend and former boss, Bill Bennett, is out with an update to his book The True Saint Nicholas, and he's here to explain it and why it might be the most important part of the Christmas story.  But first, we thought it might be fun to assemble some of our favorites around the table to share some of our best Christmas memories ever, and I'm talking about favorite meals, favorite presents, favorite fights around the table, and yes family photos.  Joining me now for some holiday cheer Matt Schlapp Chairman of the American Conservative Union, Shannon Bream of course host of Fox News @ Night, and Fox News Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry.  All right, we're going to go around the table, but Ed I want to start with you.  Tell us, if you can, your favorite most or most poignant Christmas memory.",

Okay, so my friends Ham Martinovich (ph) and I went with my mother to cut down our Christmas tree. There's a tree farm near Glastonbury, Connecticut and we didn't have like a small saw, we had like a big -- you know those big red metal hacksaws or whatever, that's the two-man saw or whatever it's called, two-man saw. So we cut it down, it was a pretty nice tree. So we brought it back into my house and we were putting it up in the stand. You know those old stands that you could never get them straight, the bowls that would tip over.  And my mother says, and I can still remember her voice, God rest here, it's like hey Laura it's not -- oh fun it's a Christmas cheer, it's an earring that flying across the room.   I love that, it's part of the Christmas here. And so it started to tip over, I'd pull it, she said straighten out the bottom. I'm only maybe I don't know 11, I don't know where my dad was, he wasn't helping. So we put in the - we took it out in this tiny little living room in this braided rug, and I have my hand on it. This big old red saw and Pam (ph) is kind of having cocoa or whatever.  I'm going like, can you hold the tree down? She said, yes fine I'll hold it down. And you know how it gets kind of stuck and you lift it then it went, down on my thumb right here and it was like a gag. You know when those gags where the blood spurts out. It was like a geyser, just like it was shooting up, and this was Christmas Eve of course. It was Christmas Eve, it comes up and I roll back and I take off and the thing comes, the blood comes out, and Pam (ph) says, are you okay? I said, yes I'm doing great Pam (ph) thanks a lot. And so my mother comes, she goes, oh my god this is a crisis, we've got -- she's freaking out. I said it's fine, it's not a big deal. Go to the hospital, there to like want to get five stitches, and it's all night, thump, thump, thump. All night long, but every time I see Pam (ph) and I still see Pam a lot, it's like it's still a little sensitive right here, Christmas must be coming. That was like my - I don't know, it was fun though, it's like an adventure, I've never gotten stitches before. But my mother was freaking out all night, but that was our Christmas Eve.",

Depending on the politics at the moment, they go from being libertines to puritans. The once aggressive secular suddenly become religious enforcers and these are the same people who by the way applauded when prayer was driven out of the public schools and who cheered when manger scenes were pulled from the public square. For ever crowing about how we need separation of church and state, a phrase found nowhere in any of our founding documents. My friend, today's Left is blissfully unaware of how much they've become caricatures of what they accuse conservatives of being. They claim to be tolerant, they're among the most rigid intolerant people on the planet. They claim to be pro-choice, that only applies to abortion, maybe your gender. They claim to be for creative expression, but they're control freaks and monoliths. They really -- what they want to do is stifle and marginalize conservative voices, whether they're on college campuses, in the workplace, in the U.S. military, or yes right here on cable TV. And while they point the finger at Trump for being divisive, they're the ones working overtime to divide the country along lines of race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, just to name a few.

The president, who normally spends Christmas at his estate in Florida, stayed behind amid the partial government shutdown. Meantime, another Christmas message, this one from Pope Francis to Catholics around the world. In his annual address from the Vatican, the Pope called for a fraternity among people of different faiths and races. The Pope said the universal message of the holiday is that we are all brothers and sisters. He also made a plea for political leaders around the world to put aside their differences. And more than $400,000 is refunded after a GoFundMe campaign turns out to be a scam. Did you hear about this one? A New Jersey couple set up the page after they say a homeless veteran from Philadelphia had given his last $20 when they ran out of gas.

Raymond Arroyo takes us behind the scenes of a special holiday trip for hundreds of Gold Star families and speaks to the catalyst behind it all. Hollywood actor Gary Sinise, the heartwarming story you will not want to miss takes us far away from politics. Plus, my friend and former boss, Bill Bennett, is out with an update to his book The True Saint Nicholas, and he's here to explain it and why it might be the most important part of the Christmas story. But first, we thought it might be fun to assemble some of our favorites around the table to share some of our best Christmas memories ever, and I'm talking about favorite meals, favorite presents, favorite fights around the table, and yes family photos. Joining me now for some holiday cheer Matt Schlapp Chairman of the American Conservative Union, Shannon Bream of course host of Fox News @ Night, and Fox News Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry. All right, we're going to go around the table, but Ed I want to start with you. Tell us, if you can, your favorite most or most poignant Christmas memory."

Okay, so my friends Ham Martinovich (ph) and I went with my mother to cut down our Christmas tree. There's a tree farm near Glastonbury, Connecticut and we didn't have like a small saw, we had like a big -- you know those big red metal hacksaws or whatever, that's the two-man saw or whatever it's called, two-man saw. So we cut it down, it was a pretty nice tree. So we brought it back into my house and we were putting it up in the stand. You know those old stands that you could never get them straight, the bowls that would tip over. And my mother says, and I can still remember her voice, God rest here, it's like hey Laura it's not -- oh fun it's a Christmas cheer, it's an earring that flying across the room. I love that, it's part of the Christmas here. And so it started to tip over, I'd pull it, she said straighten out the bottom. I'm only maybe I don't know 11, I don't know where my dad was, he wasn't helping. So we put in the - we took it out in this tiny little living room in this braided rug, and I have my hand on it. This big old red saw and Pam (ph) is kind of having cocoa or whatever. I'm going like, can you hold the tree down? She said, yes fine I'll hold it down. And you know how it gets kind of stuck and you lift it then it went, down on my thumb right here and it was like a gag. You know when those gags where the blood spurts out. It was like a geyser, just like it was shooting up, and this was Christmas Eve of course. It was Christmas Eve, it comes up and I roll back and I take off and the thing comes, the blood comes out, and Pam (ph) says, are you okay? I said, yes I'm doing great Pam (ph) thanks a lot. And so my mother comes, she goes, oh my god this is a crisis, we've got -- she's freaking out. I said it's fine, it's not a big deal. Go to the hospital, there to like want to get five stitches, and it's all night, thump, thump, thump. All night long, but every time I see Pam (ph) and I still see Pam a lot, it's like it's still a little sensitive right here, Christmas must be coming. That was like my - I don't know, it was fun though, it's like an adventure, I've never gotten stitches before. But my mother was freaking out all night, but that was our Christmas Eve."

Now, this is a beloved Christmas special and the longest continually -- continuously running one as well. But do you see what liberals seek to do?

By seeing dark forces in even an innocent Christmas special, they divide us with the goal of ripping away yet another little innocuous thing that families have enjoyed for more than a half a century.

And she's going to demand that Trump recite a religious creed in a public ceremony or judge him. That's a no judgment. But again this is the problem of the Left. Depending on the politics at the moment, they go from being libertines to puritans. The once aggressive secular suddenly become religious enforcers and these are the same people who by the way applauded when prayer was driven out of the public schools and who cheered when manger scenes were pulled from the public square. For ever crowing about how we need separation of church and state, a phrase found nowhere in any of our founding documents. My friend, today's Left is blissfully unaware of how much they've become caricatures of what they accuse conservatives of being. They claim to be tolerant, they're among the most rigid intolerant people on the planet. They claim to be pro-choice, that only applies to abortion, maybe your gender. They claim to be for creative expression, but they're control freaks and monoliths. They really -- what they want to do is stifle and marginalize conservative voices, whether they're on college campuses, in the workplace, in the U.S. military, or yes right here on cable TV. And while they point the finger at Trump for being divisive, they're the ones working overtime to divide the country along lines of race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, just to name a few. But above all, liberals have become aggressively boring and no fun at all, and that's the angle. Joining me now for reaction is attorney and RNC Committeewoman from California Harmeet Dhillon, Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, and CRO of DSPolitical Jennifer Holdsworth. First of all, I want everyone to know that this is a safe space here, you can -- we won't censor you like some of the liberals. Raymond, I want to start with you. There is a sense of fun and whimsy that seems to be missing in this whole political correctness moment that we've been living in for some time."

      "utterance": "Well, jokes are out the door. You can't kid, and look, how do we get over difficult situations, how do we overcome and find connections with people we disagree with? We joke, we make fun of each other and ourselves. That is being pushed further and further out of society. You see it in some of the clips you played. You can't do a little racy or suggestive songs. This was a way in the 1950s that people interacted. It was a way to suggest something without gratuitously hitting you over the head with it. Now, we're in a gratuitous age where you can't make the quiet sideswipes, the fun jokes on the side, everything's got to be very plain, very black and white, and frankly it's a lot uglier out there today."

      "utterance": "--the way President Trump prays, this is a President who is sitting less than a foot away from another President who a lot of conservatives talked about being a Muslim for the last decades, as if there was something wrong with that. So, I think when we talk about turning the tide of the national conversation into something that's a little less offensive, it doesn't have to do with political correctness. I would like to see what conservatives would have said, had it been President Obama who did not recite the Apostles Creed, when the entire western church did."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

It's okay to be different. How can you have different points of view? But what I'm trying to get to, Jennifer, and you didn't quite seem to understand what I'm saying is that in this world of you -- if you're offensive -- if you're offended, I can't say it, I can't even feel it for fear of losing my job, not getting a promotion, and not getting a benefit in the workplace. People are afraid to speak their minds. That is not liberal, that's scary, and that's censorious. That's what the Left always considered conservatives. Harmeet Dhillon?"

I mean, conservatives are not in the business of critiquing how people pray, I just think that's crass and he prayed the way and he was -- he felt comfortable doing it. It's not our business to critique that. But what I see on college campuses and in workplaces, where I do a lot of litigation, is that people are constantly censoring themselves, walking around on eggshells. Young people are actually doing consent videos before they move to second base with a girl so that they don't get sued. And it's really sucking all the joy out of life and I--"

He is working his way through it, and he is not ostentatious.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What? That is a non sequitur. You are not arguing the point. The point is liberals claim that they are pro-choice, be who you want to be, be your authentic self, my truth. Trump is praying the way he darn wants, and he gets trashed by Don Lemon. Don Lemon used to be someone I actually respected. Don Lemon has gone so for over the line. God bless him, I don't know what is going on with him. But you are so obsessed with trashing Trump that you have got to trash him at the moment when everyone is honoring George Bush. I don't understand that. I think it speaks so poorly of where this culture is. And I think it goes back to, Jennifer, people are truly just afraid. They are afraid. They're afraid to speak, afraid you feel. Now, if you hum along to \"Baby, It's Cold Outside,\" you might as well have raped somebody. Honestly, it's gone way overboard, and it's just not fun. There's no fun. Can you really have fun? I guess you can smoke pot, do edibles, and then talk about how you might want to change your gender, that is kind of interesting, I guess. But you can't do much else. I guess play sports? Honestly, in the public life, it is very hard. Jerry Seinfeld is right. Humor is dead. And that's why they go to political humor and they trash Trump."

On this Christmas Day, our men and women stationed across the country and world got a special phone call from our president, Donald Trump. Over a video conference in Washington, the president spoke to members of all five branches of the military. He thanked them for their service and acknowledged the sacrifices they were making. The president, who normally spends Christmas at his estate in Florida, stayed behind amid the partial government shutdown. Meantime, another Christmas message, this one from Pope Francis to Catholics around the world. In his annual address from the Vatican, the Pope called for a fraternity among people of different faiths and races. The Pope said the universal message of the holiday is that we are all brothers and sisters. He also made a plea for political leaders around the world to put aside their differences. And more than $400,000 is refunded after a GoFundMe campaign turns out to be a scam. Did you hear about this one? A New Jersey couple set up the page after they say a homeless veteran from Philadelphia had given his last $20 when they ran out of gas. But prosecutors say the viral feel good story was all put together by the trio. So all that money has since been returned. Merry Christmas, everybody. I'm Anna Kooiman.

And it's just overwhelming. You're speechless. It's very emotional. My daughter did not know her father. He was the first Marine casualty after the start -- post 9/11. So she was only eight months old when he died.

So to come here and watch them hold hands and go through the park together, that's the stuff that you really -- nobody else on the outside really gets to see. They see kids who lost a dad, they don't see what they are feeling. And this is a family that sees, they know what we're all going through no matter what it is.

But we drive over to uncle Bob's, Bob Bennett, your former boss, Christmas party. And when they were little, they would say, see, look, up there, they he goes. You see? And the boys would turn their heads. Those are the memories."

      "utterance": "In 280 A.D., Nicholas is born to an older couple. They didn't think they would have a child, but then a miracle, another miracle. He is born. They have some money, they die, and he inherits the money, doesn't know what to do. And he decides to give it away, to be a good steward. In the town there is a gentleman who has three daughters, and he is quite poor, so he doesn't have enough for a dowry. In those days you had to have a dowry to give a daughter off to marriage. I got a dowry from Mrs. Bennett's father. It gave me a big envelope, but it was parking tickets from North Carolina."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That sounds perfect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "He handed me this big envelope. I said, dowry? He said, sort of. They're yours now, buddy. Anyway, so there are these three daughters, and too poor to be married. So one night, and this is the seminal Santa Claus story, in maybe 300 A.D., this young man becomes a priest and then a bishop, takes a bag of gold, and goes to the open window and throws it in the open window, and it lands in a stocking or a shoe. How about that? And he does it three times. He wants to be anonymous. And the third time, the father is waiting up and catches him, throws him to the ground and says, I know who it is. A wonderful irony there because the men who wanted to remain anonymous becomes over time the most famous gift giver."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And he didn't want to become a bishop, as I recall in your book. He wasn't -- he thought he was too young and he hadn't done enough. And yet the bishop basically said --"

    {
      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "The story was that they said the next guy, the next religious guy, the next believer who walks into our church we'll make the bishop, and that was Nicholas. So he became a bishop. And then he goes to the Council of Nicaea, and he misbehaves because there is a heresy, and Arius is pushing this banned heresy. And Nicholas goes up and slaps in the face. There is a lot of history."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "He goes all over the world. His fame goes all over the world, and his story goes all over the world. Now, we get into the 16th century, and I don't want to hurt sales, but those reformation people, were kind of hard on St. Nicholas. We love you, you destroyed icons and the stained- glass windows. But he goes into the homes then and becomes this favorite character in people's homes and stories, much beloved of children. And so the name of Saint Nicholas, and then getting towards the end, the Dutch come to New York and they bring with them something called, someone called Sinterklaas. And then Clement Moore, a wealthy New Yorker, writes a poem called \"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" Washington Irving writes about this gentleman. And then it's America, so Coca-Cola discovers him, puts on about 100 pounds, gets a big red coat, and that is our guy."

Rest a little bit if you can. Reach out maybe to someone you haven't been in contact with, someone important to you. Maybe you've been separated for some reason. That's always nice to do, especially at Christmas time. And 2019, can you believe it, it's going to be full of promise, challenges, I'm sure, but we're going to have a lot of great shows. We have an amazing staff. We couldn't do it without them every single day. We are blessed to have them, blessed to have you.
