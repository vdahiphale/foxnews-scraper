The West, meanwhile, says that Russia has been lying about its claims to be withdrawing forces from around the area around Ukraine's border. They said the opposite is actually true, that Russia is building up its forces, putting them into attack position and increasing the number of troops on Ukraine's border by up to 7,000. The U.S. secretary of state laid out in detail what might be the pretext for a major Russian invasion.",

And it was a DHS court document that said that the last month's traffic on the Southern border quadrupled what was recorded in January of 2020 and almost doubled last year's tally. Remember, this does not even include what Border Patrol officials called get-aways, obvious enough, those who don't get apprehended. So they're not even in the system. And Texas DPS estimates that there were roughly 600,000 of those last year. So, in fact, those numbers we're seeing, they say, are much, much higher, the bulk of encounters still from people primarily from Central America. And out of the more than 154,000 encounters for January 2022, DHS says more than 62,000 of them were released right back into the U.S. interior. All the while, gangs and smugglers work around the clock exploiting the system. Just this week, migrants were found inside some locked train cars down here in South Texas, including a young child with a family.

Well, lawyers for former Clinton associate Michael Sussmann say there are multiple reasons why they think the case against their clients should be dismissed. For one, they argue Sussmann is being targeted for political purposes under special counsel John Durham's probe. Now, the government's accusing Sussmann here of lying to the FBI for not disclosing that he was advising Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign when he was discussing what he was describing as suspicious links between then- candidate Donald Trump and Russia. In the filing today, Sussmann's lawyer said that this was a case of extraordinary prosecutorial overreach, and that Mr. Sussmann did not make any false statements to the FBI, but that, in any event, the false statement alleged in the indictment is immaterial as a matter of law. Some legal experts FOX spoke with say that they don't believe this change is going to mean -- nothing today is going to make much of a difference. However, Sussmann has already pled not guilty to this charge and he is scheduled to go to court in May. Meantime, up on the Hill, Republicans are very eager to see if more charges could come and if any more Clinton associates could be accused of wrongdoing. Republicans vowing to investigate further, that is, if they win in the midterm elections. We heard from Congressman Jim Jordan on Twitter today, who wrote: \"It's not a vast right-wing conspiracy. They spied on President Trump.\" Republican senators also demanding the Justice Department make sure that special counsel John Durham, the man on your screen right there, has the resources he needs to investigate for as long as he needs. His work started back in 2020. The attorney general says Durham's work will be allowed to go on. Meantime, we're also watching some new developments today in the ongoing New York state investigation into the Trump Organization. Today, a state judge ruling the former president, as well as Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., all must testify under oath. The Trumps were challenging some subpoenas that -- issued to them late last year that was compelling their testimony. The judge is ordering the Trumps to sit down for depositions within the next few weeks. We're going to wait to see if and when the Trump Organization may respond.",

And as we take a look at some of the tape that we have from today, the former New York senator and secretary of state was greeted by a few protesters outside the state's Democratic nomination convention, but largely greeted by a lot of cheers and enthusiasm inside. Now, this was the first time that we have heard from Clinton in person since the accusations in special counsel John Durham's report that were made public last Friday. The report contained, as you know, allegations that Clinton campaign cybersecurity lawyer Robert (sic) Sussmann shared Internet data information gathered from Trump Tower and the White House by his friend and client tech executive Rodney Joffe with the FBI and CIA to establish an interference and narrative. So, while touting recent accomplishments of Democrats, she also talked about this being a time when our nation is deeply divided and dangerously divided, pointing to select social media and FOX, as well as former President Donald Trump.",

Earlier today, in what the Russians called a tit-for-tat move for the U.S. tossing Russian diplomats, likely spies, from the Russian Embassy in Washington, Moscow today announced it has expelled the deputy U.S. ambassador to Russia as payback, another sign of worsening relations. Today, the leader of Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north, said he's open to letting Russia park short-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads in his country after these drills end on Sunday. I'm here tonight in the city where U.S. diplomats evacuated to after fleeing the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, the capital here in Ukraine, six hours to the east.

So I think that that is a concern of his and he is looking at that very closely. But I also think that he realizes that it may be now or never. If he wants to reestablish, which he very much does, wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union, or at least parts of it, during Joe Biden's presidency is the best time to do that. During a period of a weakened NATO, which he has had some success in peeling off some of the NATO nations here, I think, especially Germany, I think he realizes this is his best opportunity. It may be now or never. So I think that he will go for the whole enchilada."

We have to have the weapons of war that will allow the Ukrainians to fight a battle in a formidable way and make the Russians pay a tremendous price.

Back out here live, you can see that there are still some crowds here. And, man, does it pick up on the weekends. Where the government calls it a siege, these people call it a party, saying it's Canada Day every day. And there's lots of people that are expected to move in. But there's also checkpoints, which is new in the past 24 hours, that are going to stop those people from joining the convoy, according to police.

It gives them the power to make arrests, to seize bank accounts, even to cancel insurance. I think that Trudeau is marshaling his forces. My sense is that he figures he may need to actually clear the square by force, if necessary, but he's clearly getting his legal ducks in order in order to take whatever action he deems necessary."

He has to determine that there's a threat to Canada's national security or its sovereignty. He also has to determine that the normal laws aren't up to the task. It's not clear to me that either of those conditions is met here. He's basically circumventing the normal democratic process and invoking these extraordinary powers."

On the other hand, I think it is an uphill battle. The Supreme Court just a couple of weeks ago turned away a very similar challenge to a mask mandate. So I think, from Texas' perspective, what they need to do is explain why their case is different, why what the CDC and the Biden administration are trying to do here is different than the prior mask mandate challenges that have been brought before the court before."

I don't think so. The other part of the equation, you're seeing inflation numbers we haven't seen in decades. If you want to just add kerosene to the fire, all you got to do is just start drumming up a lot more spending, a lot more out of the Fed of printing money and keeping rates zero, and all heck breaks loose And you are seeing the consumer right now absolutely crushed.

And it's not -- it shouldn't be a surprise. It was actually predictable. And so the idea that we should continue, as Gary said, to fuel the fire with even more federal spending, it makes no sense. I mean, Kristal, I thought we were beyond this crisis moment. And when we look at Democratic cities and states that are actually releasing their COVID era restrictions, from masking to lockdowns, I think it's time for us to go move back to normal. That means we don't need more crisis level spending. We don't need to flood -- continue to flood the American households or economy with more cash. Again, that's just going to make inflation worse."

      "speaker": "CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Charles. And we should point out, in fact, that that data, we had to kind of go in a roundabout way to get it, because the federal government still has not officially released the border numbers from January or February, since it's almost over. So we have gleaned the data on those January stats from a federal court document. And it was a DHS court document that said that the last month's traffic on the Southern border quadrupled what was recorded in January of 2020 and almost doubled last year's tally. Remember, this does not even include what Border Patrol officials called get-aways, obvious enough, those who don't get apprehended. So they're not even in the system. And Texas DPS estimates that there were roughly 600,000 of those last year. So, in fact, those numbers we're seeing, they say, are much, much higher, the bulk of encounters still from people primarily from Central America. And out of the more than 154,000 encounters for January 2022, DHS says more than 62,000 of them were released right back into the U.S. interior. All the while, gangs and smugglers work around the clock exploiting the system. Just this week, migrants were found inside some locked train cars down here in South Texas, including a young child with a family. Charles, the investigators and officials here say that it is just one more example of how those smugglers are willing to go to any means to get their cargo across, whether it's drugs or people -- back to you."

So, what I can tell you, it should be concerning, not only for law enforcement, but for the American people, when you see the amount of illegal immigrants that are coming across. And we're not talking about the families or the children. We're talking about those single adults that are coming across our border into the interior, some of those with criminal histories, criminal gang members, potential terrorists. And we have seen that. Also, U.S. Border Patrol has seen that as well. So this is a reality of this current border crisis. It's only going to continue to escalate. And we see that by the numbers; 60,000 that were released into the country from January, that's a staggering number, compared to the previous years. And that's unacceptable as far as releasing these individuals into the interior, when border agents, as well as our DPS personnel, are trying to secure the border by providing all the personnel, all the manpower, technology in order to apprehend these individuals and to stem the flow of migration. But, again, because of the messaging and the fact that the majority of these illegal immigrants are being released into the interior does not help the current situation right now."

And when we mentioned that got-aways, of course, those are only got-aways that are reported. There's also those that don't set off any sensors or any cameras, that we don't know who they are, and we don't know where they're at and what their intentions are.

We're seeing the criminal organizations, the drug trafficking organizations exploiting that messaging. They're profiting billions of dollars off of human smuggling, as well as narcotics smuggling. And because of that, we're continuing to see this influx of illegal immigration taking place along the Southern border. And it's going to continue. That was the whole reason why Governor Greg Abbott launched Operation Lone Star, is to crack down on these organizations, and also, most importantly, to support our federal partners, because we know right now they are overwhelmed and their hands are tied. They're not able to do the job that they want to do. And that's being out there on the border, trying to secure it and apprehend these individuals that are coming across."

We're not getting any type of support from the federal government. Also, most importantly, constructing the first ever Texas border wall, that's all Texas funds.

Well, lawyers for former Clinton associate Michael Sussmann say there are multiple reasons why they think the case against their clients should be dismissed. For one, they argue Sussmann is being targeted for political purposes under special counsel John Durham's probe. Now, the government's accusing Sussmann here of lying to the FBI for not disclosing that he was advising Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign when he was discussing what he was describing as suspicious links between then- candidate Donald Trump and Russia. In the filing today, Sussmann's lawyer said that this was a case of extraordinary prosecutorial overreach, and that Mr. Sussmann did not make any false statements to the FBI, but that, in any event, the false statement alleged in the indictment is immaterial as a matter of law. Some legal experts FOX spoke with say that they don't believe this change is going to mean -- nothing today is going to make much of a difference. However, Sussmann has already pled not guilty to this charge and he is scheduled to go to court in May. Meantime, up on the Hill, Republicans are very eager to see if more charges could come and if any more Clinton associates could be accused of wrongdoing.

She did not respond -- Charles."

In fact, he wrote a 5,000-word essay on the subject last summer. Today, the head of NATO joined President Biden, saying Russia is poised to invade any day now."

      "utterance": "Putin is now on his fifth U.S. president, Charles. He could stay in office until 2036. Tonight, over 150,000 Russian troops massed on Ukraine's border. There are also Russian warships offshore loaded with Russian marines and tanks. These joint military exercises with Belarus featuring rocket launchers dubbed Stalin's organ, because tubes look like pipe organs. All set to end, these exercises, on Sunday. After that, it's anyone's guess. Only Putin knows what comes next. Earlier today, in what the Russians called a tit-for-tat move for the U.S. tossing Russian diplomats, likely spies, from the Russian Embassy in Washington, Moscow today announced it has expelled the deputy U.S. ambassador to Russia as payback, another sign of worsening relations. Today, the leader of Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north, said he's open to letting Russia park short-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads in his country after these drills end on Sunday. I'm here tonight in the city where U.S. diplomats evacuated to after fleeing the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, the capital here in Ukraine, six hours to the east. The U.S. Embassy was abandoned over fears of the Russian invasion. The top U.S. diplomat here says she had to order sensitive documents shred. Now, Charles, this city of Lviv is about the size of Boston. It's a university town in a country the size, about the size of Texas. A lot of the students I have spoken to here are nervous. Some are even-keeled. Others are saying, bring on the Russians -- Charles."

      "utterance": "You know, Putin has created such a destabilizing situation that really threatens European security. And we haven't seen much action on that, except the fact that he's moving more troops to the border of Ukraine. You and I spoke a few weeks ago, Charles, about the importance of proactively imposing these sanctions on Russia, so that -- so that they understand that there is going to be a cost for any overt action that they take, an invasion that they take. But we haven't seen that happen. So I have not seen that happen from the White House. We're not seeing it happen with our Democrat colleagues. So Republicans got together. We have a bill prepared that would impose sanctions on Russia, specifically their financial institutions, the bank, on Putin and his cronies, on their assets, but, importantly, to stop construction on Nord Stream 2."

      "utterance": "I didn't see his speech. I will watch it probably on reruns tonight. I hope he was firm. I hope he showed resolve. I hope that he spoke about strong sanctions. And I hope he said that they would be proactive. We're dealing with a country that relies on gas, on its sale of natural gas, on its minerals, its metals for income. We can put sanctions on those to show that the United States, our NATO allies, we mean business on this. We don't want to -- we don't want to see a war start in Europe. I certainly don't want to see a war start. And that needs to be made clear when we close down his gas station and he realizes we're going to take action."
