So what does small business owners think of the latest delay? David Glazier is the founder and president of Fleet Transportation. He joins us now.  David, thanks for joining us tonight.  All right, so you heard about this latest delay. Your first thought probably more uncertainty for you, who have had a hard time already trying to follow all the delays that have happened even before this one.  DAVID GLAZIER, FOUNDER & CEO, FLEET TRANSPORT: Right. Absolutely. Uncertainty is the word of the day. The difficulties here are that we can't get a valid idea of what we are looking at on the exchanges. And furthermore, what's going to happen here is that we have small business tax credits that are available to us that get on to the exchanges. But, yet, we are not able to go ahead and take advantage of those because we can't get on the exchange. I'm understanding we can go through a broker or individual health insurance company, which we have tried doing. I got off the phone today with my broker just before this news broke and we were very positive. We thought, all right, we're going to get out, we are going to go ahead and get a log-in set up, and when we get to December 1st we will be able to jump in and get going. But that obviously doesn't seem like that's going to be the case.",
