And this is \"Your World.\"  And in a letter, the House speaker telling the president that, because of the shutdown, they should work together to determine another suitable date, or maybe just consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to Congress.  Mrs. Pelosi citing security concerns, but now the Department of Homeland Security secretary herself, Kirstjen Nielsen, is saying, what concerns? We're going to get right to the bottom of it with Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott and New Jersey Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer, who met with the president today on this very shutdown.  First, FOX Business Network's Blake Burman at the White House, where all of this was unfolding -- Blake.",

      "sentences": "Hey there, Neil.  The stalemate really ratcheting ratcheting up today with this one, as Nancy Pelosi suggested that the televised portion of the State of the Union address set for later this month should no longer go forward.   She is citing security concerns, saying that the United States Secret Service falls under the Department of Homeland Security, which, of course, is impacted by this partial government shutdown. So she wrote a letter to the president which ends with the following, saying -- quote -- \"Sadly, given the security concerns, and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address, or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29.\" However, one DHS official, the Department of Homeland Security, tells FOX that Democratic leadership never even reached out to the Secret Service and the head of DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen, said there is not a security issue at all.   Here was a tweet from her today. She said -- quote -- \"The Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union. We thank the Service for their mission focus and dedication and for all they do each day to secure our homeland.\" Now, after that, the Democrat response seemingly came from Congressman Bennie Thompson. He is the head of the Homeland Security Committee. He said -- quote -- \"It would be completely inappropriate for President Trump to further deplete the agency's resources and manpower for the sole purpose of having an hour of uninterrupted prime-time television coverage.\" Now, here's the bottom line with all of this, Neil. The president of the United States is required to submit an update of the state of our union to Congress. But the televised portion of this only became tradition in 1965, when President Johnson started it.  So, in theory, President Trump could still give a State of the Union address, just not up on Capitol Hill in front of Congress, at a place, maybe the Oval Office, maybe the White House, maybe somewhere else, and the date of his choosing.   So far, though, no direct response from the president to Nancy Pelosi -- Neil.",

Mrs. Pelosi citing security concerns, but now the Department of Homeland Security secretary herself, Kirstjen Nielsen, is saying, what concerns? We're going to get right to the bottom of it with Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott and New Jersey Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer, who met with the president today on this very shutdown.

      "utterance": "Hey there, Neil. The stalemate really ratcheting ratcheting up today with this one, as Nancy Pelosi suggested that the televised portion of the State of the Union address set for later this month should no longer go forward. She is citing security concerns, saying that the United States Secret Service falls under the Department of Homeland Security, which, of course, is impacted by this partial government shutdown. So she wrote a letter to the president which ends with the following, saying -- quote -- \"Sadly, given the security concerns, and unless government reopens this week, I suggest that we work together to determine another suitable date after government has reopened for this address, or for you to consider delivering your State of the Union address in writing to the Congress on January 29.\" However, one DHS official, the Department of Homeland Security, tells FOX that Democratic leadership never even reached out to the Secret Service and the head of DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen, said there is not a security issue at all. Here was a tweet from her today. She said -- quote -- \"The Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union. We thank the Service for their mission focus and dedication and for all they do each day to secure our homeland.\" Now, after that, the Democrat response seemingly came from Congressman Bennie Thompson. He is the head of the Homeland Security Committee. He said -- quote -- \"It would be completely inappropriate for President Trump to further deplete the agency's resources and manpower for the sole purpose of having an hour of uninterrupted prime-time television coverage.\" Now, here's the bottom line with all of this, Neil. The president of the United States is required to submit an update of the state of our union to Congress. But the televised portion of this only became tradition in 1965, when President Johnson started it. So, in theory, President Trump could still give a State of the Union address, just not up on Capitol Hill in front of Congress, at a place, maybe the Oval Office, maybe the White House, maybe somewhere else, and the date of his choosing. So far, though, no direct response from the president to Nancy Pelosi -- Neil."

They didn't even call over there to ask them if there was a security threat. They don't want the president having prime-time television. That's just the fact of the matter. She could have said that.

And as their currency weakens, if the pound weakens, that means it makes our goods much more expensive to the U.K. Our manufacturing sector gets hurt, as well as our farmers.

And that's been affecting things. I think what has been helping markets is everybody's going easy again. You have our central bank do a 180. China just put $83 billion yesterday into their banking system. And Europe and Japan, who have been promising to get off of the printing of money, well, they have decided to keep that going for another bunch of months.

And I think you have got to do it when the government's open. But I think you have heard historically from Democrats and Republicans there's a way forward here with both those issues. But we have got to talk about it and be willing to talk about it. And I know we all talk about it in different ways. But we have got to actually come to the table and have a real conversation, and not just on -- not just on TV screens yelling at each other, but actually really sit down face to face and keep that conversation going. It's what the American people hire us to do. They expect us -- this is what I did most of my career in business -- they expect us to actually sit down and talk to one another, and not get everything you want. And I think that's really what the Problem Solvers Caucus, which I co- chair, is really focused on. Where is that? Where is that common ground?

Then there are loans that are held in abeyance, and all of this as the frustrations build in this partial government shutdown that's now in its 26 day.

Now, yesterday, I flew to Charlotte to celebrate the 10 years of the Miracle on the Hudson. And I know you know that one pretty well. And that controller had a full support team helping him out, giving him information that he could relay to the pilots, so they can make the best decisions. They're not working right now.

What are my generals -- what are my generals telling me, get as much advice as he can, and then make the best decision. But, right now, it sure seems like we ought to be really rethinking what we're doing in Syria."

      "utterance": "Neil, what -- what we know, there's a lot of people there that want to harm us. I would rather have our -- our fights over there than in the United States. And so we have got to figure out how to do everything we can to keep the terrorism out of this country."

      "utterance": "Let me switch gears, if I can go back to your state of Florida. You're aware that your successor has suspended Sheriff Israel, of course, who was there for the high school shooting last year, saying that he essentially botched it. We have talked to a number of parents of those who were killed who agree with that move. The sheriff is planning to aggressively challenge that. Your thoughts?"

      "utterance": "Well, your heart goes out to those families. I have gotten to become very close with many of those individuals. I can't imagine losing a child or a grandchild. So your heart goes out to them. So, the -- we passed a very aggressive school safety bill right after that. And I know that's being implemented around the state. I hope it never happens again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, but it does happen, unfortunately, in other areas. And you are right to be right on top of it and try to institute new laws in your state, the most rapid turnaround we have seen in any school shooting post a school shooting. But a part of the governor's thinking, the new governor's thinking was that we're too politically correct about dealing with wayward students or those who should be watched more closely, but aren't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",

And so, I mean, I just can't imagine what these parents are going through. My heart still goes out to them. I just -- I just hope it never happens again."

The president was critical of that when one or two of them tried it. Now better than two dozen companies have tried it. Do you think they're getting a little too greedy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, so, we have to figure out how we drive down the cost of drugs. If you -- if you look about it, if you care about people getting health care, which, as a provider, when I was in the hospital industry, I wanted people to get health care. I want people to get health care. Part of the problem with getting health care is, it's too expensive."

      "speaker": "SCOTT",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, I just want to update you on what Chuck Schumer had to tell reporters when he stepped out of his office and sort of told us where this whole shutdown thing stands. There's no one blinking, and there's no one conceding anything. He agrees with Nancy Pelosi that the president should put off his State of the Union message or file it in writing, that now is not the time to consider it. So they both seem to be factoring in that there won't be any settlement of this before the planned address in less than two weeks. So, the president has some options. He's weighing them, we're told, at the White House. He could submit it in writing. Remember, there's no mandate, per se. The whole television phenomena is a post-LBJ thing. Lyndon Johnson -- there were other presidents, like Jefferson, who found the whole idea stupid. So, he wouldn't do it. That was then. Here's the mess now. \"The Five\" now.
