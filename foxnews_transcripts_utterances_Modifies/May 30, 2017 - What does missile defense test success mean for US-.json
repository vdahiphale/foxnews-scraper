It's hitting a bullet with a bullet. The system that has been designed is operational today, on watch 24/7, with sensors, airmen, and sailors operating both the homeland defense system and the regional defense systems.  The flight-test intercept track record on the current field of missiles is four for seven in terms of successful intercept tests.",

And there you see the video put out by the Pentagon. This is a big deal in context as we watch this, because obviously North Korea and all that we have heard about what they are trying to do, this would be the defense for the U.S. homeland. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan from Alaska put out this statement, \"This test clearly demonstrates to our adversaries that our homeland missile defense system remains on track to defend our country. Today is an important day for our nation's missile defenders, our scientists and engineers, and the American people. The successful intercept test of an ICBM like target sends a clear message to the unstable dictator in North Korea that the U.S. ballistic missile defense system can and will shoot down any ballistic missile threat that endangers the American people. While I'm thankful this test was a success and I look forward to the emplacement of the remaining GBIs at Fort Greely, we need to do more to ensure that our missile defense system continues to advance ahead of the rapidly increasing North Korean threat.\" And, as you can imagine, Senator Sullivan has a piece of legislation to do just that. Let's bring in our panel, start there with the news of the day: Charles Hurt, political columnist for The Washington Times; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Charles, a big deal?",

We really are reaching a point in history where we are going to be susceptible to a rogue state, meaning North Korea, could be Iran later, hitting the homeland with a nuclear weapon. And we need a way to shoot it down. As of a few years ago we had no way to do it. Americans didn't understand if a missile was launched at us there is no way to stop it. It's going to hit, it's going to kill. And I must say it was a partisan idea. This is after 35 years of Democrats doing everything they could to slow walk, slow down the program and to stop it where they could. This was originally Reagan's vision. But he had two ideas. One was to be able to shoot down the entire Russian arsenal, which was star wars and it was a fantasy. That's impossible. But it was very important to develop defenses that would shoot down one or two rockets at a time from small states, unstable states, that would not be susceptible to deterrents. That's what we have here.  What we need to do now is to mass produce these, to put them up in Alaska and in California because the North Korea have announced they are going to start to mass produce their rockets. And they have shown tremendous advance in their rockets even in the last couple of months. So this is a race between offense and defense. Thank God our defense appears to be working.",
