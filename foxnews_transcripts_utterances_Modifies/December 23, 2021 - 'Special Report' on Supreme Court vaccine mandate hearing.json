      "sentences": "Breaking tonight, just in the past few minutes, the U.S. Supreme Court just announced it will hear oral arguments in separate appeals over President Biden's vaccine mandates. This is for large businesses, 100 or more, and for healthcare workers at facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding. Enforcement of those policies have been put on hold pending resolution in the high court. These separate arguments will be Friday, January 7th, we're told, one hour for each issue, and we expect rulings on the merits of the president's mandates relatively quickly. This is a big deal. We knew it was going to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court. Now the court is saying we take these cases, and we will hear them. Oral arguments, January 7th. Let's bring in our panel, start there, Juan Williams is a FOX News analyst, Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson, and syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt. Hugh, this is really where this is all coming to. The Supreme Court was going to have to weigh in because you had a number of courts weighing in with different rulings.",

I think you have got at least six justices led by Justice Kavanaugh who are very suspicious of administrative agency overreach, and that this will be struck down, the mandate in private employers, at least for certain struck down. And I think it will be fairly quick. And I don't think it's going to be any great dispute among the court. You might even get Justice Kagan to say it's under something that's very obscure, the Chevron doctrine, this is just beyond what OSHA was intended to do. If Congress wants to give the president this power, they have to pass a law to do it.",

The reality is we're at the point where a high percentage not only of government employees, but private sector employees are vaccinated because of, not federal mandates, but because the employers themselves have said this is what is best for our staff, our workers, and our customers in terms of keeping our economic interest to the forefront and not allowing people who just choose not to get vaccinated to determine the health of others. So it becomes a communal argument. Hugh makes a very good point about the Chevron argument. As a matter of law, you don't want government interfering in something like this. But the counterpoint would be that you have at this moment a critical national health emergency. And does the court understand or care about that point?",

President Biden credited President Trump and Operation Warp Speed for the vaccines that we're all taking today, and President Trump thanked him. So I think to get over this political divide on the vaccine, that's an important point, that everyone act like grownup adults and recognize that there is a lot of input from both parties on this. However, I think there is going to be auto big sigh of relief from many conservatives around the country that the Supreme Court is hearing this, especially when we have today in Washington, D.C., the mayor, Muriel Bowser, saying, similar to New York City, to attend a movie theater or to go into a restaurant or a bar other a nightclub, if anyone still does that, you're going to have to show your vaccination card. And I think for a lot of people who are pro-vaccine but anti the mandate, it seems like a huge amount of government overreach to show your vaccination card to get a hamburger. And when does it stop, right? Is it with the next booster? Or what if we have some other disease, a pandemic, or something else that's inflicting the country, how much of your personal information, of your personal medical information are you going to have to show if you want to grab a beer with friends?

      "utterance": "There you go. He is always factoring into the stories. All right, panel, thanks so much. Have a good one. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee talks about the GOP's path to regaining the majority in the House. They are confident about it. We'll go over some specifics with him. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"FOX NEWS PRIMETIME\" hosted by Brian Kilmeade starts right now, unless you have a headline, Brian."
