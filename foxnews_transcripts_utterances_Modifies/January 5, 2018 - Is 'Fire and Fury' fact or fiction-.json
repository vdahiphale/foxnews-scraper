But that is not 3 hours of Michael Wolff speaking with President Trump or President-elect Trump or candidate Trump. That's being in the presence of Donald Trump, the man that he absolutely analyzing as if he were a shrink and says things. I have to say that yesterday my wrath was directed at the Benedict Arnold-Steve Bannon who absolutely had behaved traitorously to the family that entrusted him. Today, I really -- and I don't generally like criticizing reporters, but Michael Wolff said something that I think begs exploration and analysis. Michael Wolff said, and I'm quoting, 100 percent of the people around Donald Trump, senior advisors, family members, every single one of them questions his intelligence and fitness for office. Really? Every single one of the family members of -- this is a patent lie. This is absolutely untrue. And at some point, even people on the left have to admit as the Washington Post did today when they questioned whether he got access at all under false pretenses. Everyone watching has to question every single one of the president's family. So Ivanka who Michael Wolff said was dumb as rocks. She questions the --Ivanka questions the intelligence and fitness of her father for office? This is not true. And it is unfair.

One of the things that Michael Wolff did leading up to the election was to write a couple of pieces that were very flattering about President Trump and saying how intelligent he was and how he was going to be able to pinpoint what the American people wanted and how he was able to win. And so, that was one of the ways that he got his foot in the door. And again, I don't blame him. And then he writes this book. I heard a couple of things also that are like factually wrong. Like one thing about Mitch McConnell, there's a report in there that he declined to take a meeting because he needed to get a haircut. And his office said that's ridiculous. That never happened. The one thing I think that is a little bit of a danger is that he said -- he says, and I don't know if he'll reveal any, but he has notes and recordings and contemporary reports. And so, if you were one of those people that thought you were talking to him off the record and you get burned in this book, you might be really cautious about saying it never happened, because then you'd be super more embarrassed.

GERALDO RIVERA, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: It's more than 9 months because the campaign began in 2015, so what you have is 3 hours. But that is not 3 hours of Michael Wolff speaking with President Trump or President-elect Trump or candidate Trump. That's being in the presence of Donald Trump, the man that he absolutely analyzing as if he were a shrink and says things. I have to say that yesterday my wrath was directed at the Benedict Arnold-Steve Bannon who absolutely had behaved traitorously to the family that entrusted him. Today, I really -- and I don't generally like criticizing reporters, but Michael Wolff said something that I think begs exploration and analysis. Michael Wolff said, and I'm quoting, 100 percent of the people around Donald Trump, senior advisors, family members, every single one of them questions his intelligence and fitness for office. Really? Every single one of the family members of -- this is a patent lie. This is absolutely untrue. And at some point, even people on the left have to admit as the Washington Post did today when they questioned whether he got access at all under false pretenses. Everyone watching has to question every single one of the president's family. So Ivanka who Michael Wolff said was dumb as rocks. She questions the --Ivanka questions the intelligence and fitness of her father for office? This is not true. And it is unfair.

One of the things that Michael Wolff did leading up to the election was to write a couple of pieces that were very flattering about President Trump and saying how intelligent he was and how he was going to be able to pinpoint what the American people wanted and how he was able to win. And so, that was one of the ways that he got his foot in the door. And again, I don't blame him. And then he writes this book. I heard a couple of things also that are like factually wrong. Like one thing about Mitch McConnell, there's a report in there that he declined to take a meeting because he needed to get a haircut. And his office said that's ridiculous. That never happened. The one thing I think that is a little bit of a danger is that he said -- he says, and I don't know if he'll reveal any, but he has notes and recordings and contemporary reports. And so, if you were one of those people that thought you were talking to him off the record and you get burned in this book, you might be really cautious about saying it never happened, because then you'd be super more embarrassed.

And I rightfully believe the hidden people are very worried about this. Very worried about it. Everybody knew what was going on when she did this.

There has been the first criminal referral -- I'm not joking -- first criminal referral from the Senate, from senators Grassley and Graham. And guess who has been referred to the Department of Justice by the Senate Judiciary Committee? Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier, the infamous dossier, is the first criminal referral. They have reason to believe, says senators Grassley and Graham, that Christopher Steele lied to the feds. So this is a major, major development. So you know, here, how ironic with all of the Russia-gate. Who's the first criminal referral from the Senate to the Department of Justice?"
