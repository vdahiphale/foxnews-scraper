All right, earlier this week the New York Times published a help wanted ad, a staffer actually tweeted this, \"Folks, the New York Times needs your help. We are looking for false information being spread deliberately to confuse, mislead or influence voters ahead of the 2018 midterms. Tip line here. Please share.\"  I love the \"folks\" part. That way we'll think they're actually human. Now, when I first heard the Times asking for proof of fake news. I sent them a New York Times gift subscription. I mean, really, I mean, think about it. \"The Times\" asking for proof of fake news. That's like Dolly Parton setting up a GoFundMe page for breast implants. Or Michael Moore pleading for more cake or Maroon Five asking you to write more terrible songs. Yes, Maroon Five. As if the NFL is not screwed enough, they hired a car alarm to play at the Super Bowl. I think we found something worse than kneeling before the flag, it's puking in your ear.

Every time the real story is not fit to print, like the good news coming out of the Koreas, no nukes is good news, so the Times can't be bothered. Did you hear about her dealings with Poland? If it undermines the Russian collusion narrative, you're not going to hear much. And there's that endless good news on the economy but who is counting, just people seeing more cash in their wallets. But that's not what the Times want you to see. They want fake news from readers just to camouflage their conveyor belt of bias and they can do it without you or a hand mirror.

Well, make you think the guy is unstable. That's today's the narrative. Unstable. Next week, it will be living in a stable with a beautiful mare. Don't question lifestyles.

See that. \"I sneezed: Did the President they bless you, Carl? No.\". That's an actual book. \"Trump Cut In Front Of Me At Baskin-Robbins And Then Broke Wind.\" That's a favorite. \"Trump Tweeted That I Have Sleepy Eyes, Which I Do But That's Not My Fault.\" That is Chuck Todd's memoir. Oh yes, \"I Was Hired To DJ A Trump Family Wedding And He Grabbed The Mic And Said I Had Low Energy And Was A Waste of Money.\" I don't know, Jed, had a night job? All right. \"Trump Did Not Hold The Door Open For Me In 1986 At Studio 54 And Then I Was Framed For Cocaine Possession In The Bathroom. Truth Is I Had Already Finished The Coke I Came With.\" \"Anyway, If You Want To Hang Out Later, I'd Love To Tell You About My Screenplay I'm Working On And Do You Know Where I Can Get Some More Coke?\" All right, Jedediah, you're a busy person.

I don't think I know how else to write them, but as a loving couple.\" Meanwhile, Sesame Street released two statements in response. They say Bert and Ernie are just friends and because they are puppets, have no sexual orientation. And Frank Oz, the guy who created Bert in the '60s, says they are not gay.

That way we'll think they're actually human. Now, when I first heard the Times asking for proof of fake news. I sent them a New York Times gift subscription. I mean, really, I mean, think about it. \"The Times\" asking for proof of fake news. That's like Dolly Parton setting up a GoFundMe page for breast implants. Or Michael Moore pleading for more cake or Maroon Five asking you to write more terrible songs. Yes, Maroon Five. As if the NFL is not screwed enough, they hired a car alarm to play at the Super Bowl. I think we found something worse than kneeling before the flag, it's puking in your ear."

If it undermines the Russian collusion narrative, you're not going to hear much. And there's that endless good news on the economy but who is counting, just people seeing more cash in their wallets.

There are other examples. The recent anonymous op-ed about insiders trying to stop Trump. That could be inducted into the fake news hall of fame or what I call CNN. I'm kidding.

He is always angry, furious, outraged, infuriated, livid, erupting, lashing out, on a tirade. The good news he only stabbed Mike Pence twice, it could've been worse. So why this language? Well, make you think the guy is unstable. That's today's the narrative. Unstable. Next week, it will be living in a stable with a beautiful mare. Don't question lifestyles. Absent any horrible deeds by Trump and face with great economic news, the media must create a daily fear that justifies their sweat stained night terrors.

Also, I think that this is making the assumption, this entire thing is making the assumption that fake news is the reason why Trump won the election, right? That's a lot of liberals think.

Ford says the Supreme Court nominee attempted to rape her decades ago at a high school party. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation. And overseas, the death toll from the tragic ferry accident in Tanzania is more than 200, but an engineer managed to survive the disaster. He locked himself in a small room inside the ship and divers pulled him to safety. Authorities say he is in serious condition. The ferry captain's has been arrested.

So I want to flat out say that I don't know and I think a lot of the people who are claiming that they know for sure one way or another, their reasoning for their belief is based on partisanship rather than on the facts because the facts are super unclear. People are saying she must be believed, you have to believe her. They don't want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.

No, let's hear everybody out. Let's get the facts. Let's figure it out. It's not fair to either party. And by the way, her legal team is infuriating.

The dog does not know the difference between your phone or the TV you're watching or the plate of food. He's a dog. He will sit next to you and wait for you. If you leave, he will be at the door when you come back because he has no concept of time, let alone the damn phone. The dog really don't care but and that little story that you just told is you projecting some weird [bleep] on your dog. Dogs are not spiteful. He went to the bathroom because you forgot to take them out because your ass was on the phone too long. Period."
