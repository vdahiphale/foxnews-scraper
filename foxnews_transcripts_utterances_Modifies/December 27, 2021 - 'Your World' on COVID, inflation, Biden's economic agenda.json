This is all cancellations. Delta telling FOX Business that the spread of Omicron is creating staffing issues and leading to some of these cancellations, the company saying that 200 of their over 4,000 scheduled flights will be canceled because of that. United has said that 115 flights today will be canceled of their 4,000 flights. Jackie, the people here that I spoke to, they're just hoping that their flight is not added to that list.",

What we, though, as a nation have to do is, I think the president needs to immediately reimpose the sanctions on the Nord Stream pipeline. And he needs to find out exactly what the Ukraine believes that they have to have. And we need to start arming them with lethal weapons and materiel that will ensure that this will not be a simple takeover, like it was in Crimea. You need to remember, we all need to remember that the reason the Russians ultimately left Afghanistan was because Russians were being killed their. Russians were being sent home in body bags. And no one could explain to the people of Russia, to the moms and dads that were receiving their sons on the way home, nobody could explain why they were there, what their objectives were, and when would the war be over?

Meanwhile, the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square is being scaled back because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Instead of the usual 58,000 people watching in the street, only 15,000 will be allowed. Entry will not be permitted until 3:00 p.m. All revelers must have I.D. and proof that they are fully vaccinated. And even though the event, of course, is outdoors, everyone must wear a mask. And speaking of New Year's Eve, early next year, a number of cities are going to impose either new mandates, or they're going to beef up existing mandates.

And, yet again, the mayor instills another harsh penalty for small businesses."

Other countries have said, listen, let the young healthy people go out and battle the virus. That's the only way we're going to end this pandemic. The reason that I'm actually canceling reservations is because of all the things I won't get to do because of quarantining and all the rules that are in place. That's the problem here."

They're shopping more strategically at the grocery stores. They're shopping sales at the grocery stores when and if they actually have them. They're shopping for their clothing at thrift stores, going to sites like Thredup, one of the world's largest online thrift stores, where they're finding both value and selection, over 35,000 brands, so some very good deals there. I talked to one woman who is in Austin, Texas. She's 45 years old, and for the first time in many, many years, she's now bringing in a roommate to help defer her housing costs.

And then there's two sort of conflicting pieces of data as well, the S&P 500 closing at a record today, despite worries about Omicron, despite worries about inflation. And then holiday sales rose 8.5 percent. It was the fastest pace of growth that we have seen in 17 years. So how do you sort of reconcile what people are saying vs. what the numbers are telling us?"

    {
      "speaker": "GIBBONS",
      "utterance": "Well, holiday sales, I mean, those numbers didn't really surprise anybody. I mean, I know these are preliminary numbers, but the overall expectation was that holiday sales were going to be extremely strong because of the unbelievable amount of demand. And the gains are being driven primarily by the high-income households, who shopped very early on, late summer on into early fall, before this variant actually hit us. I think people were feeling pretty good about things in general. Stock market was doing well. Home values are ridiculous right now. So people were feeling pretty wealthy, and people continue to feel wealthy. And when you feel wealthy, you actually spend more. So the holiday sales numbers really don't seem all that surprising, given the fact the pent-up demand has been ridiculous. I mean, people have been holed up for a couple of years now."

Yes, there was strong demand there. I'm not saying people didn't go out and shop this year. But, also, from the inflation that we're talking about, those retail sales numbers may look higher because, literally, the retailers were charging more for goods. It doesn't necessarily translate into more volume. Your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIBBONS",

Amazon had its Prime Day very early on. Other retailers followed suit. So that's part of the issue too is that, yes, people were paying more for those holiday items. But I think, also, there was a shift to people actually buying more experiences back then. They were thinking, well, let's -- if I can't find what I want, let's go ahead and buy an experience. So people were buying travel packages."

That's just not possible. There's a constitutional provision that requires Congress to appropriate money to be able to have spending. And there is no appropriations in this case. And so the idea that the what the progressives are pushing -- and, if you notice, they have not provided any detail whatsoever as to what they're calling Biden to do. They say a plan is forthcoming. That plan likely will never have the details that's required, because there's no possible way that they can achieve the legal authority that's necessary."

Then Joe Manchin came back when the bills were separate. And he said, no, I'm not voting for this. Look, he is for some spending. He has said that. He just wants to see it be a little bit more sensible. Yet you have got the progressives in this party essentially just pushing this president, saying absolutely not. But the longer this saga plays out, the more embarrassing it becomes."

That itself will have inflationary problems to it.

      "utterance": "Look, when President Biden was running as a candidate for president, he promised that he would govern for all Americans, including Trump supporters. Since taking office, what we have witnessed has been completely the opposite. Joe Manchin, the last Democrat in America with common sense, has shot down this Build Back Better bill. And it's time now for the Democrats to go back to the drawing board, as opposed to doubling down on this FDR- style socialist spending plan. If Joe Biden listens to Representative Jayapal and insists on going ahead with this, what's going to happen is the Democrats are going to be annihilated in the midterms in 2022, leaving Joe Biden 100 percent a lame duck."

      "utterance": "Yes, you're right, Jackie. And I find it interesting. Democrats, like Vice President Kamala Harris, are saying that democracy is one of the biggest threats to American national security. Well, is it democracy for the people's representatives in the House and the Senate to be ignored in favor of the president going in alone and ruling by executive order? Laura had some good points, but I don't think Americans are clamoring, for example, for free universal pre-K. West Virginia, of course, did it without federal help, as Joe Manchin repeatedly points out. And, again, most Americans, more than 50 percent of Americans disapprove of Joe Biden's handling of the economy. And part of that is how much money, trillions of dollars, he has put into the economy since he started since he took office in January. Adding billions more is just going to make inflation worse. It's going to send things spiraling even worse than they are. And Americans, they often do vote with their pocketbook, don't they, Jackie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",

    {
      "speaker": "FINK",
      "utterance": "Well, no, they're absolutely feeling the pinch. But I'm going to I'm going to go with 17 Nobel Prize-winning economists that say that this won't contribute to inflation. I'm going to go with Goldman Sachs, who has lowered their projections with respect to how much our economy will grow, shrinking economic growth predictions. That's not a good thing. And I'm going to go with the 2.5 million women that right now have dropped out of the work force to care for children or elders that this Build Back Better program would help. And that would also help our economy. Americans are fans of the elements of this bill. And Joe Biden isn't going to quit now, just because Joe Manchin put a lump of coal in everybody's stocking. Expect these elements to move forward, and America to be better off because of these programs and because of this help."

And that essentially is what Goldman Sachs was saying when it said this -- not passing this bill would shave off a point off of GDP. But, Nick, the concern, of course, is that some of these programs that Laura's talking about will run long term, will end up costing far more than $1.75 trillion. And that will be a negative that the American consumer, that the average American will feel long-lasting effects from, not just a short-term sugar high from stimulus."

I'm going to go with every American that fills up their car at the gas pump, because they're the ones that truly know what's going on. They're the ones that feel the pinch. The truth is that the American people don't like this reckless socialist spending, which is what this bill is about. And from the very beginning, Joe Biden and his cronies have lied about Build Back Better. They said that Americans -- it would cost Americans zero dollars. They said it would all be about heart infrastructure. None of that has turned out to be true. And that's why you're going to see dire electrical -- electoral -- electoral consequences for the Democrat."

Former Deputy Defense Undersecretary Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin joins me now. Lieutenant General, wonderful to see you today. I will start right there. How serious is the threat? Because many folks are saying they're looking at Putin right now, looking at the United States, and saying, we're under weak leadership here. This is the perfect time to pounce."

Now, it could never be the same because we have already integrated several countries into NATO. But what he does not want to see is, he does not want to see NATO coming any closer to his borders."

      "speaker": "BOYKIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And keep in mind also, in 2014, America did nothing when the Crimea was annexed by Russia. And they're still there. So, he has, I think, every reason to believe, especially given our weak leadership in America right now, and I would say even in Europe's -- there is some weak leadership there as well -- I think that he would see this as an opportune time to do the same thing for Ukraine as a whole. What we, though, as a nation have to do is, I think the president needs to immediately reimpose the sanctions on the Nord Stream pipeline. And he needs to find out exactly what the Ukraine believes that they have to have. And we need to start arming them with lethal weapons and materiel that will ensure that this will not be a simple takeover, like it was in Crimea. You need to remember, we all need to remember that the reason the Russians ultimately left Afghanistan was because Russians were being killed their. Russians were being sent home in body bags. And no one could explain to the people of Russia, to the moms and dads that were receiving their sons on the way home, nobody could explain why they were there, what their objectives were, and when would the war be over? So we need to give Ukraine as much lethal material as they can take."
