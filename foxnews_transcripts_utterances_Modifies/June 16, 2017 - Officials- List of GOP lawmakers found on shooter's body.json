FOX News can confirm that authorities found a list of six names of Republican members of Congress in a van belonging to James Hodgkinson, the left wing gunman who opened fire at a practice for the annual Congressional baseball game. The news adds to the mountain that Hodgkinson's specifically targeted Republicans when he went on his shooting spree wounding five including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise who remained hospitalized and in critical condition.  Representative Trent Franks of Arizona was one of the names on Hodgkinson's list. Martha MacCallum asked him about it tonight.",

Like at a town hall meeting or, you know, some place where they're meeting with constituents or they're out in the open where they feel like they need it. And the -- is sort of, I don't think they haven't said no, but it sort of dragging their feet on it but seems to me that if it would give some members of Congress some confidence to be able to go out and do their work, that would not be taxpayer funded dollars, they would have to make a decision to use campaign funds to pay for that. I feel like the -- should go ahead and approve that. At least in the interim to give people some confidence because I'm that other members of Congress think that they are probably on other list out there. Hopefully, that is not true.

You have had meetings between Speaker Ryan and the Minority Leader Pelosi about added investment in security specifically the Capitol police.

The news adds to the mountain that Hodgkinson's specifically targeted Republicans when he went on his shooting spree wounding five including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise who remained hospitalized and in critical condition.

And this idea that it comes to the baseball field and asks, are those Republicans or Democrats? They're practicing. I would imagine, he actually probably knew that and perhaps we'll find out more. The one thing about security for these members of Congress is very interesting. So, only the leadership has actually afforded 24-hour security."

One of the things that members of Congress have been asking and Congressman Marsha Blackburn was talking about this the other day, that they have asked the Federal Election Commission for permission to use some of their campaign funds to supplement security for times when they feel like they might need it. Like at a town hall meeting or, you know, some place where they're meeting with constituents or they're out in the open where they feel like they need it. And the -- is sort of, I don't think they haven't said no, but it sort of dragging their feet on it but seems to me that if it would give some members of Congress some confidence to be able to go out and do their work, that would not be taxpayer funded dollars, they would have to make a decision to use campaign funds to pay for that. I feel like the -- should go ahead and approve that. At least in the interim to give people some confidence because I'm that other members of Congress think that they are probably on other list out there. Hopefully, that is not true. But if you don't have any other way to protecting yourself, I think this seems reasonable today."

You don't have access. The capital is, I mean, that is supposed to be basically a Congress that American people are supposed to be able to go in there and talk to elected officials. In recent years, they've made some changes in terms of meeting space by creating that Capitol Center that so many people may now be familiar with is actually underground but that is where so many meetings with the constituents take place. And then in the last two days, seems the shooting, Kimberly. You have had meetings between Speaker Ryan and the Minority Leader Pelosi about added investment in security specifically the Capitol police. Just having more Capitol police on the grounds and potentially as Dana was discussing, at some of this town hall meetings but the question is, how far do you go with security?

I'm just trying to think of the reaction if it had been the other way and just try to -- some of the hypocrisy. It almost seems like today, the media kind of wants to move on from the story.

I'm bringing this up in the story to illustrate that guns save lives. Those guys were on the run. They were on the run. They murdered two prison guards. They were going to kill more.

You have the President's lawyer Michael Cohen saying he's hiring his own lawyer. We know that Vice President Pence has hired his own lawyer. They are now going to apparently interview people who want of the lead, communications people for the campaign. So, and we know that it goes beyond. I mean, one of the things about the Trump tweet, that was so interesting was to suggest, as Greg was saying, well, maybe now, it's not about collusion now it's about obstruction. But in fact, the investigation goes on. It's not only collusion it's also potentially obstruction, and now there is this financial piece that involves Jared Kushner. So, we have it on many levels. But I think the most intriguing thing that happened now is this Rod Rosenstein put out a very strange announcement that said, don't believe any anonymous sources that come from foreign governments is thinking, well, is he talking about news of where he came out, or something more coming that apparently is being intentionally sourced and placed by foreign governments trying to hurt the United States.

Instead of spending the rest of her life in jail, she's been living a good life in Cuba for over 30 years after escaping from a New Jersey prison with the help of her pals and the Black Liberation Army. President Obama made a big splash when he reopened diplomatic relations with the communist island in 2015. But he made no mentioned on Miss Chesimard when touting his Cuba initiative outraging New Jersey state troopers of all stripes. President Trump is taking a much stronger line with the country demanding the communist send back Miss Chesimard."

Trump was right to kill this deal because it is a deal, because we got nothing in this deal. Obama didn't even ask for Chesimard or Morales the bomb maker. So what Trump is doing is that that deal is done, we want (inaudible), we want a better deal. We might not be equal in the deal, but we are going to get these people back.

For example, bad shame on you, do not harbor fugitives and people who execute police officers, and why don't you get something in return for once to do something and do the right thing? Why do we have to bend over backwards and play by their rules and on their terms when we actually have power and influence and leverage to actually accomplish some greater good? This was the easiest thing in the world for President Obama to ask for at the time. Instead, he gave them everything, we get nothing back in return. I think what President Trump did makes a lot of sense and again, it was something that he honored and obviously Marco Rubio has been pressing on this issue for quite some time and you could tell that he was delighted."

Ms. Carter back in 2014 sent a barrage of texts to her teenage boyfriend telling him to kill himself. Conrad Roy III soon thereafter committed suicide. Ms. Carter now faces up to 20 years in jail when she's sentenced on August 3rd. Now, just to draw the picture for you, he was in a car and he's texting with her, and the gases are collecting in the car, and she tells him to get back in the car where he died. Now, Massachusetts doesn't have a law against encouraging suicide, but you got a situation where she says, she cared for him, he was terribly depressed, and I don't want to have him live this way anymore. Kimberly, what do you think?"

She tried to take a chance by saying, okay, I'm going to go with the judge. She thought she would fare better than going in front of a jury trial. Wrong. She has sociopathic tendencies. Very clearly this person is a danger to others. That's been demonstrated. There are over thousand Facebook and text messages between them to substantiate and document this. All she had to do was let a family member know. Instead, she might as well put a gun to his head. I think that she even acted even further than involuntary manslaughter. I feel that she acted with implied malice which is acting in conscious disregard of a known risk. This man was suicidal. He was depressed. That has likely resulted in great bodily injury or death. And she kept telling him to get back in the car to kill himself. So, feel a little bit better when she is behind bars."

It is not completely free. And if your free speech ends up causing someone to die, as a direct result, then I think you have to face the music. She is going to face it. Twenty years is a long time."

Number two, why did she do this? According to the prosecutors and I believe this to be true, for the drama of it. To be famous as a grieving girlfriend. Very Romeo and Juliet of this kind of like thing. It's like the majestic death scenes. The third thing is, you know, she didn't kill him with her hands, but she goaded him to death. How similar is this to the discussion that we've been having in the last week about goading people to death or to commit death? This is a (inaudible) seems to me to be very related.
