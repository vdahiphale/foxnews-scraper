But no, since that aired 450 former Jeopardy contestants signed an open letter demanding that Kelly Donohue publicly apologize \"For the ramifications of the gesture.\" And disavow any connection to white supremacist doctrines. And urges the show to address Kelly's behavior and take measures to make sure future mistakes of this magnitude never make it on the air. And here you thought you had to be smart to appear on Jeopardy. Now we finally know who's dumber than a fifth grader. So this dude's got to apologize whether his hand gesture was intentional or not. This is nuts or in Jeopardy terms what is (BLEEP) crazy. I -- is the applause for the swearing? The idea that white supremacists are looking for signals on game shows. It's Jeopardy, not the prices, right? I mean, how many Klansmen actually watch Jeopardy besides my uncle? Sorry. If there shouldn't be a game so have the guts to call this delusional witch hunt out? Nope. The world loses the legendary talented, classy guy at Alex Trebek.   And within six months, they prove they can't fend off the social Jeopardy warriors whose idea of strength is opening a piping hot bag of microwave popcorn. Meanwhile, Donohue already beg for forgiveness. It's sad. So, how did this actually become a story? Well, it began with one loser on Twitter with a dozen followers. Here I thought Kilmeade swore off social media. But that's all it took for the press to amplify it. And why? Are they so thirsty for proof of white supremacy that they'll take direction from a finger sniffer and a stained Snuggie? Yes. They can't find enough real world examples. So they create a potpourri of paranoia, hoaxes and deliberate misunderstandings, simulating around wearing fake nooses they made in arts and crafts. They believe that under every bed is an angry white male. I wonder what an angry white male thinks.",

Now these are comedians apparently yet what's funny about them is their humorlessness. SNL used to make fun of people like this. Now they are the morally outraged. The Dean Wormer scowling and disgust at the Animal House.  Which leads to another question. When did Musk become an evil Bond villain? Was it all those electric cars he's making, sending astronauts to space, naming his kid after an obscure tax form? It seems that the dumbest most delusional people on earth are controlling these outrage narratives. They're seeing who can spew the dumbest take the fastest. It's like watching the hot dog eating contest in reverse. But you know who I like? Jason Fried. He's the CEO of Basecamp. Not to be confused with Hunter Biden's company free base camp. He announced that employees wouldn't be allowed to share their politics it work. \"Every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy, or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant.\" He wrote, you shouldn't have to wonder if staying out of it means you're complicit or wading into it means you're a target.  Translation. When you're at work, focus on work, that thing that you're paid to do. That's it. It's the opposite of a delusion. We've seen our politics play out in sports. If you don't kneel, you're part of the problem. So maybe free found the solution. After he banned politics at work, a third of his employees quit citing the policy. That's around 20 people, or as Joy Reid calls it high ratings. Meaning he may have dumped his most annoying workers in one shot.   Just like that. All the dopes who lectured you while stinking up the break room with their microwave broccoli burgers, they're gone. So, what if every company did that? You know what happens? Just like after doing a fistful of mushrooms, doctor, life returns to normal. Civility, respect, productivity. Three things the media can't stand. No matter how many fingers it takes to count them. And the only finger we should show them is the appraised middle one.",

Apparently, it's still not COVID safe for teachers to go back to school or go back to in-school learning. Translation. We are never teaching again. Screw your stupid kids. Let's get drunk. I know how to speak teacher. The National Teachers Union lobbied hard to prevent students returning to the classroom even as the science showed schools weren't a primary source of infections. Unless you consider leftist indoctrination and infection. And we know you do. And you know we do. Of course, their most recent guidance for vaccinated members of the general public says maskless outdoor dining and socializing in small groups is fine. Yes (BLEEP) the CDC changes their mind more than Trey Gowdy changes haircuts. Have you noticed this? You noticed this? I've been watching this on and off for two years. And I've kept silent on this, but I can't keep silent anymore. Somebody has to speak the truth around about Trey Gowdy's hair. Meanwhile, the CDC also announced new guidelines for summer camps among them all children must be thrown into a vat of scalding lava. I read that wrong. Kids should stay three feet apart, and everyone including vaccinated camp counselors should stay masked up the whole time. Which sounds absurd. I mean, come on, kids had more fun at camp and Friday the 13th. At least Jason was the only one in a mask and he's had holes in it. Oh, I loved him, Kennedy. You know, this summer camp thing is insane. If you were -- if a version of you from a few years ago, time traveled to now. First, you'd be like, wow, I can time travel. Why am I here?

Now, Caitlyn may identify as a woman and get those votes but Governor Newsom can also be expected to counter it with (BLEEP) vote and criminals. On Saturday, 76,000 California inmates including violent repeat felons became eligible for early release due to new good behavior. The only caveat is that they all stay in California, so many opted to return to jail. But that 76,000 includes nearly 20,000 who are serving life sentences. Some lawmakers are already bashing Newsom for the changes said state Senator Jim Nielsen, \"is putting us all at greater risk and there seems to be no end to the degree to which he wants to do that.\" For more, we went to Gavin Newsom for comment.

But no, since that aired 450 former Jeopardy contestants signed an open letter demanding that Kelly Donohue publicly apologize \"For the ramifications of the gesture.\" And disavow any connection to white supremacist doctrines. And urges the show to address Kelly's behavior and take measures to make sure future mistakes of this magnitude never make it on the air. And here you thought you had to be smart to appear on Jeopardy. Now we finally know who's dumber than a fifth grader. So this dude's got to apologize whether his hand gesture was intentional or not. This is nuts or in Jeopardy terms what is (BLEEP) crazy. I -- is the applause for the swearing? The idea that white supremacists are looking for signals on game shows. It's Jeopardy, not the prices, right? I mean, how many Klansmen actually watch Jeopardy besides my uncle? Sorry. If there shouldn't be a game so have the guts to call this delusional witch hunt out? Nope. The world loses the legendary talented, classy guy at Alex Trebek. And within six months, they prove they can't fend off the social Jeopardy warriors whose idea of strength is opening a piping hot bag of microwave popcorn. Meanwhile, Donohue already beg for forgiveness. It's sad. So, how did this actually become a story? Well, it began with one loser on Twitter with a dozen followers. Here I thought Kilmeade swore off social media. But that's all it took for the press to amplify it. And why? Are they so thirsty for proof of white supremacy that they'll take direction from a finger sniffer and a stained Snuggie? Yes. They can't find enough real world examples. So they create a potpourri of paranoia, hoaxes and deliberate misunderstandings, simulating around wearing fake nooses they made in arts and crafts.

The Dean Wormer scowling and disgust at the Animal House. Which leads to another question. When did Musk become an evil Bond villain? Was it all those electric cars he's making, sending astronauts to space, naming his kid after an obscure tax form? It seems that the dumbest most delusional people on earth are controlling these outrage narratives. They're seeing who can spew the dumbest take the fastest. It's like watching the hot dog eating contest in reverse. But you know who I like? Jason Fried. He's the CEO of Basecamp. Not to be confused with Hunter Biden's company free base camp. He announced that employees wouldn't be allowed to share their politics it work. \"Every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy, or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant.\" He wrote, you shouldn't have to wonder if staying out of it means you're complicit or wading into it means you're a target. Translation. When you're at work, focus on work, that thing that you're paid to do. That's it. It's the opposite of a delusion. We've seen our politics play out in sports. If you don't kneel, you're part of the problem. So maybe free found the solution. After he banned politics at work, a third of his employees quit citing the policy. That's around 20 people, or as Joy Reid calls it high ratings. Meaning he may have dumped his most annoying workers in one shot. Just like that. All the dopes who lectured you while stinking up the break room with their microwave broccoli burgers, they're gone. So, what if every company did that? You know what happens? Just like after doing a fistful of mushrooms, doctor, life returns to normal. Civility, respect, productivity. Three things the media can't stand. No matter how many fingers it takes to count them.

The only caveat is that they all stay in California, so many opted to return to jail. But that 76,000 includes nearly 20,000 who are serving life sentences.

I don't have the, the expertise that Caitlyn Jenner does when she talks about sport and being a trans-athlete, and I certainly defer to her.

And every time those players kneel to our flag, and they don't stand up against these violence-ridden inner cities that are killing all these kids in Chicago, and in Detroit, and in Philadelphia, and they say nothing that's put these, these fans right on them. That's what I wanted. I want to replace roles."

Man City, the, the favorite team of Ricky Hatton and Oasis, the Gallagher Brothers. So, they've always been kind of the punk rock team, but now they have money and they're doing well. They're mad at the Glazers at number one because they plunged the team into debt. And, and they are still in debt. The team is essentially broke then they tried to break away. It'd be like if Texas tried to secede from the union and failed. And then Greg Abbott came out what I'm sorry guys like a really suck. So, that's essentially what happened."

And just because there's American owners, well, you know what I want soccer imported to the United States more. I want to see more soccer here. It's a really, really safe, and energetic and great sport, so I don't like the violence. And by the way, I do think they were trying to steal the league. Yes, that part's bad, but I don't like to turn violent. Everything seems to turn violent now."

They like our military, but they don't want us owning their stuff. So, that's why they were whining and crying so much. I think soccer is great for different reasons because as a as a kid growing up and is coaching youth football, truly expensive for kids in the intercity to play football."

So that's why it's so popular across the country because anybody can play it on an area. So, I'd like to see more of that in our, in our intercities in the United States where there's more opportunities, where it cost somebody 75 bucks for the kid to play all year opposed to it's like 350 for gear plus on a football can be expensive."
