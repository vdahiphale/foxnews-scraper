January 26th, Sally Yates warns the White House Counsel Don McGahn about Flynn lying and saying that could potentially compromise him. February 8th, Flynn denies discussing the sanctions with Russian officials in a Washington Post piece. He then has to say he has no recollection of discussing sanctions. February 13th, Flynn resigns from his national security adviser post.  That is where we are, testimony today, a long hearing.

And we live in an age where that can sometimes work, the video of the United Airlines guy. If it hadn't been on video, we never would have talked about it. But because it was dramatized, it became a huge event.  There is nothing that was said today that we didn't already know. The only result of these hours of hearings is that Sally Yates is now a Democratic star and she needs to pick a state and run for the Senate. She is a rising candidate for the future. And her answer on the question why did you resign at all that was exactly right. It would be nice if we had a tradition in our government where people resign on principle. You could say it was a cheap shot. She was leaving three days later anyway. But it's refreshing, I don't think since Cyrus Vance and the Iran raid in 1979 have we had a high official who resigns and then the administration was right to fire her. If you can't carry out the president's orders, you are gone. So everything was right on both sides. But the bottom line is we learned zero.",

      "speaker": "JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE",
      "utterance": "We did not include any evidence in our report, and when I say \"our,\" that is NSA, FBI, CIA with my office, the director of national intelligence, that had anything -- that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report."

      "utterance": "I understand that, but does it exist?"
    },

      "speaker": "CLAPPER",
      "utterance": "Not to my knowledge."

      "utterance": "Is that still accurate?"

      "utterance": "It is."

      "speaker": "YATES",
      "utterance": "My answer to that question would require me to reveal classified information. I think Director Clapper also said that he was unaware of the FBI counterintelligence investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Just putting that all together for the audience, you have this report that is said to be signed off by the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, not every intelligence -- but essentially the director of national intelligence is giving this report and coming to the conclusion that they didn't have evidence of collusion. Sally Yates is saying I can't talk about it because there was an ongoing investigation that he didn't know about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALMER",
      "utterance": "That's the question here. Clapper stood by that testimony saying to the best of his knowledge, again today, that it wasn't happening. But it appears there was an investigation happening, that for whatever reason people beneath him weren't giving him that information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So is it because it was in its infancy it just didn't make it into the report? I mean, it seems like a big disconnect here. And now we are well into this administration and we still don't have evidence of collusion. It is not there yet. But Democrats continue to say that it's there, essentially."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "Of course. What else do they have? When you say it's not there yet, that assumes it's going to come out. What is going to come out? I don't even understand what \"collusion\" means."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Knowing when the WikiLeaks was going to be released, orchestrating the timing of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape comes out and then the emails are released same day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "If that's what was going on, there'd be so many parties involved, the idea that we would have no evidence of that right now, wouldn't have been leaked to any of the news organizations, is highly improbable. And I think it's just the Democrats pursuing a conspiracy theory. When I heard the senator from Minnesota, Franken, talking about his tremendously elaborate theory, I was thinking, who gave him the tinfoil hat? That is so way out there. It's a great theory. It would make a great novel, but show me evidence, what you've got, people who are involved with the Russians and you get Russians involved in the election without a shred of evidence connecting them. So until you get it, it's a concoction by the Democrats. I am open to evidence. Show it to me."
