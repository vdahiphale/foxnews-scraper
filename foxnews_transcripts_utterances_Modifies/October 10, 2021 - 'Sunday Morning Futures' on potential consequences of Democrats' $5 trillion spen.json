Wyoming Senator John Barrasso with the very latest on negotiations in the Senate and how the U.S. will fundamentally change with all of the free money, more government control, and millions of new migrants in the country.

GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is here on the Republican agenda and fighting this Marxist playbook in America. What can we do to protect our freedom and liberties in the face of these communist China moves from the Biden administration? Then: the adversary that Joe Biden will not take on, an aggressive Chinese Communist Party. Nearly 150 jets flown into Taiwan last week.

That undermines the accountability that they owe the American people, that all of us owe the American people. So, number one, they did not get a blank check. We made them fill in a number. And it's the first time that's happened in over a decade. And, Maria, the number that they filled in was a small number compared to the amount that they're asking for in this $5 trillion big government socialism bill.

That's about one-third of it. The next part is the massive taxes that they need to pay for it. And we're talking about 40 different taxes, including all of this extra money for the IRS. And Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, wants to use it to hire an army of IRS agents to spy on Americans' checking accounts, banking accounts.

I have been beating my drum for a long time, saying, guys, look what's coming around the corner. You know what they're doing. They're classifying anything that stands against the state as a form of domestic terrorism. We saw this, obviously, most notably, after January 6, a lot of lies being told by the media. And, in reality, what they were trying to do were two things. They were first trying to say -- issue a threat to any person that was awake to what this administration was always going to do that, if you ever try to stand up to us, we have no problem locking up political dissidents. They were also trying to brainwash everybody else to think that any extreme efforts taken from the government wants to say, hey, listen, we're fighting domestic terrorism. Well, now they have expanded their tentacles. Now we're looking at parents. Parents are rightfully standing up, left and right. And this is not partisan at all, left and right, and saying, what is going on in these school systems? Our kids are systematically becoming dumber. That's a fact, if you look at a standardized test scores, which is why they want to do away with standardized tests, because it tells parents, hey, your kids are not actually learning anything. They're getting dumber and dumber and dumber every single year. And, at the same time, you're trading in, and they're saying, you know what, we want to teach them Critical Race Theory? We want to teach them about emotional psychological conditioning. I mean, the programs they're trying to implement, Maria, I want to be very clear, this is psychological conditioning like we haven't seen since we learned about Stalin youth, communist youth programs. And they want to make sure that kids are at first -- first and foremost allegiant to the state and not to their parents, not to their family.

If you deny them access to your children, then they can't guarantee that they're going to be able to exist and sustain itself. So what's happening next -- and I keep telling people to pay attention what's happening internationally. What happened in France last year was that they banned homeschooling. They did it under the guise that, well, at home, there's radical threats, there's homegrown terrorists, we're dealing with all these Islamic terrorists, and the one way that we can prevent this is to guarantee that nobody's allowed to homeschool. So, now you are not allowed to homeschool your child. Imagine not being given the option as a parent, you birthed a human being, to not homeschool your child. Well, let me tell you, if that's them catching a sneeze, then America is about to catch a cold, OK? If France caught a sneeze, we're going to catch a cold. They're going to start saying that terror -- domestic terrorism is happening at home, and the only way to fight it, to go against these Trump supporters, these conservatives, is to guarantee that all children must be enrolled in the public schools. This is why I say to parents over and over and over again, the time is now. Remove your children from these indoctrination camps. They're not learning to be smart. They're not focused on hard academics. They are being brainwashed and systematically controlled. And what they want to produce, by the way, are failures, because it guarantees then that they will have children that grow up to be adults that are dependent on the government. And a totalitarian government that's focused on Marxist principles needs people that are dependent upon them. That is what is happening right now in this country.",

That's about one-third of it. The next part is the massive taxes that they need to pay for it. And we're talking about 40 different taxes, including all of this extra money for the IRS. And Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, wants to use it to hire an army of IRS agents to spy on Americans' checking accounts, banking accounts. And then the third part is the real attack on American energy, which is going to make energy costs go up harder and more expensive to drive your car, to heat your home.

The question is, how much are they going to start funding? But their goal is a complete takeover of the lives of the American people, which is why I call it big government socialism.

Instead of finding a way to pay the credit card off, all they think should do is, you shouldn't limit how much I can spend. That is what's put us in this problem. That is what has increased inflation that we haven't seen in decades. That is why we have got one of the worst jobless numbers that we have had in quite some time. This Biden plan is putting America on the wrong path. And so we have to come back in session to vote on the debt ceiling to increase the amount.

If they put these programs into the bill, what they will be saying is, it costs less. It does not. They're just dialing back how long they will fund it. It will continue to go on. If you're concerned about bank surveillance, if you have more than $600 in your bank account, government will now know what you do, whether you go to Disneyland, how you spend your money. And, again, Secretary of Treasury Yellen supports that. And the Democrats support that. Why? Because they want to vote for 85,000 new IRS agents to spy on what you're doing, instead of protecting the border. Then, if you look from the other aspects, it has more than $100 billion for amnesty for 10 million people who came to America illegally. And we're watching that happen day after day on our borders.

So they went to their local school board to question. And instead of making these answers or changing the course and not having Critical Race Theory taught in our schools, the next thing the Biden administration does is tries to silence you, intimidate you.

She's desecrated this institution, because now she's made it almost impossible for the minority to get documents from the Biden administration, so we can hold them accountable, not just on this, but on Afghanistan as well. She now has proxy voting, where there are Democrats that have not shown up for work for months, but they still get their paycheck.

The Biden administration, through the FBI and Secret Service, purchased from DJI, which is -- which is a company that the Trump administration actually flagged in 2017. Department of Homeland Security said that that specific company was using its drones for the purpose of providing information on U.S. critical infrastructure to the Chinese Communist Party. And that was moderate confidence that that was taking place, which is why our administration took all of those out and basically advanced a policy where we wouldn't use that Chinese technology. You outlined the kind of concerns that Huawei and companies that are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party pose to our national security. So, like so much the Biden administration has done on national security lately, this makes very little sense. It's harmful to our national security. And, also, Chinese drone technology is not as good as U.S. drone technology. So, it's hard to make sense out of what's doing this, other than it is consistent with the Biden administration taking a softer approach, trying to promote a false narrative that somehow China is a competitor or not an adversary. And you would think that the lessons learned from COVID would treat -- would teach everyone that China's not to be trusted and that moves like this are harmful to our national security posture."

And yet Mark Milley claims that the U.S. is the threat, and that he had to de-escalate things by calling his Chinese counterpart and saying, if Trump invades China, we will give you a heads-up in advance.

Now, keep in mind, Maria, from a time frame standpoint, that's four days before the presidential election. Now, the idea that something like that took place, and Mark Milley, as the president's principal military adviser, didn't brief President Trump on that or myself, as the president's principal intelligence adviser, didn't brief President Trump, would tell you that it just didn't happen.

And then, on your show, we talked about this very fact, that the Hillary Clinton campaign created the Trump-Russia collusion. And the intelligence community and the FBI knew that. And they briefed not just President Obama, but Vice President Biden and the entire national security team. I expected and said there would be indictments forthcoming. Michael Sussmann is the first of what I would hope would be a number, based on the fact I provided not just those declassified documents, but I provided 1,000 intelligence community documents that I think support additional charges that I would expect John Durham to bring."

One Florida mom got a standing ovation Thursday when she called for a mass exodus from the public school system during a panel discussion in Virginia. Watch."

And, Candace, you said on this program months ago, pull your kids out of the public school system. Your reaction to what's taking place? CANDACE OWENS, HOST, \"CANDACE\": I'm very happy to see it. I have been beating my drum for a long time, saying, guys, look what's coming around the corner. You know what they're doing. They're classifying anything that stands against the state as a form of domestic terrorism. We saw this, obviously, most notably, after January 6, a lot of lies being told by the media. And, in reality, what they were trying to do were two things. They were first trying to say -- issue a threat to any person that was awake to what this administration was always going to do that, if you ever try to stand up to us, we have no problem locking up political dissidents. They were also trying to brainwash everybody else to think that any extreme efforts taken from the government wants to say, hey, listen, we're fighting domestic terrorism. Well, now they have expanded their tentacles. Now we're looking at parents. Parents are rightfully standing up, left and right. And this is not partisan at all, left and right, and saying, what is going on in these school systems? Our kids are systematically becoming dumber. That's a fact, if you look at a standardized test scores, which is why they want to do away with standardized tests, because it tells parents, hey, your kids are not actually learning anything. They're getting dumber and dumber and dumber every single year. And, at the same time, you're trading in, and they're saying, you know what, we want to teach them Critical Race Theory? We want to teach them about emotional psychological conditioning. I mean, the programs they're trying to implement, Maria, I want to be very clear, this is psychological conditioning like we haven't seen since we learned about Stalin youth, communist youth programs. And they want to make sure that kids are at first -- first and foremost allegiant to the state and not to their parents, not to their family. And parents are rightfully standing up and saying this is wrong. And what's happening in response? Joe Biden's administration's looking at them and they're saying, you know what, you're domestic terrorists too."

      "utterance": "Unfortunately, it's really scary. So, listen, they look at children as the future because children are the future, right? So a government that wants to maintain itself, if they want to maintain this Marxist government, they need to guarantee that they can have your children. If you deny them access to your children, then they can't guarantee that they're going to be able to exist and sustain itself. So what's happening next -- and I keep telling people to pay attention what's happening internationally. What happened in France last year was that they banned homeschooling. They did it under the guise that, well, at home, there's radical threats, there's homegrown terrorists, we're dealing with all these Islamic terrorists, and the one way that we can prevent this is to guarantee that nobody's allowed to homeschool. So, now you are not allowed to homeschool your child. Imagine not being given the option as a parent, you birthed a human being, to not homeschool your child. Well, let me tell you, if that's them catching a sneeze, then America is about to catch a cold, OK? If France caught a sneeze, we're going to catch a cold. They're going to start saying that terror -- domestic terrorism is happening at home, and the only way to fight it, to go against these Trump supporters, these conservatives, is to guarantee that all children must be enrolled in the public schools. This is why I say to parents over and over and over again, the time is now. Remove your children from these indoctrination camps. They're not learning to be smart. They're not focused on hard academics. They are being brainwashed and systematically controlled. And what they want to produce, by the way, are failures, because it guarantees then that they will have children that grow up to be adults that are dependent on the government. And a totalitarian government that's focused on Marxist principles needs people that are dependent upon them. That is what is happening right now in this country."
