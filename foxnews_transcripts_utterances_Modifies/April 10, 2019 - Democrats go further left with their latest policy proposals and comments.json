Donald Trump with immigration.  So we're going 30 years, 40 years through this immigration period where both parties are screwing around, not sure what to do, and so he sinks his teeth into it like a pitbull and he will not let go.

Well, guess what, sister, the government will correct you on that and those charges that she is facing with the 20 years of pop, prosecutors use that as leverage all the time because of that penalty. And so, in a way if one believes that is public shaming then take it up with your legislators. Number two, that is why, bear with me for a sec, 97 percent of federal defendants plead out of those halves get sentences below the sentencing - the guidelines at all, just not even at the minimum. And of those 60 percent were recommended by the Feds. Meaning, if you play ball and you agree to a plea deal, you will get on average 26 months for fraud rather than 40 years.

In the wake of the opioid crackdown, the CDC had said that painkillers should be a last resort for patients. The result medical societies greatly reduced prescriptions Insurers refuse to cover them for patients with cancer or sickle cell anemia. And even when patients weren't denied coverage, they had to jump through more hoops than dolphins at SeaWorld. Now there is no denying, we've got an opioid problem. But to make it worse with broad strokes based on fear and misinformation. For one, the problem isn't prescription opioids, but street fentanyl. The addiction rate for prescriptions is low. The overdoses from street drugs are not. So, broadly targeting the prescription side only harms cancer patients as well as other people with chronic and acute pain. Meaning the lawful, not the lawless. As the media frames this as an epidemic, what you get is the same old one size crushes all reaction that smacks every fly with a hammer. If you're a conservative and disagree consider firearms should you punish lawful gun owners for the crimes of street gangs armed with illegal weapons. No, that would be a violation of your rights. So, why suspend that logic here. The problem with opioids is that they work. And the worst thing you can do is let the government transfer business to the drug dealer who is more than happy to oblige. So, Dana, the good news here is that the CDC is actually kind of changing their story and saying, now you can prescribe them for certain things are kind of loosening the reigns.",

Instead, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is attacking Republicans and saying she knows what's really causing the crisis. You're ready? The far right loves to drum up fear and resistance to immigrants, but have you ever noticed they never talk about what's causing people to flee their homes in the first place. Perhaps, that's because they'll be forced to confront one major factor fueling global migration, climate change. AOC's climate hysteria didn't end there. She also said this."

And so that way you had people sort of in the middle here. You had people that didn't quite make enough money to -- made too much money to be on Medicaid, but not quite enough to qualify for this or that plan and it has been very confusing and people are frustrated. Now they've worked out some kinks a little bit, so it's a little bit more popular now than it was in years past. But what Bernie is saying is just let's do away with it. Let's just do it.

They're actually fleeing the ideas that belong to AOC and Bernie, and they come here, this horrible capitalist society that has crated more wealth and prosperity in the history of the world. And by the way, Sanders is a millionaire, so even socialists who hate the system can get rich in the system. And there should be a TV show, I was thinking about this called Beverly Gills Socialist. I think would be very good. But I have to say this, we live in a world where if you don't address an issue, that vacuum will be filled by someone else. Who proved that? Donald Trump with immigration. So we're going 30 years, 40 years through this immigration period where both parties are screwing around, not sure what to do, and so he sinks his teeth into it like a pitbull and he will not let go. I guarantee you this thing is going to be going on until the very end. So you may -- as a Republican, conservative, or libertarian, may not think that climate change or health care is a huge problem. But if you ignore it at your own peril -- I can never tell -- sure where to put the accent. And you forfeit --"

We've talked about -- you know, there is -- there are people on the left and the right, the Stewart Brand of the world and the Bill Gates of the world who believe that you can solve climate change with generation 4 advanced nuclear reactors. This is not your old man's nuclear power. This can eliminate meltdown risk and also it feeds off the nuclear waste as an energy source.

And health care is pretty big because everyone is saying, oh, well, Bernie's plan is going to cost a lot. Actually, Bernie's plan will cost the government and potentially us as taxpayers more, but it will cut down on your medical bills. So it's very appealing.

Then you give them control of both, nothing happens. Democrats step into the void, as you described it, and Democrats are saying we're going to come up with something, we're working on something we care about.

Now the cost for this when we say that it transfers from a patient to the federal government, that is us, and our debt grows by 2 billion a day, and the interest alone annually will soon become a trillion. So these nebulous vague ideas with absolutely no specificity, we're the ones that eventually absorb the cost. And it is brutally bipartisan, you guys. It is both sides of the aisle, this debt situation facing us. So when those on the left are calling for sustainability, to me, the biggest fractured system is what is in existence. And the people who have the power to change it are those sitting in legislature right now. There are some Medicare contracts where labs -- the cost of the stamp to build the patient for what is left on that Medicare contract exceeds what they would recoup. And if they fail to send the bill, if they say it's not worth it because that's good business practice, that's Medicare fraud. So to me, that's what needs to be --"

We love a good fall, but we love even better the resurrection. But Lori Loughlin strolled in there, and that article that came out today that said she didn't believe she could face jail time. Well, guess what, sister, the government will correct you on that and those charges that she is facing with the 20 years of pop, prosecutors use that as leverage all the time because of that penalty. And so, in a way if one believes that is public shaming then take it up with your legislators. Number two, that is why, bear with me for a sec, 97 percent of federal defendants plead out of those halves get sentences below the sentencing - the guidelines at all, just not even at the minimum. And of those 60 percent were recommended by the Feds. Meaning, if you play ball and you agree to a plea deal, you will get on average 26 months for fraud rather than 40 years.

In the wake of the opioid crackdown, the CDC had said that painkillers should be a last resort for patients. The result medical societies greatly reduced prescriptions Insurers refuse to cover them for patients with cancer or sickle cell anemia. And even when patients weren't denied coverage, they had to jump through more hoops than dolphins at SeaWorld. Now there is no denying, we've got an opioid problem. But to make it worse with broad strokes based on fear and misinformation. For one, the problem isn't prescription opioids, but street fentanyl. The addiction rate for prescriptions is low. The overdoses from street drugs are not. So, broadly targeting the prescription side only harms cancer patients as well as other people with chronic and acute pain. Meaning the lawful, not the lawless. As the media frames this as an epidemic, what you get is the same old one size crushes all reaction that smacks every fly with a hammer. If you're a conservative and disagree consider firearms should you punish lawful gun owners for the crimes of street gangs armed with illegal weapons. No, that would be a violation of your rights. So, why suspend that logic here. The problem with opioids is that they work. And the worst thing you can do is let the government transfer business to the drug dealer who is more than happy to oblige. So, Dana, the good news here is that the CDC is actually kind of changing their story and saying, now you can prescribe them for certain things are kind of loosening the reigns."

The same cases is happening here with opioids. People end up with street drugs and they die. So, isn't it better to have prescriptions where they could be modulated and moderated?"

Also, I want viewers to understand that right now we're seeing a rash of lawsuits and that have come to conclusion that have included quite a large amount of settlements that big pharmas are making. And for example, I just want to use Oklahoma for a second as a case study for viewers to understand. In this $270 million settlement, all of that money is going - it's private money obviously from these drug makers who did not admit liability, but they agreed to settle, it's going to state institutions and that's all staying within the state of Oklahoma. And so, who do you think however is going to fund this after that initial $270 million goes toward establishing the National Center for Drug Addiction and Treatment and providing those medicines. The taxpayers will assume that debt afterwards obviously and as you guys, I'm sure remember after the Big Tobacco fiasco in the late 90's, there was a huge or the debacle was what happened with the money mismanagement after with those millions of dollars of payments and settlements played out. So, I just want that everyone should keep track and note what is occurring with these settlements and what happens and who carries the bill moving forward."

I think the pharmaceutical companies pushed opioids, legal opioids at a very high rate into some communities, especially poor communities with tragic consequences. And when we hear about settlements even if they don't admit liability, I think there is a reason for the settlement. They know that they could get hit even harder. So, for my money I think you know what. We've had pain management before we had opioids. There are other ways to deal with pain. But I think if we could pull back and say, you know what, people should have total access to opioids through the doctor. We don't understand the doctors in fact were part of the problem.

So, if you are upset with me or your husband or somebody and you say, I'm going to send him a text, it's like I can't tell your face, I don't know the nuance. I don't know how serious this is.
