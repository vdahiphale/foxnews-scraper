      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Tonight, it was like a bad but still semi-amusing comedy film come to life. Federal authorities taking a quick break from chasing after Russian Facebook trolls have exposed a very large nationwide effort by actors, lawyers, private equity moguls, to game the college admissions process, to cheat. And it worked. Suddenly, unimpressive students became geniuses, totally uncoordinated video game players became crew captains or legendary poll vaulters. Some people even fabricated new racial identities to get into school. Amazing. Trace Gallagher has the details for us tonight -- Trace.",

      "sentences": "Tucker, late today, a Federal judge here in Los Angeles agreed to release actress Lori Loughlin on a $1 million bond. She and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli are charged with paying $500,000.00 to have their two daughters recruited for the University of Southern California crew team, despite neither girl knowing how to row.  And now, USC says all applicants connected to this cheating scheme will be denied, and those already in school will be reviewed, meaning that Loughlin's 19-year-old daughter Olivia Jade, a YouTube star, could be kicked out of SC.  Meantime, the hammer is also coming down on coaches and athletic departments. The charity foundation of Rick Singer, the ringleader of the whole scam, who already pleaded guilty, shows payments of $338,000.00 to the NYU Athletic Department and $546,000.00 to the University of Texas Athletic Department. There's also a $100,000.00 contribution to a mysterious Princeville Enterprise, which coincidently shares the same address as UCLA's former soccer coach. So far, coaches and other athletic personnel have now been fired or suspended at USC, Stanford, Wake Forest, University of Texas, Georgetown, Yale, and UCLA. In other words, this scheme was a pay to not play.  Finally, the people who cheated to inflate SAT and ACT test scores are also being rounded up -- Tucker.",

The Liberal Arts curriculum in America has become a grotesque joke. Even the people who make a living from it know that very well.  Humanities professors may be the single most cynical people in this country. The Sociology of Miley Cyrus, Critical Text and White Privilege, Women's Studies. They are mocking us. They've got to be. This is pop art, not education. Nobody is pretending otherwise anymore.  Yet, even as academia descends deeper into absurdity and irrelevance, college degrees have become more valuable than ever. In modern America, only a small percentage of the population succeeds in the end, and the pathway to that success, to the world you read about on the internet, runs through a relatively small number of elite universities. A ruling class claims legitimacy based on the fact that they have degrees from those places. It's all completely fair, they tell us. They are in charge because they won the great meritocratic competition and got into Yale. You are not in charge because you didn't.  But of course, they are lying to you.

They get it for free. They are just awarded them for the achievement of being born. That's how Chelsea Clinton wound up at Stanford and Oxford and then a hedge fund at McKinsey and then on various boards of big companies and then making documentary films nobody ever watched -- all without having a single original thought ever in her life. Do you know that is? That's an aristocracy disguised as a meritocracy. It's a scam.   Too few have been punished for it. In this case only parents, athletic coaches, and a few university advisers have been indicted, no actual admissions officials have been named. As far as we know, none of the event been punished and that's a joke. They knew what was going on. They had to know.  What the rest of us don't know but should know is how the college admissions process actually works. What are the rules of it? What are the criteria? Who gets in and why? Those are the key questions in the whole chain, from birth to world domination. And yet, no one will reveal what the recipe is. Like all systems built on secrecy and deceit, it's opaque. It should not be opaque. We pay for all of this -- all of higher education -- directly through tuition and then indirectly, billions in tax dollars, direct or in Federally-backed student loans. We have a right to know. So open the doors. Bring in the sunlight. Let's see their books. College is too important to be this corrupt.  Bradley Campbell is a sociologist, coauthor of the book \"The Rise of Victimhood Culture,\" and he joins us now. Bradley, thanks very much for coming on.

But my first reaction is just as a professor, and also as someone who did not go to an elite college myself. I don't teach at an elite college now. I teach at Cal State Los Angeles. And if you look at elite colleges, Ivy League universities, we find the children of elites and wealthy people are already very overrepresented.  There are 38 colleges, including five of the Ivy Leagues where there are more students from families of the top 1% of income than the bottom 60%. So that's the disparities you're talking about. And then you have my students -- the students I teach at Cal State Los Angeles aren't from anywhere close to the top 1% of income, and they work hard. Many of them are trying to raise families while they are pursuing their education, working jobs and all of these things, and so it's on a personal level to see that and it's just outrageous to think of people who are gaming the system and getting ahead of people who are trying to work.   College is still a pathway to success for many people and it's a very hard one for many people who have all kinds of other responsibilities and things going on. And so this is far --",

That's why you have such competition with the people, and the efforts to cheat.   I think of it in this way. There are always people who are out there trying to cheat, trying to game the system who will do things like this, but what does it reveal when it happens about, you know, the system? How are people getting ahead? And I think there's a tiny bit of good news and that some of it is paying people to take tests and things, so test scores and those kind of things do matter somewhat. If we are thinking about, is there a meritocracy? There is not completely, but it's not -- that merit has nothing to do with people getting in. But at the same time, you see these other things. You see sports being so important where people are paying to get on rosters of soccer teams and these things. You see all of sees other factors that are important and even when people aren't cheating, it's the rich and wealthy people who have advantages there. They can pay for their children's extracurricular activities.

The very fact that we are exempting these children from the opportunity to be agents of their own uplift and as a consequence people -- places like Palo Alto have a suicide rate that is six times the national average among teenagers. There are people in that community who are wearing safety vests at railroad crossings because of a high number of teenagers that feel distress of meeting expectations.

      "sentences": "It's the most ridiculous proposal that I've ever heard. First of all, it's important to deconstruct it a little bit. Reparations, the question is who pays and who gets paid? People don't realize that slavery, there were blacks who owned slaves as well. There were 3,700 blacks that owned 12,000 slaves, and that's three tribes, the Chickasaw tribes, the Creek Indians. They owned 3,500 slaves, so the question for me and for the audience should be, well, who pays? Do the sons and daughters of those blacks and Native Americans that owned slaves, do they pay? And so, it's a little more complicated than people are making. What about the whites who came here after slavery? What about the hundreds of thousands who died fighting in the Civil War who never owned slaves? And so I just think that we ought to take this into consideration when we are talking about slavery. It's also providing exemption from personal responsibility. All the problems that black America has, for someone to say that the answers to those challenges are external. Let's just say we accept the premise that reparations should be paid. What problem does it solve? If whites paid blacks money on Monday and we come back two weeks later, what would be the impact on black-on-black crime? What would be the impact of drug addiction? About the high dropout rate? And so I just think it's lethal for us to just talk about a simplistic remedy so we can do virtue signaling on the issue of race and appear to be champions. What we have done at the Woodson Center is we believe you should look into black America's past and find out how our ancestors achieved against the odds where there was racial inequality and income disparity.  We built hospitals. We built schools. We had solid families. And so it is important for us to look back, but also to look at what are our strengths. And frankly, Tucker, I'm going to say I think black America needs to abandon complaining about what happened in the past and begin to address the enemy within -- that's the challenge we face today and we won't do that as long as we are looking to the people we say who are enemies to be our liberators, it's just ridiculous.",

So we decided to do an exhaustive fact-check of both what she said and also our interpretation of what we thought she was trying to say. I mean, she is talking about the caging of children, and as we look through it -- I mean, he looked befuddled and rightly so. There was one company that Wells Fargo was involved with and they provided financing to this company which built one detention center under President Obama. And they sent us so many photos of it. It has no cages and it's much nicer than any school my child has ever attended or a summer camp. I mean, from what we saw, it's lovely, but there's definitely no children that are separated in any way from their families at this location which I'm guessing was her point, but they also built a facility under President Obama and it looked rather nice. So the premise of her question was a \"Gotcha\" that seemed to have no connection to anything that you said that Wells Fargo has done that hasn't been great in the past. This just wasn't one of them. And on the pipeline question, I mean, she's going down this road and she names a pipeline that doesn't exist, so you give her the benefit of the doubt and he kind of pivots to one that does exist that they did help finance along with a bunch of other banks. And the premise is sort of like, if you provided finance to a builder, if then the operator down the line does something bad, you are responsible. That's like saying if I kill someone in my house, you should go put in jail the mortgage broker at the bank that they gave me the loan. I mean, it's so many degrees of separation it just seems like there was enough to pick on. Why are you pivoting to your issues and sort of beating this guy?",

It's already down, but more importantly, and I think President Trump did the appropriate thing erring on the side of caution when human life is at stake. If it's what I believe and people in the industry tell me and contacts and sources inside the FAA tell me, it's what I stated before, it's a software and training issue, an information issue that hopefully -- well, it's way too early to determine probable cause for any accident, will hopefully prevent this from happening in the future. I think the key, Tucker, is how long does the grounding occur and how proactive is the FAA and Boeing to getting a fix in place in getting these pilots trained. There is approximately -- Southwest, I think has approximately 38 airplanes, this series of airplanes have been grounded. American has the next largest number and United, approximately 250 to 280 flights a day. While, it's certainly is not good and it's going to affect the bottom line revenue of each one of these airlines negatively. Don't get me wrong. It's not a great thing.

Now hundreds of scientists have just warned that wireless headphones could increase people's cancer risk by exposing the human body to unsafe levels of radiation. Keep in mind, very little is known about this because there hasn't been a ton of testing believe it or not. Is it worth being afraid? Dr. Marc Siegel is are Fox News medical correspondent in the first person we asked around questions like this and he joins us today.

The National Institute of Health last year looked at rats and mice and found out that rats with prolonged exposure have increased risks of hard cancer, of certain brain cancers with prolonged exposure. But that's what our kids are getting, right? Prolonged exposure. We don't have it yet in humans, but we are talking about rays that are like microwaves. They are radio frequency waves are like microwaves and with Bluetooth headsets, you're beaming it across your brain. So your chances of prolonged used causing an increased cancer risk when you're disrupting the cells of your brain, the calcium channels in your brain, I think that that has to be carefully looked at and I don't think that the scientists, 250 scientists over 40 countries are way out on this. That's just one issue that they are changing the cells. That's one issue. Another issue is of course ADHD is on the increase -- attention deficit disorder among people that use these headsets. And a study out of Brazil shows that you're more likely to have ringing in the ears of you use these headsets. My kids, I can't even get them to answer me, Tucker.

And again, we are only just starting with the rats, but the reason you're seeing this outcry is because of the studies in animals, male rats by the way only, females were okay. I don't know why that is. But we certainly have to see more and more research on this. And again, there's reasons like depression, anxiety that occurs from prolonged use, cutting off contact, lack of communication with your friends, with your parents, with your peers, with your teachers. I'm not for this, and I don't think it's harmless. There's no evidence that low intensity radiation, radiofrequency waves like this actually disrupts cells the way that ultraviolet light does.

Cringing hipster sensitivity burnished with low grade academic buzzwords. Pretty banal stuff, but Hayes always seemed like a decent guy personally. He didn't seem like a hater. It was hard to imagine him promoting open racism or anti-Semitism or at least, it was hard to imagine until the other night. That's when Hayes invited a man called Angelo Carusone on to his show. Carusone runs Media Matters, almost every day, he issues outrage press releases accusing other people of bigotry and yet because everything is irony, Carusone is himself an enthusiastic bigot. We know this for sure because he has written about it extensively. It turns out that for years, Carusone maintained a racist blog, one post entitled quote, \"Tr*nny Paradise\" addressed a crime story from Thailand. A Bangladeshi man had been robbed and assaulted by a group of male prostitutes dressed as women. Carusone objected to the idea that this was a story and ridiculed South Asians as inherently ugly and poor. Quote, \"Is the writer a tr*nny lover, too? Or perhaps he's just trying to justify how these tr*nnies tricked this Bangladeshi in the first place. Look, man, we don't need to know whether or not they were attractive. The f-ing guy was Bangladeshi. What the hell was he doing with $7,300.00 with of stuff? The guy is Bangladeshi.\" End quote. In another post, Carusone described how a male coach at a Japanese high school had sexually abused female players. People in japan were horrified by this, understandably. Carusone was not. His advice quote, \"Lighten up, J*ps.\" Later than month, Carusone, by now in a frenzy of racism heaped praise on a former Ku Klux Klan leader. And still another post from the same period, Carusone described a Jewish man as being handsome quote, \"despite his jewelry.\" Carusone didn't like the man's political views, but attributed them to quote, \"his possession of several bags of Jewish gold.\" End quote. Jewish gold. According to Angelo Carusone, Jewish gold is a problem. Media Matters probably ought to issue a press release about this. They've done a lot more for a lot less and yet, somehow, this is the remarkable part -- Chris Hayes managed to pretend that none of this ever happened. Hayes never mentioned the Jewish gold. He never said a word about the Japs or the trannies or the Klan or even those dirty Bangladeshis who deserve what they get no matter what the trannie lovers say. None of that. Instead, Hayes gave cover to Carusone's bigotry and anti-Semitism. Amazingly, he even directed his viewers to Carusone's website.",

And now, USC says all applicants connected to this cheating scheme will be denied, and those already in school will be reviewed, meaning that Loughlin's 19-year-old daughter Olivia Jade, a YouTube star, could be kicked out of SC. Meantime, the hammer is also coming down on coaches and athletic departments. The charity foundation of Rick Singer, the ringleader of the whole scam, who already pleaded guilty, shows payments of $338,000.00 to the NYU Athletic Department and $546,000.00 to the University of Texas Athletic Department. There's also a $100,000.00 contribution to a mysterious Princeville Enterprise, which coincidently shares the same address as UCLA's former soccer coach. So far, coaches and other athletic personnel have now been fired or suspended at USC, Stanford, Wake Forest, University of Texas, Georgetown, Yale, and UCLA.

This is pop art, not education. Nobody is pretending otherwise anymore. Yet, even as academia descends deeper into absurdity and irrelevance, college degrees have become more valuable than ever. In modern America, only a small percentage of the population succeeds in the end, and the pathway to that success, to the world you read about on the internet, runs through a relatively small number of elite universities. A ruling class claims legitimacy based on the fact that they have degrees from those places. It's all completely fair, they tell us.

That's how Chelsea Clinton wound up at Stanford and Oxford and then a hedge fund at McKinsey and then on various boards of big companies and then making documentary films nobody ever watched -- all without having a single original thought ever in her life. Do you know that is? That's an aristocracy disguised as a meritocracy. It's a scam. Too few have been punished for it. In this case only parents, athletic coaches, and a few university advisers have been indicted, no actual admissions officials have been named. As far as we know, none of the event been punished and that's a joke. They knew what was going on. They had to know.

But my first reaction is just as a professor, and also as someone who did not go to an elite college myself. I don't teach at an elite college now. I teach at Cal State Los Angeles. And if you look at elite colleges, Ivy League universities, we find the children of elites and wealthy people are already very overrepresented. There are 38 colleges, including five of the Ivy Leagues where there are more students from families of the top 1% of income than the bottom 60%. So that's the disparities you're talking about. And then you have my students -- the students I teach at Cal State Los Angeles aren't from anywhere close to the top 1% of income, and they work hard. Many of them are trying to raise families while they are pursuing their education, working jobs and all of these things, and so it's on a personal level to see that and it's just outrageous to think of people who are gaming the system and getting ahead of people who are trying to work. College is still a pathway to success for many people and it's a very hard one for many people who have all kinds of other responsibilities and things going on. And so this is far --"

That's why you have such competition with the people, and the efforts to cheat. I think of it in this way. There are always people who are out there trying to cheat, trying to game the system who will do things like this, but what does it reveal when it happens about, you know, the system? How are people getting ahead? And I think there's a tiny bit of good news and that some of it is paying people to take tests and things, so test scores and those kind of things do matter somewhat. If we are thinking about, is there a meritocracy? There is not completely, but it's not -- that merit has nothing to do with people getting in. But at the same time, you see these other things. You see sports being so important where people are paying to get on rosters of soccer teams and these things. You see all of sees other factors that are important and even when people aren't cheating, it's the rich and wealthy people who have advantages there. They can pay for their children's extracurricular activities. They have the time to do it and they can pay for their personal statements and all of these other things that matter in college admissions."

One of the most important books that I've read about this and I commend to your viewers is Richard Watson's book, \"Fables in Fortune: What Rich People Have That You Don't Want.\" And the sequel to that is \"Entitlemania.\" Where he talks about the entitlement mentality. The very fact that we are exempting these children from the opportunity to be agents of their own uplift and as a consequence people -- places like Palo Alto have a suicide rate that is six times the national average among teenagers. There are people in that community who are wearing safety vests at railroad crossings because of a high number of teenagers that feel distress of meeting expectations. So I think it's worse than that. This old entitlement mentality that also exists among low income blacks where the highest death rate is from homicide because reparations is the moral equivalent of what these parents are doing among blacks when we are creating false -- you know ..."

      "utterance": "It's the most ridiculous proposal that I've ever heard. First of all, it's important to deconstruct it a little bit. Reparations, the question is who pays and who gets paid? People don't realize that slavery, there were blacks who owned slaves as well. There were 3,700 blacks that owned 12,000 slaves, and that's three tribes, the Chickasaw tribes, the Creek Indians. They owned 3,500 slaves, so the question for me and for the audience should be, well, who pays? Do the sons and daughters of those blacks and Native Americans that owned slaves, do they pay? And so, it's a little more complicated than people are making. What about the whites who came here after slavery? What about the hundreds of thousands who died fighting in the Civil War who never owned slaves? And so I just think that we ought to take this into consideration when we are talking about slavery. It's also providing exemption from personal responsibility. All the problems that black America has, for someone to say that the answers to those challenges are external. Let's just say we accept the premise that reparations should be paid. What problem does it solve? If whites paid blacks money on Monday and we come back two weeks later, what would be the impact on black-on-black crime? What would be the impact of drug addiction? About the high dropout rate? And so I just think it's lethal for us to just talk about a simplistic remedy so we can do virtue signaling on the issue of race and appear to be champions. What we have done at the Woodson Center is we believe you should look into black America's past and find out how our ancestors achieved against the odds where there was racial inequality and income disparity. We built hospitals. We built schools. We had solid families. And so it is important for us to look back, but also to look at what are our strengths. And frankly, Tucker, I'm going to say I think black America needs to abandon complaining about what happened in the past and begin to address the enemy within -- that's the challenge we face today and we won't do that as long as we are looking to the people we say who are enemies to be our liberators, it's just ridiculous."

Something that basically nobody in Washington does. Did you begin to wonder maybe if this was a selective prosecution? MICHAEL CAPUTO, FORMER ADVISER TO TRUMP CAMPAIGN 2016: Wow. Yes, I guess so. I mean, Tucker, nobody knows more than you that the left views absolute annihilation as victory. They will stop at nothing to achieve it. They will try to get you fired, try and silence you or they will try, like in my family, try and ruin your family or even throw your dad in jail.

Each time, they are the same questions. Each time it cost me half a year's salary, and here we go again just for my family was waiting to press play on our lives, right? I've got nothing left. They've taken my business. They have punch the living crap out of my family. I've got nothing left.

I watch this and this is -- so this is the newest game of \"Gotcha.\" You drag someone out for a beating and then you beat them about things that may or may not be related to their business at all. So we decided to do an exhaustive fact-check of both what she said and also our interpretation of what we thought she was trying to say. I mean, she is talking about the caging of children, and as we look through it -- I mean, he looked befuddled and rightly so. There was one company that Wells Fargo was involved with and they provided financing to this company which built one detention center under President Obama. And they sent us so many photos of it. It has no cages and it's much nicer than any school my child has ever attended or a summer camp. I mean, from what we saw, it's lovely, but there's definitely no children that are separated in any way from their families at this location which I'm guessing was her point, but they also built a facility under President Obama and it looked rather nice. So the premise of her question was a \"Gotcha\" that seemed to have no connection to anything that you said that Wells Fargo has done that hasn't been great in the past. This just wasn't one of them. And on the pipeline question, I mean, she's going down this road and she names a pipeline that doesn't exist, so you give her the benefit of the doubt and he kind of pivots to one that does exist that they did help finance along with a bunch of other banks. And the premise is sort of like, if you provided finance to a builder, if then the operator down the line does something bad, you are responsible. That's like saying if I kill someone in my house, you should go put in jail the mortgage broker at the bank that they gave me the loan. I mean, it's so many degrees of separation it just seems like there was enough to pick on. Why are you pivoting to your issues and sort of beating this guy?"

It's been the most used and has the highest number of miles flown aircraft for decades in its various generations. I do believe there's an issue likely in the software side that will be fixed. And more importantly, taught to the pilots and the aircrews. I think what happened has been unfortunate. I do believe the 737, including the MAX series, the 8s and 9s are a safe aircraft.

      "utterance": "Actually, I think President Trump took the appropriate action in grounding. The key is how long the grounding is for. Boeing has already gotten a negative press for these series of events, so I'm not sure how much more of an effect it's going to be on the stock price. It's already down, but more importantly, and I think President Trump did the appropriate thing erring on the side of caution when human life is at stake. If it's what I believe and people in the industry tell me and contacts and sources inside the FAA tell me, it's what I stated before, it's a software and training issue, an information issue that hopefully -- well, it's way too early to determine probable cause for any accident, will hopefully prevent this from happening in the future. I think the key, Tucker, is how long does the grounding occur and how proactive is the FAA and Boeing to getting a fix in place in getting these pilots trained. There is approximately -- Southwest, I think has approximately 38 airplanes, this series of airplanes have been grounded. American has the next largest number and United, approximately 250 to 280 flights a day. While, it's certainly is not good and it's going to affect the bottom line revenue of each one of these airlines negatively. Don't get me wrong. It's not a great thing. And it will certainly impact people across the country that fly, two, three, four, five-day grounding period and rescheduling of aircrews and the flying public I think is a small price to pay to prevent another horrible incident from occurring."

      "utterance": "Thank you. Jetliners are not the only danger that could be lurking in daily life. Wireless communications are everywhere and in the form of cellphones and Bluetooth headphones. They are often right against your own brain. Now hundreds of scientists have just warned that wireless headphones could increase people's cancer risk by exposing the human body to unsafe levels of radiation. Keep in mind, very little is known about this because there hasn't been a ton of testing believe it or not. Is it worth being afraid? Dr. Marc Siegel is are Fox News medical correspondent in the first person we asked around questions like this and he joins us today. So, doctor, I guess the first thing to note in a story read this morning, it's not really known what the effect if, for example the Bluetooth in the ear, headphones from Apple might have on the brain."

      "speaker": "MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Not yet, Tucker. But we are getting there. The National Institute of Health last year looked at rats and mice and found out that rats with prolonged exposure have increased risks of hard cancer, of certain brain cancers with prolonged exposure. But that's what our kids are getting, right? Prolonged exposure. We don't have it yet in humans, but we are talking about rays that are like microwaves. They are radio frequency waves are like microwaves and with Bluetooth headsets, you're beaming it across your brain. So your chances of prolonged used causing an increased cancer risk when you're disrupting the cells of your brain, the calcium channels in your brain, I think that that has to be carefully looked at and I don't think that the scientists, 250 scientists over 40 countries are way out on this. That's just one issue that they are changing the cells. That's one issue. Another issue is of course ADHD is on the increase -- attention deficit disorder among people that use these headsets. And a study out of Brazil shows that you're more likely to have ringing in the ears of you use these headsets. My kids, I can't even get them to answer me, Tucker. I don't know about yours, but they don't even answer me and now I find out that there are health risks."

      "utterance": "Great point, Tucker and the answer is we have always known that it's the distance from the head that matters the most, how far away. That's what they always said. Cell phone users, just keep it away from your head. But now it's on your head. So we don't know because nobody has done long-term studies in humans yet. And again, we are only just starting with the rats, but the reason you're seeing this outcry is because of the studies in animals, male rats by the way only, females were okay. I don't know why that is. But we certainly have to see more and more research on this. And again, there's reasons like depression, anxiety that occurs from prolonged use, cutting off contact, lack of communication with your friends, with your parents, with your peers, with your teachers. I'm not for this, and I don't think it's harmless. There's no evidence that low intensity radiation, radiofrequency waves like this actually disrupts cells the way that ultraviolet light does. It's not up at that level, but again prolonged use. Three hundred and fifty million headsets were sold last year -- 350 million. We've got to study this more. I'm a little concerned about it."

      "utterance": "Chris Hayes is an anchor over on MSNBC, the one with the glasses. His political views aren't very interesting. Cringing hipster sensitivity burnished with low grade academic buzzwords. Pretty banal stuff, but Hayes always seemed like a decent guy personally. He didn't seem like a hater. It was hard to imagine him promoting open racism or anti-Semitism or at least, it was hard to imagine until the other night. That's when Hayes invited a man called Angelo Carusone on to his show. Carusone runs Media Matters, almost every day, he issues outrage press releases accusing other people of bigotry and yet because everything is irony, Carusone is himself an enthusiastic bigot. We know this for sure because he has written about it extensively. It turns out that for years, Carusone maintained a racist blog, one post entitled quote, \"Tr*nny Paradise\" addressed a crime story from Thailand. A Bangladeshi man had been robbed and assaulted by a group of male prostitutes dressed as women. Carusone objected to the idea that this was a story and ridiculed South Asians as inherently ugly and poor. Quote, \"Is the writer a tr*nny lover, too? Or perhaps he's just trying to justify how these tr*nnies tricked this Bangladeshi in the first place. Look, man, we don't need to know whether or not they were attractive. The f-ing guy was Bangladeshi. What the hell was he doing with $7,300.00 with of stuff? The guy is Bangladeshi.\" End quote. In another post, Carusone described how a male coach at a Japanese high school had sexually abused female players. People in japan were horrified by this, understandably. Carusone was not. His advice quote, \"Lighten up, J*ps.\" Later than month, Carusone, by now in a frenzy of racism heaped praise on a former Ku Klux Klan leader. And still another post from the same period, Carusone described a Jewish man as being handsome quote, \"despite his jewelry.\" Carusone didn't like the man's political views, but attributed them to quote, \"his possession of several bags of Jewish gold.\" End quote. Jewish gold. According to Angelo Carusone, Jewish gold is a problem. Media Matters probably ought to issue a press release about this. They've done a lot more for a lot less and yet, somehow, this is the remarkable part -- Chris Hayes managed to pretend that none of this ever happened. Hayes never mentioned the Jewish gold. He never said a word about the Japs or the trannies or the Klan or even those dirty Bangladeshis who deserve what they get no matter what the trannie lovers say. None of that. Instead, Hayes gave cover to Carusone's bigotry and anti-Semitism. Amazingly, he even directed his viewers to Carusone's website."

      "utterance": "Pretty amazing. If a guy with a history of ranting about Jewish gold came on your show, would you ask him about it? Would you challenge him on it? How would you not? You would feel morally obligated, but Chris Hayes didn't. That tells you a lot. Now, to be clear, we are not calling for either of these people to be imprisoned or executed or even fired from their high-paying jobs. We are not planning to organize an advertiser boycott against them. We won't picket their offices with bullhorns. We won't attack their children. But we do think you should know what they are actually like and in Chris Hayes' case, it's kind of depressing to find out. It turns out you really never know who people are. Joe Concha writes about media for \"The Hill\" and he joins us tonight. So Joe, if you went on someone's show to talk about how someone had said naughty things 15 years ago, but you had kept a blog, in which you used the kind of stereotypes and racial attacks that this guy had and referred to Jewish gold and the Japs. Wouldn't at some point, you think, \"This was too hypocritical, I can't do this?\""

      "utterance": "I would think that would happen. If I knew that the interviewer would challenge me on those things and apparently Angelo Carusone knew that probably in advance that wouldn't happen and with Chris Hayes's case, it's a classic case of pushing a narrative by engaging in the worst kind of bias, the bias of omission. A disservice completely to MSNBC viewers for not showing it, and by the way, \"The Hill\" has reached out to the MEDIA MATTERS president for comment, as have many other news organizations and he's isn't talking. But then again, Tucker, you have to feel sorry for him. I mean, how would you feel if somebody went back into your past and talked about the things that you said 10 or 15 years ago and then demanded that you get taken off the air? I mean, you've got to feel sorry for the guy."

His dumb opinions interest me, not at all. So I'm not in any way suggesting that he or anybody else should be punished for what he wrote on some dumb blog 15 years ago.

He came up with this phenomenal phrase, it's called \"A fenced archaeology,\" and he says, \"Go to any space conservative social justice, you know what you'll find? Endless surveillance. Everyone is to be judged and everyone is under suspicion.\" He goes on to say that, \"That's what liberalism is now. The search for bad, he is doing bad things like little offense archaeologist.\" Great saying. \"Digging deeper and deeper and deeper to find out who is good and who is bad.\" Nobody likes this, Tucker on the left or the right.

      "utterance": "Of course. Look, we all have done bad things and we could all go back and find something that's bad. The bottom line is what Media Matters say, they have no leg to stand on here because when MSNBC's Joy Reid made homophobic anti-Semitic comments, they said it didn't meet the threshold for them to call for boycotts of her, and now obviously that's what's happening with you and meanwhile, you made some of your statement while you were at MSNBC.
