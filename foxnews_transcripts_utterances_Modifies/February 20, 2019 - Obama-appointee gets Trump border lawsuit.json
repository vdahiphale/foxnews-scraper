A remarkable yet, I don't know, it's a totally predictable turn of events in the Jussie Smollett case. The Empire actor now officially indicted on a felony charge for filing a false police report. A live update from the ground and shocking new video from Chicago just moments away. Also, tonight, less than a week after Trump's new AG was confirmed, reports that Mueller's investigation could be coming to an end next week. Wow, we have exclusive reaction there. Plus, what did John Wayne and Barack Obama have in common? They're both part of a campaign as seen and unseen with Raymond Arroyo But we begin with the breaking news alert out of Chicago, the Cook County State's Attorney has just filed a felony charge against Smollett with felony disorderly conduct. That's what it's called for filing a false police report. Mike Tobin joining us now from outside Chicago PD with all the details. Mike?",

And I thought we weren't supposed to impose our morality on others when it came to issues like life or marriage, but when a liberal can't claims moral superiority, all the rules change. Now consider the situation on campuses today. Free thought and free speech have been marginalized or altogether obliterated and they're marginalized or obliterated in favor of forced adherence to the ever-changing leftist credo. A credo where Marxism trumps the free market and trigger warnings beat down free thought.   The Young Americas Foundation just released a study of courses that are being offered at some Ivy League colleges. A few of these are real howlers. Check them out, last semester at Columbia, you could have taken a class called fascism, aesthetics and politics. The election of President Donald Trump has renewed interest in the examination of fascism as an ideology, as a political movement and as a form of governance. Last fall at Cornell, students took histories of the apocalypse from Nostradamus to nuclear winter. Brexit. Immigration and the election of Donald Trump have all been recently heralded as signs of an imminent apocalypse, very understated. And then at Harvard, why not pay $70,000 a year in tuition to study, \"journalism\" in the age of Trump. President Trump's declared war on fake news, his attacks on the press as enemies of the people as well as secular changes in technology and the ways in which the news is produced and delivered have combined to undermine the very notion of truth.  The political indoctrination is one aspect of what universities are doing to mess with young minds. But there is a lot more. Parents also pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in total for their kids to marinate in an entitled - It's kind of a pseudo intellectual grievance culture. Professors and administrators have founded their own type of religion whose adherents are required to embrace manufactured anger and complete oppression.   Now consider the case of a small school called The Evergreen State College. Documentarian Mike Nana captured this rise of leftist authoritarianism in real time and he interviewed professors who could see the ideology of racism and white privilege suffocating free expression on campus. Now check this out. These are actual faculty members of Evergreen State College.",

Well, because as a conservative, Dinesh does not count. He doesn't buy into their oppression narrative, so he's just as guilty as a white unyoke lacrosse player who grew up in Greenwich, who goes to an Ivy League school.  And my friends, there is victimhood obsession of course has infected now society at large because they want us all to live on their college campus. Think about this Jussie Smollett case. Even when his wild allegations couldn't be substantiated, even after it appears that Smollett himself organized the attack, he initially blamed on MAGA hat wearing racists and even after he was charged with filing a false police report, in the eyes of these folks, none of it matters. He ultimately gets a pass in their eyes because the story fit the left's narrative, and he is morally right in their eyes even if kind of confused and sad regarding these current set of facts.  And regardless of facts, anyway Trump and his followers are according to them violent racists. And if you disagree with that, well you're a racist yourself. Playing by the university rulebook. Well, dissent is not allowed. And liberal victims fake or otherwise are entitled to mercy. 20th Century Fox issued a statement today reading Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional onset and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show. We'll see if that changes with the news tonight. I'm telling you, redemption is almost limitless when you are a liberal, I guess. The governor and lieutenant governor of Virginia know all about that. Roseanne though, wow, she's still waiting for her letter of apology. As parents, we have to use these examples to remind our children of what is expected of them. Teach them to respect themselves and of course their fellow man. To halt the spread of this victimhood menace, we have to teach kids to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. Because if you're a victim. You're going to need to be saved. And the left believes your savior is the government. I say, no thanks. I'll leave that to Jesus Christ. Thank you very much.  But we have all. Put this all aside for a moment. We have all been given gifts by the Almighty. A soul, a heart and mind capable of changing things for the better and making good choices out of our own freewill. And when you start to cling to victim Status, you're just giving away your power. You're letting others define you. We Americans are a lot better than that. And our kids deserve better than that what they're being fed on college campuses. So, let's expose the frauds and encourage more personal responsibility. And I bet we'll all be happier. And that's “The Angle.” All right. We want to get back to this breaking news on Jussie Smollett now and what do community leaders in Chicago think about their city being used as part of a hoax and this kind of fits into the victimhood mentality we've been talking about tonight. And where did the Chicago police go from here to help us answer those questions. We're joined from Chicago by Tio Hardiman. He's a CEO of Violence Interrupters and former LAPD detective and Fox News contributor Mark Fuhrman.   Tio, I want to start with you. Now you're saying that community leaders, most of them knew from the start that this was fake. So, why were so many national politicians, top leaders in the Democrat Party and celebrities fooled.",

That doesn't happen in Chicago and making a comment about a Chicago be Make America Great Again country that does not happen in Chicago. So, if Jussie you know stays the attack, he's dead wrong, because he's receiving all the attention and we just had a one-year old child, a toddler shot in here named Baby Chase. And he's not getting any attention. And we have a 14 to 16 percent homicide clearance rate. And if Jussie is guilty of the charges, he's dead because he's taking much needed attention from a serious problem in Chicago. INGRAHAM: Mark pick up on that for a moment. 24 police officers were apparently assigned to this Smollett case. 24 and as Tio said, we had a chance to meet Tio when we did our special In Chicago some months back.

She resents them, she hates them, she hates what they brainwashed her into becoming and she honestly is tremendously relieved now that she sees the light and is speaking out against them, I think in a sense it's very cathartic for her that she's finally lifted this burden off her shoulders.",

And I thought we weren't supposed to impose our morality on others when it came to issues like life or marriage, but when a liberal can't claims moral superiority, all the rules change. Now consider the situation on campuses today. Free thought and free speech have been marginalized or altogether obliterated and they're marginalized or obliterated in favor of forced adherence to the ever-changing leftist credo. A credo where Marxism trumps the free market and trigger warnings beat down free thought. The Young Americas Foundation just released a study of courses that are being offered at some Ivy League colleges. A few of these are real howlers. Check them out, last semester at Columbia, you could have taken a class called fascism, aesthetics and politics. The election of President Donald Trump has renewed interest in the examination of fascism as an ideology, as a political movement and as a form of governance. Last fall at Cornell, students took histories of the apocalypse from Nostradamus to nuclear winter. Brexit. Immigration and the election of Donald Trump have all been recently heralded as signs of an imminent apocalypse, very understated. And then at Harvard, why not pay $70,000 a year in tuition to study, \"journalism\" in the age of Trump. President Trump's declared war on fake news, his attacks on the press as enemies of the people as well as secular changes in technology and the ways in which the news is produced and delivered have combined to undermine the very notion of truth. The political indoctrination is one aspect of what universities are doing to mess with young minds. But there is a lot more. Parents also pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in total for their kids to marinate in an entitled - It's kind of a pseudo intellectual grievance culture. Professors and administrators have founded their own type of religion whose adherents are required to embrace manufactured anger and complete oppression. Now consider the case of a small school called The Evergreen State College. Documentarian Mike Nana captured this rise of leftist authoritarianism in real time and he interviewed professors who could see the ideology of racism and white privilege suffocating free expression on campus. Now check this out. These are actual faculty members of Evergreen State College."

Well, because as a conservative, Dinesh does not count. He doesn't buy into their oppression narrative, so he's just as guilty as a white unyoke lacrosse player who grew up in Greenwich, who goes to an Ivy League school. And my friends, there is victimhood obsession of course has infected now society at large because they want us all to live on their college campus. Think about this Jussie Smollett case. Even when his wild allegations couldn't be substantiated, even after it appears that Smollett himself organized the attack, he initially blamed on MAGA hat wearing racists and even after he was charged with filing a false police report, in the eyes of these folks, none of it matters. He ultimately gets a pass in their eyes because the story fit the left's narrative, and he is morally right in their eyes even if kind of confused and sad regarding these current set of facts. And regardless of facts, anyway Trump and his followers are according to them violent racists. And if you disagree with that, well you're a racist yourself. Playing by the university rulebook. Well, dissent is not allowed. And liberal victims fake or otherwise are entitled to mercy. 20th Century Fox issued a statement today reading Jussie Smollett continues to be a consummate professional onset and as we have previously stated, he is not being written out of the show. We'll see if that changes with the news tonight. I'm telling you, redemption is almost limitless when you are a liberal, I guess. The governor and lieutenant governor of Virginia know all about that. Roseanne though, wow, she's still waiting for her letter of apology. As parents, we have to use these examples to remind our children of what is expected of them. Teach them to respect themselves and of course their fellow man. To halt the spread of this victimhood menace, we have to teach kids to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. Because if you're a victim. You're going to need to be saved. And the left believes your savior is the government. I say, no thanks. I'll leave that to Jesus Christ. Thank you very much. But we have all. Put this all aside for a moment. We have all been given gifts by the Almighty. A soul, a heart and mind capable of changing things for the better and making good choices out of our own freewill. And when you start to cling to victim Status, you're just giving away your power. You're letting others define you. We Americans are a lot better than that. And our kids deserve better than that what they're being fed on college campuses. So, let's expose the frauds and encourage more personal responsibility. And I bet we'll all be happier. And that's “The Angle.” All right. We want to get back to this breaking news on Jussie Smollett now and what do community leaders in Chicago think about their city being used as part of a hoax and this kind of fits into the victimhood mentality we've been talking about tonight. And where did the Chicago police go from here to help us answer those questions. We're joined from Chicago by Tio Hardiman. He's a CEO of Violence Interrupters and former LAPD detective and Fox News contributor Mark Fuhrman. Tio, I want to start with you. Now you're saying that community leaders, most of them knew from the start that this was fake. So, why were so many national politicians, top leaders in the Democrat Party and celebrities fooled."

I wrote a post about it because nobody really - if you get beat up for real in Chicago, nobody gets pimp slapped in Chicago, nobody gets a pass in other words and stories about people pouring bleach on somebody. That doesn't happen in Chicago and making a comment about a Chicago be Make America Great Again country that does not happen in Chicago. So, if Jussie you know stays the attack, he's dead wrong, because he's receiving all the attention and we just had a one-year old child, a toddler shot in here named Baby Chase. And he's not getting any attention. And we have a 14 to 16 percent homicide clearance rate. And if Jussie is guilty of the charges, he's dead because he's taking much needed attention from a serious problem in Chicago. INGRAHAM: Mark pick up on that for a moment. 24 police officers were apparently assigned to this Smollett case. 24 and as Tio said, we had a chance to meet Tio when we did our special In Chicago some months back. That is an appalling and appallingly low rate of solved murders in the city. Yet you've got 24 people in total assigned to this case."

But the city officials wanted this out of the press as quickly as possible, so they wanted the suspects arrested and move on as quickly as possible. I understand that. But once they started investigating this, they started uncovering exactly what it was, they knew it was a hoax.

We all know the famous kissing sailor image after the war, Alfred Eisenstaedt's photograph of V-J Day when the war came to an end, George Mendonsa, the sailor captured in the image, thought it was an important momentum of the war. GEORGE MENDONSA, SAILOR IN FAMOUS WORLD WAR II \"KISSING SAILOR\" PHOTO: The picture is still known around the whole world as a symbol of the end of World War II. This is one of the good things that ever happened to me."

In the wake of his death, a statute capturing that moment was defaced with the words \"#MeToo.\" The implication being that the nurse in the picture did not consent to be kissed. This is related to an Internet sensation, trolls dug up a 1971 \"Playboy\" interview with John Wayne. The acting legend in the interview, he refers to gays using a pejorative, says Indians were selfishly trying to keep this land, and he's glad we took it from them. And then he says this, \"With a lot of blacks, there's quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so. But we can't all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks. I believe in white supremacy,\" Duke said, \"until the blacks are educated to the point of responsibility.\" Laura, what I don't like about both of these stories is we are judging the past in the light of shifting moral, ethic, and cultural codes of today. We can't do that."

Now, the massive operation including transporting large amounts of coke and meth across state lines. In Louisiana, U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested a convicted child sex offender who had been previously deported.

This is me walking to an alternative.\" I think it's \"this is I,\" isn't it, supposed to be grammatical. How cute. He'd rather freeze than enter Trump Tower. I just couldn't resist. Here's my advice to Swalwell. Since you've been operating in an alternative universe for years, this should be easy for you. Try the Russian tea room, Eric. Maybe you'll finally find your collusion.
