It gives US consumers access to global markets, and the basic concept of economics is that trade - voluntary trade is always win-win and makes both parties better off.  So, from an economics' standpoint, to create the most amount of wealth and prosperity in jobs, what we want to do is maximize the amount of trading opportunities that are available both on the buying side and on the selling side. So it's very clear from an economic standpoint using economic theory, empirical evidence that economists are pretty united on this one topic. They might defer or diverge on other topics, but economists as a group pretty much have unanimous support for the benefits of free trade and they are almost universally and unanimously opposed to restrictions on trade in the form of protectionism and tariffs.  So trade is just a way that we increase our opportunities and it enhances our standard of living and gets us to a much higher level of prosperity and a higher standard of living.",

It's kind of new to conservatism, these across-the-board ideas of tariffs of our allies. But, I guess my question is this: while it may at least temporarily protect those workers, aren't there more workers down economic stream who are using steel and when you drive up the price of steel, more and more of those industries go out of business or they cut back on R&D, they cut back on wages and benefits or they cut back unemployment, period.",

They lose market share. They would then have less demand for workers.  So, again, that's the part that you have to kind of trace all of the effects through and not just look at the one steelworker whose job is now protected because of protectionism, we have to trace it through and look at all of the effects - the negative effects on the economy. When you do, that I don't think you can point to any case where the benefits of protectionism have outweighed the cost.

So, in a way, I always argue, we get the best of both worlds. Really, a trade deficit means we have a net inflow of goods. We have goods surplus, there are more goods coming in the country than going out. We also have a net inflow of capital from our capital account surplus.

I mean, I don't believe we should have had free trade with let's say the third Reich. I don't think we should have had free trade with Tojo's Japan or Mussolini's Italy, or anything like that even before war broke out. When China is making it obvious with these phony islands and all the rest that it is a threat to us to, I think a President or a government has a responsibility to try at least and find ways to protect the American people from them.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Trade is important because it gives American firms access to global markets. It gives US consumers access to global markets, and the basic concept of economics is that trade - voluntary trade is always win-win and makes both parties better off. So, from an economics' standpoint, to create the most amount of wealth and prosperity in jobs, what we want to do is maximize the amount of trading opportunities that are available both on the buying side and on the selling side. So it's very clear from an economic standpoint using economic theory, empirical evidence that economists are pretty united on this one topic. They might defer or diverge on other topics, but economists as a group pretty much have unanimous support for the benefits of free trade and they are almost universally and unanimously opposed to restrictions on trade in the form of protectionism and tariffs. So trade is just a way that we increase our opportunities and it enhances our standard of living and gets us to a much higher level of prosperity and a higher standard of living."

      "utterance": "Yes, of course, and I think one way to - I always encourage people to look at trade through the viewpoint of the consumer because all we hear out of Washington and Trump and the protectionists is through the viewpoint of the producer. So especially if you view international trade from the viewpoint of the American consumer, we're much better off today getting access to low cost goods from all over the world, and so especially from the consumer standpoint, the opportunities we have to shop around the world, basically, that really elevates the standard of living of every American who buys anything at a Target or a Walmart or Home Depot or travels abroad, and so, really from - especially from the consumer standpoint, Americans are much better off with trade compared to the alternative, which would be protectionism or reductions in international trade."

    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, right. And we kind of get a little off base here because we always talk about like the US and maybe a deficit with China or Japan or Canada or Mexico, but countries don't trade, individuals trade. So, I think that's also very important for people to understand that trade happens at the individual level, that the United States doesn't decide to go on vacation to Canada or vice versa, it's American tourists that might decide to go on vacation there. So, trade always happens at the individual level from economic theory and just economic reasoning and logic, trade is win-win, and so we want to, again, to maximize the amount of trade and individuals engaged in trade and that's where I think we have to always think of the consumer as the - the viewpoint of the consumer is what's important in trade."

They have an open playing field then, don't they?"

      "speaker": "PERRY",

It's kind of new to conservatism, these across-the-board ideas of tariffs of our allies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But, I guess my question is this",
      "utterance": "while it may at least temporarily protect those workers, aren't there more workers down economic stream who are using steel and when you drive up the price of steel, more and more of those industries go out of business or they cut back on R&D, they cut back on wages and benefits or they cut back unemployment, period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Oh sure, I mean, that's just the reality that I guess for every protected job in the US steel industry, for workers who are making steel, there's something like 25 or 30 workers whose jobs are at risk now because their companies use steel as an input, and so it drives up the price of an input and makes them less competitive because again, a lot of US companies are not only selling here, they're selling globally, so you're driving up input prices for American companies, makes them less competitive. They lose market share. They would then have less demand for workers. So, again, that's the part that you have to kind of trace all of the effects through and not just look at the one steelworker whose job is now protected because of protectionism, we have to trace it through and look at all of the effects - the negative effects on the economy. When you do, that I don't think you can point to any case where the benefits of protectionism have outweighed the cost. It's always that the cost outweigh the benefits or that the jobs lost are greater than the jobs saved."

    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, again, if you look at it through the viewpoint of the American consumer, we want the lowest prices, we want the lowest labor costs. So if American companies can import products produced in another country because of lower wages in China or Mexico, that still creates this huge benefit for American consumers and to the extent then that they save money on buying imports that freeze up money that they spend on other goods and services, so there could be the stimulus effect and more jobs in these other industries that are hard to identify, but again..."

You may import something that resonates beneficially to the American consumer, the American consumer may spend money on this industry or those services or products rather than this, or they might be buying natural resources from these poor countries, using them and again, that create jobs throughout the American economy."

Now that may help the steel barons and it may help the steel unions, but when that begins to resonate throughout the economy and the consumer, does that help everyone on assembly lines? Does that help the United States military that are buying new tanks and buying new aircrafts and other armaments and right down through the economic system?"

They're just a small company trying to survive in a globally competitive marketplace, so again, as you see those higher input prices kind of ripple through the economy, I think what we're going to see is just like in 2002, there's going to be job losses and in that case, 2002, there were more jobs lost throughout the economy than there were jobs in the..."

I'll give you an example very quickly, let's say as a nation, the people in the country, the businesses in the country buy a billion dollars worth of oil from Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia just saying, buys nothing, so we're in the hole \"a billion dollars with Saudi Arabia\" but we need the oil to finance assembly lines, to build stuff, to apply the products, to drive our cars and so forth, so why is that so bad?"

Or maybe people want to buy this stuff because it's really important to their households or whatever and we're not producing it in quantity in the United States, so whatever the reason is. I often think to myself, when we talk about this balance of trade. Okay, so what's the answer to that if we accept their argument? Does the government now decide we're going to have a balance, so we have to be exactly 100% each way with this country and that country?

So, in a way, I always argue, we get the best of both worlds. Really, a trade deficit means we have a net inflow of goods. We have goods surplus, there are more goods coming in the country than going out. We also have a net inflow of capital from our capital account surplus. So we have a net inflow of goods and a net inflow of capital and then complain that somebody is taking advantage of us or we're somehow getting duped."

There's things that we can learn, things that we can do and so, there's a back-and-forth knowledge flow too, that capitalism, that trade, that commerce is involved in, it's not like that's the intention of everybody, but, wow, look how they did this, maybe we can improve upon this and so forth and so on, am I right?"

So if other countries, because they have more authoritarian and autocratic governments, choose to impose their will on their people, limit what they can buy, drive up the cost of our products, limit their access to our technology and so forth and so on, that's to their detriment, not to ours, is that correct?"

They are raw materials and supplies and inventory and so on. So it's really our companies that are buying inputs that make them more efficient and more productive and more competitive.

I want to talk about China. I consider China our gravest threat right now. There's Iran, there's North Korea, there's Russia and there's others, but China is building up a significant military machine. It is trying to take control in geopolitical ways and geographical ways that at the South China Sea, other navigable waters, space, cyber warfare and they are stealing us blind. They are compelling our companies that do business in China to cough up their technology and their proprietary information. By joining with these companies which was basically state-run companies. They are stealing our technology here by buying up companies and taking the technology and the latest twist is, they're now flooding our patent office with patent challenges to try and slow down our ability to get our own patent. So, they're not playing by any kinds of rules and it seems to me, there is a point at which, and we have export control regimes in place, the Commerce Department and State Department to make sure we don't give our enemies our cutting-edge technology so they can improve their nuclear weapons systems and so forth.

We've had Republican Congresses that basically let China get away with it, why? Because the corporate instinct, which I like, is profit and in some cases, profit at all costs. Got it, good. But sometimes, it's just like with the Constitution when it comes to national security, we have to look at a country. I mean, I don't believe we should have had free trade with let's say the third Reich. I don't think we should have had free trade with Tojo's Japan or Mussolini's Italy, or anything like that even before war broke out. When China is making it obvious with these phony islands and all the rest that it is a threat to us to, I think a President or a government has a responsibility to try at least and find ways to protect the American people from them."

      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, and actually, in the international trade theory, one of the exceptions to free trade and one of the reasons you might want to have some kind of restrictions is national security. So to the extent that that's an issue now, we should really think about that seriously. The danger is I think that is that then every industry can always make some kind of a national security argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "That's different. I agree with you. But I'm not talking about the industries making the argument. I'm talking about there's that country over there that's dangerous, I don't really care what this industry, that industry or the other industry said, and you say you don't trust the current administration to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm just thinking because as a protectionist, I think Trump is always going to favor protectionism over any other kind of solution. So in the case of China, maybe I would support what he's doing there, I am just not quite sure what he's doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "And yet, I think when it comes to China, he's doing the right thing. I think so. They're trying to limit the technology that's flying to China. They're punishing China domestically in our courts and elsewhere for stealing our technology. He is putting tariffs in place, he said, for national security reasons because they're stealing our technology. They do not pay attention to international agreements or international court rulings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so maybe there is some justification there. What maybe I would differ a little bit if we're claiming that they subsidized their producers or they manipulate their currency, then I would say that's fine that they do that because they're really subsidizing American consumers and American companies if they are subsidizing their producers or if they are manipulating their currency. When those claims were being made, it was that they were making the dollar too strong, making their goods cheap. So, there were some benefits for that type of trade policy that they implemented that people complained about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "So essentially, we agree to disagree, in part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "All right, we'll be right back. I want to get back to this word \"fair.\" Fair. Some companies live, some companies die. Some companies expand, some retract. On what basis are we supposed to subsidize companies and subsidize workers to the detriment of other companies and other workers and the taxpayers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, I mean, the whole notion of fair or fairness is just so swishy and so subjective that there's no real definition for that. So if we talk about fair wages or fair trade, from an economic standpoint it always is just never quite as a good concept as just to have freedom and allow the free market and the principles of a market economy to kind of determine the direction of where the economy is heading."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Is it pro-American to be in favor of fair trade?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, it is, unless like I said before, when people use the term \"fair,\" it is almost always followed by some kind of government intervention to impose fairness on a situation that they have determined to be unfair. So I think in principle, it's a fine ideal to have everything be fair in people's minds, but usually fair translates into government intervention whereas freedom and free trade usually means the absence or less government control on regulation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Do you think if we as a country proposed let's eliminate all barriers, all subsidies, all tariffs, all taxes of every kind, in every product or service we trade with Canada, if they will do the same, do you think our government would go along with that? I don't think our government would go along with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "No, I think that would be a great way to approach it. Because when we talk about free trade, like with NAFTA or something, it's some of the negotiated 2,000-page contract or something like that, but yes, and then again, the politicians get a payoff from their voters and supporters when they impose protectionism in ways that they don't get when they support free trade. So, I think politically, it's not viable, but from an economic standpoint, it would be a great..."

    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "I think you and I have counted 12,000. They've been slipped into bills for political reasons to protect certain industries. They give certain donations, and then you want to talk about the swamp, you want to talk about entrenched bureaucracy, isn't that it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, the idea that America is this big open market to the rest of the world and everybody is mean and bad and cuts off our products, again, the 25% tariff on trucks, the fact that we don't allow any foreign sugar in to protect our sugar beet farmers. We pay twice the world price for sugar, it's not as if we come into this discussion with clean hands, and so we have to be realistic about what's going on."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "We'll be right back. Dr. Mark Perry, here's the final question for you, please, do you see the country abandoning capitalism - market capitalism moving toward socialism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I see some promising signs under the current administration in terms of - in the areas of let's say energy, and education, and regulation, and taxes, so I think we're moving in the right direction in some of those areas. I think the danger now in terms of moving away from free-market capitalism is the trend towards this greater protectionism that we are seeing because I think that is moving us in the wrong direction. So, the biggest challenge that I see right now and the biggest threat to free-market capitalism is this wave of protectionism that we are seeing now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "But what about the body politic? Do you think the wave of protectionism we're seeing is a reaction to that, because I'm starting to think it is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think there has been some resistance in Congress to Trump's authority on his own to unilaterally impose these perfectionist policies, and so I think there is some blowback in Congress."
    },

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "At the voters?"
    },

      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, the voters are being, I think, you know, are being, I think, a little bit influenced now by this wave of protectionism and that is the danger that I see is that people are now kind of buying into the make America first protectionism."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "Conservative movement, you know, I think, it has to remember its principles going back to Reagan and heroes like Milton Friedman who kind of really showed us the way to think about the economy, and so I think if we can keep that legacy in mind with some of those intellectual heroes of mine and yours, I think, then, I think we will be okay in this."
