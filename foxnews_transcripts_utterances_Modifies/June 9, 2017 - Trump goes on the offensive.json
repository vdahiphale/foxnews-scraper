I mean, he's driven the media to push fake news stories which has now ruined their credibility. He's driven Democrats, to lie, to cry, and to put on their little tinfoil hats. He's driven celebrities to use the N-word, to behead, to just, you know, get fired and he's driven people on college campuses to riot and like chase their little safe spaces. On the swearing, I mean Democrats are supposed to be about protecting the children and they're supposed to be the party that is sophisticated and they're doing the exact opposite.

Where do they go from here? Where's the big, you know, conspiracy, and the collusion, or obstruction of justice or investigations we've been hearing about over and over again? I mean, yes, they're going to finish this up and see, but what are they going to all of a sudden magically get that what came to life after Comey was fired? Are they going to get some evidence?

So, you have to believe that then the FBI director left and decided to write a creative story on his laptop that would be the most epic perjury in the history of the country. And I don't know if that's necessarily going anywhere but it is something that the media is going to chew on.

They're state owned. They act on behalf of the Russian government but they are not technically intelligence officials. Or you have the way that the Russian spies work to recruit people.

So, when you prepare a document like that -- contemporaneous with an interview or discussion with the president of the United States, that is absolutely work product. That should be privileged. It is discoverable as well. And the fact that he made it and went it and then went ahead and made a conscious decision to leak it to an outside civilian, a professor, in order for that person to give it to the press? It's just like mind-boggling. I mean, and he admitted it. There's no question about whether he did or whether he didn't.

Oh, my gosh. You know, we had to, you know, and then he said it's the Russia thing. The Russia thing. That's the reason I fired him. So, Comey had a reason to say, hey, let's get this on the record and if there are tapes, let's hope so. By the way, if there's work product, boy, those tapes would be work product. Wouldn't they?

You're saying that under investigation over this dossier. Why don't you go out and do something about it? He didn't do it, so he fired him. So, the funny thing is, you can't trust Comey and Trump realized that. I mean, the leak proves that he can't be trusted. He realized that Comey always had allegiances elsewhere.

But if you listen to the audience, they're all yelling and clapping and applauding. They love it. They're laughing. And as Greg has pointed out so many times that politics is downstream from culture and as the culture (INAUDIBLE) this becomes more acceptable. Now, we can complain about it. I'm sure she wouldn't like it if her children said something like that but I don't think it's going to stop because the Democrats get to that kind of response from their audience.

I mean, he's driven the media to push fake news stories which has now ruined their credibility. He's driven Democrats, to lie, to cry, and to put on their little tinfoil hats. He's driven celebrities to use the N-word, to behead, to just, you know, get fired and he's driven people on college campuses to riot and like chase their little safe spaces. On the swearing, I mean Democrats are supposed to be about protecting the children and they're supposed to be the party that is sophisticated and they're doing the exact opposite. I think right now is in order to get attention in the Trump news cycle you have to say explicit things or else you're not going to get any play.

They set a new school record for the most wins and the trip to the NCAA tournament with multiple wins in 70 years. The last time this happened was 1948 when George H.W. Bush was a senior and captain of the team. Yale lost to Oregon State in the playoffs, who are considered the top team of the country, but the whole team came to Kennebunkport to have their picture taken with the president. I love it."

It's time for this, \"I Hate These People.\" All right, put up this quote I saw from The New York Times two days ago. Do you have it there? \"I wouldn't be surprised if I took half days or the day off.\" This is about the Comey hearing. This person said, \"If I had a normal job, I don't know what I'd be doing.\" Just the assumption that people were taking the day off shows you how remote you are from the rest of America. Every body who wasn't in the media was at work."

I knew they were bad people and I knew they hate Americans. I just want to support all Americans. He said so, if they have to fight ISIS, they can have some support. Very cute.

Our colleague Brit Hume went to his granddaughter, Claire's high school graduation this week and here you can see here with the head of the school. She graduated from Holton-Arms outside D.C. and Brit, my man, he prepared a special surprise for her. The keys to his 2011 white sedan. What a great gift. There he is with Claire, and she was ecstatic but no more beaming than Brit Hume. Look at how happy they both are. We wish Claire all the best in the world. And a tip of the hat to Brit for being just such a great granddad. A model for me, Brit."
