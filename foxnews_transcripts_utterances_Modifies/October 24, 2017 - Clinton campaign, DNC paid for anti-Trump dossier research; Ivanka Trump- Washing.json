      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. What an amazing show we have. This is a Fox News alert. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we are following four major breaking news stories. But first, before we even start, tonight is the night of vindication. Even The Washington Post is now tonight being forced to admit what we have been telling you for over a year.  Also tonight, The Hill's John Solomon reporting the Obama administration gave a visa to a Russian nuclear official even after evidence showed he was involved in bribery and kickbacks, extortion and money laundering.  All these schemes to advance Vladimir Putin's radium interest in America. Wait until you hear this report. John Solomon and Circa News' Sara Carter will all be here with the very latest. Also, Victoria Toensing.  Also breaking tonight, the Department of Justice, they are now deliberating whether to allow this FBI informant with all of this evidence to testify before Congress about this corrupt Uranium One deal. And a possible new Clinton pay to play scheme. This is the same FBI informant that helped uncover the Russian nuclear bribery and kickback plot and reportedly has all the evidence of the Russian money flowing straight to the Clintons. And tonight also, House Republicans, they are finally catching up to us, a year later. They are now launching the investigations we've been calling for into the corrupt Uranium One deal. Thanks to the amazing reporting, investigative work of Sara Carter, John Solomon, and this show. Things are starting to move at an accelerated rate. We are now closer to getting to the truth about what is the biggest national security breach and Russia scandal in American history.  We've got a huge breaking news night tonight on \"Hannity.\" Even The Washington Post is reporting and Fox News has confirmed Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC, they paid for the research that became the fake news, anti-Trump dossier. They've been lying to you for a year. Plus, never Trumper senators, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, John McCain, they are lashing out at the president, we'll have a full report on that. These senators seem to be more interested in attacking the President than they are in serving you, the American people, the forgotten men and women in this country. They need to move.  Anyway, we've got all of that and tonight's important breaking news opening monologue and part two of our Ivanka interview.   All right. We have made more progress in the last 24 hours with new information and breaking news. Tonight, I'm going to go through all of this very, very slowly. The media has been lying to you. They have been entirely wrong for almost a year. And that relates to the real Russia story. You don't want to miss a minute of tonight's program. Tonight we will prove how we've been right all along and ahead of the curve and how wrong they have been. We will lay it out all out, all of the ugly details. And there's a ton of new information tonight. We have explosive information on the massive Uranium One scandal that the Obama administration attempted to cover up. We've been telling you for years this was going to be a big deal, and tonight it is.   Now, The Hill's John Solomon is out tonight with another absolutely stunning report. Here's the headline: Obama administration granted visa entry to Russian nuclear executive under FBI investigation for bribery. Now, according to this new report, the Obama administration actually granted a temporary work visa to this top Russian official in 2011 and then they renewed it in 2014, even after there was overwhelming evidence this official was involved in a criminal scheme that involved racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering. Also tonight, Fox News is learning that senior Justice Department officials are finally deliberating over allowing the FBI informant to now testify and tell the truth before Congress. This informant is the key player in the latest developments that we've been sharing with you on this Uranium One scandal. And as John Solomon and Sara Carter have reported, the informant helped uncover a Russian nuclear bribery -- as I said, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, money laundering -- criminal enterprise which began one year before the approval of the Uranium One deal, before it was approved. Now, of course, all of this evidence was kept secret from Congress by the Obama administration on purpose. Now because this eyewitness signed a nondisclosure agreement, that prevented him from telling Congress and the American people the truth.  Now in addition to all of this, The Hill and Circa News are reporting that the same FBI informant also has evidence of Russians trying to influence the Clintons specifically. This is on top of what we already know about the Clintons' role with Uranium One.   The Hill is reporting that Bill Clinton tried to get State Department permission -- remember, his wife was running this -- to meet with the Russian nuclear official while the Uranium One deal was actually being approved by the Obama administration. And we can't forget that just before the deal, what did Bill get? He pocketed half a million dollars in a speech from Moscow. That was double his normal speaking fee. And during that meeting, he was advocating for Uranium One and he sat down with Vladimir Putin.  Now, I want to add one other point here, this is important. You want to talk about a real Russian conspiracy? Listen to this. The bank that was paying Bill Clinton -- when you pay attention to this -- that bank was connected to Putin and that bank also had financial interest in Uranium One. And there is more. According to a The Hill report published last night after Hillary Clinton became the secretary of state, Russian spies purposely tried to gain access to Hillary, her top aides and the former President Bill Clinton. Now the reports knows that one Russian spy who was successful actually got a job with a major Democratic donor and actually was arrested and deported.  Now, there's Peter Schweizer's book, remember \"Clinton Cash\"? We were the first to bring that to your attention. It exposed how $145 million in donations poured into the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was secretary of state, while she was approving the Uranium One deal.  Now, this is what people all across this country and all of you corrupt people in the media, you should all be angry about this tonight. Now because of all of the evidence of wrongdoing earlier today, finally -- finally -- prayers answered. House Republicans announced that key committees will finally be launching investigations into this corrupt bribery Uranium One kickback deal. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Here's my prediction tonight. People will be going to jail over this. Now, this is something we've been calling for for weeks, months, even over a year.  The House is also launching an investigation into how the Obama Department of Justice, how the FBI handled Hillary Clinton's email server case. And I've got to say, it's about time. Because the evidence of wrongdoing in both of these massive scandals is overwhelming, it's incontrovertible and it puts our security at risk. And as we have been saying for months, Congress has a duty, a moral obligation. We can't have a dual justice system. They must investigate these scandals fully and they must uncover the truth of what actually happened. How is it possible -- how -- that they never recognized giving Vladimir Putin and the Russians 20 percent of our uranium, the foundational material to nuclear weapons, a hostile actor, is a good idea?   And with Uranium One, Congress literally can start by calling on key Obama administration officials. Eric Holder, Rod Rosenstein and yes, Robert Mueller, I hope you are watching. You need to testify under oath. And let me tell you why. As the Attorney General Eric Holder -- of course he had oversight over the FBI. He was a member of the government committee that actually approved Uranium One but yet they had all this evidence of corruption and bribery. He clearly had the information.  And then there's now deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Well, he was actually in charge of this FBI investigation into this Russian bribery and money laundering scandal.  And finally, special counsel Robert Mueller. Back in 2009, he was the FBI director. This was when the bureau, the FBI so clearly had this information. He has conflicts of interest. There's no way the American people can trust Robert Mueller to investigate anything Russian related, to be fair and impartial. It's impossible because of his past role in this. He should resign immediately tonight. Now also, the House tonight is also going to be investigating the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI's handling of the Clinton email server scandal. All happening tonight. Now, aside from Clinton having secret, top-secret, special access program, classified information, mishandled a felony on her server. Remember, the one stored in the bathroom of a mom and pop shop? The House will be looking into the former FBI director -- which they should -- James Comey. And it's inexcusable conduct. Now, you may remember he drafted the letter exonerating Hillary Clinton before actor conducting the interviews with the key witnesses including Hillary Clinton herself. Comey also, he abused his power when he announced he was not recommending charges against Clinton. He never had that authority.   Then we have the attorney general, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Remember the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton? Days before Comey's decision. And like we've been saying, it's about time. These are all serious issues, all need to be investigated fully. And those involved need to be held accountable.  We are also learning tonight that we were right about the GPS fusion dossier. Tonight, even The Washington Post has to finally begin to report what we have been telling you forever. And according to The Washington Post tonight -- I love to quote them -- Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC, they paid for that phony research that eventually became the dossier. That's the same document that used Russian government paid sources and made wild and completely untrue and ridiculous accusations about Donald Trump. And remember, the Democrats, media, they were happy to repeat. For example, oh, that Donald Trump was in the Ritz in Moscow and he had hookers urinating in his bed. And James Comey wanted to hire this man and pay him taxpayer dollars.  All of this makes the Clinton campaign and the DNC tonight complicit in spreading Russian propaganda and Russian lies about then candidate Donald Trump. Now, if they are spreading this Russian propaganda, they've been lying to you, the American people, using phony Russian sources. And this lie has gone on for over a year.  This is the Russia collusion. This is the real Russia story. Robert Mueller, wake up tonight. Now, Fox News has also confirmed the information in the post article is correct. In other words, we've been right for over a year.  And we want to point out another part of the Washington Post article. It reads, quote, \"Fusion GPS' research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.\" This was before the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign took over. OK, I want to know, who is that? Was it one of the other candidates? Was it Senator McCain who reportedly gave it to the FBI? Who is behind this? We need answers. Keep in mind, it was McCain, he said he passed this dossier around. And by the way, we have to wonder, if this new information is the reason why the group behind the dossier, Fusion GPS, is trying to stop lawmakers from accessing their bank records? Hmm. Follow the money.   Now the entire Democratic apparatus, most of the Republican apparatus and all of the mainstream media, they fell hook, line and sinker for a Russian disinformation lying campaign to the American people during an election. The Democrats, Hillary Clinton, they all lied to you for over a year.  Now, keep in mind, there is a report. James Comey, he tried pay Christopher Steele, the former British spy, who put this whole dossier together. He wanted to give me your money. And tonight, predictably, the new DNC Chairman Tom Perez, he's like, \"I didn't do this.\" He is denying he had any personal involvement with the dossier. You're going to hear a lot more of those denials in the days to come. We will continue to follow that story. Also tonight, a very important report. And that is pathetic, weak, gutless, spineless never-Trumper establishment Republicans forces all lashing out against the president today. Now, Senators Bob Corker, we have little snowflake whiny Jeff Flake and John McCain all bashing the president instead of doing what? Focusing on passing tax reform for the forgotten men and women in poverty, on food stamps, and out of work in those country.   Take a look.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Here is a simple truth: All three of these guys they are inapt, they're ineffective, they have completely failed to deliver on the promises that they made to their constituents and you the American people, for years. These guys have accomplished nothing. And others like Ben Sasse, too. And you know what? all they are doing here is standing in the way of enacting an agenda to help move the country forward, what the people voted for last November. And they are trying to be martyrs in the process. You want to be martyrs? You guys go right ahead. Here is my answer to all of you tonight: Good riddance, happy trails, don't let the door hit you on the way out of town. Now, before his little stunt on the Senate floor, Senator Flake announced he was not going to be running for reelection in 2018. Now, here's part of the truth here. Flake is now trying to say his decision is all about President Trump. But here's the truth -- because he lied today. At least, he's not choosing to run again because back in August, Flake had an 18 percent approval rating among voters in Arizona. And another poll showed that he was losing to his chief Republican primary challenger Dr. Kelli Ward, who would have crushed Flake in a primary had he had the courage to run.  And then you got Bob Corker, he's done nothing but attack the president now for weeks. Bob Corker, he's stepping aside. He is not running again because he would have lost in Tennessee.  So, I have a suggestion for all you never-Trumper senators that are headed for the exits, people like Corker and Flake, you know what, guess what? You guys, you know, take your other colleagues with you. Mitch McConnell, good-bye. Ben Sasse, good-bye. John Cornyn, goodbye. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins. Either get the job done that you promised the American people, advance the president's agenda. What other conservative values that the president is advocating for that you are unwilling to support? Many of you can retire and we will all be happier. Now, the difference here between President Trump and these senators that I just listed, is the president is a fighter. He is fighting for what he believes in. I like somebody fighting for the American people. And he's also somebody that is keeping his word, his promises. The Senate has done next to nothing to help the president keep his promises or help the American people or help the forgotten men in poverty, on food stamps, and out of work. Look at these statistics. The Senate has confirmed in about a year, since January, only 175 of President Trump civilian nominees. Guess what? Two hundred and twenty nine have yet to be confirmed. How many vacations do these guys take? And during the similar time frame, President Obama had 359 nominees confirmed, over twice as much.  And listen to this. Through September of this year, the House of Representatives -- and I have disagreements with them at times, at least they do their job. They have passed 308 bills that originated in that chamber and of those 308 bills that the House of Representatives passed, the Senate has passed 34. Beyond an embarrassment. Beyond a disgrace. These guys are the definition of failure. The poster children of failure. Now, Senate Republicans are no longer serving the American people. So you know what, Senator Flake? Bye. You know what Senator Corker? See you later. It is time for accountability. It's time to drain the swamp. If Republicans don't back this agenda, a tax reform, repealing and replacing, they need to get out of the way or resign or retire or do something. Because you know what? The only reason these people are now saying they are not running is because they know they can't win. And for all you never-Trumpers who were watching tonight, take a look at the side of your screen, they happen to be Donald Trump's accomplishments. Let's see. Pretty long list. Real, tangible, accomplishments, promises made, promises kept. So, what have you never-Trumpers done in this period of time? Have you helped the millions of forgotten men and women of this country that are suffering? Well, the answers are simple. You've done nothing other than help the Democrats obstruct the president at every single turn. And you know what? Enough is enough.   Now, we are going to have a lot more in all this breaking news. And I promise you, you don't want to miss a minute of any of this. When we come back, the heroes, investigative reporters who have been exposing the truth and standing alone and digging hard. John Solomon, Sara Carter. Plus, Victoria Toensing, she is the attorney for that FBI informant who is at the center for exposing this Uranium One scandal. We've got all of that.

I think that this will lead to an investigation that will expose and finally for once tell the American people and Congress what actually happened with the Uranium One deal, how far the Russians are willing to go. And the connections those Russians made in the United States. And that is going to be imperative. And there's so much there. It's like we've unraveled a threat, right? And it just doesn't stop unraveling. So, I think that the momentum needs to be kept up, Sean. People need to continue to look into this.

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker. What an amazing show we have. This is a Fox News alert. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we are following four major breaking news stories. But first, before we even start, tonight is the night of vindication. Even The Washington Post is now tonight being forced to admit what we have been telling you for over a year. Also tonight, The Hill's John Solomon reporting the Obama administration gave a visa to a Russian nuclear official even after evidence showed he was involved in bribery and kickbacks, extortion and money laundering. All these schemes to advance Vladimir Putin's radium interest in America. Wait until you hear this report. John Solomon and Circa News' Sara Carter will all be here with the very latest. Also, Victoria Toensing. Also breaking tonight, the Department of Justice, they are now deliberating whether to allow this FBI informant with all of this evidence to testify before Congress about this corrupt Uranium One deal. And a possible new Clinton pay to play scheme. This is the same FBI informant that helped uncover the Russian nuclear bribery and kickback plot and reportedly has all the evidence of the Russian money flowing straight to the Clintons. And tonight also, House Republicans, they are finally catching up to us, a year later. They are now launching the investigations we've been calling for into the corrupt Uranium One deal. Thanks to the amazing reporting, investigative work of Sara Carter, John Solomon, and this show. Things are starting to move at an accelerated rate. We are now closer to getting to the truth about what is the biggest national security breach and Russia scandal in American history. We've got a huge breaking news night tonight on \"Hannity.\" Even The Washington Post is reporting and Fox News has confirmed Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC, they paid for the research that became the fake news, anti-Trump dossier. They've been lying to you for a year. Plus, never Trumper senators, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, John McCain, they are lashing out at the president, we'll have a full report on that. These senators seem to be more interested in attacking the President than they are in serving you, the American people, the forgotten men and women in this country. They need to move. Anyway, we've got all of that and tonight's important breaking news opening monologue and part two of our Ivanka interview. All right. We have made more progress in the last 24 hours with new information and breaking news. Tonight, I'm going to go through all of this very, very slowly. The media has been lying to you. They have been entirely wrong for almost a year. And that relates to the real Russia story. You don't want to miss a minute of tonight's program. Tonight we will prove how we've been right all along and ahead of the curve and how wrong they have been. We will lay it out all out, all of the ugly details. And there's a ton of new information tonight. We have explosive information on the massive Uranium One scandal that the Obama administration attempted to cover up. We've been telling you for years this was going to be a big deal, and tonight it is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, The Hill's John Solomon is out tonight with another absolutely stunning report. Here's the headline",
      "utterance": "Obama administration granted visa entry to Russian nuclear executive under FBI investigation for bribery. Now, according to this new report, the Obama administration actually granted a temporary work visa to this top Russian official in 2011 and then they renewed it in 2014, even after there was overwhelming evidence this official was involved in a criminal scheme that involved racketeering, bribery, extortion, money laundering. Also tonight, Fox News is learning that senior Justice Department officials are finally deliberating over allowing the FBI informant to now testify and tell the truth before Congress. This informant is the key player in the latest developments that we've been sharing with you on this Uranium One scandal. And as John Solomon and Sara Carter have reported, the informant helped uncover a Russian nuclear bribery -- as I said, bribery, kickbacks, extortion, money laundering -- criminal enterprise which began one year before the approval of the Uranium One deal, before it was approved. Now, of course, all of this evidence was kept secret from Congress by the Obama administration on purpose. Now because this eyewitness signed a nondisclosure agreement, that prevented him from telling Congress and the American people the truth. Now in addition to all of this, The Hill and Circa News are reporting that the same FBI informant also has evidence of Russians trying to influence the Clintons specifically. This is on top of what we already know about the Clintons' role with Uranium One. The Hill is reporting that Bill Clinton tried to get State Department permission -- remember, his wife was running this -- to meet with the Russian nuclear official while the Uranium One deal was actually being approved by the Obama administration. And we can't forget that just before the deal, what did Bill get? He pocketed half a million dollars in a speech from Moscow. That was double his normal speaking fee. And during that meeting, he was advocating for Uranium One and he sat down with Vladimir Putin. Now, I want to add one other point here, this is important. You want to talk about a real Russian conspiracy? Listen to this. The bank that was paying Bill Clinton -- when you pay attention to this -- that bank was connected to Putin and that bank also had financial interest in Uranium One. And there is more. According to a The Hill report published last night after Hillary Clinton became the secretary of state, Russian spies purposely tried to gain access to Hillary, her top aides and the former President Bill Clinton. Now the reports knows that one Russian spy who was successful actually got a job with a major Democratic donor and actually was arrested and deported. Now, there's Peter Schweizer's book, remember \"Clinton Cash\"? We were the first to bring that to your attention. It exposed how $145 million in donations poured into the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was secretary of state, while she was approving the Uranium One deal. Now, this is what people all across this country and all of you corrupt people in the media, you should all be angry about this tonight. Now because of all of the evidence of wrongdoing earlier today, finally -- finally -- prayers answered. House Republicans announced that key committees will finally be launching investigations into this corrupt bribery Uranium One kickback deal. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Here's my prediction tonight. People will be going to jail over this. Now, this is something we've been calling for for weeks, months, even over a year. The House is also launching an investigation into how the Obama Department of Justice, how the FBI handled Hillary Clinton's email server case. And I've got to say, it's about time. Because the evidence of wrongdoing in both of these massive scandals is overwhelming, it's incontrovertible and it puts our security at risk. And as we have been saying for months, Congress has a duty, a moral obligation. We can't have a dual justice system. They must investigate these scandals fully and they must uncover the truth of what actually happened. How is it possible -- how -- that they never recognized giving Vladimir Putin and the Russians 20 percent of our uranium, the foundational material to nuclear weapons, a hostile actor, is a good idea? And with Uranium One, Congress literally can start by calling on key Obama administration officials. Eric Holder, Rod Rosenstein and yes, Robert Mueller, I hope you are watching. You need to testify under oath. And let me tell you why. As the Attorney General Eric Holder -- of course he had oversight over the FBI. He was a member of the government committee that actually approved Uranium One but yet they had all this evidence of corruption and bribery. He clearly had the information. And then there's now deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Well, he was actually in charge of this FBI investigation into this Russian bribery and money laundering scandal. And finally, special counsel Robert Mueller. Back in 2009, he was the FBI director. This was when the bureau, the FBI so clearly had this information. He has conflicts of interest. There's no way the American people can trust Robert Mueller to investigate anything Russian related, to be fair and impartial. It's impossible because of his past role in this. He should resign immediately tonight. Now also, the House tonight is also going to be investigating the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI's handling of the Clinton email server scandal. All happening tonight. Now, aside from Clinton having secret, top-secret, special access program, classified information, mishandled a felony on her server. Remember, the one stored in the bathroom of a mom and pop shop? The House will be looking into the former FBI director -- which they should -- James Comey. And it's inexcusable conduct. Now, you may remember he drafted the letter exonerating Hillary Clinton before actor conducting the interviews with the key witnesses including Hillary Clinton herself. Comey also, he abused his power when he announced he was not recommending charges against Clinton. He never had that authority. Then we have the attorney general, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Remember the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton? Days before Comey's decision. And like we've been saying, it's about time. These are all serious issues, all need to be investigated fully. And those involved need to be held accountable. We are also learning tonight that we were right about the GPS fusion dossier. Tonight, even The Washington Post has to finally begin to report what we have been telling you forever. And according to The Washington Post tonight -- I love to quote them -- Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC, they paid for that phony research that eventually became the dossier. That's the same document that used Russian government paid sources and made wild and completely untrue and ridiculous accusations about Donald Trump. And remember, the Democrats, media, they were happy to repeat. For example, oh, that Donald Trump was in the Ritz in Moscow and he had hookers urinating in his bed. And James Comey wanted to hire this man and pay him taxpayer dollars. All of this makes the Clinton campaign and the DNC tonight complicit in spreading Russian propaganda and Russian lies about then candidate Donald Trump. Now, if they are spreading this Russian propaganda, they've been lying to you, the American people, using phony Russian sources. And this lie has gone on for over a year. This is the Russia collusion. This is the real Russia story. Robert Mueller, wake up tonight. Now, Fox News has also confirmed the information in the post article is correct. In other words, we've been right for over a year. And we want to point out another part of the Washington Post article. It reads, quote, \"Fusion GPS' research into Trump was funded by an unknown Republican client during the GOP primary.\" This was before the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign took over. OK, I want to know, who is that? Was it one of the other candidates? Was it Senator McCain who reportedly gave it to the FBI? Who is behind this? We need answers. Keep in mind, it was McCain, he said he passed this dossier around. And by the way, we have to wonder, if this new information is the reason why the group behind the dossier, Fusion GPS, is trying to stop lawmakers from accessing their bank records? Hmm. Follow the money. Now the entire Democratic apparatus, most of the Republican apparatus and all of the mainstream media, they fell hook, line and sinker for a Russian disinformation lying campaign to the American people during an election. The Democrats, Hillary Clinton, they all lied to you for over a year. Now, keep in mind, there is a report. James Comey, he tried pay Christopher Steele, the former British spy, who put this whole dossier together. He wanted to give me your money. And tonight, predictably, the new DNC Chairman Tom Perez, he's like, \"I didn't do this.\" He is denying he had any personal involvement with the dossier. You're going to hear a lot more of those denials in the days to come. We will continue to follow that story. Also tonight, a very important report. And that is pathetic, weak, gutless, spineless never-Trumper establishment Republicans forces all lashing out against the president today. Now, Senators Bob Corker, we have little snowflake whiny Jeff Flake and John McCain all bashing the president instead of doing what? Focusing on passing tax reform for the forgotten men and women in poverty, on food stamps, and out of work in those country. Take a look."

These guys have accomplished nothing. And others like Ben Sasse, too. And you know what? all they are doing here is standing in the way of enacting an agenda to help move the country forward, what the people voted for last November. And they are trying to be martyrs in the process. You want to be martyrs? You guys go right ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here is my answer to all of you tonight",
      "utterance": "Good riddance, happy trails, don't let the door hit you on the way out of town. Now, before his little stunt on the Senate floor, Senator Flake announced he was not going to be running for reelection in 2018. Now, here's part of the truth here. Flake is now trying to say his decision is all about President Trump. But here's the truth -- because he lied today. At least, he's not choosing to run again because back in August, Flake had an 18 percent approval rating among voters in Arizona. And another poll showed that he was losing to his chief Republican primary challenger Dr. Kelli Ward, who would have crushed Flake in a primary had he had the courage to run. And then you got Bob Corker, he's done nothing but attack the president now for weeks. Bob Corker, he's stepping aside. He is not running again because he would have lost in Tennessee. So, I have a suggestion for all you never-Trumper senators that are headed for the exits, people like Corker and Flake, you know what, guess what? You guys, you know, take your other colleagues with you. Mitch McConnell, good-bye. Ben Sasse, good-bye. John Cornyn, goodbye. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins. Either get the job done that you promised the American people, advance the president's agenda. What other conservative values that the president is advocating for that you are unwilling to support? Many of you can retire and we will all be happier. Now, the difference here between President Trump and these senators that I just listed, is the president is a fighter. He is fighting for what he believes in. I like somebody fighting for the American people. And he's also somebody that is keeping his word, his promises. The Senate has done next to nothing to help the president keep his promises or help the American people or help the forgotten men in poverty, on food stamps, and out of work. Look at these statistics. The Senate has confirmed in about a year, since January, only 175 of President Trump civilian nominees. Guess what? Two hundred and twenty nine have yet to be confirmed. How many vacations do these guys take? And during the similar time frame, President Obama had 359 nominees confirmed, over twice as much. And listen to this. Through September of this year, the House of Representatives -- and I have disagreements with them at times, at least they do their job. They have passed 308 bills that originated in that chamber and of those 308 bills that the House of Representatives passed, the Senate has passed 34. Beyond an embarrassment. Beyond a disgrace. These guys are the definition of failure. The poster children of failure. Now, Senate Republicans are no longer serving the American people. So you know what, Senator Flake? Bye. You know what Senator Corker? See you later. It is time for accountability. It's time to drain the swamp. If Republicans don't back this agenda, a tax reform, repealing and replacing, they need to get out of the way or resign or retire or do something. Because you know what? The only reason these people are now saying they are not running is because they know they can't win. And for all you never-Trumpers who were watching tonight, take a look at the side of your screen, they happen to be Donald Trump's accomplishments. Let's see. Pretty long list. Real, tangible, accomplishments, promises made, promises kept. So, what have you never-Trumpers done in this period of time? Have you helped the millions of forgotten men and women of this country that are suffering? Well, the answers are simple. You've done nothing other than help the Democrats obstruct the president at every single turn. And you know what? Enough is enough. Now, we are going to have a lot more in all this breaking news. And I promise you, you don't want to miss a minute of any of this. When we come back, the heroes, investigative reporters who have been exposing the truth and standing alone and digging hard. John Solomon, Sara Carter. Plus, Victoria Toensing, she is the attorney for that FBI informant who is at the center for exposing this Uranium One scandal. We've got all of that.

I think that this will lead to an investigation that will expose and finally for once tell the American people and Congress what actually happened with the Uranium One deal, how far the Russians are willing to go. And the connections those Russians made in the United States. And that is going to be imperative. And there's so much there. It's like we've unraveled a threat, right? And it just doesn't stop unraveling. So, I think that the momentum needs to be kept up, Sean. People need to continue to look into this.

Especially Sean when it goes into territory that's classified. But I think that a special counsel can do that. They can look into this also, the House Intelligence Committee can look into a lot of these issues, oversight can take a look. Senator Grassley then tremendous as well. As far as asking the right questions and moving forward. But I think a special counsel as Victoria suggested, it is something that I have been hearing from sources. Something that they hope Attorney General Jeff Sessions move forward with."

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes. The main immigration laws says that you may not grant a visa to someone that you know has engaged in criminal conduct. And specifically, there's a section that says if you know they are involved in money-laundering. Well, we know the Russian nuclear official that was eventually indicted was involved in money laundering. That was a kickback and money laundering scheme. The Obama administration in 2011 and then again, in 2014. According to court records, not according to anonymous sources. Court records. They gave this guy two visas. Even though they knew he was involved in a criminal conspiracy. And I think that that's why these questions are surfacing. There is either a breakdown in the system or knowing in willful decision to let this people into our country."

Sean, I was talking to sources that deal with Russian intelligence. This is U.S. intelligence, U.S. sources that deal with the Russians often. The minute Christopher Steele step in to Russia to start talking to the KGB, former KGB agency and started digging into President Trump, they knew immediately who was funding it and they used it for this information. What's interesting here is that actually, the Democrats may be unknowingly were actually funding a disinformation campaign by the Russians. That is astonishing."

And I think tonight in many ways is only the beginning of a vindication I've been predicting has been coming. Victoria, great job. I'm glad that your client pick the right person. I've known you for many years. You are tough. I would not want to go against you in a courtroom. We will have you guys back on tomorrow night. Thank you all for being with us. We really appreciate it. We have a lot more to come tonight. A lot more breaking news.

Also breaking minutes ago, Hillary Clinton's former spokesperson Brian Fallon, they are like racing, and Perez is the first. I didn't know about Christopher Steele's hiring during pre-election. If I had, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him. Oh, really? Here with the reaction is the author of \"Defeating Jihad,\" he makes America great again and coalition chief strategist, former deputy assistant for the president, Sebastian Gorka.

That is what the Russian collusion story has done for the DNC and for Hillary. Let's stop using the word collusion, because the evidence we now have is about subversion, it's about sabotaging the political process and it's about propaganda. In the cold war, the Soviet Union will be used what was called active measures to undermine our democracy. This is the Democrat Party, the Hillary campaign using active measures to undermine Donald Trump and the Democratic process in America. It's a shocking story."

And money paid to Hillary Clinton. And a sleeper agent getting close to Clinton. They never notified congress. They had a legal duty to notify congress. Congress would have stopped the sale of the asset."

Now we just have the evidence."

They are making a big deal about $100,000 worth of Facebook ads by Russia. Half of which occurred after the election. This is not $100,000 worth of ads. This is stuff to make nuclear weapons, being given to Vladimir Putin. Can we just ingest the enormity of what we are talking about now? This is a massive scandal."

An arms sales. All of that can be subject to a special counsel investigation. While you are at it, let's throw in the email case, because to me, as a lawyer, it's a clear case of the violation of the espionage."

Double a speaking fee. He is being paid by a bank that has a financial interest in uranium one. Then he wants to meet with Vladimir Putin and his wife signs off on the deal. And then the $145 million kickback. What other evidence do you need to know that they were not putting the security of this country as their first priority?"

      "utterance": "You don't need it. Look, 108 emails of TSSCI, highest level SAP classification on the private home server. We expect this from the Clintons. The most corrupt political clan in modern American history. The issue is how the establishment dealt with it under the Obama administration. How somebody who was a suspect in that investigation was allowed to be the counsel for Hillary Clinton. How the blackberries were destroyed and how the laptops that the FBI had were also destroyed by the Federal Government. That is a banana republic. Mueller would have to be fired and right now, e.g. Sessions has to have a national security special prosecutor."

We can take it. It's the millions of Americans we saw across this country who are addicted to opioids or who have lost a child to opioid abuse, who have lost their job, because their industry can no longer be competitive. There are people who are really suffering. If we have to take a few body blows and advocating for those men and women, I think everyone in my family and everyone in this administration is honored to do it."

I want to ask you and this is interesting, I thought this was a very important point. One of my biggest complaints about people in D.C. Is that they are not there to serve. They do not work hard enough for the people that elected them or put them there. If you work in the house that your dad now lives in, to me, I think that is one of the great honors in life, that you have the opportunity."

I am also cognizant that he is given me the privilege to think about how I can move barriers. Particularly when I think about women entrepreneurs, women of the workforce. Supporting the American family, job creation, these are things I'm deeply passionate about. Workforce development. A skills training. I feel blessed. I feel very lucky he is given me the opportunity to do that. People that make it about themselves in their own agenda, there's a lot of opportunism in Washington. Everyone is in service of the President. Look, as an American, I think we all have to be lending our voice to the discussions that matter in this country. We all have to want to have a seat at the table in areas where we agree. You can always find areas of difference. That is easy. In areas of agreement, as an American, I feel like it's my duty to see if I can be helpful and serve."
