They free up people inside the border patrol to actually go and, if you will, stand on the border and intercept people. They provide air assets. They do some of the backroom operation in terms of detention. They literally -- we had people in 2006-08 who were the dog handlers, so those dogs you see at the checkpoints, they were the people in the backroom dealing with the dogs so that there could be more border patrolmen who could actually arrest people. Under law, literally laws going back to 1807, the Insurrection Act of 1807, Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, the 1918 National Guard Act, National Guardsmen cannot arrest people.

It took the coyotes who bring these people from Central America a little bit of time to figure out how to exploit it, but there is a weakness in the law that allows, let's say we have got a family with children. The family and the children both show off the border. The family separates itself, comes across the border, gets picked up. They are called OTMs, Other Than Mexicans. Immigration lingo is really bizarre.  But the OTMs then get swept up. The child comes across, they are an unaccompanied minor, they get swept up. And then the family gets released because of certain defects in the law. And the child then can be released to their custody and they are all here in the United States.

And Pruitt's allies are calling in, and he's been very aggressive on the deregulatory agenda.  And the other thing they are saying to him is don't let the left have the victory. Don't give them the scalp because they'll never stop. That is what they are telling Trump. And that resonates with Trump. However, no one in the White House believes that this is the left's fault. They believe that Scott Pruitt is to blame for these stories. They're very frustrated with him. And Pruitt, I'm told, has assured John Kelly that there is no more ethical missteps to come.

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "They are two sides. First of all, they are sending mixed messages both publicly and privately. But the two sides are he has from their point of view policy-wise been an effective advocate for the president's agenda. But two is the signals they send privately that all the headlines have really gotten to them."

      "speaker": "SWAN",
      "utterance": "Right. And I even in the last hour have been told not to read too much into that statement by the president. I think more than anything he is deferring action. He's in a bit of a box here because unlike Rex Tillerson, unlike Shulkin at V.A. who the conservatives had no love for, a lot of conservatives love Scott Pruitt. And you saw there. Trump knows that. And Pruitt's allies are calling in, and he's been very aggressive on the deregulatory agenda. And the other thing they are saying to him is don't let the left have the victory. Don't give them the scalp because they'll never stop. That is what they are telling Trump. And that resonates with Trump. However, no one in the White House believes that this is the left's fault. They believe that Scott Pruitt is to blame for these stories. They're very frustrated with him. And Pruitt, I'm told, has assured John Kelly that there is no more ethical missteps to come. So I believe if there is major stuff, bad facts to come, it is really probably untenable."

      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Certainly not. The White House officials thinks there are more to come about his personal behavior. And they were on a tear yesterday communicating privately that he was on really thin ice. And the box that Jonathan talked about, yes, he is supported by the conservatives, although anybody who was President Trump's EPA director would carry out his agenda. On the other hand is, Trump's brand is I'm going to drain the swamp. And Pruitt is tarnishing that brand."
