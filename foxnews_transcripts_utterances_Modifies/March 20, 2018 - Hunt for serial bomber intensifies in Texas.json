It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" It happened again. Another package bomb exploded in Texas today, a state on high alert. This one set off at a FedEx facility near San Antonio. It all started on March 2nd, a 39-year-old father killed by a bomb mailed to his house in Austin. Ten days later, two similar attacks nearby killing another and injuring two. The fourth bomb went off Sunday, this one on the side of the road in a residential neighborhood and rigged with a tripwire. Two people hurt.  And early this morning, a fifth explosion at a FedEx facility, one worker was injured. An intense manhunt is currently underway before the killer or killers strike again. Here's President Trump.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kimberly. Good to see you all and be with all of you guys. You know, things took a very different turn today when these unexploded devices were found at FedEx distribution locations. At least one we have confirmed for sure.  That means now, instead of someone just placing these on someone's doorstep like we previously saw or putting it in a residential neighborhood with a tripwire, which is what we saw here on Sunday, this is where it gets different, because now we're talking about someone physically putting a package into the distribution system.   And so, they go to giant places like this one back here, multiple FedEx locations across central Texas being investigated. And we want to kind of break them down for you, OK? Because there is a lot of moving parts and a lot of conflicting information, frankly, that's out there. This is a big location right here in Austin, and it is on the outskirts of Austin- Bergstrom International Airport. Now, officials say that a suspicious package was found here this morning and it has closed the whole thing down. Spencer, if you could, my photographer, go on to the mobile command unit back there because we should point out there was no explosion here, just a suspicious package as all would say (ph). But, see that mobile command unit back there? Austin Police, a very big presence here in addition to ATF and FBI agents, so we've got that here. Now, the second location, that is in Schertz, which is near San Antonio, a Schertz distribution center, and that is where the package exploded this morning when it was going down a conveyor belt. You imagine those big Amazon distribution sites and the United States Post Office, all of the mail and packages are being sorted every which way on those belts. It was going down one of those belts, apparently, when it went off. And fortunately, no one was right next to it, so no serious injuries.   There was some initial talk about a second package that was found at that location. It did not detonate. But that it may be contained explosive material. Police have since walked that back, and they've said that now only one package was found at that location, the one that went off. Then, we've got a third spot, and that is in Sunset Valley, which is only two miles or so from Sunday night's crime scene. And officials in Sunset Valley have roped off a FedEx store there, and the thought is that the package that exploded at that distribution center down near San Antonio, that it might have originated from that location. Again, only two miles from Sunday's scene. So, it is a little confusing. You have multiple locations, multiple victims, and a whole lot of concern because, again, this is a city on alert. Some 420 calls of suspicious packages came in to 911 just in the last 24 hours, according to Austin police, and you can imagine that is straining the resources, guys.",

Five hundred federal agents, ATF, FBI, boots on the ground here, and that is not including all of the Austin police officers and the bomb squads that has been brought in from Houston P.D. and the rest. So, they're flooding it with resources so they can follow up on every single one of these tips. But the primary message being sent to the public is to remain vigilant.

You know, we're used to doing that at, say, the airport or at a big public event, the Super Bowl, you know, game or something. However, not so much when you're in a residential neighborhood, or if you're in a McDonald's, or something, let's say.

The similarities they won't go into great detail with, because if they release too much information, as you know, say something, perhaps, only the bomber or the bombers would know themselves, they don't want to put that out there into the public so that people, A, don't copy the crime and, B, they don't want to jeopardize their investigation.

Because you're right, the first several bombings, the first three that started on March 2nd, one man was killed, and then ten days later, two people killed in a single blast. These were all packages that were left on a porch. They didn't go through a distribution center. They weren't mailed. They were just dropped off on the porch overnight. And then, the people open them or moved them and caused the explosion. The victims were African-American or Latino. And these were in East Austin, traditionally known as a lower income area, if you will. So, that's where that theory came out that they might have been targeting specific groups of people, a hate crime, something like that. But with the tripwire being put on the device on Sunday, police say that that meant it was designed to hurt anybody who discovered it, so not a specific person.

The challenge in this world is to somehow, like, fight this numerical significance where one person, a shooter, or a bomber, or a terrorist, can affect thousands of people, or in fact millions because all of the network coverage. So, he's already affected the world and it will be seen as a success. Meanwhile, what the real lesson from all this is that, you know, evil deeds succeed with proper planning, as long as you plan ahead. We still don't know anything about Vegas. We know nothing. And the reason why we don't know anything is because he planned for two years. That's why we have to plan. You know, a half a plan cannot go up against a full plan. Clearly, this is a planned event.

And so, the resources that are required in order to deal with things like this -- hopefully disrupt plans, if you can. But if not, then deal with the aftermath. Local law enforcement and state governments are having a big problem on their hands because they got a lot of resources, a lot of things they need to spend money on, and there's not enough money to go around. And so, the most important thing, one, is economic growth, which thankfully we have right now, but planning ahead because these types of things are going to continue. It's not just localized anymore.

To me, it looks like a serial killer that doesn't want to get his hands dirty. Someone that enjoys toying with law enforcement, someone who enjoys the gamesmanship of it all, and someone who I think is going to get caught pretty soon because there's video cameras all over these distribution centers, whenever you drop off a package, there's going to be surveillance footage. It's, obviously, someone sophisticated because they have the tripwire technology. So it's not an idiot. But it's not someone, you know, CIA, it's not that high level. It's, obviously, someone that gets the materials from a local store, from what we're hearing from the senators. Maybe an anarchist, someone who just likes death and destruction, it's really hard to tell. It's just sad because Texas and Florida, at this point, have suffered so greatly in the past year, whether it's national disasters, or these shootings, and these bombings.

Getting his face painted on cars? So why wasn't the killer nabbed despite all the red flags? What we saw was a county they did half a right thing: They saw something, did nothing. It's an ugly lesson. Half a right thing can be worse than one whole wrong thing for it pretends to be progress and that prevents real solutions. Example, more lenient school discipline has been hailed as progress. But is it? As National Review's David French reports in 2013, the Broward County School Board agreed with law enforcement to limit on-campus arrests. Did that affect this case? Could be.   But we know what went wrong, and it's time to right it. First, fire Israel. Has there ever been a more incompetent boob in law enforcement? He's a power-hungry political hack. And finally, let's create a database for sick people who are tagged in civil court based on testimony by officials, teachers, and so on. If you're on that list, then no guns. That's called a plan. It's not half a plan. And it's one that would have saved 17 lives.

He's always about parade routes and whether he can get a picture with a politician. He's not liked among the people on the ground there. So what he did instead, he brought all his flunky friends from softer law enforcement background and put them in charge of places like Parkland. And you see what happened, there's poor training, there's poor reaction time. And the shooting in Maryland today is interesting because it was done with a pistol.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" It happened again. Another package bomb exploded in Texas today, a state on high alert. This one set off at a FedEx facility near San Antonio. It all started on March 2nd, a 39-year-old father killed by a bomb mailed to his house in Austin. Ten days later, two similar attacks nearby killing another and injuring two. The fourth bomb went off Sunday, this one on the side of the road in a residential neighborhood and rigged with a tripwire. Two people hurt. And early this morning, a fifth explosion at a FedEx facility, one worker was injured. An intense manhunt is currently underway before the killer or killers strike again. Here's President Trump."

      "utterance": "Hey, Kimberly. Good to see you all and be with all of you guys. You know, things took a very different turn today when these unexploded devices were found at FedEx distribution locations. At least one we have confirmed for sure. That means now, instead of someone just placing these on someone's doorstep like we previously saw or putting it in a residential neighborhood with a tripwire, which is what we saw here on Sunday, this is where it gets different, because now we're talking about someone physically putting a package into the distribution system. And so, they go to giant places like this one back here, multiple FedEx locations across central Texas being investigated. And we want to kind of break them down for you, OK? Because there is a lot of moving parts and a lot of conflicting information, frankly, that's out there. This is a big location right here in Austin, and it is on the outskirts of Austin- Bergstrom International Airport. Now, officials say that a suspicious package was found here this morning and it has closed the whole thing down. Spencer, if you could, my photographer, go on to the mobile command unit back there because we should point out there was no explosion here, just a suspicious package as all would say (ph). But, see that mobile command unit back there? Austin Police, a very big presence here in addition to ATF and FBI agents, so we've got that here. Now, the second location, that is in Schertz, which is near San Antonio, a Schertz distribution center, and that is where the package exploded this morning when it was going down a conveyor belt. You imagine those big Amazon distribution sites and the United States Post Office, all of the mail and packages are being sorted every which way on those belts. It was going down one of those belts, apparently, when it went off. And fortunately, no one was right next to it, so no serious injuries. There was some initial talk about a second package that was found at that location. It did not detonate. But that it may be contained explosive material. Police have since walked that back, and they've said that now only one package was found at that location, the one that went off. Then, we've got a third spot, and that is in Sunset Valley, which is only two miles or so from Sunday night's crime scene. And officials in Sunset Valley have roped off a FedEx store there, and the thought is that the package that exploded at that distribution center down near San Antonio, that it might have originated from that location. Again, only two miles from Sunday's scene. So, it is a little confusing. You have multiple locations, multiple victims, and a whole lot of concern because, again, this is a city on alert. Some 420 calls of suspicious packages came in to 911 just in the last 24 hours, according to Austin police, and you can imagine that is straining the resources, guys."

      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Casey, what is the -- what's the advice to the citizens there because, I mean, 420 packages, if you get that many calls is going to take a while for the police to get there."

    {
      "speaker": "STEGALL",
      "utterance": "Right. But they are wanting to make sure that they docked all of their I's and cross their T's, which is why Governor Abbott, the governor of Texas, and others have diverted a lot of law-enforcement resources here. There are more than 500 federal agents alone. Five hundred federal agents, ATF, FBI, boots on the ground here, and that is not including all of the Austin police officers and the bomb squads that has been brought in from Houston P.D. and the rest. So, they're flooding it with resources so they can follow up on every single one of these tips. But the primary message being sent to the public is to remain vigilant. And if you see something, say something. I was talking about this yesterday at our reporting. You know, we're used to doing that at, say, the airport or at a big public event, the Super Bowl, you know, game or something. However, not so much when you're in a residential neighborhood, or if you're in a McDonald's, or something, let's say. So, they're asking people if you see something, do not touch it, and call police so they can come follow up on it, Dana."

      "utterance": "Casey, what about copycats? Do we know -- is this the work of one person or multiple people? Is there anything like that that is giving us some hint as to what's going on here? And I have a follow-up after you finish."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEGALL",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Juan, that's a good question because there is concern always with copycat crimes. And that's one of the reasons police say they're being very guarded with the information they release. That's why they say they're only similarities with the explosive devices that have gone off so far. The similarities they won't go into great detail with, because if they release too much information, as you know, say something, perhaps, only the bomber or the bombers would know themselves, they don't want to put that out there into the public so that people, A, don't copy the crime and, B, they don't want to jeopardize their investigation. So, right now, they don't believe that this is a copycat situation. It could be the work of one person or more, they say. Frankly, they simply don't know, Juan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Casey, just a quick follow-up, you know, initially, the two people who died were black men. And then, there was the suspicion on the part of the congressional black caucus that, you know, they should be identified as a terrorist act, and then you had the NAACP saying to the black community -- but then, the last two people injured were white. So where does that stand now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEGALL",
      "utterance": "Well, it kind of threw the whole, you know, targeting instance or motive, potentially, that was being discussed, kind of, out the window, is how I gathered it from law enforcement yesterday. Because you're right, the first several bombings, the first three that started on March 2nd, one man was killed, and then ten days later, two people killed in a single blast. These were all packages that were left on a porch. They didn't go through a distribution center. They weren't mailed. They were just dropped off on the porch overnight. And then, the people open them or moved them and caused the explosion. The victims were African-American or Latino. And these were in East Austin, traditionally known as a lower income area, if you will. So, that's where that theory came out that they might have been targeting specific groups of people, a hate crime, something like that. But with the tripwire being put on the device on Sunday, police say that that meant it was designed to hurt anybody who discovered it, so not a specific person. So that kind of took the weight out of that argument a little bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "All right. Casey, thank you. OK. We'll take it around the table. Greg, your thoughts on this, we have it laid out in terms of the facts and with the police and authorities know so far. Obviously, reluctant in the middle of an investigation to give out some of the characteristic or signature elements of the bombs and how they compared or they're dissimilar in some respect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Clearly, we don't know much from that. So, these events just -- it show, once again, how an individual or a group of individuals can command an audience and it's as contagious as it is alluring. It could be copycats. It could be one person. Media coverage focuses on it so heavily that it's just irresistible to continue. The challenge in this world is to somehow, like, fight this numerical significance where one person, a shooter, or a bomber, or a terrorist, can affect thousands of people, or in fact millions because all of the network coverage. So, he's already affected the world and it will be seen as a success. Meanwhile, what the real lesson from all this is that, you know, evil deeds succeed with proper planning, as long as you plan ahead. We still don't know anything about Vegas. We know nothing. And the reason why we don't know anything is because he planned for two years. That's why we have to plan. You know, a half a plan cannot go up against a full plan. Clearly, this is a planned event. And we have to learn, we have to plan against these planners. He who plans, wins."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, I was just thinking about -- I know, as of yesterday, they had 500 federal law enforcement officers on the ground in order to help. That probably has doubled. And it's not just happening in Austin. Or you have to be vigilant because copycats, if you have something on national media, copycats can happen anywhere in the country. And so, the resources that are required in order to deal with things like this -- hopefully disrupt plans, if you can. But if not, then deal with the aftermath. Local law enforcement and state governments are having a big problem on their hands because they got a lot of resources, a lot of things they need to spend money on, and there's not enough money to go around. And so, the most important thing, one, is economic growth, which thankfully we have right now, but planning ahead because these types of things are going to continue. It's not just localized anymore. It's not just going to just be in Austin American statesmen. It's going to be all over the world."

I just don't like how it becomes so racialized right in the beginning. But, I think, they're still leaving that open, but let's just put that aside. To me, it looks like a serial killer that doesn't want to get his hands dirty. Someone that enjoys toying with law enforcement, someone who enjoys the gamesmanship of it all, and someone who I think is going to get caught pretty soon because there's video cameras all over these distribution centers, whenever you drop off a package, there's going to be surveillance footage. It's, obviously, someone sophisticated because they have the tripwire technology. So it's not an idiot. But it's not someone, you know, CIA, it's not that high level. It's, obviously, someone that gets the materials from a local store, from what we're hearing from the senators. Maybe an anarchist, someone who just likes death and destruction, it's really hard to tell. It's just sad because Texas and Florida, at this point, have suffered so greatly in the past year, whether it's national disasters, or these shootings, and these bombings. You know, it just takes a special type of citizen in these two states to reckon with it. And Texas, like they always do, is doing a very good job."

And then today, I was watching Dana's show at two, and she had on an expert who said that, in fact, the detonation caps are different, and very difficult to obtain. And so, if you go and find the source, which is what Kimberly was just suggesting, of those detonation caps or detonation caps that were lost, that's going to be a big clue."

Getting his face painted on cars? So why wasn't the killer nabbed despite all the red flags? What we saw was a county they did half a right thing: They saw something, did nothing. It's an ugly lesson. Half a right thing can be worse than one whole wrong thing for it pretends to be progress and that prevents real solutions. Example, more lenient school discipline has been hailed as progress. But is it? As National Review's David French reports in 2013, the Broward County School Board agreed with law enforcement to limit on-campus arrests. Did that affect this case? Could be. But we know what went wrong, and it's time to right it. First, fire Israel. Has there ever been a more incompetent boob in law enforcement? He's a power-hungry political hack. And finally, let's create a database for sick people who are tagged in civil court based on testimony by officials, teachers, and so on. If you're on that list, then no guns. That's called a plan. It's not half a plan. And it's one that would have saved 17 lives. So, Jesse, this article, I think it was -- I can't remember if it was in The Federalist or National Review about how they decided not to send kids, like, to get involved with law enforcement, and because they didn't want kids to go to jail."

      "utterance": "It could have been. It started under the Obama administration when they didn't want to unfairly target minority students in public schools because a lot of them were getting arrested and it was having repercussions on going to college and things like that. But, at the same time, you have such an egregious case of misbehavior and dangerous behavior from this kid. If you're cutting yourself, if you're saying I want to kill someone with a gun, if you're throwing your mother up against the wall. If you're doing all sorts of outrageous things and you've been tried to be civilly committed twice, the FBI has been tipped off two to three times, the police have visited your house almost 30 to 50 times. It's not like there were laws and mechanisms in place to prevent this. So you can't point to the gun. Everything on the state, local, and federal level broke down. And you look at a guy like Israel who's taken zero responsibility. He cares more about politics than public safety. Apparently, he doesn't even discuss crime. He's always about parade routes and whether he can get a picture with a politician. He's not liked among the people on the ground there. So what he did instead, he brought all his flunky friends from softer law enforcement background and put them in charge of places like Parkland. And you see what happened, there's poor training, there's poor reaction time. And the shooting in Maryland today is interesting because it was done with a pistol. And an armed person was at the school and neutralize the shooter before he could do anymore damage. Now, life kind of gives you lessons. And to not look at these lessons is just not the right thing because you're not hearing the media talk about an AR-15. You're not hearing the media talk about school safety solutions with armed security guards because it doesn't fit their anti-NRA narrative. So people need to look at what happened in Maryland, as a solution to the problem."

That's a problem right there.

The Democrat is challenging Andrew Cuomo, who's seeking a third term. Early match-up polls put Cuomo far ahead of Nixon. And I think it's, you know, pretty unfair to say that President Trump was just a celebrity, since he had been involved in politics for quite a while and was a successful business person.

And because everything is going so great, society says, \"We don't need those training wheels anymore. So let's elect a Democrat.\" Case in point, Giuliani. Then you get training wheels. You take them off, and you get de Blasio. So you can't have a de Blasio or a Cuomo without the training wheels of the Republican before him.

And they found that a working mom clocks in, on average, 14 hours a day seven days a week. That's nearly 100 hours, which is equivalent to working two and a half full-time jobs. I'm telling you, it's true. So that's nearly -- I guess that \"Working Mother\" magazine says that moms only average about an hour and 7 minutes to themselves every day. That's all they get. Everything else is devoted to the family. So can you imagine that? And then single moms, working moms, that's a lot. That's why. OK."
