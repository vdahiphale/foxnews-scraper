This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" On a major news night, Washington. We have it all covered. Multiple fronts, Iran, impeachment and a lot more. And of course, Iran did launch more than a dozen missiles, the U.S. military forces in Iraq, a retaliation they say for last week's targeted killing of General Qasem Soleimani.  Now at this hour, the Pentagon is telling us that the ballistic missiles were fired from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi bases that host U.S. military personnel. Now it's still too early to assess all the damage. But a U.S. official is telling Fox News tonight as Sean said, there are no American casualties.  We'll be bringing you updates, important analysis throughout the hour from multiple perspectives. But first, I want to go to Fox News Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst, who is live from Baghdad where the sun has just come up. Trey, you've been up all night. What can you tell us at this early hour?",

      "sentences": "Laura, good evening. We saw the expected response from the Iranians, no one knew exactly what it was going to be, but it ended up being more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired from Iranian territory towards that military base. The al-Assad base in western Iraq. This is a base that does house many U.S. forces. According to our Lucas Tomlinson, over at the Pentagon, a total of 15 ballistic missiles were fired, four of them failed. One of them landed in the city of Erbil, the rest hitting that base. But as you said, no reports of American casualties. The good news out of this ballistic missile strike attack tonight from the Iranians.  What is different about tonight's attack from previous ones that we saw for example earlier this week in Baghdad's Green Zone to the left of me, there were some rockets fired by Iranian backed Iraqi Shia militia groups. These are smaller rockets and they're fired from within Iraqi territory often towards U.S. backed bases, but not from Iranian territory. This is a major escalation to what the Iranians have been doing before. What we have seen here in Baghdad tonight though a lot of helicopter activity overnight in Baghdad's Green Zone, a number of countries including the United States patrolling that area to ensure that none of those militias would launch a similar attack during the same time.  According to Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Zarif, it does appear that this round of retaliation is over the ball is now in President Trump's court. He has participated in this back and forth with the Iranians all week. Even today though, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and top leadership there have said, they are going to spill American blood. Again though, it does appear that this round of retaliation is over, but make no mistake, there are Iranian proxies across the Middle East.   We've spoken with many of them in places like Gaza that you have Hamas, Islamic Jihad, also in Lebanon, Hezbollah and Iranian backed militias in places like Iraq and Syria. They all threatened U.S. troops in the region or allies such as Israel. So, while this round of retaliation may be over, U.S. troops in the region and in Kuwait where President Trump has deployed more than 3000 American forces are still on high alert. Laura.",

And then as we found out throughout the night that it didn't look as bad as what had been initially expected. The President tweeting a short time ago, \"All is well. Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties and damage taking place now. So far, so good. We have the most powerful and well-equipped military anywhere in the world by far. I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\" We have no idea the timing of the statement or really what the president is going to say. But there is a belief among some high-ranking administration officials that what we saw from Iraq, Iran here tonight may have been an intentional miss, that they knew where the U.S. forces were housed. And even though they hit the al-Assad air base with 10 missiles and hit the base in Erbil with one, that those missiles fell far away from where U.S. forces were being housed.  And while there may have been some casualties among Iraqi forces, there were no casualties among American forces, which really would have changed the equation. So this is being potentially seen here and this is still in the early going as a potential face saving measure on the part of Iran to say, we did something here, but they didn't do enough that would invoke a really harsh and wide ranging retaliatory response from the United States.  Now, that said, the President could announce tomorrow morning that he is going to respond in some way, shape or form, certainly in the Oval Office this afternoon.

And Javad Zarif himself tweeted out that Iran undertook and concluded its response. It does not want escalation, according to Zarif, but it will respond when attacked. So, we'll see where this goes from here. But the early betting may be that it doesn't go too much further unless the U.S. decides to respond against potentially some Iranian infrastructure.

I think we've reached a point where that is not the case. I don't think that the press is so much sympathetic to Iran or sympathetic to Soleimani so much as they are hostile to Trump.

      "sentences": "Perhaps what American journalists are forgetting at this moment is things like, for example, when I was living in Baghdad for five years right. One of the Revolutionary Guards proxy forces, one of the Iranian militias in Iraq, their task was to hunt down every Iraqi pilot that flew missions in the Iran-Iraq War. And that commander who was trained in Iran, who was loyal to Iran, who was run by Qasem Soleimani, he killed, according to the U.S. embassy, 2,500 Sunnis. And his preferred method to kill them was to drill holes in their heads while they were alive. We would go into mosques, Shiite mosques where there would be meat hooks on the wall that the Iranian militias used to hang people there. And I remember interviewing a young Iraqi boy whose father was taken in the night by an Iranian militia, an Iranian backed militia, and I will never forget him holding my hand and saying, when they took his father from his bed, he had no shoes. And he ran and got his father's shoes and he ran after him. And the Iranian militia who were leading his father out said he won't need shoes where he's going. And the body of their father and a number of other Iraqis, like so many, turned up in a dumpster the next day. I lost count of the number of bodies that we covered turned up in dumpsters all across Baghdad. So what's odd to me is that there are many of reporters who have worked in the region, there are reporters who have been to Syria who know what the people of Syria have suffered. And Qasem Soleimani, one of the things he did, Chris Matthews said he wasn't operational. What is that based on? Based on what? Because Qasem Soleimani like to put up pictures of himself. The Iranians released pictures of him on the battlefield of Syria, on the battlefield in Yemen, on the Battlefield in Iraq. This was part of it. There wasn't an Iraqi or a person in the Middle East that didn't know the name of Qasem Soleimani. And perhaps the strength of the reaction from Iran is kind of an indication of how significant he was, because the Iranian government uses terrorism as a form of statecraft. They're the only government in the world that does that to that degree. That is why they were designated as a foreign terrorist organization. Why designate them if you're not going to treat them as terrorists?",

This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" On a major news night, Washington. We have it all covered. Multiple fronts, Iran, impeachment and a lot more. And of course, Iran did launch more than a dozen missiles, the U.S. military forces in Iraq, a retaliation they say for last week's targeted killing of General Qasem Soleimani. Now at this hour, the Pentagon is telling us that the ballistic missiles were fired from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi bases that host U.S. military personnel. Now it's still too early to assess all the damage. But a U.S. official is telling Fox News tonight as Sean said, there are no American casualties. We'll be bringing you updates, important analysis throughout the hour from multiple perspectives. But first, I want to go to Fox News Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst, who is live from Baghdad where the sun has just come up. Trey, you've been up all night. What can you tell us at this early hour?"

      "utterance": "Laura, good evening. We saw the expected response from the Iranians, no one knew exactly what it was going to be, but it ended up being more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired from Iranian territory towards that military base. The al-Assad base in western Iraq. This is a base that does house many U.S. forces. According to our Lucas Tomlinson, over at the Pentagon, a total of 15 ballistic missiles were fired, four of them failed. One of them landed in the city of Erbil, the rest hitting that base. But as you said, no reports of American casualties. The good news out of this ballistic missile strike attack tonight from the Iranians. What is different about tonight's attack from previous ones that we saw for example earlier this week in Baghdad's Green Zone to the left of me, there were some rockets fired by Iranian backed Iraqi Shia militia groups. These are smaller rockets and they're fired from within Iraqi territory often towards U.S. backed bases, but not from Iranian territory. This is a major escalation to what the Iranians have been doing before. What we have seen here in Baghdad tonight though a lot of helicopter activity overnight in Baghdad's Green Zone, a number of countries including the United States patrolling that area to ensure that none of those militias would launch a similar attack during the same time. According to Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Zarif, it does appear that this round of retaliation is over the ball is now in President Trump's court. He has participated in this back and forth with the Iranians all week. Even today though, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and top leadership there have said, they are going to spill American blood. Again though, it does appear that this round of retaliation is over, but make no mistake, there are Iranian proxies across the Middle East. We've spoken with many of them in places like Gaza that you have Hamas, Islamic Jihad, also in Lebanon, Hezbollah and Iranian backed militias in places like Iraq and Syria. They all threatened U.S. troops in the region or allies such as Israel. So, while this round of retaliation may be over, U.S. troops in the region and in Kuwait where President Trump has deployed more than 3000 American forces are still on high alert. Laura."

Now their networks in Iraq, in Syria, in Yemen and in Lebanon are all in chaos. The Russians called Assad to their airbase to meet with Putin today. All right. Assad was Soleimani's guy. All right. They were buddies. So, now the Russians are moving in there. There are all kinds of bad things going on. And Iran has plenty on their plate. They don't want to beef with us.

And if we thought that there was an imminent strike come in, the actual operational people are still untouched, and they immediately replaced Soleimani. So, all those things still exist. But now you've added on top of that a lot of emotion on top of that for retaliation. So, the risk is actually higher, in my view. But now, President Trump and I think that there is a red line, when an American is killed, I mean, how could he not retaliate and respond. But that's why we need to get those troops out of there, because by getting them out of there, that reduces our strategic risk. And it makes it harder for Iran to do something because if we don't have those targets there. What else are they going to do? Because their reach is very short, and our global reach is unrivaled in the world. And we can reach out from anywhere."

And remember, General Casey, who didn't want to - he didn't want to talk much about Iran back then.

I. believe that this may, in the short-term, put us at more risk, but in the long-term, it can create a wedge between Iran and their proxies and also at home, it reminds the Iranian people that they're buying guns for militants in Iraq and Syria, not eggs and butter for their own people.

If we are now in a position in Iraq, where we're supposed to not respond when we have Soleimani parading around the Baghdad airport, obviously planning something behind the attack on the embassy, they would have torched that whole embassy if they could have. So, if we're in a position where we can't do anything because it would trigger Iran, then why are we there? Then the situation is truly hopeless. If a country that is a sixth of our size, we have - 326 million people in United States. they have about 80 million. They are sixth of our size. If we can't retaliate, then what are we doing there? That's another way of looking at it. It kind of illustrates, I guess, Colonel Davis, what you're saying here. But it also is your point like, we're there. We thought we'd be out of there, we're still there. We get threatened. He's parading around the airport and we're supposed to just say, well, we're nothing."

John, now, the President just tweeting moments ago that he is going to address the nation tomorrow morning. Any clues about what we might expect?"

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "You know, I think you could draw a lot of clues from what we saw tonight, where initially there was what looked like mayhem unfolding in Iraq with all of these ballistic missiles fired at Iraqi bases that housed U.S. military forces. And then as we found out throughout the night that it didn't look as bad as what had been initially expected. The President tweeting a short time ago, \"All is well. Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties and damage taking place now. So far, so good. We have the most powerful and well-equipped military anywhere in the world by far. I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\" We have no idea the timing of the statement or really what the president is going to say. But there is a belief among some high-ranking administration officials that what we saw from Iraq, Iran here tonight may have been an intentional miss, that they knew where the U.S. forces were housed. And even though they hit the al-Assad air base with 10 missiles and hit the base in Erbil with one, that those missiles fell far away from where U.S. forces were being housed. And while there may have been some casualties among Iraqi forces, there were no casualties among American forces, which really would have changed the equation. So this is being potentially seen here and this is still in the early going as a potential face saving measure on the part of Iran to say, we did something here, but they didn't do enough that would invoke a really harsh and wide ranging retaliatory response from the United States. Now, that said, the President could announce tomorrow morning that he is going to respond in some way, shape or form, certainly in the Oval Office this afternoon. The President said, he was ready to do that. Listen here."

There was even some suggestion by the Iraqi Prime Minister and the Iranian Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, that Soleimani was there on some sort of diplomatic peace mission that Iraq was trying to broker a new relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Secretary of State basically laughed that off this morning and listen to what President Trump said about it this afternoon."

But the initial assessment this evening, Laura, the thinking is among many administration officials that this could have been a deliberate miss on the part if Iran fire some missiles out into the Iraqi desert, hit around the air base from which they say the attack against Soleimani was launched. And Javad Zarif himself tweeted out that Iran undertook and concluded its response. It does not want escalation, according to Zarif, but it will respond when attacked. So, we'll see where this goes from here. But the early betting may be that it doesn't go too much further unless the U.S. decides to respond against potentially some Iranian infrastructure. But the fact that there were no U.S. casualties tonight, Laura, I think is a good sign of where this may be headed in the future."

Get this, there isn't even text yet. So, here we are back in D.C. They're talking about having a vote this week on something to undercut and handcuff the President of the United States. They still haven't yet figured out what their text looks like. So, I would say it's the wrong answer. I think Speaker Pelosi putting out her statement and instead of thinking about our troops, hoping there's no casualties, sticking together as Americans first to take that political partisan shot at the President was wrong. I think she needs to do some self-reflecting tonight and as we go through the rest of this week, we should be working together as Americans first in our response and not going forward to her plan to undercut and try to take out the President."

Remember, General Soleimani, the terrorist was trying to pull the United States and Iran into war. That's why it was the right thing to do to kill him. However, we should not give General Soleimani in deaf, what he could not accomplish in life, and that is a war with the United States and Iran. I'm hopeful this was an intentional miss. I do believe if the United States seeks war with Iran, which the President doesn't, the American people don't. That, of course, congressional authorization would be required. That's in the Constitution, certainly not for self-defense. I think the President has been measured and let's hope that restraint wins the day."

I'm sure Death to America is part of that tune. And as reported last night, a lot of these folks are compelled to show up to these types of events. Now, this is all happening just hours after the country launched an attack. Whether it was a temped to save face and purposely miss or not, we don't know yet. But, you know, trying to at least pretend to look like they're reacting to the killing of Soleimani. Now, if you're just joining us, Iran fired 15 ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq that were at Iraqi bases. And a U.S. official told Fox tonight, there are no casualties. Now, Iran's Foreign Minister tweeting this during the attack after calling the U.S. strike cowardly. He said, we do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.\" This is -- Trump also said he didn't want to escalate this or have war today either.

And in this case, this person was the paradigm of someone who could be targeted for killing under the law. He was a combatant. He was a killer with a past history. He was going to kill other people.

Whether they are right or wrong, the absurd notion that it's an impeachable offense to make a decision that you disagree with, this was legally authorized more than any single strike conducted by the Obama administration, much more lawfully authorized than the killing of Usama bin Laden, the drone attacks, the killing of the American who was a propagandist. This was preventive, and this was a militant. This was a terrorist. This was in uniform. Everything that international law requires was satisfied here, and everything that the United States constitutionally requires was satisfied here. The previous congressman who was saying the Constitution requires consultation with Congress -- where? Show me anything in the Constitution that says that. The only thing Congress has the authority to do is to fund the military and to declare war. But they have no authority to be consulted by the president, who engages in a military act as commander in chief."

The country hasn't dealt with strength in a very long time, until my father came along. And how many more oil tankers need to be captured? How many more drones have to be shot out of the sky? How many more U.S. embassies have to have Molotov cocktails thrown over their walls? I could go on and on and on, but somebody finally has to punch back, and my father did that very effectively. And he did it with a man who has killed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Americans, and I'm very proud of him doing that.

So he's kind of left to deal with both administrations' messes here, yet there is also the concern that your dad was really popular, in part because he wanted to get out of this mess.

We should be taken that $7 trillion and investing it in our own infrastructure and our own country and our own education system. At the same time, he's not going to let jerks around the world push America around. And he also realizes that with so many of these nations, you actually have to deal with them using strength and not appeasement. And that is one of the things Biden never got right and Obama never got right. Again, sending $150 billion, do you know what, Laura, you know what that $150 billion did? It probably paid for the missiles that were just launched at one of our sites today. It didn't make them friendly people. They are still on the streets chanting \"Death to America.\" It got us absolutely nothing. You know what gets this country something? Strength. And that is what my father does very, very well.

At some point you have to put an end to it. And again, appeasement didn't work. And listen, my father was willing to take a very decisive shot the other day. I'm very glad he did. I think the world is glad he did, and he probably stopped a lot of terrorist attacks from happening. And so I thought that was very strategic, I thought that was very surgical.

I think we've reached a point where that is not the case. I don't think that the press is so much sympathetic to Iran or sympathetic to Soleimani so much as they are hostile to Trump. So they view, you may say, Soleimani as the far enemy. If Obama had taken him out there would be hosannas, celebrations, Obama is a genius. But since it is Trump, they want to mobilize the Soleimani assassination against Trump. So they are, in a way, willing to go to bed with the far enemy to defeat the near enemy who is a greater threat to their agenda here at home."

      "speaker": "LOGAN",
      "utterance": "Perhaps what American journalists are forgetting at this moment is things like, for example, when I was living in Baghdad for five years right. One of the Revolutionary Guards proxy forces, one of the Iranian militias in Iraq, their task was to hunt down every Iraqi pilot that flew missions in the Iran-Iraq War. And that commander who was trained in Iran, who was loyal to Iran, who was run by Qasem Soleimani, he killed, according to the U.S. embassy, 2,500 Sunnis. And his preferred method to kill them was to drill holes in their heads while they were alive. We would go into mosques, Shiite mosques where there would be meat hooks on the wall that the Iranian militias used to hang people there. And I remember interviewing a young Iraqi boy whose father was taken in the night by an Iranian militia, an Iranian backed militia, and I will never forget him holding my hand and saying, when they took his father from his bed, he had no shoes. And he ran and got his father's shoes and he ran after him. And the Iranian militia who were leading his father out said he won't need shoes where he's going. And the body of their father and a number of other Iraqis, like so many, turned up in a dumpster the next day. I lost count of the number of bodies that we covered turned up in dumpsters all across Baghdad. So what's odd to me is that there are many of reporters who have worked in the region, there are reporters who have been to Syria who know what the people of Syria have suffered. And Qasem Soleimani, one of the things he did, Chris Matthews said he wasn't operational. What is that based on? Based on what? Because Qasem Soleimani like to put up pictures of himself. The Iranians released pictures of him on the battlefield of Syria, on the battlefield in Yemen, on the Battlefield in Iraq. This was part of it. There wasn't an Iraqi or a person in the Middle East that didn't know the name of Qasem Soleimani. And perhaps the strength of the reaction from Iran is kind of an indication of how significant he was, because the Iranian government uses terrorism as a form of statecraft. They're the only government in the world that does that to that degree. That is why they were designated as a foreign terrorist organization. Why designate them if you're not going to treat them as terrorists?"
