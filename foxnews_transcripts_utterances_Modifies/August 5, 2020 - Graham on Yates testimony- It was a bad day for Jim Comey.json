      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, it's officially the 90-day mark. In less than three months, you are the ultimate jury and you will make the most consequential decision in our lifetime, especially for our kids and grandkids. America the world is literally on the brink. Freedom, liberty, capitalism versus radical, statist, liberty-crushing socialism. That's what happens in 90 days.  Do you want Joe Biden? Well, the ever confused one. Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, Bozo, Schumer, Pelosi running the country? Well, I do not.  Ronald Reagan warned that this nation, he warned us all freedom is but one generation away from extinction -- well, we owe it to our kids and grandkids to not be that generation that lets it become extinct.  And earlier today, Biden had yet -- well, another complete public meltdown while trying to just answer a simple question about his cognitive abilities that he brags so much about passing the test and I take them all the time. That full tape is coming up and we'll ask important questions about his fitness for office that the media mob, they talk about privately, Democrats talk about privately, but never publicly. Also, major breaking news out of the swamp. Sally Yates was just grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee where she accused Mr. Higher Honor himself of going rogue and was forced to admit that the FISA applications that she signed, the ones that say verified were fraudulent. And, by the way, knowing what she now knows, she never would have signed them. Senator Lindsey Graham with that update.  Also tonight, panic is set in among Democrats and the media mob. We're going to analyze the latest insane conspiracy theories, all straight ahead. First, we must ask the obvious question, the media mob, the Democrats, they're avoiding it like the plague. Now, I know for a fact, privately, they're scared to death about this. What is wrong with Joe Biden? What is going on with Joe Biden?  The question is this, does this 77-year-old man really have the stamina, the strength, the mental acuity, mental alertness to serve in the toughest most demanding job on earth?   Now, in 1984, well, similar questions were posed to 73-year-old President Ronald Reagan. That was during his reelection campaign, and here's how Reagan famously responded.",

At times, he doesn't even know what day of the week it is, what state he's in, and what office he's even running for. He's experiencing frequent bouts of irritability, anger, confusion. I'm not a doctor. I don't know what's going on with Biden but it's obvious that something is off, very off. And even though he barely leaves his basement bunker, he looks exhausted. Kind of looks like he needs a hot cocoa and a little nappy every day.  Now, given what we see, wouldn't it be a good idea for him to take that cognitive test? By the way, double a comprehensive physical exam, share the results with the American people. President Trump has already done that and more. It's an honest question at this point, and before early voting starts, we the American people deserve an answer.

Now, I spent an hour with the president, that's not a cognitive exam but at least that was in person that wasn't via a video screen and I got an impression of somebody that's very cognitively advanced in terms of the president in terms of Vice President Biden I want to bring up a few facts first of all over the age of to percent of all aging people over that age have cognitive impairment, have cognitive issues. I think the president is right to bring up that this is an issue that's on the table in terms of functioning and running the country, not only running the country, any advance job, a surgeon has to deal with that, a chef has to deal with that, everybody that has advanced work to do has to deal with that, 10 to 20 percent.  On top of that, Sean, let's add these facts, Vice President Biden in 1998 had two aneurysms repaired surgically before the modern, most modern techniques came in. Studies have shown that there's up to 50 percent cognitive impairment long term following those aneurysm repairs. Also matter of public record, former Vice President Biden has atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat. He's on blood thinners for that. A study, a major study called the Swiss atrial fibrillation study came out about a year ago, over 1,200 people studied, they found three percent per year even if people on blood thinners, Sean, ended up having silent strokes. And guess how silent strokes present, they present usually with cognitive impairment, with faltering, with inability to think clearly. That study, guess how the people were tested with that study? One of the major tests they use and the president got a lot of flack for this, by the way, but he was being very serious about this test, the Montreal cognitive assessment test, that test that the president took is one of the things they used in this study to see if maybe you had a small silent stroke.

Democrats that I know, they're all talking about it. The media mob, they're even talking about it privately, not publicly, because they're protecting Joe Biden. I think 90 days out of an election, they ask these questions about Reagan, fair questions. Anyway, tonight, more news surrounding Joe Biden's basement bunker campaign. Now, Biden will no longer travel to the DNC convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to deliver his nomination acceptance speech. Instead, he will make his reward from his home state of Delaware. This comes as many of Biden's protectors in the mob, they're begging him not to show up for debates. If Donald Trump ever get away with ducking debates, imagine the media outcry.  Meanwhile, President Trump is calling for more debates and I think rightly so. His campaign is asking for at least one to be moved up before early voting begins, which is fairly soon. Now, my prediction is Joe will continue to hide in his basement bunker as long as possible. He's a walking, talking liability. Many believe that his running mate -- well, and others around him like, oh, let's see, Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, Pelosi Schumer and company they'll be making the calls and making the shots. But tonight, Biden's VP list apparently, according to reports, down to two people maybe, maybe not, could be a head fakes. Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, both have significant baggage. Now, remember, Harris all but accused Biden of being a racist at a Democratic debate last year. Susan Rice, Obama's top CYA official lying about the Benghazi terror attacks on national TV on one Sunday five times. They knew better. She wrote the biggest CYA email in history on her last day when Trump was being inaugurated. Obama said do everything by the book, and -- as it relates to the investigation to General Flynn.

At least, he didn't make a total fool of himself. A quick story. My dad and I watching the first televised presidential debate at least in my lifetime, 1960, Nixon against JFK. Everyone said Nixon was good, my dad was a Republican. Everyone said Nixon was going to clean JFK's plate. He was going to wipe the floor with JFK. JFK could not stand against an experienced politician like Nixon. JFK not only showed up for the debates, but he was charming and Nixon sweated. JFK, you know, said that the pope wasn't going to take over the White House. So, you know, Catholics were OK to be president.  You know, the debate really set the stage for JFK's defeat of Richard Nixon who didn't recover as you know -- for, you know, eight long years, in exile. So I think that although Biden is having some problems communicating as slickly as maybe once he did, and I remember Paul Ryan, he did a good job with Paul Ryan.

Everyone saw his diminished capability then, and he was able to string a few sentences together move his way through a terrible field and secure the nomination. What will happen after three debates with Donald Trump, the only thing missing is the fact that there will be eight million people voting before the first debate happens. The president is right to say we should move it up. I hope they stick to that. The commission, of course, in the camp with Joe Biden probably will not. But this -- this will come down to who has the capability to lead us through this moment and it's sad to see where Joe Biden is. I don't think he recovers from this.

They've been maneuvering in this era of coronavirus. They've kept them in the basement, they've benefited from being out of the spotlight. And they've been doing really interesting things like, we're running for Texas, we're going up with TV ads. Well, they put up $65,000 worth of TV ads. We're going to Ohio and we're going to have a massive campaign and we've been announcing our first hires. They're hiring two people. You know, this is just -- you know, and the media immediately jump up and say Ohio is in play and Texas is in play because Biden is making a move. You have to take off your hat and say these people know how to lay -- laid it out there and manipulate the media to follow their -- to follow their story line. But strategically, I wonder if they're smart as they are tactically, I don't think so, because their strategy is Biden benefits most when he is seen as the normal alternative, the traditional Democrat alternative to the incumbent. And instead of letting him be that, they're pushing him hard to the left, with these speeches, with his rhetoric. You know, I'm going to end shareholder capitalism, I'm going to transform the economy, radical, revolutionary changes -- all of these words are coming out of his mouth and it causes I think accumulatively over the course of the next couple of months. It could, if the -- if the Trump campaign attacks it head-on and contrast, this could be Michael Dukakis 1988 all over again. Interestingly enough, I was taken -- our colleague Dana Perino interviewed Jill Biden yesterday, and she said, went out of her way to say, Joe has always been a moderate and that's always who will it be. Obviously, she's not in sync with the high command of -- the rest of the high command of the Biden campaign, which says let's just make him as most -- the most progressive president and president in history.

My point is very simple as Larry said, they won't go back to New York City, Democrats do not want to go back to New York City, and that is why Trump's message of law and order is very, very consistent, and Democrats in New York at the Hamptons are not going back to New York. Regarding Biden, look everyone knows, 50 years, very clear, has done absolutely nothing. What bothers Democrats is that in three short years, Donald Trump has done more for blacks, Democrats for this country than Obiden-bama for eight years. And that hurts people. That pains people.

In less than three months, you are the ultimate jury and you will make the most consequential decision in our lifetime, especially for our kids and grandkids. America the world is literally on the brink. Freedom, liberty, capitalism versus radical, statist, liberty-crushing socialism. That's what happens in 90 days. Do you want Joe Biden? Well, the ever confused one. Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, Bozo, Schumer, Pelosi running the country? Well, I do not. Ronald Reagan warned that this nation, he warned us all freedom is but one generation away from extinction -- well, we owe it to our kids and grandkids to not be that generation that lets it become extinct. And earlier today, Biden had yet -- well, another complete public meltdown while trying to just answer a simple question about his cognitive abilities that he brags so much about passing the test and I take them all the time. That full tape is coming up and we'll ask important questions about his fitness for office that the media mob, they talk about privately, Democrats talk about privately, but never publicly. Also, major breaking news out of the swamp. Sally Yates was just grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee where she accused Mr. Higher Honor himself of going rogue and was forced to admit that the FISA applications that she signed, the ones that say verified were fraudulent. And, by the way, knowing what she now knows, she never would have signed them. Senator Lindsey Graham with that update. Also tonight, panic is set in among Democrats and the media mob. We're going to analyze the latest insane conspiracy theories, all straight ahead. First, we must ask the obvious question, the media mob, the Democrats, they're avoiding it like the plague. Now, I know for a fact, privately, they're scared to death about this. What is wrong with Joe Biden? What is going on with Joe Biden? The question is this, does this 77-year-old man really have the stamina, the strength, the mental acuity, mental alertness to serve in the toughest most demanding job on earth? Now, in 1984, well, similar questions were posed to 73-year-old President Ronald Reagan. That was during his reelection campaign, and here's how Reagan famously responded."

I know you're trying to goad me, but I mean, I'm so forward-looking to have an opportunity to sit with the president or stand with the president in debates. There could be plenty of time. And, by the way, as I joke with them, you know, I shouldn't say it -- I'm going to say something I don't I probably shouldn't say. Anyway, I am -- I am very willing to let the American public judge my physical AND mental -- my physical as well as my mental fitness, and to -- you know, to make a judgment about who I am."

This is just simply not normal or appropriate behavior and apparently, Biden even forgot that just a few weeks ago, remember, he was actually telling reporters and the American people that he was constantly tested for cognitive decline. Occasionally, of course, we'll admit, everyone gets words mixed up here and there, but this is now a daily occurrence for Joe Biden. And Joe Biden, this is serious, as confused as he is, he's running for the most important the hardest the toughest the most difficult job in the free world, he wants to be president of the United States of America, our commander-in-chief. If he's ever elected, his finger will be on that nuclear button. So, obviously, mental acuity, alertness is very important and yet, Biden seems to struggle even too numerous times to list on this show. You think I'm overstating the fact? We'll let you decide tonight. Take a look."

He always sees two people a day. All right, let's take some facts. Joe Biden loses his trend of thought often. He mixes numbers up often. He struggles to remember certain words. At times, he doesn't even know what day of the week it is, what state he's in, and what office he's even running for. He's experiencing frequent bouts of irritability, anger, confusion. I'm not a doctor. I don't know what's going on with Biden but it's obvious that something is off, very off. And even though he barely leaves his basement bunker, he looks exhausted. Kind of looks like he needs a hot cocoa and a little nappy every day. Now, given what we see, wouldn't it be a good idea for him to take that cognitive test? By the way, double a comprehensive physical exam, share the results with the American people. President Trump has already done that and more. It's an honest question at this point, and before early voting starts, we the American people deserve an answer. Recently for the president, he encouraged Biden to take the test when he sat with an interview with Dr. Siegel from medical aid team. Take a look."

Now, I spent an hour with the president, that's not a cognitive exam but at least that was in person that wasn't via a video screen and I got an impression of somebody that's very cognitively advanced in terms of the president in terms of Vice President Biden I want to bring up a few facts first of all over the age of to percent of all aging people over that age have cognitive impairment, have cognitive issues. I think the president is right to bring up that this is an issue that's on the table in terms of functioning and running the country, not only running the country, any advance job, a surgeon has to deal with that, a chef has to deal with that, everybody that has advanced work to do has to deal with that, 10 to 20 percent. On top of that, Sean, let's add these facts, Vice President Biden in 1998 had two aneurysms repaired surgically before the modern, most modern techniques came in. Studies have shown that there's up to 50 percent cognitive impairment long term following those aneurysm repairs. Also matter of public record, former Vice President Biden has atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat. He's on blood thinners for that. A study, a major study called the Swiss atrial fibrillation study came out about a year ago, over 1,200 people studied, they found three percent per year even if people on blood thinners, Sean, ended up having silent strokes. And guess how silent strokes present, they present usually with cognitive impairment, with faltering, with inability to think clearly. That study, guess how the people were tested with that study? One of the major tests they use and the president got a lot of flack for this, by the way, but he was being very serious about this test, the Montreal cognitive assessment test, that test that the president took is one of the things they used in this study to see if maybe you had a small silent stroke.

We need to be clear about that. But do you have the same observations I do? He looks exhausted. He can't keep his train of thought.

Democrats that I know, they're all talking about it. The media mob, they're even talking about it privately, not publicly, because they're protecting Joe Biden. I think 90 days out of an election, they ask these questions about Reagan, fair questions. Anyway, tonight, more news surrounding Joe Biden's basement bunker campaign. Now, Biden will no longer travel to the DNC convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to deliver his nomination acceptance speech. Instead, he will make his reward from his home state of Delaware. This comes as many of Biden's protectors in the mob, they're begging him not to show up for debates. If Donald Trump ever get away with ducking debates, imagine the media outcry. Meanwhile, President Trump is calling for more debates and I think rightly so. His campaign is asking for at least one to be moved up before early voting begins, which is fairly soon. Now, my prediction is Joe will continue to hide in his basement bunker as long as possible. He's a walking, talking liability. Many believe that his running mate -- well, and others around him like, oh, let's see, Bolshevik Bernie, AOC, Pelosi Schumer and company they'll be making the calls and making the shots. But tonight, Biden's VP list apparently, according to reports, down to two people maybe, maybe not, could be a head fakes. Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, both have significant baggage. Now, remember, Harris all but accused Biden of being a racist at a Democratic debate last year. Susan Rice, Obama's top CYA official lying about the Benghazi terror attacks on national TV on one Sunday five times. They knew better. She wrote the biggest CYA email in history on her last day when Trump was being inaugurated. Obama said do everything by the book, and -- as it relates to the investigation to General Flynn.

But the one thing I think Republicans have to be careful about is setting the bar so low that all Vice President Biden has to do is show up at the debates and put two or three sentences together, people say, whoa, it wasn't bad. At least, he didn't make a total fool of himself. A quick story. My dad and I watching the first televised presidential debate at least in my lifetime, 1960, Nixon against JFK. Everyone said Nixon was good, my dad was a Republican. Everyone said Nixon was going to clean JFK's plate. He was going to wipe the floor with JFK. JFK could not stand against an experienced politician like Nixon. JFK not only showed up for the debates, but he was charming and Nixon sweated. JFK, you know, said that the pope wasn't going to take over the White House. So, you know, Catholics were OK to be president. You know, the debate really set the stage for JFK's defeat of Richard Nixon who didn't recover as you know -- for, you know, eight long years, in exile. So I think that although Biden is having some problems communicating as slickly as maybe once he did, and I remember Paul Ryan, he did a good job with Paul Ryan.

Spygate, the Clinton-Epstein thing, we called like three and four years ago, never -- my sources are pretty much always spot on. I got some information off, let's say a few days ago or so, I don't want to nail anybody down. But Biden's in bad shape, Sean. Now, that's not a mystery. But here's the kind of new information, it's not that he's in bad shape, everybody knows that. It's that his bad shape is getting better on not an arithmetic scale but on an exponential one. The people around him are seriously concerned. In other words, it's not getting bad on a two plus two scale, it's getting bad on a ten times ten scale. That they're very concerned day by day about him. I'm not kidding, my sources have never let me down on this. This is real trouble for him. And I say that because that's why I kind of disagree -- Geraldo's not wrong. I mean his analysis about the debates are right. But I think he's wrong because I don't think he knows what I'm hearing, he doesn't, he just heard it for the first time.

Everyone saw his diminished capability then, and he was able to string a few sentences together move his way through a terrible field and secure the nomination. What will happen after three debates with Donald Trump, the only thing missing is the fact that there will be eight million people voting before the first debate happens. The president is right to say we should move it up. I hope they stick to that. The commission, of course, in the camp with Joe Biden probably will not. But this -- this will come down to who has the capability to lead us through this moment and it's sad to see where Joe Biden is. I don't think he recovers from this.

So, they're assuming that maybe that's the secretary of defense is involved in this. Maybe, you know, after all, this is going to be a military takeover. I mean, this is so ridiculous and so absurd that these people ought to be ashamed of themselves. I mean talk about stirring up emotion and fear-mongering. Jim Clyburn -- I'm terribly disappointed.

They've been maneuvering in this era of coronavirus. They've kept them in the basement, they've benefited from being out of the spotlight. And they've been doing really interesting things like, we're running for Texas, we're going up with TV ads. Well, they put up $65,000 worth of TV ads. We're going to Ohio and we're going to have a massive campaign and we've been announcing our first hires. They're hiring two people. You know, this is just -- you know, and the media immediately jump up and say Ohio is in play and Texas is in play because Biden is making a move. You have to take off your hat and say these people know how to lay -- laid it out there and manipulate the media to follow their -- to follow their story line. But strategically, I wonder if they're smart as they are tactically, I don't think so, because their strategy is Biden benefits most when he is seen as the normal alternative, the traditional Democrat alternative to the incumbent. And instead of letting him be that, they're pushing him hard to the left, with these speeches, with his rhetoric. You know, I'm going to end shareholder capitalism, I'm going to transform the economy, radical, revolutionary changes -- all of these words are coming out of his mouth and it causes I think accumulatively over the course of the next couple of months. It could, if the -- if the Trump campaign attacks it head-on and contrast, this could be Michael Dukakis 1988 all over again. Interestingly enough, I was taken -- our colleague Dana Perino interviewed Jill Biden yesterday, and she said, went out of her way to say, Joe has always been a moderate and that's always who will it be. Obviously, she's not in sync with the high command of -- the rest of the high command of the Biden campaign, which says let's just make him as most -- the most progressive president and president in history.

And Yates revealed even more of Comey's bad behavior, about his efforts going rogue to set up a perjury trap for Michael Flynn. Take a look. That was the ambush."

Here's what I can prove, that Jim Comey has become radioactive, people are running away from him like he's got the plague. Rosenstein said, no, I wouldn't have signed the warrant if I knew then what I know now. Sally Yates threw him under the bus, that he went rogue, that he set up General Flynn for, as you say, to manufacture a crime. So what's the takeaway here? That Comey set on top of one of the most corrupt investigations, Crossfire Hurricane, in the history of the FBI, and the rats are jumping ship. Bad day for Jim Comey."

The best way to describe his tenure is FBI director is he was rogue, that he ran every stop sign. There's no way in hell that he didn't know the dossier had been basically proved to be unsound by the Russian sub-source interview in January.

He lied in either case, somebody, because he's contradicting himself. Then we also know he signed another FISA warrant after his own FBI found out from the sub-source, none of this is real."

Odds are they didn't inherit it, they didn't marry it, they didn't steal it, they didn't win it in the lottery. They busted their butts for hours and hours over a period of years to become wealthy. And I thought Francois Hollande, the former president of France, learned that lesson when he imposed that wealth tax and a whole bunch of rich people left France and they repeal the tax. And if you live in New York City, you're paying a city tax on top of the state tax, the top 1 percent pay half of all the taxes in New York City and you've got an insane mayor who is defunding the police to the tune of a billion dollars and is painting \"Black Lives Matter\" in front of Trump Tower.

The whole key here is that Trump is going to win this election. Why? Because New York is the bluest of all blue states, the bluest of all blue city, those are law body Democrats who have left New York City. They don't want to come back to New York because de Blasio is the worst mayor in the city. Second place, Eric Garcetti. My point is very simple as Larry said, they won't go back to New York City, Democrats do not want to go back to New York City, and that is why Trump's message of law and order is very, very consistent, and Democrats in New York at the Hamptons are not going back to New York. Regarding Biden, look everyone knows, 50 years, very clear, has done absolutely nothing. What bothers Democrats is that in three short years, Donald Trump has done more for blacks, Democrats for this country than Obiden-bama for eight years. And that hurts people. That pains people. You know why? Because Republicans are not supposed to care about minorities and Donald Trump looks at this colorblind. He does what's in the best interest of America, period."
