Mixed signals this evening from his accuser and we are hearing that we may get an update on this situation any minute on where this whole thing stands. This as this story continues it slowly slide into the abyss as the dirty politics of our time are now giving us a crystal clear example of just how bad things really are.  We learned today that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford and their families are the subjects of vile attacks on social media, and apparently death threats. This is what happens when politicians hijack a claim that then takes the media and the public from zero to 60 in no time. Allowing an allegation to become a conviction in a hot second. Here is a story that was tweeted today by the Yale Daily News as just an example, we have several. It shows fraternity brothers of Brett Kavanaugh is back in the 80s with a flag that they're waving made bras part of a pledge thing.  Clarification tweets followed, fessing up the -- oh, by the way, not actually Brett Kavanaugh in the picture anywhere but somehow it's supposed to prove that he's guilty of something, I assume, by association. Seems fair, right? Also, on the other side, reports about Christine Ford's high school yearbooks on social media. Claiming that those Holton-Arms girls where she went to school were always drunk at parties all the time in high school. So, you get the idea on both sides, right?  The consequences of all this already becoming apparent. Here is Tammy Bruce, calling -- describing what she calls the revictimization of Christine Ford. Watch.",

The White House confirmation team here that is trying to shepherd through Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation has been planning for an appearance that he will make at the Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday.   Judge Kavanagh himself putting out a statement within the past half hour saying, \"Thank you for the invitation to appear before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Monday, September 24th. I will be there. I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee. I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible so that I can clear my name. Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity.\"  But whether that hearing will happen on Monday is increasingly in question, Debra Katz, who is Christine Blasey Ford's lead attorney sent a letter to the Committee, saying, \"She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. A hearing on Monday is not possible.\" Katz also appeared to drop her initial demand that the FBI launched an investigation into the allegation prior to a hearing writing, \"Her strong preference,\" note the word \"preference\", \"continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.\"  The Judiciary Committee, says that it has already been investigating this alleged incident. Interviewing Judge Kavanaugh on Monday, his high school friend, Mark Judge, and two other people all under penalty of perjury and felony, and has offered to let Ford testify in whatever forum makes her comfortable.  But Democrats today claimed, Ford is not being treated fairly. Listen here.  SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D—N.Y., SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: I consider that to be bullying. I consider that to be disregarding. I consider that to be something set up for failure. They would like a he- said, she-said, scenario.",

In Congress, some Republicans are now shifting their position.

Susan Collins who has been on the fence about Kavanaugh is urging forward to come forward. And Florida Senator Marco Rubio indicated a no-show by Ford would definitely be a turning point. Listen here.   SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R—FLA., SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: She shouldn't be criticized for not doing it. Number two, we can't force her and we shouldn't try to.

This has got to be discussed.\"  What concerns me is the turn of that. Suddenly, all of that changed and what I've been expressing the last few days is that it seems as though what Dr. Ford wanted has been adjusted and changed by people around her who are doing her no favor, and perhaps, who have betrayed what it is she wanted to accomplish. What this has turned out to be is a partisan attack on Judge Kavanaugh. And for me, as a -- as a woman who's worked to elevate women's lives for most of my adult life and as the former president of now and as somebody worked on the Dianne Feinstein campaign in 1992, is trying to make sure that women do have a fair shot at being heard, that we are to be taken seriously. But it's events like this that affect all of us, that send a message that only certain kinds of women matter because of course conservative women or Republican women who have also been in the public, complaining about their treatment by Democratic men don't get the same treatment.   And in this case, you've got -- when it comes to the issue of due process, the reason we are able to be taken seriously and we want to be taken seriously is because we can be trusted in telling our stories based on the fact that we're willing to enter a system where there is fairness. When we're entering into it, presuming that the man who's been under accusation will not have an ability to defend himself, then everyone comes under question. This hurts all of us, certainly, this issue is not a partisan issue, but they are making it one and this is why it becomes suspect all of the steps leading up to this hurt, not just Judge Kavanaugh, but certainly, Dr. Ford, as well. But the offense to all of us who have gone through this, who have either experienced domestic violence or sexual violence, to politicize this, it has been an obscene thing to watch, and this has got to be rectified right now one way or the other.",

As someone who wants a president to succeed, in his corner and hoping for his success, it's extremely frustrating. What should the president want us to be talking right now. The president should be wanting us to talk about the fact that the economy grew at 4.2 percent. That we added 210,000 jobs, that manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest pace in 14 years, wages are growing at the fastest phase in nine years. Unemployment -- the job losses are the lowest they have been in half a century and going on and on and on. What are we talking about? We are talking about his latest broadside against Jeff Sessions. What does the president think the media would, rather, the mainstream media would rather cover, is economic success or his latest feud with Jeff Sessions?

We've seem two interviews in the past 48 hours from people who were in classes with Christine Blasey Ford when she was back in high school saying they believe her story. And then when specifically asked whether they actually heard about this, they say no. Do they know anything about Brett Kavanaugh? No. But they believe her story because bad things happen to them. Well, that's not standard as to whether you know something that happened in this case. The idea that justice, truth, guilt and innocence, these things can be decided simply by an appeal to men are bad and women must always be believed, it's absurd. You have to have some standard of evidence before you destroy a man's life. You at least have to give him a chance to defend themselves. Democrats are now saying things like if he even defends himself he's insulting the woman.

We learned today that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford and their families are the subjects of vile attacks on social media, and apparently death threats. This is what happens when politicians hijack a claim that then takes the media and the public from zero to 60 in no time. Allowing an allegation to become a conviction in a hot second. Here is a story that was tweeted today by the Yale Daily News as just an example, we have several. It shows fraternity brothers of Brett Kavanaugh is back in the 80s with a flag that they're waving made bras part of a pledge thing. Clarification tweets followed, fessing up the -- oh, by the way, not actually Brett Kavanaugh in the picture anywhere but somehow it's supposed to prove that he's guilty of something, I assume, by association. Seems fair, right? Also, on the other side, reports about Christine Ford's high school yearbooks on social media.

The White House confirmation team here that is trying to shepherd through Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation has been planning for an appearance that he will make at the Judiciary Committee hearing on Monday. Judge Kavanagh himself putting out a statement within the past half hour saying, \"Thank you for the invitation to appear before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Monday, September 24th. I will be there. I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee. I continue to want a hearing as soon as possible so that I can clear my name. Since the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity.\" But whether that hearing will happen on Monday is increasingly in question, Debra Katz, who is Christine Blasey Ford's lead attorney sent a letter to the Committee, saying, \"She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety. A hearing on Monday is not possible.\" Katz also appeared to drop her initial demand that the FBI launched an investigation into the allegation prior to a hearing writing, \"Her strong preference,\" note the word \"preference\", \"continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.\" The Judiciary Committee, says that it has already been investigating this alleged incident. Interviewing Judge Kavanaugh on Monday, his high school friend, Mark Judge, and two other people all under penalty of perjury and felony, and has offered to let Ford testify in whatever forum makes her comfortable. But Democrats today claimed, Ford is not being treated fairly. Listen here. SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D—N.Y., SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: I consider that to be bullying. I consider that to be disregarding. I consider that to be something set up for failure. They would like a he- said, she-said, scenario."

In Congress, some Republicans are now shifting their position. Senator Jeff Flake who said he couldn't proceed in a confirmation vote unless there was a hearing now says, if Ford doesn't show up on Capitol Hill, the committee should proceed to a vote. Susan Collins who has been on the fence about Kavanaugh is urging forward to come forward. And Florida Senator Marco Rubio indicated a no-show by Ford would definitely be a turning point. Listen here. SEN. MARCO RUBIO, R—FLA., SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: She shouldn't be criticized for not doing it. Number two, we can't force her and we shouldn't try to.

Is that you've got clearly a politicized framework. A woman who wanted to tell her story. A woman whose initial comments even when outed was, \"I do want to tell my story. I want to come forward now. This has got to be discussed.\" What concerns me is the turn of that. Suddenly, all of that changed and what I've been expressing the last few days is that it seems as though what Dr. Ford wanted has been adjusted and changed by people around her who are doing her no favor, and perhaps, who have betrayed what it is she wanted to accomplish. What this has turned out to be is a partisan attack on Judge Kavanaugh. And for me, as a -- as a woman who's worked to elevate women's lives for most of my adult life and as the former president of now and as somebody worked on the Dianne Feinstein campaign in 1992, is trying to make sure that women do have a fair shot at being heard, that we are to be taken seriously. But it's events like this that affect all of us, that send a message that only certain kinds of women matter because of course conservative women or Republican women who have also been in the public, complaining about their treatment by Democratic men don't get the same treatment. And in this case, you've got -- when it comes to the issue of due process, the reason we are able to be taken seriously and we want to be taken seriously is because we can be trusted in telling our stories based on the fact that we're willing to enter a system where there is fairness. When we're entering into it, presuming that the man who's been under accusation will not have an ability to defend himself, then everyone comes under question. This hurts all of us, certainly, this issue is not a partisan issue, but they are making it one and this is why it becomes suspect all of the steps leading up to this hurt, not just Judge Kavanaugh, but certainly, Dr. Ford, as well. But the offense to all of us who have gone through this, who have either experienced domestic violence or sexual violence, to politicize this, it has been an obscene thing to watch, and this has got to be rectified right now one way or the other."

They tried to derail the hearing from the beginning. You know, so, are you confident that there hasn't been any effort to -- you know, alter her message in any way?

A great deal of his adult life when it comes to what he does for a living. That the FBI did this again recently for this position. This is a man who's been under extraordinary scrutiny for a public life that he's led for a clearly a number of years. So, we have a general sense of who he is and that's what we are now going on. He's testified under oath already. A number of people also always have. For women to be taken seriously, we've got to be able to be -- to play fair, and to not do what detractors say we do.

It's what we did when we -- when the President finally moved to the embassy to Jerusalem when that was such an issue. It's what he did when we drew a red line on Syria and stuck to it and actually told Asad, chemical weapons aren't going to be used.

And this has been one of the consistent strong points he has made from the very beginning which is why he wanted to get us out of the Iran deal because every country was giving her on a pass on all of the bad things that we're doing in the name of this deal. When the deal wasn't keeping them to be a clean actor in the international community, the deal was giving them a pass. So he got out of the deal he then said we aren't finished, there's more to discuss, Iran is going around to the Europeans trying to get whatever business they can. They're losing it left and right. It's time for us to have a real discussion. And that's what you'll see the President do when he chairs the Security Council on Wednesday. It'll be the most watched Security Council meeting ever I'm sure but he will be with all these heads of countries. And he's not just going to talk about Iran, he's going to talk about you know the chemical weapons issue that we had to work on this month alone to keep from happening in Idlib and Syria. He's going to talk about North Korea and what we're dealing with there. The fact that we had to take on the Russian incident and the U.K. with the Skripals. So you're going to hear him talk about these but with Iran, he does not think we should turn away. He does not think we should let our focus go away. He thinks so dangerous. He thinks they're issues and he thinks that the international community has to take that into account."

What it means is we both have to figure out how each defines denuclearization. We made it very clear that we want to see denuclearization with verification that we can look at that. And I think if you look at what's happened it's been successful in that we haven't had any ballistic missile tests. You're seeing Kim now socialize with the region that needed to happen. You're seeing the fact that even if he's talking with Moon, all of these things you know, if you take into those three sanctions packages into account, Kim felt suffocated. And the president when he felt suffocated, the president opened that door to him to say there's a different life for North Koreans if you want it. And I think what you're seeing is this is going to happen. It is baby steps. It's not going to happen overnight. We knew that but we can't accept task measures that would be doing it like previous administrations. We have to do this completely, fully, and we have to do it by making sure we're continuing the sanctions and continuing to hold North Korea's hand to the tire."

But two, that narrative that the Democrats are going to be picking up, that is the direct result of a disastrous lack of message discipline on the part of the president of the United States. As someone who wants a president to succeed, in his corner and hoping for his success, it's extremely frustrating. What should the president want us to be talking right now. The president should be wanting us to talk about the fact that the economy grew at 4.2 percent. That we added 210,000 jobs, that manufacturing jobs are growing at the fastest pace in 14 years, wages are growing at the fastest phase in nine years. Unemployment -- the job losses are the lowest they have been in half a century and going on and on and on. What are we talking about? We are talking about his latest broadside against Jeff Sessions. What does the president think the media would, rather, the mainstream media would rather cover, is economic success or his latest feud with Jeff Sessions? So the president of the United States continuously steps on his story and as a result, the media doesn't have to tell what I'd called the greatest story never told which is that the Trump administration is succeeding."

The way that Diane Feinstein handled this, she first saw her letter July 30th, she didn't reveal it to anyone else for six weeks and then finally they come forward two days after Brett Kavanaugh finally finishes his hearing six or seven days afterward. That's when we finally hear the entire story. When we first heard the story, she didn't give the name of the accuser, she didn't give of what actually happened and the accuser still can't give a date or a time as to when this happened. It's incredibly difficult for Brett Kavanaugh to even defend himself. And meanwhile you got Democrat saying well, we want to hear her story. And then the minute Republicans say well, why don't you just bring her, you know, like in front of our committee so we can hear her story, then Democrats say, hey, that sexist. It's sexist to want to hear her story. So if they don't hear her story of sexism and silencing her and if they do hear her story--"

I'm just shocked, you know, sort of given the history that we've seen in these cases. And you know, you've pointed out and I've pointed out, we don't know what happened. Nobody knows what happened in this case. And you know, obviously that's the most important underlying factor of what's going on here. But I'm shocked when you look back like the Duke case or the UVA case or some of these cases that have unraveled, that people are so willing to jump in with their opinion, not knowing her or not knowing anything about the actual facts. Watch some of these that was released today in support of the accuser."

Who the hell cares about a bunch of celebrities who weren't in the room and haven't been anywhere near that side of the country for what have to say about what happened here? I mean, what exactly like do they have to shed on any of this? They got to be more absurd than that. We've seem two interviews in the past 48 hours from people who were in classes with Christine Blasey Ford when she was back in high school saying they believe her story. And then when specifically asked whether they actually heard about this, they say no. Do they know anything about Brett Kavanaugh? No. But they believe her story because bad things happen to them. Well, that's not standard as to whether you know something that happened in this case. The idea that justice, truth, guilt and innocence, these things can be decided simply by an appeal to men are bad and women must always be believed, it's absurd. You have to have some standard of evidence before you destroy a man's life. You at least have to give him a chance to defend themselves. Democrats are now saying things like if he even defends himself he's insulting the woman. Ana-Marie Cox over at Wonkette and MSNBC, she suggested that it doesn't really matter whether Brett Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent. What really matters is whether he feels this woman's pain."

This is all insanity and again, it's demonstrative of the fact that if we really wanted to get to the truth of the situation, if Democrats really gave one crap about this, what Democrats would be doing is putting this woman in front of a hearing and calling whatever witnesses they could and then, they would be attempting to bolster her case. They would be hiding her and then suggesting that any questions to be asked or something undermining the justice system."

General Jack Keane who was one star general, the assistant division commander was -- he really liked our unit and like these live fire exercises. And so he and I were walking behind this squad and one of our soldiers, a fine soldier, special Smith, knocked out a bunker with a grenade and went in and sprayed it. Came out and on the top step he tripped. And we think as he came down, and he hit very hard, he was actually stunned for a moment, that his finger was in the trigger housing and he squeezed as you tends up when you are about to hit the ground and squeeze off around. And that round, an M-16 round went right through here, thankfully over the A.M. Petraeus rather than the letter A and army. I thought I had been hit from behind. I didn't see the soldier, Jack Keane had seen the soldier so he knew what happened. But the below is actually -- as it blows out of your back more than it is the actual hit in the front."

The hole in the back was much bigger than the very tiny hole right here. And I was very fortunate that it only nick an artery it didn't sever an artery, in which case literally bled out. Then you get into shock. I was telling the guys, don't worry about me, guys, we need to just do a quick after action review, prop me against the tree and get me some water to drink because you have all of a sudden have this raging thirst. And of course they are all rolling their eyes because they've realized I've been shot. And I'm not sure I'd fully processed all of this at that moment in time. I did remember saying, don't cut my gear, you know, it took me a lot of time to tie everything down here and I don't want to have to redo that. And of course they are thinking about it, how are we making sure this guy doesn't die."

And holding his hand actually, we flew into the post hospital to the emergency room, and that's where they really in a sense saved my life. Because what they did there was they took a scalpel and cut an x, he actually said, this is going to really hurt, and it really did. It was the one time in the whole endeavor that, you know, I truly sort of, started to just say, maybe this isn't worth hanging onto, because it hurt so much and I end up there."

And you know, I have had a reasonable amount of determination over the years and wasn't ready to give it up quite so easily. And now we're starting to think, gosh, what about the unit? This is a fairly traumatic experience, their new battalion commander, you know, has been shot and almost killed. And so I asked the chaplain in fact to bring the soldier down to Nashville to the Vanderbilt Medical Center so I could sit with him. He was a fine soldier and things happen, and so, you know, at the end of the day it was really no harm. I was a fairly inpatient patient, so they moved me from there back to the post hospital at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. And I was driving them crazy there. I said, you know, I think I'm ready to check out of here, I think this was the five or six day mark. And I said why don't I show you, I will do 50 push-ups for you if you want and then you can see whether that's enough."

It certainly gave a sense of an understanding of this enormous knowing uncertainty that almost all of our soldiers exhibited. Because the truth is that, what they wanted to do was just get back to their unit and the truth is, that's exactly what I wanted to do. But it was amazing that, you know, I would go and see a soldier who is in the field hospital who might have lost a leg or something, and he would plead with me, just, sir, don't worry about it, just let me get back to the unit. You know, something called the brotherhood of the close fight and, those that are really in the true firefight on the ground with each other, they are thinking about each other. And they have each other's backs and this is all about their ranger buddy or air assault body or whatever. And there is fierce loyalty among them, and a fierce desire to not let one's body down. And that does extend beyond that, but it certainly was always visible when someone was hit and they didn't want to be medevac to the states or to Germany or what have you, they just wanted to be treated there and get back to their unit."

Again, that was his Saturday. He wasn't on the golf course or somewhere else, he was out there with us walking this very intensive live fire exercise and he did that many, many more times with us.
