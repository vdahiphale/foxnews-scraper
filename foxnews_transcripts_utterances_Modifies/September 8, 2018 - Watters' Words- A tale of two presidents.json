I can't remember if Obama ever actually held a job in the private sector, but I don't believe he did. I certainly know he never ran a company, he never did a hard core negotiation.

I mean, the majority of America - red, white and blue, black, white, everything - voted for this man twice to occupy the Oval Office. So this country is not a bigoted country.

The unemployment is at records low. Our economy is at record high. Everybody benefits from that. That is true equality, the likes of which Barack Obama wouldn't know no matter what."

If you wanted people to have to show ID when they voted because you didn't want voter fraud, you were considered a racist. If you wanted a country that had borders, you were considered xenophobic under Barack Obama. And it's just the same old talking points that he used for the last eight years."

But let me just be very clear about who the President is because we have this anonymous opinion piece that was published clearly by nobody who has never spent any amount of serious time in the Oval Office and has never worked closely with the President, and this is what the left will never understand. Donald J. Trump does what he does in terms of securing America, in terms of unleashing the economy for all Americans. He doesn't care less of your skin color, your accent, where you were born. In fact, the stunning thing about this man, Jesse, he doesn't care if you voted for him or not. If you voted for Hillary, if you wanted Bernie to win, he doesn't care. If you are an American here legally, he wants you to be safe and he wants you and your family to prosper. End of story.

They claim they are conservative, I guess, and they are protecting the country against Donald Trump. So when the President gives orders that should be executed by staff, they prevent some of those orders from being undertaken, and the President addressed this conspirator within the administration the other day, let's hear what he had to say."

I think it has backfired seriously. Angry mobs, deep state radicals and their fake news allies. Those people are the best. They are the best allies. I mean, you look at The Washington Post or the New York Times, I can never get a good story. I mean, you look at this horrible thing that took place today. It is really - is this subversion?

Instead of looking at what happens, look at why the person would do what they would do. Why would this anonymous coward go to the failing \"New York Times,\" if their goal was really hold this fragile administration together. There's absolutely - it's nonsensical.

Now, they are going to sniff out this rat and they are going to boot him out and it's obviously going to inflame everybody at the White House, but it's deeper than that, Dr. Gorka. This person and his fellow conspirators, they weren't elected by the American people. Donald Trump was elected by the American people, so this person and their little gang, they are subverting democracy. They are unelected. They are like Strzok who appointed himself above it all and he is the one that is the great patriot and needs to protect the country against the President. He's the adult in the room.

It's not treason because you have to actually give tangible socket to our enemies. This is sedition. So sedition, you can look it up in the Merriam Webster, is the active or covert attempt to undermine a legal authority or constitutional order, and guess what? Donald Trump is the legal authority of the United States."

They have no right - they have no right to say \"I represent the real America, and therefore I get to sabotage the person that more than 60 million Americans chose to run the country.\" If you have a problem with that president, resign, start a political party and run against the next candidate in the next election. This is why Donald Trump won, Jesse, because of these people who think they are above Americans."

That's not how our democracy is supposed to work. These people aren't elected. They are not accountable.

And Bob Woodward seems focused on a lot of negative stuff and it's too bad because he is a very good reporter, but it seems like in this case, it's 100% negative. How do you assess it?"

Jim Mattis, General Kelly - they've all come out and denied the elements that are in the book, but as you've said, Jesse, the one thing you can't deny is that the Trump economy is roaring. Just getting news of over 200,000 jobs created last month and we continue to see people across the country doing better and I think that's going to matter a lot more than these fictitious palace intrigue looks inside the Trump White House."

It really is a shame. Now, let's turn to the Kavanaugh hearings because there is a major conspiracy theory that was circulating all over the internet. Look at this woman behind Kavanaugh. If you notice her fingers, she is making some sort of hand gesture, and the left on the internet said this is a white supremacist signal she was showcasing for the entire world to see. And it turns out, ironically she is of Mexican descent and her parents escaped the holocaust."

I think that Brett Kavanaugh has done a phenomenal job equipping himself to answer questions and prepare himself to answer questions and prepare himself for service in the highest court in the land and the fact that this is what the left has to try to draw attention, so it shows that Brett Kavanaugh must be doing a pretty good job answering actual questions."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It's true. He's running circles around these senators and making them look very unprepared, and it's pretty easy to do that because most of them are unprepared. Another incident that the left is glommed on to at the Kavanaugh hearing to distract from their inability to nail him with real questions, so, I believe a father of a slain young student at Parkland, I believe his name was Fred Gutenberg, went up to Kavanaugh after the hearing finished and tried to shake his hand. Now, this picture circulated again all over the internet and everybody said \"Kavanaugh refuses to shake the hand of grieving Parkland father.\" But if you watch the video, and if you see it in real-time, the father comes and rushes over to Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh is confused, and he doesn't really know who this guy is and this is after a hearing where a bunch of maniacs have been shrieking and causing mayhem and disturbing the entire decorum, so it's understandable why Kavanaugh wouldn't obviously embrace some strange person confronting him. How do you see this?"

      "speaker": "GAETZ",

And again, like if this is what they have to focus on, Jesse, the answers must be pretty good. But I'm glad Lindsey Graham gave Brett Kavanaugh the chance to address this publicly and to say that of course, he is a person who hasn't lived in a bubble. He has seen the pain, the pain in my state of Florida and across the country have been through as a consequence of violence and we all want to live in a society where that is less frequent."

I mean, I don't want Washington running my life, but I sure is heck don't want Silicon Valley running my life.
