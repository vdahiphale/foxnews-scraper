      "sentences": "All right. Tucker, thank you. And welcome to HANNITY.  We start the week with yet another big breaking news night. President Trump has been given a clean bill of health. He is now back on the campaign trail, will be all week, moments of go wrapping up a massive rally and I mean massive. It looks like 30,000 people if I had to guess, in Florida.  And in the upcoming days, the president will crisscross the country with the rallies in North Carolina, and Georgia, and Iowa, and elsewhere.  Hannity -- election correspondent Lawrence Jones is standing by on the ground in Florida. He has a full report about the events just earlier tonight. Lawrence will ask voters what they think of Biden's sneaky, sketchy, underhanded behavior on the issue of court packing. I'll tell you after, you don't have a right to know because that's what Joe is now saying that you, the American people, do not deserve to know he's position on these controversial issues until after the election. We will play you his new unconscionable remarks coming up.  And we'll also break down why this is such a critically important issue with constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley. Also tonight, we also have the file lights from day one of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's hearings. Judge Barrett delivered a stellar performance. The Democrats, as usual, looking small and petty in comparison, but with just  22 days until you're the ultimate jury and the election takes place, let's turn back to the campaign trail where Joe Biden has finally mustered up the courage to leave his basement bunker for a few hours.   In fact, Joe left his home state of Delaware today -- a rare occurrence for the weak, frail, cognitively struggling Democrat, and needless to say, he was totally overwhelmed. At one point, he confused Robert Byrd with Ted Kennedy. At another point, Joe could not even remember Senator Mitt Romney's name, referring to him as that -- that Mormon. Watch this.",

Joe wants to be the president of the United States of America, that would be the toughest job in the world and at times Joe doesn't seem to remember that he's running for president, or what state he's in, what day of the week it is.  Does anyone really believe that if elected, Joe Biden will actually be in control of anything? That brings up another scary thought, that would be his most radical. Vice presidential running make, Kamala Harris. Now, he knows his radical socialist base, they are going to be the ones in charge. That's Kamala Harris. That's Bolshevik Bernie. That's AOC.  And, by the way, they are saying what the stated plans are to fundamentally transform this country. Court packing, ending the legislative filibuster, what, starting the process to ban the Electoral College, adding D.C., Puerto Rico, as states? Oh, four more Democrats, so you have a Democratic run Senate in perpetuity.  It would be the biggest power grab in the history of the country. Then they want open borders, why, they hope all the 11 and 50 million people die got amnesty, they're hoping that they will vote Democratic. According to Chuck Schumer, he said it, everything is on the table. Now, at least one emboldened far left activist group, they've even posted online a guide on how to disrupt and shut down this entire country by force if the 2020 race is too close to call.  We'll have more on that coming up in a special report. But, first, here is what President Trump had to say about his struggling Democratic opponent and his radical base. Take a look.",

Now, if he -- I don't know what he does between the debates or doesn't do, but if he is able to keep it together for an hour and a half on stage, it's going to be the Biden's advantage. And therefore, the other thing the president needs to do is make Biden to the left, show how liberal he is. And there are many number of ways to do it but again, he's got to put Biden in a liberal box and let Biden show just how far to the left he is on taxes, on energy, on cutting police funding.

Tonight, as we speak, Democrats are looking for ways to rule this country in perpetuity with what will be the sink is to power grab by any one political party ever. In the last 150 years, they don't like checks and balances, they don't value coequal branches of government. And, clearly, they do not care about the Constitution. And, by the way, they don't seem to give a damn about your Second Amendment rights either. As per Kamala Harris, she would illuminate gun rights through executive fiat. So, it's no wonder Democrats are planning to destroy the U.S. Supreme Court with a practice known as court packing.  A friend of called me this weekend and he said, Sean, you know, most people don't know what it means. Let me explain it. It is a corrupt scheme where by a president would increase for the first time in hundred 50 years the number of Supreme Court justices giving that president an opportunity to nominate endless judges that believe -- well, not in our Constitution, that they could bypass the other two branches of government, the legislative branch, the executive branch, and basically rule by executive fiat. Things that Democrats could never accomplish legislatively or at the ballot box, they would then use a packed court to enforce on the country. If they are successful, that would be the biggest and the most destabilizing power grab in over 150 years. Now, the Supreme Court would no longer function as a coequal branch of government, it would no longer check the executive branch or the legislative branch. It would basically take over for the legislative branch. This would have significant, real, and extraordinarily dangerous ramifications, including the potential collapse of our constitutional republic. Joe Biden doesn't think you deserve to know where he stands on this critical issue. This is what he said again. Watch.",

And when you lose the Supreme Court as this moderating institution, this stabilizing institution, things can go really badly and really bad times. And this is one of those times. We've been divided as a nation before, but we've always had this stabilizing influence.

And that's the process you're involved in and the review of today's transcript found the Obamacare related terms will use a whopping 140 times. But I'd like to remind every American to ask yourself, how many of you lost your doctors and lost your plans and how many of you are paying less for your health care than you were paying before? Because millions lost their doctors, millions lost their precious plans, and guess what? States like Alabama, Wyoming, there's only one Biden Obamacare provider to choose from, that's almost 40 percent of the country. And let's also be clear: almost everybody is paying 200 percent more. Whatever happened to the on average, average families going to save $2,500 a year? Not one single Obamacare promised Democrats made, Biden and Obama made, was ever kept. And there's nothing illegitimate about this week's hearings. The president is the president. The president swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. The president, like 29 presidents before, during presidential election years, well, he did his job and made a Supreme Court nomination. And with the advice and the consent of the U.S. Senate, that nomination will hopefully elevate Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. And it is that simple. It is that straightforward. Here with more reaction, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Lindsey Graham. Now, I'll be honest, every possible -- not one senator had to be in the room. You made teleconferencing, Zooming, FaceTiming, whatever you want to call it, available to everybody. I understand that antivirals were cleaned out in the entire room ahead of time. I saw distancing of what, 12 feet between every senator. People have the option as I understand to get more tests if they felt the need to do so. Mike Lee was cleared by his doctor to be there, but yet, they tried to attack you on that issue. Your reaction?",

I'm afraid that the Democratic base is going to push these senators to declare war on this nominee. My opponent raised $57 million.

Or who knows what Joe Biden remembers what Joe Biden believes? That's the most amazing thing to me is the American people are seriously considering putting in as commander-in-chief somebody who clearly is less and less in touch with reality. So, a few weeks ago when he is running with the liberal nomination, of course, he's going to ban fracking. Now that he has the nomination, and he's trying to run for centrist voters, well, he never meant to ban fracking. And just as he said he was going to ban fracking doesn't mean that you should think he's going to ban fracking. Of course, the problem is we live in the age of videotapes where we have both he and Harris making very, very radical positions that are on tape, it's a little hard for them to walk away from.

He is now back on the campaign trail, will be all week, moments of go wrapping up a massive rally and I mean massive. It looks like 30,000 people if I had to guess, in Florida. And in the upcoming days, the president will crisscross the country with the rallies in North Carolina, and Georgia, and Iowa, and elsewhere. Hannity -- election correspondent Lawrence Jones is standing by on the ground in Florida. He has a full report about the events just earlier tonight. Lawrence will ask voters what they think of Biden's sneaky, sketchy, underhanded behavior on the issue of court packing. I'll tell you after, you don't have a right to know because that's what Joe is now saying that you, the American people, do not deserve to know he's position on these controversial issues until after the election. We will play you his new unconscionable remarks coming up. And we'll also break down why this is such a critically important issue with constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley. Also tonight, we also have the file lights from day one of Judge Amy Coney Barrett's hearings. Judge Barrett delivered a stellar performance. The Democrats, as usual, looking small and petty in comparison, but with just 22 days until you're the ultimate jury and the election takes place, let's turn back to the campaign trail where Joe Biden has finally mustered up the courage to leave his basement bunker for a few hours. In fact, Joe left his home state of Delaware today -- a rare occurrence for the weak, frail, cognitively struggling Democrat, and needless to say, he was totally overwhelmed. At one point, he confused Robert Byrd with Ted Kennedy. At another point, Joe could not even remember Senator Mitt Romney's name, referring to him as that -- that Mormon. Watch this."

Joe wants to be the president of the United States of America, that would be the toughest job in the world and at times Joe doesn't seem to remember that he's running for president, or what state he's in, what day of the week it is. Does anyone really believe that if elected, Joe Biden will actually be in control of anything? That brings up another scary thought, that would be his most radical. Vice presidential running make, Kamala Harris. Now, he knows his radical socialist base, they are going to be the ones in charge. That's Kamala Harris. That's Bolshevik Bernie. That's AOC. And, by the way, they are saying what the stated plans are to fundamentally transform this country. Court packing, ending the legislative filibuster, what, starting the process to ban the Electoral College, adding D.C., Puerto Rico, as states? Oh, four more Democrats, so you have a Democratic run Senate in perpetuity. It would be the biggest power grab in the history of the country. Then they want open borders, why, they hope all the 11 and 50 million people die got amnesty, they're hoping that they will vote Democratic. According to Chuck Schumer, he said it, everything is on the table. Now, at least one emboldened far left activist group, they've even posted online a guide on how to disrupt and shut down this entire country by force if the 2020 race is too close to call.

So, you know, you can probably get in an hour and a half out of anybody to survive, but when you see the real Biden under the real stress of a campaign, it comes out -- very different from a debate."

And so, the trick here and you pointed out the media bias, it's not showing this to the American people, the trick here is for Donald Trump to take advantage of one big event that remains, with 70 million and 80 million people watching and he has to deliver and let Biden fail. Now, if he -- I don't know what he does between the debates or doesn't do, but if he is able to keep it together for an hour and a half on stage, it's going to be the Biden's advantage. And therefore, the other thing the president needs to do is make Biden to the left, show how liberal he is. And there are many number of ways to do it but again, he's got to put Biden in a liberal box and let Biden show just how far to the left he is on taxes, on energy, on cutting police funding.

Tonight, as we speak, Democrats are looking for ways to rule this country in perpetuity with what will be the sink is to power grab by any one political party ever. In the last 150 years, they don't like checks and balances, they don't value coequal branches of government. And, clearly, they do not care about the Constitution. And, by the way, they don't seem to give a damn about your Second Amendment rights either. As per Kamala Harris, she would illuminate gun rights through executive fiat. So, it's no wonder Democrats are planning to destroy the U.S. Supreme Court with a practice known as court packing. A friend of called me this weekend and he said, Sean, you know, most people don't know what it means. Let me explain it. It is a corrupt scheme where by a president would increase for the first time in hundred 50 years the number of Supreme Court justices giving that president an opportunity to nominate endless judges that believe -- well, not in our Constitution, that they could bypass the other two branches of government, the legislative branch, the executive branch, and basically rule by executive fiat. Things that Democrats could never accomplish legislatively or at the ballot box, they would then use a packed court to enforce on the country. If they are successful, that would be the biggest and the most destabilizing power grab in over 150 years. Now, the Supreme Court would no longer function as a coequal branch of government, it would no longer check the executive branch or the legislative branch. It would basically take over for the legislative branch. This would have significant, real, and extraordinarily dangerous ramifications, including the potential collapse of our constitutional republic. Joe Biden doesn't think you deserve to know where he stands on this critical issue. This is what he said again. Watch."

And we know from Chuck Schumer, he would get rid of the legislative filibuster. We know Democrats want to add places like D.C., and Puerto Rico states. Why? Oh, they think they'll get four extra senators which would keep them in the Senate majority for perhaps perpetuity.

He'll end the legislative filibuster. We know they want D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood.

The Supreme Court is an extraordinary institution. As President Jackson says, it has no army. And yet, presidents have yielded to it, the American public has yielded to it, because it has credibility, because it has authority. If you packed the courts, you lose that. And when you lose the Supreme Court as this moderating institution, this stabilizing institution, things can go really badly and really bad times. And this is one of those times. We've been divided as a nation before, but we've always had this stabilizing influence. That's why it's wrong for Biden to refuse to answer -- many people of both parties will not vote for someone who is even considering a court packing plan.

But I'd like to remind every American to ask yourself, how many of you lost your doctors and lost your plans and how many of you are paying less for your health care than you were paying before?

The president swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. The president, like 29 presidents before, during presidential election years, well, he did his job and made a Supreme Court nomination. And with the advice and the consent of the U.S. Senate, that nomination will hopefully elevate Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. And it is that simple. It is that straightforward. Here with more reaction, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Lindsey Graham. Now, I'll be honest, every possible -- not one senator had to be in the room. You made teleconferencing, Zooming, FaceTiming, whatever you want to call it, available to everybody. I understand that antivirals were cleaned out in the entire room ahead of time.

Friday, I have no reason under the guidelines to be tested. It was a safe place to conduct the hearing but it was important. And let me tell you what I got out of this. Nobody has really mentioned this today. When Joni Ernst and Marsha Blackburn spoke in there 10 minutes, you could see the emotion coming from their soul. Why is this so important? Donald Trump nominated someone to the court, the fifth woman in the history of our nation, who is unashamedly pro-life, and conservative.

Now, the ever weak, frail, forgetful Joe, well, he continues to try and erase his past positions, let's see on fracking, telling a small group of reporters in Pennsylvania, and I mean, small teensy weensy little group, that he is not going to ban it. The only problem is, Joe, well, we have you and we have your running mate on tape saying the exact opposite. You said it during this campaign trial. That's the real Joe Biden in my view. I don't trust you. But we'll let our viewers decide."

Joe actually lied during the debate. I don't have the Bernie-Biden manifesto. Yeah, you do, all 110 pages of it. Here with the reaction, author of \"The New York Times\" best seller \"Trump and the American Future\", FOX News contributor, Newt Gingrich. OK. The guy flips and flops and flails in every position. He said -- when he was fighting for the nomination, he said it numerous times. Kamala said it numerous times. But now, I guess he's come to realize, oh, I may lose Pennsylvania and Ohio because of that. Your thoughts?"

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, how do you take seriously a guy who just this week explained that he's running for the U.S. Senate? Who couldn't quite remember Mitt Romney's name and referred to him, you know, that Mormon guy. You know, who knows what -- deep in his heart, who knows what Joe Biden believes? Or who knows what Joe Biden remembers what Joe Biden believes? That's the most amazing thing to me is the American people are seriously considering putting in as commander-in-chief somebody who clearly is less and less in touch with reality. So, a few weeks ago when he is running with the liberal nomination, of course, he's going to ban fracking. Now that he has the nomination, and he's trying to run for centrist voters, well, he never meant to ban fracking. And just as he said he was going to ban fracking doesn't mean that you should think he's going to ban fracking. Of course, the problem is we live in the age of videotapes where we have both he and Harris making very, very radical positions that are on tape, it's a little hard for them to walk away from. So, my guess is in the end, people are going to see, you know, this is exactly what his politics give him a bad name. They'd say that this guy is just lying."

We know they want D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood, and they want amnesty. Now, to me, this seems like what the Democrats are trying to do is what the statists have done historically and that would they want one party rule and they want no accountability and no chance that an opposition party could ever basically exist if they accomplish that. How dangerous is that in your mind?"

I think that if they could control, they will do everything they can to turn the entire country to California. To make it a one party system, a system of mass corruption, a system that's extraordinarily radical ideas. If you look at what's happening in San Francisco where, of course, the vice presidential nominee Harris is from, where anti-Pelosi is from, you look at what's happening whether it's the wildfires, running out of electricity because they want to invest in the system, brand-new efforts to control your life, between the increasingly Cuomo dictatorial position in New York, which I'm told, for example, led them to shut the gates of the Jewish cemetery, the kind of behavior that you don't associate with America at all. You have Cuomo in New York, then you have what's happening in California. That's the future if they win control of the country."

You know, the very same polls who are off massively, I just read a great article this morning that said, if you have believed the polls in 2018, we have a Democratic governor of Ohio, we have a Democratic governor of Iowa, and they went on this list and they said, the fact is the polls in '18 in the Midwest were as bad as the polls in '16.

There's just a couple weeks left. The guy is a con man. He keeps telling moderate Americans in America on the Democrat side that he's a moderate. He's not. And then he goes to liberals and tells liberals he's this huge liberal and then backs out on them too. He's lying to both sides. But most importantly the question you should ask yourself, if you really want to know who Biden is, who is -- who is he surrounding himself with? Because people are policy. Look at what he's got, AOC running his Green New Deal agenda, Beto running his gun confiscation agenda, Bernie running health care. I mean, who's he going to grab next, resurrect Lenin and maybe Khrushchev and have them run the economy? I mean, can you get more for the radical left agenda? This guy is the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. He's whatever you think he is. That's his deal."
