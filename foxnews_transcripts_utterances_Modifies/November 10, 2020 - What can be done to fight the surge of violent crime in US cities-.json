It was passed in 1799, never, ever been used to successfully prosecute anybody. Most people think it is unconstitutional and you can start enforcing it now. And yet, that is what the Obama Administration used as the pretext to investigate Michael Flynn, who was the incoming national security advisor for the incoming Trump Administration, and they ended up questioning - the FBI questioning Michael Flynn about all of this, again on the pretext of a Logan Act violation on January 24th, 2017, just four days into the administration.  So I think what Senator Cruz was clearly angry about was this double standard, because during a period of transition, and incoming administration will speak to foreign leaders.

That's going to come out potentially under the watch of the Biden Administration and it is going to have to have a Republican Senate to handle that. But Byron is completely right. The reason why Biden officials are not worried is because the FBI isn't trying to set a perjury trap for anything with Joe Biden or any of his officials. This was basically a pretext to have a perjury trap because they had cleared Michael Flynn in the crossfire hurricane investigation.  And so, even said - the FBI even said they were closing the case, and then all of a sudden they got these calls between him and the Russian Ambassador, and decided they wanted to interview about it to see if they could get him to lie.  And so they came up with the Logan Act as a pretext, but - they didn't need to interview him because they had a transcript of the call. There was no reason to do it except as a pretext to go after Michael Flynn, and the counterintelligence Chief of the FBI said, to see if they can get him to lie or get him fired or to get him quit. So this was a political hit job and unfortunately he walked right into it by lying about his conversation.",

But it's really not totally true when you have an outgoing president for a transition period and an incoming president. It is only natural that foreign leaders are going to want to talk to the incoming administration, to know what to expect. Some of them expect great things for their country from the United States under the new president. Some of them are worried about it. So, that's the process that goes on.

He slapped sanctions on Iran and took a tough position and that gave the Arab states confidence to reach out to Israel and enter into this process.

And if it did, would that state be enough to tip the balance in his favor and change the outcome of the election? Pennsylvania, by itself, would not be enough to do that. So the president would have to do something elsewhere, and I think the Supreme Court will be looking very carefully, the Supreme Court under John Roberts and what is happening elsewhere, because they are not going to want to rule on this if they don't have to. You know, to reverse the outcome of the election at a particular state. They might even issue a ruling that it was unconstitutional, but it didn't matter, but I think they would rather not rule at all if they don't have to, they won't, and Pennsylvania wouldn't give Trump enough electoral votes to overturn the result of the election, I suspect they will try to dodge it.",

Furthermore, the GOP super PAC, Winning for Women Action Fund, spent nearly $3 million supporting Republican female candidates, and so far, 24 women endorsed by the group have won their races, including incumbents with multiple additional races awaiting official results. But take a look at this. At least 15 new GOP women have won their congressional contest so far. And take a look at those names on your screen, also notice that it happened in blue states. Colorado, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, California, where we stand right now, 215 Democrats to 201 Republicans, and a lot of new female faces to watch for in 2021. Martha?",

The point is not that they were doing anything wrong or that Joe Biden, at this point as President-Elect, is not doing anything wrong, but it puts a stark contract the way that those individuals were treated across the board, Byron?"

      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It really does. The way to start the conversation is to agree with Senator Cruz, the Logan Act is dead. It was passed in 1799, never, ever been used to successfully prosecute anybody. Most people think it is unconstitutional and you can start enforcing it now. And yet, that is what the Obama Administration used as the pretext to investigate Michael Flynn, who was the incoming national security advisor for the incoming Trump Administration, and they ended up questioning - the FBI questioning Michael Flynn about all of this, again on the pretext of a Logan Act violation on January 24th, 2017, just four days into the administration. So I think what Senator Cruz was clearly angry about was this double standard, because during a period of transition, and incoming administration will speak to foreign leaders. It's what - it's part of a transition, and it is not a criminal act."

Marc, when you look at this situation, it raises - one of the questions on my mind when I watched this hearing today was it a lot of people are going to say this is too little, too late, right? These questions that could have been raised a long time ago, the subpoenas that could have taken place, all of this questioning just feels like it is kind of getting in right under the door at the last minute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, that's why it's important that the Republicans hold onto the Senate, because they will still have control of the committees and investigate this and John Durham is not done with his report yet. That's going to come out potentially under the watch of the Biden Administration and it is going to have to have a Republican Senate to handle that. But Byron is completely right. The reason why Biden officials are not worried is because the FBI isn't trying to set a perjury trap for anything with Joe Biden or any of his officials. This was basically a pretext to have a perjury trap because they had cleared Michael Flynn in the crossfire hurricane investigation. And so, even said - the FBI even said they were closing the case, and then all of a sudden they got these calls between him and the Russian Ambassador, and decided they wanted to interview about it to see if they could get him to lie. And so they came up with the Logan Act as a pretext, but - they didn't need to interview him because they had a transcript of the call. There was no reason to do it except as a pretext to go after Michael Flynn, and the counterintelligence Chief of the FBI said, to see if they can get him to lie or get him fired or to get him quit. So this was a political hit job and unfortunately he walked right into it by lying about his conversation."

Sure, and so the President of Egypt called President Trump the day after the election in 2016 to congratulate him, nobody claimed that that was wrong or that violated the Logan Act. What Flynn did was his took a call with the Ambassador of Russia, very late in the transition, at the end of December, and he talked about a specific problem between the U.S. and Russia, which was Russia's interference in our election. He talked about sanctions, and he talked about a specific vote in the U.N. Security Council. That is closer to a Logan Act violation.

Just simply that the Justice Department, the prosecutor for the eastern district of Missouri looked into this and he said the call was entirely appropriate because what Michael Flynn was doing was urging the Russians not to retaliate for sanctions, and so - what he was doing was in the United States' interest and there was absolutely nothing criminal about it. Michael Flynn made a mistake by not telling the truth about it, if he had just said to the FBI, yes, I talked to the Russian Ambassador, what about it, none of your business. That's what he should have done."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the crash of domestic politics and foreign policy. Clearly, foreign leaders are calling Joe Biden, and they are calling him the President-Elect. You know, what kind of ties this to what we were just talking about is Ben Rhodes, who you played talking, said in December 2016, that we only have one president at a time, only one president at a time. But it's really not totally true when you have an outgoing president for a transition period and an incoming president. It is only natural that foreign leaders are going to want to talk to the incoming administration, to know what to expect. Some of them expect great things for their country from the United States under the new president. Some of them are worried about it. So, that's the process that goes on. So when Secretary Pompeo said \"We are still counting the votes here\" well, he's right. They are counting the votes in - they are receiving ballots in North Carolina until Thursday. Still, foreign leaders are going to do this, no doubt about it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",

So, it is very helpful that Trump did that and what is a significant accomplishment by Trump, and it is going to help Biden. I don't think Biden is going to jump right into negotiations with Iran. That's going to be far down the line. I don't think he is pulled back sanctions on Iran immediately he's going to use the sanctions as leverage to get a future deal with Iran.

    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Just simply that the reason we are able to get the first peace deals in Arab-Israeli peace deals in a 25 years in quarter-century is because Donald Trump broke the mold when it comes to how the Middle East - how we deal with the Middle East? Unlike every other president before him, he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. He slapped sanctions on Iran and took a tough position and that gave the Arab states confidence to reach out to Israel and enter into this process. If Joe Biden reverses that, he's going to slow the progress of Middle East peace. We could have come in another Trump term, six, seven, eight, nine other countries make peace deals with Israel, they are poised to do it, and if he turns around the Trump policy in the Middle East, he could lose all that process."

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry is one of them, and he joins me now General thank you very much for being here, good to have you tonight.

What is important is that we get it right and that every legal vote that was cast is counted, and that the rules are followed and that the constitution remains the bedrock principle of our republic. That is the most important thing. Actually, the pressure is on the judges to make sure that they uphold the constitution, and so we don't feel any pressure. We just want judges to do their job when disputes arise."

The legislature has the responsibility to set the terms of the election as I understand it. And they allow that count to go on for three days after, assuming that the postmark was on that ballot. So where do you think the Supreme Court stands on that issue now, and do you expect them to get involved?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANDRY",
      "utterance": "Well, that is what we are hoping. We are hoping the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's disregard of following the U.S. constitution. The foundation of what we are talking about, again, is grounded in the constitution, where it sets the time, place, and manner by the legislatures, not the state courts, by the state legislatures, for the holding of federal elections. And what the Pennsylvania court did was basically disregard the U.S. constitution. In fact, I would submit to you that those Supreme Court Justices on Pennsylvania Supreme Court may have violated their own oath by not upholding the U.S. constitution in that sense. And so, our position is to actually have the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in now and to basically help resolve this dispute, and basically allow the votes to be counted based upon the way the Pennsylvania General Assembly set the rules."

This is not a very complicated or twisted law. Anybody could read it and understand the ballots must be in by 8:00 pm. So, that would mean any ballot received after 8:00 pm would be voided. It would be like you going to the polls and showing up at 8:30. They won't let you in to vote. Why couldn't they? You can make an argument, well I got late, I got stuck in traffic, but that is what the rule is."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, they are serious Martha. And the question you have to ask is whether the fraud that is being alleged or the failure to observe the election laws, which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania clearly tried to change without legal authority, whether that would upset the result of the election and give it back to President Trump? And if it did, would that state be enough to tip the balance in his favor and change the outcome of the election? Pennsylvania, by itself, would not be enough to do that. So the president would have to do something elsewhere, and I think the Supreme Court will be looking very carefully, the Supreme Court under John Roberts and what is happening elsewhere, because they are not going to want to rule on this if they don't have to. You know, to reverse the outcome of the election at a particular state. They might even issue a ruling that it was unconstitutional, but it didn't matter, but I think they would rather not rule at all if they don't have to, they won't, and Pennsylvania wouldn't give Trump enough electoral votes to overturn the result of the election, I suspect they will try to dodge it."

Arizona, Biden leads by about approximately 14,000 votes; you've got 61,000 votes outstanding in Arizona. Georgia, Biden is up by about 12,000. These aren't, you know, automatically populated numbers you are looking at here. Estimated 35,000 outstanding votes in Nevada, he leads by 36,000. You've got 33,000 outstanding votes, approximately, and President Trump ahead in North Carolina by about 73,000, with an estimated 134,000 outstanding. So a lot of people across the country look at that, and they say, you know, how can you tell me that nothing could change when all of these bows are counted, Brit, what would you say to them?"

      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, look it could. I mean, it is not impossible that it would, but not only - every state which you contest you have to establish fraudulent or illegal behavior was enough to tip the results state-by-state. I think, you know, I think that's a long shot. I think most people think it's a long shot. But look, he has every right to pursue this, in the last thing we need, it seems to me, is these people in the Democratic Party now saying he ought to shut up and concede after all they did to try to delegitimize his election four years ago. And after so many of them joined immediately joined the resistance to him and have fought him tooth and nail in every way, not to mention the farcical investigation into alleged Russia collusion, which ended up going absolutely nowhere, in terms of any criminal conduct on his part, or anybody else's part. So, I think those people should fall into a discrete silence now. Let this play out. We have systems for this. They work. They worked 20 years ago, and they'll work now."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

In moments, former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin will join us. But first, to correspondent Jackie DeAngelis on the red wave that we saw last week. Hi, Jackie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi. Good evening to you, Martha. Well, we are still watching the House and the Senate outcomes so closely, because they relate to the balance of power in the country. And while it's widely expected for the Democrats to maintain control of the House, we've all noted that more seats turned red than expected. Let's take a step further, there was even this red wave for GOP women in Congress. Consider this, six Republican women as you said, flip House seats away from Democrats, while only two Democrat women flipped a seat away from a Republican. Furthermore, the GOP super PAC, Winning for Women Action Fund, spent nearly $3 million supporting Republican female candidates, and so far, 24 women endorsed by the group have won their races, including incumbents with multiple additional races awaiting official results. But take a look at this. At least 15 new GOP women have won their congressional contest so far. And take a look at those names on your screen, also notice that it happened in blue states. Colorado, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, California, where we stand right now, 215 Democrats to 201 Republicans, and a lot of new female faces to watch for in 2021. Martha?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Really interesting. Jackie, thank you very much. So, joining me now, as promised, Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee. Governor Palin, great to have you with us. Thank you very much for being here tonight."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, what's your reaction when you look at those numbers, and you see the growing numbers of Republican women, like yourself, in Congress?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "I am very pleased. I'm very happy. We've -- my PAC in four years worked for women to get them elected also, but more than gender, of course, it's so important that these voters recognized their experience, their vision of what government actually should be, their records, their plan for what they will do in Congress. That needing to be respected now by leadership. Don't just check this mama grizzlies to the side and only call them up when you need fund-raising or you need something nice said about you or your policies, but utilize these women. They have such great amounts to offer this country. I'm very happy for them. And just really glad that they had the guts to get out there and run."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you know, you touched on something important there. You said, more than their gender, you're interested in their policy and what they represent, for their way of thinking, for their conservative way of thinking in Congress. And you know, there is this discussion about supporting women and that putting women into office is a very important thing, and of course, we all like to see greater representation -- bark back to your dog back there. But, you know, what happens is that when we see these covers on magazines celebrating women in Congress or taking over bigger spots on the hill, you know, it looks like this. The Rolling Stone cover, women shaping the future, which was after the 2018 election, it featured Nancy Pelosi. Omar, many women who wave -- who came in that wave. Do you expect that Rolling Stone will do a cover of these Republican women, as well to support women in office?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "No. No. No. if you're a constitutional conservative female, no. You will be kind of shunned by the lame stream media, but that's cool, that's OK. You know, it just makes you work a bit harder. It makes you certainly connect more with your constituents because they need to hear from you. You can't expect the media will relay accurately your plans, your record, your life story, so no. Don't expect that any of these publications will be friendly, but don't whine about it, either. You know, suck it up, cupcake, and go do your job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you ran against Joe Biden in the vice-presidential race, and you would have been the first woman vice president. Now, we have a woman president -- Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris. What are your thoughts on all of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "Well, my thoughts are I wish that I would have been the first the female vice president, I wish that Republicans would have been able to hold the White House for those eight years, but you know, I'm not going to favor anybody based on their gender, so, you know, we'll wait and see what Ms. Harris has to offer this country, if in fact, they are elected. Look, politicians lie. Men lie. Some women lie. But numbers don't lie. So, we need to get the votes counted so that we can even comment on things like how well the first female vice president do or not do. We've got to get the election counted and codified, and then we can talk about it."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "-- or something. I don't know, we have a lot of native villages though where conditions up here are pretty extreme, it's not really easy to get around, so perhaps that's it. But that's another thing Martha. Lieutenant governors and secretaries of state they are in charge of elections in the state. They need to make sure that they are on their games, that the voters can expect accuracy and fairness and in a timely manner, votes taken and votes counted. So, this I think is an awakening for what administration does in a state, we need to make sure each that state has a strong vision of election, strong secretary of state, and/or lieutenant governor, they are in charge of the elections."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Before I let you go, this is the voter, Fox News voter analysis, it showed support from suburban women, 59 percent for Biden, 40 percent for Trump, a lot of those women voted for President Trump last time around. Why do you think he lost some of them this round?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "I don't know. Because I haven't looked at that stat, to tell you the truth, so I can't tell you, because, you know, I hung in there with the administration, and I'll continue to do so until the very last vote is counted. Another thing, though. When I was the governor of the state, I knew firsthand how important it was to have accurate voter role -- again, lieutenant governor's offices are in charge of it, but Obama's right-hand man, Pete Rouse, he was acting chief of staff even for Obama, he claimed to be an Alaska voter, he voted out of Alaska. Give me a break. He hadn't been up in Alaska in a couple of decades except once for a friend's funeral, yet he was still on our voter rolls. That was cheating. That was some fraud. And yet, when I would bring it up, when I would try to make it an issue with the media, it was whoop, de do. Well, now, see, a real tiny example, but it's powerful. Pete Rouse, Obama's administration. You guys cheated, even if it was only one vote."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I haven't followed that story, but I do see that there are, you know, instances of people voting where they shouldn't be voting, people who are no longer with us who are voting, and we have to clean up these voter rolls. It is pathetic in a country like this that we do not have a clean way to run these elections in terms of who is on the roll and who isn't. And people just sort of, you know, pass it off, it's not a big deal, a couple here, a couple there, but it's wrong. It feels wrong."

The others who made the cut after Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put out an open call to create Joe Biden Joe Biden's dream cabinet. We'll show you who they voted for, coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",
      "utterance": "We are already beginning the transition. We are well underway, reviewing who we are going to pick for the cabinet positions, and nothing is going to stop that. I hope we are able to be in a position to let people know at least a couple that we want to before Thanksgiving."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called on her 10 million Twitter followers to name President-elect Joe Biden's dream cabinet. Many suggested Elizabeth Warren for treasury, Bernie Sanders for labor, Andrew Yang for just about anything, along with Susan Rice, Sally Yates, and even Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindmann from the impeachment hearings, remember him? Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was also suggested for secretary of state. Multiple people called for the Department of Homeland Security to be eliminated and one AOC follower suggested keeping much of the Trump cabinet, but adding that they would like to see Trey Gowdy as FBI director and Dan Bongino at CIA. So here now, Robert Wolf, former economic advisor to President Obama and Fox News contributor. Robert, great to have you with us tonight. Thanks, Martha."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "I do like some of them. I'm not sure it would be my cabinet, but I'm a big fan of Andrew Yang, I mean, he would be great for commerce or labor. I think someone like Stacey Abrams as attorney general, or at HUD would be exciting. My list would probably be a little more moderate, is my guess, than her Twitter followers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So here is what she said. Here is what Alexander Ocasio-Cortez said about the potential for Rahm Emanuel in the cabinet. She says, someone like Rahm Emanuel would be a pretty divisive pick. It would signal, I think a hostile approach to the grassroots and the progressive wing of the party. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "I mean, I'm not surprised that she would oppose someone like Rahm. I mean, he is a go-getter. I mean, he wouldn't necessarily be on my list, I think when she was thinking for him transportation, to me, someone like Mayor Garcetti, may be someone who is more current choice. You know, I think attorney general, you mentioned Cuomo, but this Deval Patrick, I think you were talking about treasury secretary, I don't think it's going to be Elizabeth Warren. To me, it will be more, maybe Lael Brainard, who was a Fed governor, or even a Janet Yellen who is the Fed chair, or someone like Roger Ferguson who was a vice Fed chair at some point, or even Gina Raimondo, who was governor of Rhode Island."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, if he picked Elizabeth Warren, she would be leaving that Senate seat, and they've got a Republican governor in Massachusetts, so that might not work out too well in the chess pieces scheme. Here is what Tim Ryan had to say, and I want to get your reaction to this. He said, our brand is not good. We have 70 million people who either hate us or are afraid of us or believe that there is a vast spread of socialism in our party. It's why we lost so many seats in the House, and some seats were a lot closer than we wanted. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "I love Tim Ryan, he is one of my close friends, and I actually supported him come along with Biden and Kamala for president. Those are the three I was excited about. I think Tim Ryan should be the energy secretary. He understands the move to battery, you know, battery cars, and the need to make batteries, but he also understands industrial America and the need to make sure we understand the transition from fracking, and I think tim would be a fantastic energy secretary. He also would be someone great in labor, he is close to the unions, but he is close to the workers. He would be perfect in a cabinet seat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
