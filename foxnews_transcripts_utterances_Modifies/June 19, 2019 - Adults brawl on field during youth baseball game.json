If I've got a subpoena for emails, if I deleted one email like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump.  The Democrat Party has become more radical, more dangerous, and more unhinged than at any point in the modern history of our country. They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.

He's had 16 rallies of this kind in the two and a half years he's been in the White House. So I guess people are saying like, hey, this is like a rerun. This is like a summer rerun. I've seen this act before. And there was very little new in terms of agenda. I didn't see anything new, in fact.   So he's done all this before, and the audience is shouting lock her up about Hillary Clinton. Wasn't she the candidate in 2016, Jesse? I don't get it.

When they if you guys go to the real time debt clock on online for California, it's literally like watching a livestream of dumpster fire.

I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul\".

Well, we'll tell Sleepy Joe that we found the magic wand. We accomplished more than any other president has in the first two and a half years of a presidency, and under circumstances that no president has had to deal with before. If I've got a subpoena for emails, if I deleted one email like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump. The Democrat Party has become more radical, more dangerous, and more unhinged than at any point in the modern history of our country. They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country as we know it. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. America will never be a socialist country. Remember, the only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box."

I would say that my initial reaction is he's in great position as most incumbent presidents are when they go to run for reelection, they're in great shape. He's probably is in even better shape than Obama was, and certainly than President Bush was, I think the war was a different scenario, not comfortable.

I mean, you're a news network. You're not allowed to turn it off. We can change the channel, we can turn it off, but you're a cable news network. Meanwhile, you have a lot of emotional responses from Morning Joe and, you know, calling him fat Elvis. And they're all trying to read Trump's mind. And the thing is, they're trying -- they react emotionally to this because the deeds favor Trump. If you look at the economy, the military, trade, jobs, and prison reform, all that's left that you can go after his personality and micro-flaws and tweets. But the unspoken truth when you go through the achievements that the -- I wish the media would understand is that Trump is a centrist. I went through -- I sat here, went through the list, strong military, center right. Prison reform, center left. Cut taxes, center right. Trade wars, center left. Rejection of military action, libertarian. Pro free speech, libertarian. Don't bring the flag, center right. Conclusion, he's right down the middle, and that confounds the media because they don't know how to handle that. He's exactly what America wants."

And, Juan, for a president -- an incumbent to launch his reelection campaign in front of 20,000 people in prime-time, the media did not treat it the way it would treat a normal president in these times. It was obviously blacked out on CNN after the first couple of minutes. MSNBC dump out of it. They didn't cover it seriously. And everybody was just responding with smirk. And they weren't discussing, you know, how he was framing issues, kind of the rhetorical flourishes he was using. How he was going to, you know, map out different items and he was going play to in the campaign. They don't discuss it seriously. It's all sarcastic."

And I have heard from all of you that, you know, the Trump's big advantage is he's such a great entertainer, that he's so different. Now you say they didn't treat him, the media, like other presidential, you know, incumbents, right, but he's not. He's different. Trump is different than anybody else. He's had 16 rallies of this kind in the two and a half years he's been in the White House. So I guess people are saying like, hey, this is like a rerun. This is like a summer rerun. I've seen this act before. And there was very little new in terms of agenda. I didn't see anything new, in fact. So he's done all this before, and the audience is shouting lock her up about Hillary Clinton. Wasn't she the candidate in 2016, Jesse? I don't get it. So they say lock her up, CNN sucks, build the wall, you talk about all the achievements, I think his number one promise have been to build the wall. Well, now here we are again, it's build the wall. So there's no agenda. Failure to deliver on the wall, on repeal and replace Obamacare, the middle-class tax cuts, if you're rich we could argue about how much the middle-class benefitted, Jesse. And Greg and I argued about this. But there's no question, the rich definitely benefitted."

And here are the continued themes that I've been working on. Here are want we could look forward to. And I think, frankly, it doesn't matter what he said because it was a success from the get go because of the thousands of hours he (INAUDIBLE) because people lined up for 40 hours to get inside that arena, and because the TV cameras showed a packed house. Juxtapose that and what happened last night with the two days of Democratic debates that are going to happen next week in Miami. And we saw a taste of it by candidates -- the Democratic candidates responses with Bernie saying it was absolute nonsense what he said. Really? Tell that to the people who stood in line for 40 hours, they beg to differ and so will the voters."

They don't even know. I do. It's emotion mask as thoughtfulness. Hyperbole pretending to be thought. This after AOC called holding centers at the border concentration camps. The same ones, you know, used by Fonzie back when everything was cool. Hitler or holocaust comparison, it's that patch of quicksand of the argument that every sensible person avoids, unless they're blinded by obsessional fury and work at CNN or Congress.

But this is all just a dog whistle linking Hitler to Trump, which is, as CNN says, an extreme example. Which leads to a question, who knows more about anti-Semitism, CNN or Israel? It's a safe bet Israel does. They just named a town Trump Heights. Not stupid heights, which would be a great name if CNN lived there.

And now we're running concentration camps on the border. I remember just a few years ago when Dick Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said the Guantanamo guards, Americans, are like Nazis, and all hell broke loose. This was during the Iraq war. And he actually had to apologize. And not one single Democrat came and defended Dick Durbin. Now, you have not only CNN, but you have other Democrats rushing to defend AOC. It's almost like they normalized these Nazi analogies. And Democrats should not be able to complain about this crisis at the border because they haven't lifted one finger to solve the problem. In fact, just last month they've tried to cap the bed space at the so- called concentration camps.

You can figure this out and you can figure out -- and help the people that need help and the people that are just there because the weather is nice. You can move them along. But what happens when you do that, with everything I just said, is that it goes through the media-politics filter and it says, oh, you want to put them in concentration camps.

I think the only reason that that problem and the issue will be solved is if we have someone in power that isn't a Democrat, isn't a bleeding-heart, and doesn't capitulate to the compassion war going on in terms of how to address this, Garcetti included. Now he just passed a $430 million policy for his City and County, 80% of which is long-term debt. You know how many homeless live in LA City - 36,000, and that is what the residents are paying for. When they if you guys go to the real time debt clock on online for California, it's literally like watching a livestream of dumpster fire. And yet, he's saying, \"Oh, we have to double down on the efforts\". Absolutely not. You need to stop wasting taxpayer dollars when the debt in California is 11,000 per citizen anyway. He allocated 26 million just to clean up Skid Row alone and 240 million to build more projects. Of course, that will not help. So what needs to happen is that common-sense approach that will only occur from the mouth of a Republican or someone that doesn't capitulate. And by the way, our last block we talked about how Nazis being thrown around, when a journalist in Seattle brought up institutionalizing those with mental disability or mental issues, those in homeless, he was called a Nazi by a Seattle City Council Member."

And if there were media cameras they're showing administration officials going in and doing that it - all hell would break loose and they would be smeared as just big brother nasty government bulldogs. They spent $600 million last year on the homeless crisis in LA. They raised taxes to do it and you know what happened? The LA homeless population went up 12%. So they spent more money and the homeless problem increased. What does that tell you? It's not always about how much money you spend. Look at the City of Baltimore, they threw so much money at education and test scores went down. They spent billions in Obamacare and premiums didn't go down. I mean, think about all the things liberals want to do, they throw more money at it and the problem is still there. So you have to wonder do the Liberals want to keep the problems going and tax and spend and run in four years on the same problem and feel compassionate and blame Republicans.

He spend all the time governing. You nailed down these trade deals. The economy stays hot and reelection takes care of itself. Or do you spend more time campaigning, making mischief in the Democrat primary, and labeling these guys and branding them early and often so they're damaged goods when they get to the general. I think Trump could chew gum and walk at the same time. And it's going to be incredibly entertaining and we're going to love it."

And so to me it's like he really hates it when the spotlight is not on him.

In a fetus with spina bifida, the tube that typically protects the lowest part of spine, it fails to close and that leaves the spinal cord exposed, which leads to a great deal of problems, including paralysis. Dr. Darrell Cass and a team of more than a dozen other specialists successfully performed a surgery on in nearly 23 week old fetus. And now joins other top hospitals in offering the lead prenatal care for those in need. I mean, pretty incredible right?"
