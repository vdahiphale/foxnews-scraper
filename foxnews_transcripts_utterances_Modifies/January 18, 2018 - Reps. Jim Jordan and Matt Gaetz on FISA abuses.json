Welcome to \"Hannity.\"  Tonight, in this hour, we're going to corroborate so much of what we have been telling you, I promise you don't want to miss a minute.  Breaking right now though, first, the House passes a short-term spending bill. It will now go to the Senate. And we are following the latest development as the deadline nears government shut down. By the way, government shut down is not that big of deal.  Anyway, the president also take as huge victory lap today in Pennsylvania on the economy. We're going to play for you what he had to say. But, first, based on today's events, I have a message tonight for the special counsel Robert Mueller. Your witch-hunt is now over. Time to close the doors. That is the focus of a very important news breaking opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right, huge breaking news tonight. Now, we have been telling you it's coming. It is now here. Stunning reporting tonight from Sara Carter that we are confirming with our sources.  Classified DOJ documents that members of Congress are now reviewing it shows widespread and extensive FISA abuses against the Trump campaign. And we have names.   Now, here is how it all went down. At the last minute at the House, they finally got literally within an hour, their subpoena requests approved by the DOJ. Members of Congress were able to get their hands on all these classified documents. Now, at the last minute, Rod Rosenstein tried to stop it by going into Paul Ryan's office. Paul Ryan would have none of it. Now, it is more disturbing than we ever thought. And at this hour, our sources are telling us that the abusive power is far bigger than Watergate. Remember, Watergate was a third rate break-in. What we're talking about tonight is the systematic abuse of power, the weaponizing of those powerful tools of intelligence, and the shredding of our Fourth Amendment constitutional rights that protect all of us against unlawful search and seizure. It is complicated but it's also simple. We're going to break it all down for new a way that I hope is easy to understand. Now, go back to the Watergate comparison for a minute. We have a group of people who tried to cover up the lead up to an election. They broke in. They stole things they shouldn't have stole from the opposition.   What we're talking about tonight is an abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we use to spy on people, except those tools were used against an opposition candidate, and a president-elect, and his entire team. And it was done not only under false pretenses, but with the help of Hillary Clinton. She bought and paid for the dossier that they filled with Russian lies, propaganda, salacious details that were never true. And that dossier was corroborated, we now know, by a long-time Clinton ally and sycophant. Now, here are the people that we're going to learn an awful lot about in the next couple of weeks. Pay very close attention. They are the highest ranks of the Department of Justice in your FBI. And tonight, we can confirm that the Trump-hating, Clinton-loving, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, they are at the nexus of everything and there is so much more information coming. Now, at the end of all of this, we're going to learn an awful lot beyond any shadow of a doubt that the special counsel, Robert Mueller and his band of Democratic witch-hunters never should have been appointed and they need to be disbanded immediately. Now, here's why Strzok and Page are connected to everything.  What we're learning tonight is that these two Trump-hating individuals, they are at the heart and soul and center of it all. Remember, we still have 9,600 texts of theirs between each other that we haven't seen yet. And we're expecting that some of them will be released tomorrow. And everything that we have learned so far about Strzok and Page is now beginning to make sense. Let me explain. They called Trump an idiot, a loathsome human and said F Trump. And, by the way, the meaning by behind this particular text message is now tonight coming into clear focus.   Remember Strzok, he wrote his mistress, Page, \"I want to believe the path that you threw out for consideration in Andy's office that there is no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\" Now, we believe here at Fox that Andy, mentioned in that text, is the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. And this text message was sent on August the 15th of 2016. This is a very critical time frame and here's why. Around the exact same time that Strzok and Page are talking about their insurance policy, well, the Obama administration officials are going to the FISA court to get a warrant on Carter Page.  Stay with me. They are using Carter Page as a pretext to really spy on the Trump campaign. And now, it is transparent to all of us what Strzok was saying to page when they spoke about the insurance policy with Andy -- we believe Andrew McCabe in that text message, needing that insurance policy. Now, everyone seems to forget Lisa Page is a key legal counselor for McCabe. See how it all ties together? And, listen, when they are sending the text messages about an insurance policy, they are also going to the FISA court.  Now, sources are telling us tonight that the first time they tried to get the FISA warrant against Carter Page was in the summer. It was denied. Then the second time they tried to get it in the early fall, they used the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier. And this time, they were successful for one reason. The fake news dossier put the request over the top. It was the final nail in the coffin to get the FISA warrant out there against Trump.  Now, you can forget about the reporting about George Papadopoulos running his mouth at a nightclub to an Australian diplomat. Any lawyer is going to tell you that that four-way hearsay, that's never going to hold up in court. Hearsay doesn't hold up in court. So, back to Carter Page and the FISA warrant on him. It's a very important variety of things happening here. At that point the Obama administration, they should have known that the dossier was totally false, full of salacious Russian lies. It should have been suspect on its face value. Now, Fusion GPS, they never even verified what was in that dossier, never tried, because they trusted Christopher Steele who they hired, who put it all together. The same Christopher Steele would reportedly, you know, pay Russians to get information. And by his very nature, think about it, he has a former MI-6 guy. He was highly skilled in deception.  So, tonight, sources who were familiar with this classified information, only Congress can see it right now. They are telling me that it's a case of show me the man and I will show you the crime.   All right. Now that you are up to speed on that part. We have a lot of questions for key people involved. Now, we need to know what all of these top Obama administration officials knew and when they found out, and exactly how they were involved in spying on an opposition campaign and an incoming president. Now, our questions don't end there. What did Hillary Clinton know? Her campaign know? The DNC that she controlled know? We know they paid Fusion GPS, what, 12 billion plus dollars to put this phony dossier together. Did she know this was happening and when did she know it? What did President Obama know? Was he briefed about the dossier before the election? Now, we believe he was.  To sum it all up, Clinton fixed the primary, remember, against Bernie Sanders. Then Peter Strzok and James Comey -- well, they fixed the investigation into her emails by exonerating her before even investigating that particular case. That allowed Clinton to stay in the race and at the same time, Strzok his mistress, Lisa Page, deputy FBI Director McCabe seemed to be on a mission, an insurance policy mission to destroy Trump. Insurance policy in case God forbid he wins, we don't think it's going to happen. And it's clear they were using the powerful tools of intelligence and a FISA warrant to have a backup plan in case Hillary lost.  This is far worse than Watergate. This is an abuse of surveillance and intelligence to win an election, a massive abuse of power. And it was all done by just a few people who think and thought they knew better than you about who should be the president of the United States. This is only the tip of the spear. It is the biggest national scandal by far in our lifetime.   Joining us now with more information, Congressman Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz and Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Sara, let me ask all three of you, yes or no, am I over the target?  Jim Jordan?",

The best disinfectant for this corruption is going to be sunshine and that's why Jim Jordan and I have joined many other members of Congress in calling for this information to be released for the review of all of the American people.  You know, Sean, when you been on this show each and every night making claims about the bias and the corruption and the deep state, people have accused you and your guests of being tin foil hat folks, lone voices in the wilderness.

You don't get to try to undermine our country, undermine our elections and then simply get fired.  So, I think there will be criminal implications here. We have to underscore the point that you and Jim Jordan just made. Every single Democrat on the Intelligence Committee voted against even allowing other members of Congress to see this information.

House majority leader Kevin McCarthy declaring that the house GOP has now done its job. So it's up to senate Democrats to keep the government open. Daring them to vote against this extension of health insurance for poor kids. But senate Democrats are digging in. Demanding that codifying DACA, basically giving legal status to the children of illegal immigrants be included or else they will vote no to keep the government open. In fact, the \"New York Times\" headline right now is senate Democrats appear ready to block the measure. That would appear to put the blame for any potential shut down with Democrats. But, remember, Republicans have a majority in both the house and senate so they have a responsibility to try and get this through both chambers. That is why majority leader Mitch McConnell just said a few moments ago, this should be an easy vote for both sides to support the house version that basically keeps the government only for about a month while they negotiate on a bigger deal. But that is easier said than done. They need 60 votes in the senate. They may not get that, President Trump traveling earlier to Pennsylvania.

Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, in this hour, we're going to corroborate so much of what we have been telling you, I promise you don't want to miss a minute. Breaking right now though, first, the House passes a short-term spending bill. It will now go to the Senate. And we are following the latest development as the deadline nears government shut down. By the way, government shut down is not that big of deal. Anyway, the president also take as huge victory lap today in Pennsylvania on the economy. We're going to play for you what he had to say. But, first, based on today's events, I have a message tonight for the special counsel Robert Mueller. Your witch-hunt is now over. Time to close the doors. That is the focus of a very important news breaking opening monologue."

      "utterance": "All right, huge breaking news tonight. Now, we have been telling you it's coming. It is now here. Stunning reporting tonight from Sara Carter that we are confirming with our sources. Classified DOJ documents that members of Congress are now reviewing it shows widespread and extensive FISA abuses against the Trump campaign. And we have names. Now, here is how it all went down. At the last minute at the House, they finally got literally within an hour, their subpoena requests approved by the DOJ. Members of Congress were able to get their hands on all these classified documents. Now, at the last minute, Rod Rosenstein tried to stop it by going into Paul Ryan's office. Paul Ryan would have none of it. Now, it is more disturbing than we ever thought. And at this hour, our sources are telling us that the abusive power is far bigger than Watergate. Remember, Watergate was a third rate break-in. What we're talking about tonight is the systematic abuse of power, the weaponizing of those powerful tools of intelligence, and the shredding of our Fourth Amendment constitutional rights that protect all of us against unlawful search and seizure. It is complicated but it's also simple. We're going to break it all down for new a way that I hope is easy to understand. Now, go back to the Watergate comparison for a minute. We have a group of people who tried to cover up the lead up to an election. They broke in. They stole things they shouldn't have stole from the opposition. What we're talking about tonight is an abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we use to spy on people, except those tools were used against an opposition candidate, and a president-elect, and his entire team. And it was done not only under false pretenses, but with the help of Hillary Clinton. She bought and paid for the dossier that they filled with Russian lies, propaganda, salacious details that were never true. And that dossier was corroborated, we now know, by a long-time Clinton ally and sycophant. Now, here are the people that we're going to learn an awful lot about in the next couple of weeks. Pay very close attention. They are the highest ranks of the Department of Justice in your FBI. And tonight, we can confirm that the Trump-hating, Clinton-loving, FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, they are at the nexus of everything and there is so much more information coming. Now, at the end of all of this, we're going to learn an awful lot beyond any shadow of a doubt that the special counsel, Robert Mueller and his band of Democratic witch-hunters never should have been appointed and they need to be disbanded immediately. Now, here's why Strzok and Page are connected to everything. What we're learning tonight is that these two Trump-hating individuals, they are at the heart and soul and center of it all. Remember, we still have 9,600 texts of theirs between each other that we haven't seen yet. And we're expecting that some of them will be released tomorrow. And everything that we have learned so far about Strzok and Page is now beginning to make sense. Let me explain. They called Trump an idiot, a loathsome human and said F Trump. And, by the way, the meaning by behind this particular text message is now tonight coming into clear focus. Remember Strzok, he wrote his mistress, Page, \"I want to believe the path that you threw out for consideration in Andy's office that there is no way he gets elected, but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\" Now, we believe here at Fox that Andy, mentioned in that text, is the FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. And this text message was sent on August the 15th of 2016. This is a very critical time frame and here's why. Around the exact same time that Strzok and Page are talking about their insurance policy, well, the Obama administration officials are going to the FISA court to get a warrant on Carter Page. Stay with me. They are using Carter Page as a pretext to really spy on the Trump campaign. And now, it is transparent to all of us what Strzok was saying to page when they spoke about the insurance policy with Andy -- we believe Andrew McCabe in that text message, needing that insurance policy. Now, everyone seems to forget Lisa Page is a key legal counselor for McCabe. See how it all ties together? And, listen, when they are sending the text messages about an insurance policy, they are also going to the FISA court. Now, sources are telling us tonight that the first time they tried to get the FISA warrant against Carter Page was in the summer. It was denied. Then the second time they tried to get it in the early fall, they used the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier. And this time, they were successful for one reason. The fake news dossier put the request over the top. It was the final nail in the coffin to get the FISA warrant out there against Trump. Now, you can forget about the reporting about George Papadopoulos running his mouth at a nightclub to an Australian diplomat. Any lawyer is going to tell you that that four-way hearsay, that's never going to hold up in court. Hearsay doesn't hold up in court. So, back to Carter Page and the FISA warrant on him. It's a very important variety of things happening here. At that point the Obama administration, they should have known that the dossier was totally false, full of salacious Russian lies. It should have been suspect on its face value. Now, Fusion GPS, they never even verified what was in that dossier, never tried, because they trusted Christopher Steele who they hired, who put it all together. The same Christopher Steele would reportedly, you know, pay Russians to get information. And by his very nature, think about it, he has a former MI-6 guy. He was highly skilled in deception. So, tonight, sources who were familiar with this classified information, only Congress can see it right now. They are telling me that it's a case of show me the man and I will show you the crime. All right. Now that you are up to speed on that part. We have a lot of questions for key people involved. Now, we need to know what all of these top Obama administration officials knew and when they found out, and exactly how they were involved in spying on an opposition campaign and an incoming president. Now, our questions don't end there. What did Hillary Clinton know? Her campaign know? The DNC that she controlled know? We know they paid Fusion GPS, what, 12 billion plus dollars to put this phony dossier together. Did she know this was happening and when did she know it? What did President Obama know? Was he briefed about the dossier before the election? Now, we believe he was. To sum it all up, Clinton fixed the primary, remember, against Bernie Sanders. Then Peter Strzok and James Comey -- well, they fixed the investigation into her emails by exonerating her before even investigating that particular case. That allowed Clinton to stay in the race and at the same time, Strzok his mistress, Lisa Page, deputy FBI Director McCabe seemed to be on a mission, an insurance policy mission to destroy Trump. Insurance policy in case God forbid he wins, we don't think it's going to happen. And it's clear they were using the powerful tools of intelligence and a FISA warrant to have a backup plan in case Hillary lost. This is far worse than Watergate. This is an abuse of surveillance and intelligence to win an election, a massive abuse of power. And it was all done by just a few people who think and thought they knew better than you about who should be the president of the United States. This is only the tip of the spear. It is the biggest national scandal by far in our lifetime. Joining us now with more information, Congressman Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz and Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Sara, let me ask all three of you, yes or no, am I over the target? Jim Jordan?"

      "speaker": "REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Sean, what I read today in that classified briefing room is as bad as I thought it was. And every single American citizen should have the ability to see that information to know exactly what our FBI was up to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Sean, it shocked me. I compared it to -- I remember the day I walked in two years ago on the Benghazi committee walked in and saw the immunity agreements that were given to people in the Clinton investigation. I didn't know who they had given them to. I opened up that folder and I looked down the Justice Department official slid that folder over to me on the table and look down and see they gave Cheryl Mills immunity during the Clinton investigation? Clinton's chief of staff? Her lawyer. Today, when I read the material, I had that same shocked feeling. I was like wait a minute, this actually happened from our Justice Department and this FBI? That's how serious this is. That's why we are calling on every bit of that information we got to see today to be made public for you to see, for journalists to the see, most importantly for the American people to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Matt Gaetz, you saw these materials today, you are agreeing with Jim Jordan. Because it sounds like a few people decided they wanted to fix not only -- they fixed it not only so Hillary would get in trouble on the email server scandal, we know felonies were committed. She fixed the primary, rigged the primary. It sounds like they are fixing and rigging here a general election or to overturn an election, and, you know, I mean, whatever word you want to describe that -- fixing, rigging, a coup, I don't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.",
      "utterance": "Yes, you are describing the very elements of a palace coup, and after Jim and Mark Meadows and many others of us reviews intelligence information today, it is abundantly clear that the entire Mueller investigation is a lie built on a foundation of corruption. And what is so important is that we get this information in to the public square. The best disinfectant for this corruption is going to be sunshine and that's why Jim Jordan and I have joined many other members of Congress in calling for this information to be released for the review of all of the American people. You know, Sean, when you been on this show each and every night making claims about the bias and the corruption and the deep state, people have accused you and your guests of being tin foil hat folks, lone voices in the wilderness. This critical intelligence information will vindicate the claims that have been made by so many and it is absolutely essential that we share it with all Americans. That's what we're fighting for in the Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Is it a fair statement that we've been -- the onion we have been unpeeling, we have been over the target the whole time, Congressman Gaetz?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, we can't get into the specific information, but I can tell you I am as certain as ever that the claims we have been making are accurate claims that there is intelligence information that backs it up. And that there has been a real attempt to undermine this president and it has come from the scariest of places. Some of the very people we have been talking about will be exposed and the key reason that all Americans need to see this memo is that it names names. It says who was involved with who. How different actors and characters we have heard about interacted with one another. And that is the type of information that we need all Americans to see immediately."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Sara Carter, you have been all over this all day. What can you tell us about your reporting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I can certainly say that my reporting coincides with what Congressman Gaetz and Congressman Jordan are saying. And I think it's far worse than what I believed could have happened. And from what I have been told, senior government officials may be removed from office, may be fired. I don't know how far this will go. I also want a lot of those questions answered, Sean. Who was in relationship to who when it came to these FISA warrants? How did they operate with one another? What were these really egregious actions that took place that only this memorandum and report can tell us? And I have been watching my Twitter feed and I have been watching Twitter all day. I'm seeing #releasethedocuments, #releasethedocuments everywhere. The American public deserves to know the truth here. It is absolutely essential that we understand what was happening and this was a duly elected president of the United States of America, and if people within our own government were trying to usurp that and change the trajectory, then the American people need to know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. I agree with you on release of documents. \"The Wall Street Journal\" tonight in an editorial, they are demanding the same thing. Congressman Jordan, we deserve to see this. You agree with that? And how soon will would he be able to get our eyes on these documents?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, great question, Sean. Here is the process, Chairman Nunes and the Intelligence Committee in the House, he can bring the committee back together. They can have a vote. If the majority of the committee votes to release these documents, the executive branch gets a certain amount of time to review them. If the executive branch gives a thumbs-up, they go public. So, this could happen real quick. Chairman Nunes is committed to getting this information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Not one Democrat wanted you to see it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, no, they didn't. But after you read it and you see, and if they're playing partisan politics, you can see why they didn't want us to see that and why though won't want the American people. But as Matt Gaetz said, and Sara say, this is something that needs to be out -- so this should never happen in a country as great as the United States of America and we need every single American, take a look at this and see what exactly their government did, their law enforcement division did. This is that kind of information and needs to be public as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, it sounds to me like a lot of people, Congressman Gaetz, need to be fired and investigated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "That's right. I think that this will not end just with firings. I believe there are people who will go to jail. I was very persuaded by the evidence. And it also became clear to me why Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham felt it so important to refer this matter for criminal prosecution. You don't get to try to undermine our country, undermine our elections and then simply get fired. So, I think there will be criminal implications here. We have to underscore the point that you and Jim Jordan just made. Every single Democrat on the Intelligence Committee voted against even allowing other members of Congress to see this information. So you know they're going to fight against release to the American people. What are the Democrats so afraid of? Why don't they want the American people to know the truth about what was going on with the government, how that impacted the president, his transition, his campaign and it just seems interesting to me that Democrats don't want us to know what the entire basis was in the first place for the Mueller probe. They want to drag this out through the midterm elections to try to embarrass this president and distract from the critical work we have to do to save this great country. Let's release the documents."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Without giving any details, do you conclude that Mueller, the whole issue of Trump-Russia collusion never should have come up. Does Mueller need to disband and does he need --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, this was a lie built on corruption, built on a sham. The entire investigation is a fiction. It's a fallacy. And when the American people see how this began, when the American people see how different people interacted with one another, how organizations were infected and infiltrated and subjected to tremendous biased of individuals and how that really played out, I think that every American will understand how absolutely ludicrous it is that we continue to allow the Mueller probe to go forward. It needs to end because the entire basis is a lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I know from my sources, Sara, that they are saying this should result in the immediate firing of Lisa Page, of Peter Strzok, of Bruce Ohr, also Andrew McCabe. I have some questions, where does Rod Rosenstein stick in this equation, the one who appointed the special counsel? Did he -- because we now know the dossier, the phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier, that was used for the FISA warrant. All of this leads to Mueller. That never should have happened because it was on opposition party propaganda. And then what's with Comey, what's his involvement here? Where does he stand? Where does Mueller's investigation stand based on your reporting tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Well, apparently, when this document goes public, which I believe it will, I do believe it will be the unraveling of the Mueller probe. And I have been hearing that from other sources. And, Sean, this was all about in the beginning, remember, Trump-Russia collusion, Trump-Russia collusion. Now we know from what we have been hearing from the sources, from the congressional members who have seen this memo that the collusion appears to be between certain members of the FBI and the DOJ and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and that the foundation of this was all based on lies. Not only do I want to know what Rosenstein who was actually the Department of Justice was withholding that information for a long period of time, you know, and then finally gave it up to the House Intelligence Committee."
    },

      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "We don't know that yet. I have not had the privilege of seeing the actual classified document, of course, the congressional members have. But I do not know the answer to that yet. But I would like to know how Sidney Blumenthal plays into all of this because I think that's going to be a very telling revelation when all of this comes out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Do you have -- can you give us any information, not giving us any details, Congressman Jordan but -- about Comey, about Mueller? And I'm very interested about Rod Rosenstein in all of this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "No. I mean, look, there are certain people who can sign FISA application. Only certain people can at the Justice Department. We don't know who did. After did you go read this material --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, we can eliminate this quickly it wasn't Jeff Sessions. He was recused. So, it's either Rosenstein or I believe one other person has the ability to --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Right. There's only a handful of people at FBI and Justice who can sign off on one. Who did that? We don't know. What we do know is what we have been talking about, this should go public. And also, we know there is more to come because the investigation at the intelligence committee is not complete. Thank goodness for what Devin Nunes and his committee are doing and the push they did on the Justice Department to get these documents in the first place. So -- but there is more information. Their investigation is not complete. When it's complete, then you are going to see the judiciary committee and the house do even more."
    },

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, again, we can't talk about specifics who knew what and what we read today. What we read today though was a memo that compiled information that they got that they presented to members of Congress to look at. We called for members of Congress to be able to see this material just a few weeks ago. Today, we are calling on all Americans to be able to see this material so they can see what really took place."

And you and I would not be having this conversation and Trump would not have been spending 10 months of his administration fending this stuff off. Look, the Democrats still call Joe Wilson a racist for yelling out \"you lie\" during the State of the Union speech. Actor Morgan Freeman implied that Mitch McConnell was a racist for saying, I want to make him a one-term president. Can you imagine if Obama had spent 10 months investigating collusion which nobody can define, which apparently people like Trey Gowdy has not yet been able to define yet? Can you imagine how this country would be? I think I have made this report before on your show, Sean, the country would be on fire. So, all the lefts, I would want you to put on your thinking caps and imagine if the shoe were on the other foot, what would you be seeing if these were about President Obama, given evidence this flimsy, this lame, this weak."

The house just voted moments ago to keep the government open with the provision that extends a popular children's health insurance program for six years. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy declaring that the house GOP has now done its job. So it's up to senate Democrats to keep the government open. Daring them to vote against this extension of health insurance for poor kids. But senate Democrats are digging in. Demanding that codifying DACA, basically giving legal status to the children of illegal immigrants be included or else they will vote no to keep the government open. In fact, the \"New York Times\" headline right now is senate Democrats appear ready to block the measure. That would appear to put the blame for any potential shut down with Democrats. But, remember, Republicans have a majority in both the house and senate so they have a responsibility to try and get this through both chambers. That is why majority leader Mitch McConnell just said a few moments ago, this should be an easy vote for both sides to support the house version that basically keeps the government only for about a month while they negotiate on a bigger deal. But that is easier said than done. They need 60 votes in the senate. They may not get that, President Trump traveling earlier to Pennsylvania. Out on the road charging that Democrats want the government to shut down in order to divert attention from an economy that he says is taking off."

Now, as we have talked throughout the week, even a quote, unquote, shut down of the government does not mean a complete shutdown. Critical operations will continue. More interesting is that these dire prediction of people dying was actually made already by Nancy Pelosi before the tax cut votes. She said it would bring, quote, Armageddon and as you heard the President note a moment ago there just the opposite is happening with companies like Apple stepping up with major investment in jobs and wages after that tax cut passed, Sean."
