Well, a possible new phase for the Russia investigation, the Wall Street Journal reporting that special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in the Russia probe, indicating a growing intensity in the investigation into possible election meddling. So we'll go immediately to chief White House correspondent John Roberts with the latest. John.",

      "sentences": "This would be another logical step forward in Robert Mueller's investigation. This was something that people here at the White House expected. It always comes as a surprise when the news of the announcement breaks even though it wasn't exactly an announcement because grand jury proceedings are typically kept secret, though the Department of Justice is being particularly tight-lipped about this one. We're getting some early reaction from the White House to reports that the grand jury was impaneled in a Reuters report that the first subpoenas have been issued from the grand jury in connection with that June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. had with Natalia Veselnitskaya and others at Trump Tower.  Now from Ty Cobb, who is the newly appointed attorney for the White House counsel's office here at the White House, who's looking specifically into this Russia investigation, quote, grand jury matters are typically secret. The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. That would be Robert Mueller talking about. The White House is fully committed -- is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller. And from John Dowd, who's part of the president outside counsel, is actually leading that team, quote, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation.  Again, Reuters News Agency reporting that subpoenas had been issued by that grand jury in connection with that June 2016 meeting. We have contacted some of the people who are potentially the targets of those subpoenas, so far from them no confirmation that any subpoenas have been received. But a reminder that people like Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner have already been providing information. And in some cases, Jared Kushner's case, an interview with the Senate  Congressional committee. And so, they are fully confident that if the grand jury is looking into anything, they're looking into information that's already been supplied in other areas of the investigatory universe. Paul Manafort again has provided emails, phone records. Jared Kushner gave a lengthy statements to the Senate intelligence committee, appeared before the staff in an interview a little more than a week ago. So they are quite confident that the grand jury will be looking into items of evidence and testimony that has already been aired elsewhere, Eric",

Whether he might come back and work in the residence or he'll stay in Bedminster full time. We understand he'll likely be in New Jersey between Friday and the 20th.

      "sentences": "Well, any time you get any kind of information about something that an outside prosecutor is doing, it tends to change the political landscape ever so slightly or sometimes, in terms of great upheavals. This, again, is being portrayed by the president's council inside the White House here looking into the Russian investigation, and his outside legal team as just being part of the process. One of the president's attorneys told me that when they were in the realm of the prosecutor, they would impanel grand jury all the time. And very often, the grand jury would result in nothing. They would return no indictments. In other cases, grand juries do return indictments. There're probably a lot of people who are watching our program right now who have been seated on grand juries, who either handed up indictments or they just listened to a lot of testimony, and came in every day and had lunch, and sat, and listened to hours and hours of testimony, and read reams and reams of evidence or had it presented to them, and nothing ever came of it. The impaneling of a grand jury doesn't mean that something is going to happen. The impaneling of a grand jury simply means that the prosecutor, in this case, Robert Mueller, has got some evidence and probably testimony that he wants to run by a panel, whoever peers might be involved in the giving of the testimony or might be named in the evidence, and they just want to get a fair read from these peers on what might be there. So again, it doesn't mean that they're about to file charges or that any indictments may ever be handed up. It's just that they want somebody and impanel a fair and impartial panel to hear this information.",

So I think it's going to be a fun scene in that arena later. In terms of the breaking news on this grand jury and the Mueller investigation, two things John -- to me, one is a legal point, one is a political point. Legally, I'm not a lawyer, but Andrew McCarthy is, he's a federal prosecutor in this city for a long time, he tweeted moments ago that this is an indication that the Russian investigation is no longer merely a counterintelligence investigation, it is now a criminal investigation, which he says could be a significant development.  Politically, this is just a question I have, does this box in the president more if he's even entertaining the possibility of firing Mueller? Because if the investigation is escalating and now there's a grand jury involved, if he comes in and pulls the plug, optically it looks really bad. And if you thought the cries of obstruction were loud with Comey, if he does it with Mueller, especially now, I think that might be a tough spot for him.",

One thing that everyone agrees on is we have to secure the border and that should come first, because whenever the Democrats get involved, they say, well, we'll secure the border but also we'll do these other things at the same time. And what conservatives say is no, no, no. You need to prove to us the confidence of the federal government to secure the border, which you have not proven to us. And this is a first piecemeal step that I think in the right direction, and would garner quite a lot of support across the spectrum, at least within the Republican Party.",

Tonight the president will head to West Virginia for a rally. Look at that. Look at all those people. Look at the people already waiting there for the president. They lined up last night just to see him. Now, you've heard it from me 1,000 times, stop listening to the polls, stop listening to the media, and stop listening to the anti-Trumpers. Listen to the people. Now to the other presidency. The coastal elites, along with the mainstream media, are constantly trying to derail the president on all fronts. \"The Washington Post\" just published leaked classified phone conversations between President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Forget the fact that these leaks are highly illegal. They're also substantial national security risks. Leakers need to be caught and prosecuted, and the media needs to realize the risks they pose by encouraging these leaks. It's a dangerous game they're playing. But when grading a presidency, the two most important factors are clearly the economy and national security. President Obama presided over eight years of economic malaise. President Obama presided over the massive expansion of ISIS terror and homeland terror. President Obama presided over volatile civil unrest in our communities. President Obama was a failed presidency. President Trump, however, has a robust economy. ISIS is just about defeated. Supreme Court is intact and conservative. And by the way, have you heard of any race riots in Ferguson or Baltimore recently? So you decide which matters most. Your economic well-being and your security or a conversation with the Mexican president. Bottom line: Trump has fixed most of the Obama failures, and I'd call that a successful first six months. Trace Adkins, you know, I've been promoting this book for the last few weeks, and you go out and you talk to real people, the people in the heartland. They love Donald Trump.

Well, a possible new phase for the Russia investigation, the Wall Street Journal reporting that special counsel Robert Mueller has impaneled a grand jury in the Russia probe, indicating a growing intensity in the investigation into possible election meddling. So we'll go immediately to chief White House correspondent John Roberts with the latest. John."

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "This would be another logical step forward in Robert Mueller's investigation. This was something that people here at the White House expected. It always comes as a surprise when the news of the announcement breaks even though it wasn't exactly an announcement because grand jury proceedings are typically kept secret, though the Department of Justice is being particularly tight-lipped about this one. We're getting some early reaction from the White House to reports that the grand jury was impaneled in a Reuters report that the first subpoenas have been issued from the grand jury in connection with that June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump, Jr. had with Natalia Veselnitskaya and others at Trump Tower. Now from Ty Cobb, who is the newly appointed attorney for the White House counsel's office here at the White House, who's looking specifically into this Russia investigation, quote, grand jury matters are typically secret. The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. That would be Robert Mueller talking about. The White House is fully committed -- is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller. And from John Dowd, who's part of the president outside counsel, is actually leading that team, quote, we have no reason to believe President Trump is under investigation. Again, Reuters News Agency reporting that subpoenas had been issued by that grand jury in connection with that June 2016 meeting. We have contacted some of the people who are potentially the targets of those subpoenas, so far from them no confirmation that any subpoenas have been received. But a reminder that people like Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner have already been providing information. And in some cases, Jared Kushner's case, an interview with the Senate  Congressional committee. And so, they are fully confident that if the grand jury is looking into anything, they're looking into information that's already been supplied in other areas of the investigatory universe. Paul Manafort again has provided emails, phone records. Jared Kushner gave a lengthy statements to the Senate intelligence committee, appeared before the staff in an interview a little more than a week ago. So they are quite confident that the grand jury will be looking into items of evidence and testimony that has already been aired elsewhere, Eric"

But he will be leaving the White House on Friday, going to Bedminster, unclear whether he will come back sometime between now and the 20th when the White House is being renovated, given a fresh coat of paint inside, some new carpet, fix the air conditioning. Whether he might come back and work in the residence or he'll stay in Bedminster full time. We understand he'll likely be in New Jersey between Friday and the 20th. And while everybody else is off or back in the districts, as members of  Congress like to say, the work of the special counsel likely will continue. Eric."

And really, a lot of times people don't even know it's going on, but obviously, in this case, we do. And we've been hearing about leaks, leaks, leaks, leaks, coming out of this White House. Any idea, we know it's being reported in the Wall Street Journal, who this leak might be or how it came about?"

      "utterance": "I want to ask, as you pointed out, this is something that was to be expected anytime there some sort of an investigation. But the narrative surrounding is that it's a huge concern. Is the White House concerned about how it's going to look politically? Is it going to be a tough political time for the White House right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "Well, any time you get any kind of information about something that an outside prosecutor is doing, it tends to change the political landscape ever so slightly or sometimes, in terms of great upheavals. This, again, is being portrayed by the president's council inside the White House here looking into the Russian investigation, and his outside legal team as just being part of the process. One of the president's attorneys told me that when they were in the realm of the prosecutor, they would impanel grand jury all the time. And very often, the grand jury would result in nothing. They would return no indictments. In other cases, grand juries do return indictments. There're probably a lot of people who are watching our program right now who have been seated on grand juries, who either handed up indictments or they just listened to a lot of testimony, and came in every day and had lunch, and sat, and listened to hours and hours of testimony, and read reams and reams of evidence or had it presented to them, and nothing ever came of it. The impaneling of a grand jury doesn't mean that something is going to happen. The impaneling of a grand jury simply means that the prosecutor, in this case, Robert Mueller, has got some evidence and probably testimony that he wants to run by a panel, whoever peers might be involved in the giving of the testimony or might be named in the evidence, and they just want to get a fair read from these peers on what might be there. So again, it doesn't mean that they're about to file charges or that any indictments may ever be handed up. It's just that they want somebody and impanel a fair and impartial panel to hear this information."

He made his musical debut in 1996 with the album, Dreaming Out Loud, hosts a weekly radio show called Throwback Thirty on Sirius XM, and he's a world famous country music star, so naturally he specializes in country music and songwriting, Trace Adkins is here.

      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM EDITOR",
      "utterance": "Probably not, because they're going to announce some political news out there, the crowd is going to love it. Trump feeds off these crowds, right? And they feed off of him. So I think it's going to be a fun scene in that arena later. In terms of the breaking news on this grand jury and the Mueller investigation, two things John -- to me, one is a legal point, one is a political point. Legally, I'm not a lawyer, but Andrew McCarthy is, he's a federal prosecutor in this city for a long time, he tweeted moments ago that this is an indication that the Russian investigation is no longer merely a counterintelligence investigation, it is now a criminal investigation, which he says could be a significant development. Politically, this is just a question I have, does this box in the president more if he's even entertaining the possibility of firing Mueller? Because if the investigation is escalating and now there's a grand jury involved, if he comes in and pulls the plug, optically it looks really bad. And if you thought the cries of obstruction were loud with Comey, if he does it with Mueller, especially now, I think that might be a tough spot for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I think the stakes -- I agree with you Guy on that point, the stakes becomes higher now that this grand jury has convene, certainly. But I think Trace, actually, takes the right attitude. If you're the White House and you really do want to welcome this, let it be completely flushed out by way of investigation. There's a lot of ways, John Roberts points out that these can end. A lot of times, no bill, even if there's an indictment. We don't necessarily know if that means something bad for President Trump himself. So let this thing play out in its full capacity, Eric."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",

Ty Cobb, the lawyer that John Roberts referenced says, quote, the White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller, and looks for -- it favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly.

Or they're jumping to say, see, gotcha. I don't want to say it's a nothing burger. I don't want to say its conspiracy burger.

Meanwhile, Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic senators Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, and Sheldon Whitehouse, introduced a similar bill today, the special counsel independence protection act, takes the Tillis-Coons bill one step further, requiring a court approval before removing any special counsel.

Bring in a new deputy A.G. and that person could then -- because that's the person that brought Mueller on board, Rosenstein.

People who say deport. One thing that everyone agrees on is we have to secure the border and that should come first, because whenever the Democrats get involved, they say, well, we'll secure the border but also we'll do these other things at the same time. And what conservatives say is no, no, no. You need to prove to us the confidence of the federal government to secure the border, which you have not proven to us.

We have so many people over there fighting and dying in that war, and it gets talked about so little on TV, and you know, not in the headlines. So I'm glad we're discussing it. In terms of this report that Trump was maybe discussing firing the top general there, the White House did fire back, saying that was misreported and overblown.

The President Trump rally is scheduled for 7 P.M. tonight. Guys, we know he loves those huge crowds, and they love him back. But next, it's time to \"Wake Up, America.\" Despite what the mainstream media may say, President Trump actually has a very long list of accomplishments from his time in office thus far. Mr. Eric Bolling will break it all down. Stay with us."

Tonight the president will head to West Virginia for a rally. Look at that. Look at all those people. Look at the people already waiting there for the president. They lined up last night just to see him. Now, you've heard it from me 1,000 times, stop listening to the polls, stop listening to the media, and stop listening to the anti-Trumpers. Listen to the people. Now to the other presidency. The coastal elites, along with the mainstream media, are constantly trying to derail the president on all fronts. \"The Washington Post\" just published leaked classified phone conversations between President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Forget the fact that these leaks are highly illegal. They're also substantial national security risks. Leakers need to be caught and prosecuted, and the media needs to realize the risks they pose by encouraging these leaks. It's a dangerous game they're playing. But when grading a presidency, the two most important factors are clearly the economy and national security. President Obama presided over eight years of economic malaise. President Obama presided over the massive expansion of ISIS terror and homeland terror. President Obama presided over volatile civil unrest in our communities. President Obama was a failed presidency. President Trump, however, has a robust economy. ISIS is just about defeated. Supreme Court is intact and conservative. And by the way, have you heard of any race riots in Ferguson or Baltimore recently?"

I don't do it, man. I just don't do. I sing my songs and maybe try to say something funny every now and then, and I get off the stage.

I will give you this much. I think President Obama, terrorism absolutely grew under his watch. That's undisputable. So I'll absolutely give you that. The economy stuff, I think I have to look at it in tandem. And I just -- you know, I think it's really funny how now, all of a sudden, these low unemployment numbers are given such gratitude and weight behind them. But when we saw those numbers, Eric, go down, down, and down and down under Obama, those numbers were picked apart; they were fake numbers. They weren't real numbers. Those weren't real jobs. They're low-paying jobs. They're Wal-Mart greeters. But I just want some consistency in the unemployment issue."

There's no mistake about that. However, there's also no mistake about the fact that finally we have somebody removing regulations, particularly environmental regulations. People are afraid to do it, because it looks mean, when really, pretty clearly, the solution is innovation and green technology and those sorts of things in terms of -- because that's, you know, you can get the economy going and you can help the environment. So no, he doesn't get enough credit for those things. The economy is doing great, and it is because of lessening the regulations. But you know, it's a little bit of both. You know, it's a little bit of a nuanced view. And I think sometimes President Trump does step on his own toes, though. If he wasn't, you know, talking about the Russia investigation so much, maybe we would talk about these things a little more."
