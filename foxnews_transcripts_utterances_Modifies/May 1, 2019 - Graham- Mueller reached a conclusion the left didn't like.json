Welcome to “Hannity.” Let me give you a quick headline, the details will follow, nobody else will report. The Mueller witch hunt is completely over. It is done.  Nobody listens to the attorney general, and yes, the attorney general admitted today, everything we recorded the last two years, full criminal investigations are now just beginning. Imagine that, a talk show host is right and so many in the fake news industry are wrong. We'll get to all of it. But first breaking moments ago, the Attorney General Barr will not head back to Capitol Hill to be grilled by Jerry Nadler's lawyers because he's too weak to question him himself. And tonight, of course, predictably, more breathless hysteria, selective moral outrage from the left. They are desperately trying to revive what is now a dead, fake, phony narrative. That's finished.  They are wrong. They were wrong. They lied to the American people. They continue to lie to the American people.   They perpetrated a hoax. They pushed conspiracy theories. They lost and Operation Crossfire Hurricane has now turned into Operation Boomerang. We will have full coverage of how Barr, Horowitz, Huber are about to upend the corrupt actors in the deep state, those that abused power. They will bring equal justice and equal application of our laws to the American people. It seems, tonight, finally, the Constitution and the rule of law will be followed. Also tonight, we have a major breaking news report, brand-new from John Solomon surrounding Bruce and Nellie Ohr, who soon be in serious legal trouble. Yes, I think we predicted that too.   But the Mueller witch hunt is over. Don't let nobody else fool you. They can talk about it until the cows come home. They can sit, go home and their heads can spin around like Linda Blair in the exorcist. They can projectile and vomit the green stuff, it's not going to change the truth. And the second part of that is, what we have diligently reported, night after night after night, for two years on this program, our ensemble cast, I can't name everybody. There's not a lot of us, but talk radio, Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh, and a few others, you know, here on the channel. Like Laura, and Tucker, and \"Fox & Friends\", we have all been right. So many others have gotten it dead wrong. They missed the biggest story in their lifetime, and we can confirm tonight the criminal investigations are, in fact, underway in a major way. That is the headline, the biggest headline to come out of today -- and I promise you, no one else will report it.  But not according to the Democratic and media mob. You know, the ones that are full of rage and psychotic hatred that, you know, borders all things Trump. They are obsessing about Barr's contentious hearing on Capitol Hill which could have basically been wrapped up in about two minutes. After these important questions, this is the money moment, if you will, Lindsey Graham, it says it all. It confirms what I just told you.   Take a look.",

Remember, that is only beginning today. And there is so much -- there will be a cascade, an avalanche of information. We will get to Lindsey Graham who will join us in a moment.  But for nearly 24 hours, the predictable media mob is totally, completely about a new report for \"The Washington Post\" and \"New York Times.\" Last night, just hours prior to Barr's hearing, these two far left media propaganda outlets lied again, conveniently granted access to a leaked letter from team Mueller to the attorney general's office that expressed frustration over how Barr initially summarized the report. \"Washington Post\" headline, Mueller complained that Barr's letter did not capture the context, the entirety of the Trump probe. But within their own reporting, way underneath the headline, they actually contradicted their own headlines. And the actual truth emerged.  According to a DOJ spokesperson, now confirmed by the attorney general himself, the special counsel emphasized nothing. Zero, and the attorney general's four-page March 24th letter was inaccurate or misleading. Nothing.  But he expressed frustration over the lack of content, oh, and the resulting media coverage regarding the special counsel's obstruction analysis. Oh, he is criticizing the media too. Something Mueller and I have in common. This is how Attorney General Barr responded earlier today. Let's go to the videotape.",

Mueller found zero evidence that anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Mueller did not make a determination on obstruction. The attorney general indicated these basic findings in his letter on March 24th. The Department of Justice then determined, yes, no obstruction took place and April 18th, Mueller released the full report with only a few mandated reductions because of a law supported by Democrats following the Starr investigation into Bill Clinton.  The attorney general, he had no obligation whatsoever to release any of the Mueller report. That's the truth. That's the law. These are the facts.

You abused your power. I know you are thinking you are super patriot but a lot of the FBI rank-and-file that I know are embarrassed by what you did it. It was the first FBI official to sign off on that FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page, oh, based on unverified, uncorroborated, bought and paid-for the Clinton campaign op research and \"The New York Times\" is telling us may have been Russian disinformation. You signed up on that.  He is the one that told president-elect months later it's a dossier was unverified. It's not what he said in the FISA warrant. He said it was salacious months after he used the FISA warrant. Did he lie in October, or did he lie in January of 2017, October 2016? He was the one who met with Susan Rice, President Obama, crazy Uncle Joe about the dossier after the election. Comey was the one who leaked government memos about his conversations with President Trump in order to spur special counsel investigation, that might be a crime even though he was the one that declare the president can fire an FBI director for any or no reason at all. He is the one who surrounded himself with partisan corrupt high-ranking officials who have all either resigned, been fired or demoted. And now, Comey is the one, along with his fellow deep state counterparts the tables have now turned. There's a new sheriff in town. His name is Bill Barr. And he confirmed today the investigation into your actions, the deep state spying and all the other shenanigans that happen, rigging Hillary's investigation, trying to bludgeon a president duly elected by we, the people of the United States. We now know Horowitz's investigation into FISA abuse, Huber's investigation into leaking, more investigations into Christopher Steele's bought and paid for dossier, paid for by Hillary, even Democratic collusion with Ukraine. They are trying to give us the evidence. Other probes into rampant unmasking request carried out by Susan Rice, Samantha Power in 2016, 350 percent increased -- criminal referrals are coming and here. The United States of America is supposed to be democratic republic based on the rule of law, a constitution. It is not a bureaucratic dictatorship where power is abused and used by a select few unelected, unaccountable officials. We give you these tools because we trust you to protect this country. Not use them and turn them on the elected president of the United States or the American people. This is now time we either get this straight or say goodbye, USA.

According to Solomon's report, during 2016 election, Nellie Ohr was feeding her Clinton funded op research to not only her husband, but two other prosecutors inside the Department of Justice, which appears to directly conflict with House testimony last year. That would be lying to Congress. Here to explain it all from \"The Hill\" is John Solomon, he's also our investigative reporter, along with the number one bestselling author of \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter.

Mueller got a lot of criticism about that and it upset him. So he obviously wrote a letter to Barr complaining.

Welcome to “Hannity.” Let me give you a quick headline, the details will follow, nobody else will report. The Mueller witch hunt is completely over. It is done. Nobody listens to the attorney general, and yes, the attorney general admitted today, everything we recorded the last two years, full criminal investigations are now just beginning. Imagine that, a talk show host is right and so many in the fake news industry are wrong. We'll get to all of it. But first breaking moments ago, the Attorney General Barr will not head back to Capitol Hill to be grilled by Jerry Nadler's lawyers because he's too weak to question him himself. And tonight, of course, predictably, more breathless hysteria, selective moral outrage from the left. They are desperately trying to revive what is now a dead, fake, phony narrative. That's finished. They are wrong. They were wrong. They lied to the American people. They continue to lie to the American people. They perpetrated a hoax. They pushed conspiracy theories. They lost and Operation Crossfire Hurricane has now turned into Operation Boomerang. We will have full coverage of how Barr, Horowitz, Huber are about to upend the corrupt actors in the deep state, those that abused power. They will bring equal justice and equal application of our laws to the American people. It seems, tonight, finally, the Constitution and the rule of law will be followed. Also tonight, we have a major breaking news report, brand-new from John Solomon surrounding Bruce and Nellie Ohr, who soon be in serious legal trouble. Yes, I think we predicted that too. But the Mueller witch hunt is over. Don't let nobody else fool you. They can talk about it until the cows come home. They can sit, go home and their heads can spin around like Linda Blair in the exorcist. They can projectile and vomit the green stuff, it's not going to change the truth. And the second part of that is, what we have diligently reported, night after night after night, for two years on this program, our ensemble cast, I can't name everybody. There's not a lot of us, but talk radio, Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh, and a few others, you know, here on the channel. Like Laura, and Tucker, and \"Fox & Friends\", we have all been right. So many others have gotten it dead wrong. They missed the biggest story in their lifetime, and we can confirm tonight the criminal investigations are, in fact, underway in a major way. That is the headline, the biggest headline to come out of today -- and I promise you, no one else will report it. But not according to the Democratic and media mob. You know, the ones that are full of rage and psychotic hatred that, you know, borders all things Trump. They are obsessing about Barr's contentious hearing on Capitol Hill which could have basically been wrapped up in about two minutes. After these important questions, this is the money moment, if you will, Lindsey Graham, it says it all. It confirms what I just told you. Take a look."

Remember, that is only beginning today. And there is so much -- there will be a cascade, an avalanche of information. We will get to Lindsey Graham who will join us in a moment. But for nearly 24 hours, the predictable media mob is totally, completely about a new report for \"The Washington Post\" and \"New York Times.\" Last night, just hours prior to Barr's hearing, these two far left media propaganda outlets lied again, conveniently granted access to a leaked letter from team Mueller to the attorney general's office that expressed frustration over how Barr initially summarized the report. \"Washington Post\" headline, Mueller complained that Barr's letter did not capture the context, the entirety of the Trump probe. But within their own reporting, way underneath the headline, they actually contradicted their own headlines. And the actual truth emerged. According to a DOJ spokesperson, now confirmed by the attorney general himself, the special counsel emphasized nothing. Zero, and the attorney general's four-page March 24th letter was inaccurate or misleading. Nothing. But he expressed frustration over the lack of content, oh, and the resulting media coverage regarding the special counsel's obstruction analysis. Oh, he is criticizing the media too.

Mueller found zero evidence that anyone in the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Mueller did not make a determination on obstruction. The attorney general indicated these basic findings in his letter on March 24th. The Department of Justice then determined, yes, no obstruction took place and April 18th, Mueller released the full report with only a few mandated reductions because of a law supported by Democrats following the Starr investigation into Bill Clinton. The attorney general, he had no obligation whatsoever to release any of the Mueller report. That's the truth. That's the law. These are the facts.

You signed up on that. He is the one that told president-elect months later it's a dossier was unverified. It's not what he said in the FISA warrant. He said it was salacious months after he used the FISA warrant. Did he lie in October, or did he lie in January of 2017, October 2016? He was the one who met with Susan Rice, President Obama, crazy Uncle Joe about the dossier after the election. Comey was the one who leaked government memos about his conversations with President Trump in order to spur special counsel investigation, that might be a crime even though he was the one that declare the president can fire an FBI director for any or no reason at all. He is the one who surrounded himself with partisan corrupt high-ranking officials who have all either resigned, been fired or demoted. And now, Comey is the one, along with his fellow deep state counterparts the tables have now turned. There's a new sheriff in town. His name is Bill Barr. And he confirmed today the investigation into your actions, the deep state spying and all the other shenanigans that happen, rigging Hillary's investigation, trying to bludgeon a president duly elected by we, the people of the United States. We now know Horowitz's investigation into FISA abuse, Huber's investigation into leaking, more investigations into Christopher Steele's bought and paid for dossier, paid for by Hillary, even Democratic collusion with Ukraine. They are trying to give us the evidence. Other probes into rampant unmasking request carried out by Susan Rice, Samantha Power in 2016, 350 percent increased -- criminal referrals are coming and here. The United States of America is supposed to be democratic republic based on the rule of law, a constitution. It is not a bureaucratic dictatorship where power is abused and used by a select few unelected, unaccountable officials. We give you these tools because we trust you to protect this country. Not use them and turn them on the elected president of the United States or the American people. This is now time we either get this straight or say goodbye, USA. Because as attorney general, Barr pointed out, our criminal justice system must never be used, ever used as a political weapon, ever again. Right, Jim? Take a look."

Breaking moments ago, from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, Congressman Mark Meadows has now officially filed a criminal referral against Nellie Ohr over alleged false testimony to Congress and according to a new bombshell story from Solomon, we now have more evidence of a backdoor channel between Fusion GPS, the Department of Justice. According to Solomon's report, during 2016 election, Nellie Ohr was feeding her Clinton funded op research to not only her husband, but two other prosecutors inside the Department of Justice, which appears to directly conflict with House testimony last year. That would be lying to Congress. Here to explain it all from \"The Hill\" is John Solomon, he's also our investigative reporter, along with the number one bestselling author of \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter. By the way, let me say to all three of you, that what Barr confirmed today, it's over. The Mueller report is over. He's not changing his mind, no collusion, no obstruction. But they did talk about criminal investigations into every single thing the three of you, I added a little bit myself, just a little. And we have discussed for two-plus years on this program, I know -- by the way, I'm not happy about it. This isn't good for the country. But it is imperative for the rule of law. John Solomon, let's go to Ukraine issue.

Not because we have an agenda, because it was facts. It's nice to see the news media paying attention to important developments in these stories. I think today Nellie Ohr is a really big sign of what's ahead. Everybody who had contact with the Justice Department, everybody who perpetrated the Steele dossier, everybody who signed a FISA warrant, everybody who approved intrusive tactics against the president and his campaign during this investigation are now under scrutiny. Attorney General Barr made that incredibly clear today, and I think there's going to be a lot of bad conduct unmasked in the next few months, and I use the word unmasked with a little bit of tongue and cheek, because unmasking is one of the issues we have to get back to. But everything that Gregg wrote about in his book, all the stories that Sara wrote about, all the things I've been able to write about at \"The Hill\", they are now being investigated in a serious way and that's very important development for the American people."

And what he meant by that was, all of the people at the FBI and the Department of Justice who abused their positions of power first to clear Hillary Clinton and then to frame Donald Trump for something he didn't do, and Barr today vowed in no one uncertain terms that he was going to examine not just a potential corruption in the Hillary Clinton Email Case in clearing her, but the origins of the Trump-Russian investigation. There was never any credible evidence to even start it and then using Christopher Steele. And yes, he said he is going to look into Hillary Clinton's payment for Russian information to harm her political rival. The FISA abuse, lying to a FISA court -- and don't forget James Comey stealing government documents and leaking them to unauthorized individual. So, I think the first thing that is going to happen in the next 45 days is the Inspector General's report. And I don't think it is possible that criminal referrals will not emanate from that.

So, what they're going to look at is everybody who played a role in here, all of the evidence that we, John, Gregg, you have put out over the past few years, they're going to look at that. They're going to look at the connections with the people, the most senior people in the Obama Administration. Let's just bring up Ben Rhodes, I mean we just saw an interview with him with Nicholas Ballasy where Ben Rhodes says, \"We'd knew nothing. We knew nothing about what's going on.\" Well, Ben Rhodes, that was -- his job was to know what was going on. So, right off the bat, I think there is a conflict there in his own statement. He and Susan Rice would have certainly been aware of investigation. So, I think he is going to be drawn back into this. I think the American people deserve answers. Most importantly, just as Gregg said and John said, Michael Horowitz is going to come out with his report. There will certainly be criminal referrals."

And he didn't - that is Mueller didn't resolve the obstruction charge, which is really the only thing arguably you needed a Special Counsel for. Barr put out a letter setting forth what the conclusions of the investigation were, and that letter made it obvious that Mueller had advocated on the one thing he was needed for. Mueller got a lot of criticism about that and it upset him. So he obviously wrote a letter to Barr complaining. But what he was complaining about was not Barr's articulation of the findings, it was that the media giving him a hard time. When you've been the subject of a fawning press for a couple of years and all of a sudden, you're catching darts, it's upsetting."

Correct me if my memory is wrong, maybe I'm off here, isn't it true people like Jerry Nadler -- you worked under the old independent counsel statute. Guys like Jerry Nadler didn't want the Starr report coming out, and other Democrats, just recollection maybe I'm wrong, I don't think I am. And didn't the Democrats, aren't they the ones that wanted to change and get rid of the independent counsel law after the impeachment? By the way, didn't you have 11 specific crimes that Bill Clinton committed in your report, maybe I'm wrong, that you mentioned specifically? And they are the ones that gave Barr the authority not to release anything. He didn't have to release one word."

      "utterance": "That's exactly - that's exactly right. We've really gone back to the old regime of the independent counsel statute and we had turned our back on that. We said no, we don't want that anymore. That was really a bad period. 21 years under the independent counsel statute, so for 20 years, Sean, we've now had I think a very reasonable set of regulations. But Bill Barr said something very interesting today. He said I overrode the regulations. He had the power and the authority to do it. But the irony is, Bill Barr is being savaged even though he has erred on the side of transparency just as - and you're absolutely right about Jerry Nadler. When he was in the House of Representatives then, as opposed to now, he was opposed to the release of the Starr report. He was right then. And why was he right, because it was highly - obviously highly private material. But nonetheless it was highly relevant to the House's consideration of the 11 counts of articles of impeachment."

      "utterance": "Well, a lot. Yes, the court battles you have to be away, Sean, but difficult to argue that media outlets did not vilify Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann. And now Sandmann's lawyers have filed a third lawsuit, this one against NBCUniversal which includes MSNBC for $275 million. The suit alleges that they used \"vast corporate wealth, influence and power against Nicholas to falsely attack him by relying heavily on biased and unreliable sources without conducting any reasonable investigation of the circumstances.\" Remember when a snippet of video was posted on social media, showing Sandmann staring down a Native American man, the media narrative was that Sandmann and the MAGA hat wearing Covington kids were wrong. But the entire two hours of video showed the altercation began with the students being verbally attacked. Even an independent investigation showed the students were not the instigators. Sandmann's lawyers have sued The Washington Post and CNN, and they say more are yet to come. Sean?"
