So, will one of America's most infamous prisoners be set free? It's a crime saga that began more than 23 years ago, 1994, Los Angeles police in hot pursuit of a fugitive from justice. NFL legend Orenthal James Simpson wanted for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman. It led to the trial of the century.",

We cannot -- we have forgotten how to shame. So we all must go and just suck all this in because we can't get enough of it. I don't understand parole. It should work in reverse.  You start at the sentence and good behavior prevents you from lengthening the sentence, not from shortening. I don't understand why somehow a 33 year sentence goes to eight years. I don't know. The one thing I learned from this sentence is that facts don't matter when you're a celebrity and you have got a lot of money and you have you a lot of lawyers. Nobody else could have gotten off that way.   We excuse the brutality of famous people if you look at what's going on with R. Kelly right now. There are no music sites that are talking about that.

Now, he has been behaving in prison and no one is going to testify against him at the parole board hearing.  So, I think if they're fair and they just look at this case, they will parole him. But if they say karma is going to play a role here, they're going to make him sit down. I think most Americans want to see O.J. stay in prison. I think there is a certain segment of the population that might break down among racial lines that want O.J. loose. And I understand that I'm going to shoot a waters world about this and we will see if that's the case or not. But then there is also a sixth segment of the population that says, I know he did it, but I still want to see O.J. out. I want to see O.J. in the tabloids. I want to see O.J. on TV because O.J. is a spectacle. And unfortunately, if he does get paroled, I think it's going to reopen a lot of racial wounds in this country, unfortunately. And I think O.J. being paroled is probably the only thing that could knock Trump out of a news cycle for a little while.

Remember blaming Benghazi on a video? Donna Brazile's debate help. The tarmac visit? The secret server? The IRS? Or how about the left's decades of collusion with the USSR? You couldn't swing a dead tabby without hitting a fellow traveler in Hollywood or academia. Funny how the left embraced far worse evil back then and now they hate Russia whose military and land mass is nowhere near the size and strength of its old self. Now I get it. The \"what about them\" argument doesn't excuse Donald Jr.'s actions. But that's not the point. It's simply to show you that the chase is driven by politics and not morality. It reveals the depths the left goes to win. Example: Let's say for the past year, Jesse has been stuffing me in my locker outside \"The Five.\" Finally, I punch him in the goofies. That's the \"what about\" argument. The response is valid after the abuse. That's why America yawns over Russia. And for them a better explanation exists: A nonpolitician -- Donald Trump Jr. -- took a meeting unaware the rules and forgot about it.  Look, Russian meddling is a worry that we raise every single day on \"The Five.\" But today's duplicity by hysterics who embraced the Reds decades ago negates the outrage. You want collusion to matter? Ask this: How do we stop it from happening again? That's constructive, which is why the Dems and their media enablers hate it. Jesse, shouldn't the past matter? The context? Shouldn't we to provide context the people that are chasing Trump of them far worse?",

Now, the reason you use the what about them scenario is because it's the only thing that really challenges the left's integrity. Because when you say they are hypothetical, they have double standards, they're bias. They say, oh, we're not. And you can point to these hard examples. Because their integrity is all they have in order to sell their propaganda. But that's what it is, it is a mirage? And they use it to masquerade the propaganda. So, without it, they are broke. And I love playing the what about them game. I'm actually quite good at it. You stole some of the monologue. But I would like to add a few. They did use the IRS as a weapon to persecute Republicans in order to win re-election. They lied about the video in order to win re-election. They said, you can keep your healthcare in order to win re-election. That's not even mentioning the fact that they let guns walk into Mexico that killed a border patrol guard or let, you know, these people hack our military and then commute the guilty people. So, here's the things that Don Jr. didn't do. Don Jr. didn't destroy evidence. He didn't plead the Fifth. He didn't get anybody shot. He didn't break a law so far. He didn't embolden terrorists.

Now, you put them on top of the fact that you've had Susan Collins and Rand Paul already saying they will not vote for this current version of the bill. You have Senator John McCain who just had surgery who is out in Arizona and we all know is not going to be able to come back and vote on any version of this at least for a week or so. That means the Republicans are nowhere close to having at least 50 votes to then have Vice President Mike Pence cast the 51st vote for a motion to proceed to at least get to a floor debate on this. All this comes just a few hours after the president made very positive optimistic remarks here at the White House insisting they were very close to a deal. That he still thought they were going to surprise people. So what's interesting is this advisor I just spoke to, to the president is telling me that the key move is what does the president do next? Does he go out on twitter tonight or tomorrow and start lashing out at Senate Republican leaders who I'm told in private he is very frustrated with, that they haven't been able to get this done. Or does he find a way to move forward with them constructively to try and pick up the pieces, Dana.",

I agree. Humility is great but today, folks, I am far from humble. I am bursting with pride because the event where the president spoke was a 2017 graduation for 60 members of the Presidential Leadership Scholars Program and one of the graduates, no other than my son Tony. Here's the class photo of all the graduates. You can see Mrs. Laura Bush there, Presidents Clinton and Bush. Tony is right there in the center. Here's a closer look.

So, will one of America's most infamous prisoners be set free? It's a crime saga that began more than 23 years ago, 1994, Los Angeles police in hot pursuit of a fugitive from justice.

We cannot -- we have forgotten how to shame. So we all must go and just suck all this in because we can't get enough of it. I don't understand parole. It should work in reverse. You start at the sentence and good behavior prevents you from lengthening the sentence, not from shortening. I don't understand why somehow a 33 year sentence goes to eight years. I don't know. The one thing I learned from this sentence is that facts don't matter when you're a celebrity and you have got a lot of money and you have you a lot of lawyers. Nobody else could have gotten off that way. We excuse the brutality of famous people if you look at what's going on with R. Kelly right now. There are no music sites that are talking about that.

The first time he skated because you could pay for the dream team. They chose the bad venue downtown L.A. and the prosecution booted it. They made him try on the glove. They had Mark Fuhrman the racist up on the stands. They got the race card played on them and they didn't even realize it was happening."

He wasn't even holding the gun. But he was involved in the armed robbery. And I think it was, you know, really, really rough sentence. Because they had in mind this guy skated on a double homicide. Now, he has been behaving in prison and no one is going to testify against him at the parole board hearing. So, I think if they're fair and they just look at this case, they will parole him. But if they say karma is going to play a role here, they're going to make him sit down. I think most Americans want to see O.J. stay in prison. I think there is a certain segment of the population that might break down among racial lines that want O.J. loose. And I understand that I'm going to shoot a waters world about this and we will see if that's the case or not. But then there is also a sixth segment of the population that says, I know he did it, but I still want to see O.J. out. I want to see O.J. in the tabloids. I want to see O.J. on TV because O.J. is a spectacle. And unfortunately, if he does get paroled, I think it's going to reopen a lot of racial wounds in this country, unfortunately. And I think O.J. being paroled is probably the only thing that could knock Trump out of a news cycle for a little while. But Trump will probably tweet about it and then the media is going to go bonkers."

Like any case where it had an officer as a main witness, there's a narcotics case, et cetera, very difficult at the time. Than just, you know, the composition of the juries downtown, depending on, you know, the different areas.

Remember blaming Benghazi on a video? Donna Brazile's debate help. The tarmac visit? The secret server? The IRS? Or how about the left's decades of collusion with the USSR? You couldn't swing a dead tabby without hitting a fellow traveler in Hollywood or academia. Funny how the left embraced far worse evil back then and now they hate Russia whose military and land mass is nowhere near the size and strength of its old self. Now I get it. The \"what about them\" argument doesn't excuse Donald Jr.'s actions. But that's not the point. It's simply to show you that the chase is driven by politics and not morality.

And for them a better explanation exists: A nonpolitician -- Donald Trump Jr. -- took a meeting unaware the rules and forgot about it. Look, Russian meddling is a worry that we raise every single day on \"The Five.\" But today's duplicity by hysterics who embraced the Reds decades ago negates the outrage. You want collusion to matter? Ask this: How do we stop it from happening again? That's constructive, which is why the Dems and their media enablers hate it. Jesse, shouldn't the past matter?

Because when you say they are hypothetical, they have double standards, they're bias. They say, oh, we're not. And you can point to these hard examples. Because their integrity is all they have in order to sell their propaganda. But that's what it is, it is a mirage? And they use it to masquerade the propaganda. So, without it, they are broke. And I love playing the what about them game. I'm actually quite good at it. You stole some of the monologue. But I would like to add a few. They did use the IRS as a weapon to persecute Republicans in order to win re-election. They lied about the video in order to win re-election. They said, you can keep your healthcare in order to win re-election. That's not even mentioning the fact that they let guns walk into Mexico that killed a border patrol guard or let, you know, these people hack our military and then commute the guilty people. So, here's the things that Don Jr. didn't do. Don Jr. didn't destroy evidence. He didn't plead the Fifth. He didn't get anybody shot. He didn't break a law so far. He didn't embolden terrorists.

      "utterance": "Well, Dana, I just got off the phone with one of the president's top advisor who told me this is a blow to the president tonight but they are still hopeful they can pick up the pieces either by getting the Senate to work on health care again after the August recess or perhaps the president will have to go out to the American people and put pressure on Senate Republicans to come up with a new version after six or seven years of vowing that they would repeal and replace Obamacare. Tonight, for now at least, it is dead. This news coming because two more Republican senators in the last few moments have come out and said they cannot support the current version of the bill. That would be Mike Lee of Utah as well as Jerry Moran of Kansas. Now, you put them on top of the fact that you've had Susan Collins and Rand Paul already saying they will not vote for this current version of the bill. You have Senator John McCain who just had surgery who is out in Arizona and we all know is not going to be able to come back and vote on any version of this at least for a week or so. That means the Republicans are nowhere close to having at least 50 votes to then have Vice President Mike Pence cast the 51st vote for a motion to proceed to at least get to a floor debate on this. All this comes just a few hours after the president made very positive optimistic remarks here at the White House insisting they were very close to a deal. That he still thought they were going to surprise people. So what's interesting is this advisor I just spoke to, to the president is telling me that the key move is what does the president do next? Does he go out on twitter tonight or tomorrow and start lashing out at Senate Republican leaders who I'm told in private he is very frustrated with, that they haven't been able to get this done. Or does he find a way to move forward with them constructively to try and pick up the pieces, Dana."

And I'm mostly I'm sad for the American people, you know. And there were promises made and they have not been delivered on. And they had, you know, all kinds of complaints, all along about Obamacare.

And it's really, really smart, very practical, and they are always very specific good stuff. And I keep sitting here and I'm going like there's no landing page. There is no landing place for these ideas. And I started thinking about stuff like Waze which people or drivers use. They find the quickest route based on accumulation of user data.

We want the insurance companies involved and this is how we can do it. And they've put together this plan and then Obama emulates the plan and the Republicans playing politics saying, we hate it, we hate it, we hate it. Well guess what?

He said, they take a job to fulfill a mission and in the last eight years, that mission had been very muddied. So now they feel like that the president has their back. ICE and the Border Patrol are political punching bags. So, some things are doing too much, some things are doing too little. It goes back and forth and I think that they just do a really good job.
