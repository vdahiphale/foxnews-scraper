We need to be aggressive and continue to work on the agenda going forward. And so, you know, is it troubling, the numbers that we see? Certainly. It would be disingenuous to suggest otherwise. But, in that, if we continue to deliver on our promises and keep our promises to the American people, they will show up in November.  For me, I think it's really incumbent upon us to press our leadership, to say not, well, we can look backwards on what we have accomplished. We need to about dealing with immigration, dealing with continued rollback of regulations, making sure that those tax cuts are permanent. I believe we will do that on April 15.
