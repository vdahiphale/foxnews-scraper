      "sentences": "All right, thank you very much, John. We are still monitoring. The president is still speaking in Ohio right now. He has been ripping his predecessor and talking about his economic performance, compared to the president's ongoing economic performance.  A couple of quick clarifications, though. He that he inherited essentially a mess here and that jobs were bleeding in this country. Just to put that up to steam, though, and just make sure we have got all our facts right, the president can crow, indeed, about how the economy was chugging along prior to the virus, of course, and how it has been coming back since.  But just for the record, the economy under Barack Obama gained about 12 million jobs. The unemployment rate did eventually drop to 3.7 percent. And we were seeing, again, the gain in production, I should say that, but we were seeing a steady improvement and a dramatic drop in the number of jobless workers that had hit over 10 percent to roughly about a third of that.  Also talking about how jobs in all we're gaining across all key sectors here. Manufacturing jobs were weak in the prior administration. Many in the Obama administration have pointed out that the job growth there started happening when he was president for about eight or nine months. They like to point out that he came in the middle of a financial meltdown, an economic meltdown. Just want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples. And, indeed, we are.  This, of course, part of a push on the part of the president to say that things are getting better, and they will continue to get better. There's a lot of attention right now about what kind of stimulus could be on the way, if it's on the way. We will get into that in just a second.  First to Garrett Tenney, who is with the president right now in Ohio -- Garrett.",

And what he's essentially laying out is his sales pitch as to why it is that he is the best bet for American manufacturing and blue-collar workers in the upcoming election. And he's laying out his plan of what he plans to do over the next four years. And much of it entails some of the same strategies we have seen in the current administration, in the current term, of using tariffs and renegotiating trade deals to try to improve the life and the economy of American manufacturing here in the U.S.   Whirlpool is one of the success stories of the president's efforts. The company had long complained that its competitors such as Samsung and LG were flooding the U.S. with low-price foreign-made washing machines. Two years ago, President Trump upheld a 50 percent tariff on washing machines coming in from other countries, which Whirlpool says enabled it to boost production and create several thousand more jobs. It also resulted in LG and Samsung shifting production to the U.S., creating jobs in Tennessee in South Carolina.",

When we talk about the unemployment rate, that got down to 4.7 percent under Barack Obama. I think I might have said 3.7 percent. That 3.7 percent refers to the manufacturing wage increase, real wage increase, for production workers during his presidency, and average weekly earnings gains of 4.2 percent. The president picked up on that and gained considerable steam when he came into office. I just want to make sure, though, we are comparing all accurate numbers. The president also mentioning, not only now, but in other times, how disastrous things were for the markets.  Of course, the S&P 500 picked up about 160 percent under his stewardship. This president's had a nice ride in the stock market as well. And whatever interruptions we had for the virus, we have almost wiped them out, as all the major market averages, with added gains today, are about back to where they were, the Nasdaq at all-time highs, the S&P 500 within about a percent of highs, so too the Dow.  So, both men can crow about their performance. I just wanted to make sure that you had accurate numbers vs. what they were in the Obama years and what they are faring so far in the Trump years. All right, in the meantime, we're keeping a very close eye on what's happening in Washington, D.C., and those stimulus measures, competing prices, competing price tags, competing priorities on where that money goes.

We have got to work together to make sure that we're doing the right things. One of the things that we're doing in Mississippi is, we did delay the school start for about 10 percent of our kids throughout the state. And the reason we did that is because we believe that community transmission was higher in those areas than in other areas of our state. And so we have got to -- we have got to piecemeal this.

And so what you're going to see is, it's going to be primarily a hybrid approach, where kids ensure that they're in the classrooms. I did issue a statewide mask mandate, not only in public, but also in our public schools, so that every kid will have on a mask. We will work with those schools to make sure that the kids have masks. The ones that don't have them, we will help supply them.

Police and protesters clashing last night, for instance, around Portland's East Precinct, where demonstrators started fires, erected barricades, spray-painted security cameras, pointed green lasers at police officers, and threw fireworks toward police lines. Eventually, police declared a riot, a step that enables them to order crowds to disperse and take action to enforce the dispersal order. Portland police said they used tear gas and other crowd control munitions to do that last night. In another incident on Tuesday night, a pickup truck accelerated along a street lined by protesters, at one point pushing a riderless motorcycle that had been thrown in front of it. It's not clear whether the truck driver had previously been driving at the protesters or was trying to escape from them. No one was injured.

The press got wind of it very quickly. And, again, he says he feels fine. He will continue to do his job, his duty. Obviously, he has to quarantine himself for the most part, easier said than done for governors. But he has received wide praise, as you already know, for acting and pouncing on this in his state, before pretty much any governor had, and also judiciously handling the unwinding phase or the reopening phase, stalling that at times when it looked like cases were building. Little did he know that he would be among those cases for which it was building. We wish him well. It looks like things are going OK for him now. He's on top of it and taking all precautions. In the meantime, there are a number of cities and states that are exactly very tough, stringent measures to make sure that the pandemic, whatever it is, doesn't spread. In New York City, they have got checkpoints throughout the city getting into or out of any of the five boroughs and around the greater New York City area. We're seeing this play out in Los Angeles as well, where there are now steep fines if you're having large parties. And in Los Angeles, they're going so far as to take the power away, your electricity away, or your gas away, if you have had one of these large parties and violated social distancing and capacity provisions and restrictions that are in the area.

Andy, these measures go beyond others that have been taken in other states and localities, in Los Angeles in particular, where they will yank your power, and, in New York, where you're not willing to fill out a form or go into the New York Penn Station or Grand Central Terminal and tell authorities what you have been doing or where you have been going, they can slap with a $2,000 fine and force a 14-day warranty.

In the meantime, following developments in the world of sports and coronavirus, right now waiting to see what's going to happen to the NFL, in the meantime, still getting word that there are shock effects from the University of Connecticut's decision to skip the college football season altogether, won't be doing it at all. Head coach Randy Edsall was telling me earlier on FOX Business that it was just an obvious decision for him. Take a look.",

And, as they saw all these things, and knowing that we weren't -- we weren't able to use our locker room, we're not able to use -- have everybody in the training room to be able to take care of their things because of the numbers that you can have, the social distancing, trying to keep everybody safe, our players really felt like the risk isn't worth the reward of going through a season, not being able to accomplish what you want to do as a team or what you want to accomplish individually.

He has been ripping his predecessor and talking about his economic performance, compared to the president's ongoing economic performance. A couple of quick clarifications, though. He that he inherited essentially a mess here and that jobs were bleeding in this country. Just to put that up to steam, though, and just make sure we have got all our facts right, the president can crow, indeed, about how the economy was chugging along prior to the virus, of course, and how it has been coming back since. But just for the record, the economy under Barack Obama gained about 12 million jobs. The unemployment rate did eventually drop to 3.7 percent. And we were seeing, again, the gain in production, I should say that, but we were seeing a steady improvement and a dramatic drop in the number of jobless workers that had hit over 10 percent to roughly about a third of that. Also talking about how jobs in all we're gaining across all key sectors here. Manufacturing jobs were weak in the prior administration. Many in the Obama administration have pointed out that the job growth there started happening when he was president for about eight or nine months. They like to point out that he came in the middle of a financial meltdown, an economic meltdown. Just want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples. And, indeed, we are. This, of course, part of a push on the part of the president to say that things are getting better, and they will continue to get better. There's a lot of attention right now about what kind of stimulus could be on the way, if it's on the way. We will get into that in just a second.

And what he's essentially laying out is his sales pitch as to why it is that he is the best bet for American manufacturing and blue-collar workers in the upcoming election. And he's laying out his plan of what he plans to do over the next four years. And much of it entails some of the same strategies we have seen in the current administration, in the current term, of using tariffs and renegotiating trade deals to try to improve the life and the economy of American manufacturing here in the U.S. Whirlpool is one of the success stories of the president's efforts. The company had long complained that its competitors such as Samsung and LG were flooding the U.S. with low-price foreign-made washing machines. Two years ago, President Trump upheld a 50 percent tariff on washing machines coming in from other countries, which Whirlpool says enabled it to boost production and create several thousand more jobs.

When we talk about the unemployment rate, that got down to 4.7 percent under Barack Obama. I think I might have said 3.7 percent. That 3.7 percent refers to the manufacturing wage increase, real wage increase, for production workers during his presidency, and average weekly earnings gains of 4.2 percent. The president picked up on that and gained considerable steam when he came into office. I just want to make sure, though, we are comparing all accurate numbers. The president also mentioning, not only now, but in other times, how disastrous things were for the markets. Of course, the S&P 500 picked up about 160 percent under his stewardship. This president's had a nice ride in the stock market as well. And whatever interruptions we had for the virus, we have almost wiped them out, as all the major market averages, with added gains today, are about back to where they were, the Nasdaq at all-time highs, the S&P 500 within about a percent of highs, so too the Dow. So, both men can crow about their performance. I just wanted to make sure that you had accurate numbers vs. what they were in the Obama years and what they are faring so far in the Trump years.

So, the market is really feeling, I think, good these last couple of days. But we definitely need, if the -- if there's going to be this political back-and-forth volleyball on, well, the Democrats won $600 and the Republicans don't want more than $200, we're going to have to potentially see some executive action. And President Trump does have some wide latitude here, as long as a federal disaster has been declared, under 26-USC-7580-A, so to give you a little legal law quote there. That's the actual statute that gives him the authority to temporarily suspend payroll taxes, and then we'd have to look at other places for where he could reroute money potentially."

We are up to eight kids there in that community in Northeast Mississippi that have tested positive at this time, eight tests, positive, all of whom we believe contracted in the community, not in the schools. But we have, in fact, quarantined over 100 kids in the schools. And, by the way, this is the way it's going to have to work over the next three to four months. We're going to have cases in schools in our state and every other state across the nation that opens up, and we have just got to do a good job of protecting them and protecting people in their communities."

How do you police that sort of thing? How do you know how much lead time and can you get, when you hear about kids who are getting it in the community or outside of school, they go to school, and then it's a problem?"

We know that there is risk to kids being in school because of the virus. We also know there's tremendous risk to kids not being in school. And in Mississippi, we haven't had kids in classrooms for the last five months. And I'm very concerned about each and every one of them, ensuring that we can keep up our academic achievement. We have seen great gains in our state over the last 10 years. And we want to continue to build upon that. We have got to trust each other. We have got to work together to make sure that we're doing the right things. One of the things that we're doing in Mississippi is, we did delay the school start for about 10 percent of our kids throughout the state. And the reason we did that is because we believe that community transmission was higher in those areas than in other areas of our state. And so we have got to -- we have got to piecemeal this. And while it's not the easiest thing to do, I think it's the right thing to do in our state and across the country."

We have got 450,000 kids in schools. And I made the decision that I believe those local school boards that are elected and their superintendents are better equipped to make individual decisions for each individual school. They know better what their resources are. They know better about their communities than anybody in our capital city will ever know. Now, we're working very closely with them. And so what you're going to see is, it's going to be primarily a hybrid approach, where kids ensure that they're in the classrooms. I did issue a statewide mask mandate, not only in public, but also in our public schools, so that every kid will have on a mask. We will work with those schools to make sure that the kids have masks. The ones that don't have them, we will help supply them. But if we -- we know that we keep our kids in classrooms, and we keep them in masks, and we keep them socially distanced, then it's a -- we have a high likelihood of reducing the amount of spread that occurs, either in the classroom or out in the community."

We have got a lot of dedicated people down here in our state that are focused on it. We know that our kids need to be in classrooms. We know that they need to be learning. We know that academic achievement is critical to so many kids. And, quite frankly, when you look around this country, and you recognize how much of child abuse and sexual abuse and other things that are actually reported, those things are way down, those reports are way down in this country because so much of those reports actually occur because children trust their teachers. And they will tell their teachers or their school administrators things that they won't tell anyone else. And so we think it's in the best interests of our kids to get them back in the classroom. We recognize that we're taking risks. But, in today's world, in 2020, there is no scenario whereby there -- we can eliminate 100 percent of the risk."

That is the theme, by the way, not only happening in Mississippi, but at least 31 states across the country, as things stand now. In the South, they start a little earlier. But we're keeping an eye on it. In the meantime, you do know by now that the conventions are going to be a little bit different this year, with both nominees making their acceptance speeches, not at the convention site. We already know that Joe Biden is looking at doing so maybe from Wilmington, Delaware. We don't know exactly where the president will make his remarks. But we do know this.

But one interesting thing about that is, as we're headed into the convention, Biden will be the DNC's very first virtual nominee, after he said he's not going to show up in person in Milwaukee to accept his party's nomination. President Trump also is weighing his choices of where he will accept his party's nomination, after backing out of showing up in person to do it as well, and considering doing it at his residence on Pennsylvania Avenue. But, as an election in a pandemic is changing how the conventions will happen, it's also changing how campaigns are campaigning. They're spending a lot more money on reaching voters on their TVs, their smartphones and social media more than ever before. Both campaigns are spending less on in-person events and more on meeting voters in their living room, spending record amounts of money on campaign TV ads."

But that money does not include what they're going to spend on digital into the fall. But, also, talking about the campaign's presence online, Facebook is announcing a ban on one Trump -- pro-Trump right-leaning super PAC. The Committee to Defend the President is getting banned because Facebook says they have been spreading misinformation. The ban, we are told from a source, will be for 90 days starting August 10. Facebook says this in a statement: \"As a result of the Committee to Defend the President's repeated sharing of content determined by third-party fact- checkers to be false, they will not be permitted to advertise for a period of time on our platform.\" The Trump campaign has been trying to get one more in-person event added to the agenda. They wanted another presidential debate against Joe Biden to happen before mail-in ballots get sent out to voters' homes. But we did just hear from the Commission of Presidential Debates that is rejecting that request from the Trump campaign, saying there's a big difference in mail-in ballots going out to people's mailboxes and those votes actually needing to be cast before the first debate happens -- Neil."

The withdrawal from the streets of federal agents whose presence had sparked so much anger seems to have simply shifted the focus of the protests away from the federal courthouse there and toward local police precincts. Police and protesters clashing last night, for instance, around Portland's East Precinct, where demonstrators started fires, erected barricades, spray-painted security cameras, pointed green lasers at police officers, and threw fireworks toward police lines. Eventually, police declared a riot, a step that enables them to order crowds to disperse and take action to enforce the dispersal order. Portland police said they used tear gas and other crowd control munitions to do that last night. In another incident on Tuesday night, a pickup truck accelerated along a street lined by protesters, at one point pushing a riderless motorcycle that had been thrown in front of it. It's not clear whether the truck driver had previously been driving at the protesters or was trying to escape from them. No one was injured. The driver was interviewed by police and released without charge.

And it's only gotten worse. They have had over a billion dollars in a fund that was supposed to assist those with mental illness just sitting there doing nothing, while people suffered. We have politicians like Mayor Eric Garcetti who is basically a professional contortionist. He calls for the cutting of the LAPD budget one minute, doesn't want our officers to respond to non-emergency calls, and then turns around when some people are upset over COVID house parties, and the first place he goes is wanting our officers to go in and shut those down.

He seems to be doing well. He did let all his seven children know first, so that he would sort of make sure that that was beaten before the press got wind of it. The press got wind of it very quickly. And, again, he says he feels fine. He will continue to do his job, his duty. Obviously, he has to quarantine himself for the most part, easier said than done for governors. But he has received wide praise, as you already know, for acting and pouncing on this in his state, before pretty much any governor had, and also judiciously handling the unwinding phase or the reopening phase, stalling that at times when it looked like cases were building. Little did he know that he would be among those cases for which it was building. We wish him well. It looks like things are going OK for him now. He's on top of it and taking all precautions. In the meantime, there are a number of cities and states that are exactly very tough, stringent measures to make sure that the pandemic, whatever it is, doesn't spread. In New York City, they have got checkpoints throughout the city getting into or out of any of the five boroughs and around the greater New York City area. We're seeing this play out in Los Angeles as well, where there are now steep fines if you're having large parties. And in Los Angeles, they're going so far as to take the power away, your electricity away, or your gas away, if you have had one of these large parties and violated social distancing and capacity provisions and restrictions that are in the area. I want to get on whether you can do any of this and should you do any of this with Andy McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney. Andy, these measures go beyond others that have been taken in other states and localities, in Los Angeles in particular, where they will yank your power, and, in New York, where you're not willing to fill out a form or go into the New York Penn Station or Grand Central Terminal and tell authorities what you have been doing or where you have been going, they can slap with a $2,000 fine and force a 14-day warranty.

This part of the federal Constitution is very important. Your right as an American citizen to travel from state to state has always included in that -- in that constitutional right the right not to be treated as a hostile interloper in another state. In other words, if you're an American, you're supposed to be able to go everywhere and be treated equally to the inhabitants of the state. So, singling out people for no other reason, for example, than that their license plate happens to show another state that you think there's a spike in, in terms of the virus, especially in a place like New York and New Jersey, where, let's be real, they didn't really handle it in a model way, even though a lot of the media, I think, is now trying to portray it that way, that seems to me to be arbitrary. The problem is, to get this kind of stuff reviewed by a court in real time is very difficult to do. And the history of our country is that courts seem to back off while the crisis is taking place. And then what ends up happening is, a lot of these cases end up being heard later, and they create norms for the next crisis.

The Nasdaq closed at an all-time high today, now over 11000. It has never been in this neck of the woods, one high after another. I believe it's its 32nd record of the year. The Dow and the S&P 500 were also lurching up, the S&P itself now within about a percent of a record, the Dow just a few percentage points of records that seemed virtually unattainable back in the lows of March, when this whole shutdown of the U.S. economy was starting. All the major market averages are up better than 40 percent from those lows, so optimism about the future, as stocks go on a wild, racing ride north. We will follow that. In the meantime, following developments in the world of sports and coronavirus, right now waiting to see what's going to happen to the NFL, in the meantime, still getting word that there are shock effects from the University of Connecticut's decision to skip the college football season altogether, won't be doing it at all. Head coach Randy Edsall was telling me earlier on FOX Business that it was just an obvious decision for him. Take a look."

      "utterance": "And, as we were going through this, we had three young men who developed symptoms, and -- at three separate stages during July. And we had eight guys out at one time. And then we had four more. And now we have 10 right out right now. And it's a 10-to-12-day process that's been taken to get these guys back. And, you know, our players saw what they had -- what they were going through. And some of them had to be isolated. Some of them had to be quarantined. And, as they saw all these things, and knowing that we weren't -- we weren't able to use our locker room, we're not able to use -- have everybody in the training room to be able to take care of their things because of the numbers that you can have, the social distancing, trying to keep everybody safe, our players really felt like the risk isn't worth the reward of going through a season, not being able to accomplish what you want to do as a team or what you want to accomplish individually. And they expressed that to me. And so I just wanted to make sure that their voice was heard, because, first and foremost, they are the ones playing the game. I'm not playing the game. Our athletic director is not playing the game. The board of trustees aren't playing. And the president isn't playing. So, we sat down last Friday with the athletic director and our doctors and trainers, and our players expressed their concern in terms of the unknowns of the virus. How do you stay safe? We are going to be bringing (AUDIO GAP) thousand students back here on campus, you know, in nine days, and our bubble is going to be broken. And then..."

Because you go into some of these visitor locker rooms, they are very, very small, and you can't social distance. But yet they are going to make you social distance on the sideline during the game, and then showering after the game and all those things. There were so many unknowns. And the players just didn't think it was healthy enough to say, OK, let's go and play. And the thing that I respect is that they -- the one thing is, I wanted to make sure that our players had a say in this, because you take a look at a lot of these things that are going on, these players really didn't have a say in anything. Everybody is making all these decisions and putting schedules together, we're playing conference-only games, we are only doing this, we are only doing that. But nowhere did you really see where the players had a say in it. So, that's what I wanted to make sure that we did. And we made the decision. And I'm glad we made that decision. And our kids now have direction in terms of what's going on."

Within minutes of that, we got word that Notre Dame and Navy, a rivalry that goes back and a regular game that goes back, I think, about 90 years, they're not going to play this year. That game was canceled. You have heard similar reports out of the Ivy League, not going to have that season at all, no Ivy League sports there. So this is spreading. I wonder what Mike Gunzelman -- we call him Gunz, the Internet radio host sensation, sports reporter, much, much more. Gunz, what do you think of all this?"

And I hate to say this, but I truly believe that it's not a matter of if, but when college sports are going to be canceled. I don't think that they go forward with it. And you look at all the unknowns, and the NCAA hasn't done a great job of setting protocols that everyone should follow. And just recently, OK, so, UConn, they already opted out. You mentioned Notre Dame-Navy. First time in 93 years they're not going to play game. Ivy League, all them, they had already canceled fall sports. But then three major schools, Michigan State, Northwestern, Rutgers, have all halted football activities because they have outbreaks throughout the football team. Rutgers University right now has 28 football players that have the coronavirus. How are you going to play a season in 3.5, four weeks from right now?"

So, if somebody shows up coughing or sneezing near you, you won't know if it's a cold, if it's the flu, or if it's the coronavirus. And how do you go forward with sports, especially at the college level right there? I don't think you can."

      "utterance": "And that's going to be the same thing with the NFL and with college football, if college football happens. So, here's the big thing regarding football, OK, traveling, because you're going to go to different cities, different states, perhaps across the country. So, you're traveling. Also, the nature of sports, of football, because of the close proximity. You're tackling. You're lining up against somebody right across, six inches away from you. And then, of course, the fact that it is in the winter, and the weather is going to be against you, because people are going to be sick. Testing is going to be huge. NFL made a $70 million deal with a biolab that claims that they will be able to have results back within 24 hours. Great. That's the NFL. But we saw with Major League Baseball, they had to wait two or three days to get their testing results back. And guess what? We had outbreaks across the Marlins and Cardinals. So, you got to get the results back from those tests. Otherwise, it's pointless. It doesn't matter if you wait two or three days, because you're going to spread it if somebody's sick. So, unfortunately, it doesn't look good for fall or winter sports."

If you cut sports is going to have a drastic economic effect. They're going to have to cut programs. They're going to have to lay off staff. And, also, it's going to take years for them to recover. And you still don't even know if you're even going to get actual students on campus still. So, it's just not a good situation all around."
