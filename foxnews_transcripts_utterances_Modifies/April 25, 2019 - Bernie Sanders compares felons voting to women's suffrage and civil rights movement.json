But what Biden did was he said that Trump is a threat unlike anything else in his lifetime. I guess it's worse than war, 9/11, disease. I think Kathy Griffin is running his campaign.   But here's why it's bad for my perspective. That wasn't an argument for Biden. That was an argument for anyone but Trump. The argument was orange man evil. It wasn't Joe Biden good. And I don't believe for a second that he talked to Obama, and told Obama don't endorse me. I assume he also told Oprah not to endorse him, Jesus Christ, and the Pope. And he got, actually, Avenatti's endorsement, so that means, maybe, Jussie Smollett will be next? But what's Biden's primary message, everything was great before Trump. I guess that's true with Anita Hill. That was true when he said that Barack Obama was the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, and clean, remember that? So everything was great before Trump, so we need to get rid of Trump and get back to the way things were.  OK, so that's a lie because a lot of stuff sucked back then. The economy, the jobs, military excursion, the spying, Benghazi, remember ISIS? Almost every day we talked about ISIS. North Korea was a threat. We have problems with Russia that were ignored. There was the Ukraine.  So contrary to Joe Biden, America has actually gotten better, stronger. It's more peaceful, more prosperity, safer. The psychological stuff that he's talking about, that's on them. That's a derangement disorder that they haven't gotten over since 2016. So Trump's -- so they don't have anything. They don't have anything except Trump's response to Charlottesville. That's all they have. And his response could have been better, except Biden got it wrong. When he was talking out both sides, he was talking about the monument debate. I have the transcript right here. I can read it for you. When Trump talks about both sides, he was talking about the monument debate. Having said that, Trump could have done a better job at the start. But whenever a big or ugly thing happens like what happened in Charlottesville, there is a fog of war. The first response is always terrible because nobody knows what going on. I can say I never even knew what was going on in Charlottesville that day. I have no idea. If somebody asked me about it, I wouldn't know. I think the first press conference is always the worst.   But he said, he called out the racists, he called out the bigots, and he said that the both sides -- he was talking about the monument debate. It's in the actual transcript.

And Allegheny County is a county that Obama performed very well in, so I think he's going back home there. But to the video, I completely agree with Greg. That was not a launch. That was an attack. It was an attack against President Trump's character. He's not running on the economy. He's running on policy. He's seeded policy. He's seeding the great economy to the president. He's going directly after the character of the President of the United States.   And he looks like he's going to make this race about race, about identity, and about hate. And I thought it was small to launch your campaign over something like Charlottesville. I think there are other issues that are much more important to the American people, although I'm not downplaying that.  But this was an ad directed at black America and towards the resistance. That's who he was targeting there. But it was slick and highly produced, but I personally wasn't moved by it. He is an establishment candidate, has never polled over 1 percent. That's why before sleepy, it was 1 percent Joe. And as he gets in the race and starts getting bruised and battered, his numbers will go down. But he has no social media army to back him up. AOC is not enthusiastic about him. And he has no vision that's forward-looking. And to Greg's point, it's about a restoration. Restoring the Obama America to what it was.",

If you stop that, you create a tight labor market, very boring stuff. But the tight labor market, what does it do? It naturally raises wages.

So, no one takes it seriously when somebody like Bernie Sanders comes out and says that, it fulfills the stereotype. It's a terrible thing to run on, whereas if a Republican came up and said, you know it's time for prison reform and I'm interested in those non- violent offenders having the right to vote.

I don't like sharing the elevator with people who are one tenth my age, but 100 percent my height. Plus, this means Dana has to watch her language in the halls and we all know how filthy she is. Also, it's hard to fire someone who has their kid with him. How do you do that? Maybe tell the parent to wait outside and tell the kid hey your dad's fired. So, take your child to work day has now become the day you can't swear or fire anyone day. And that's wrong for people like Dana who enjoy swearing and making people cry. Also, I don't have kids so today is really no different than yesterday except with more screaming, which scares the kids when I do it. But the other half of me embraces this day. After all, it's good that your kids see what people do for a living. They need to learn that money isn't something that mysteriously regenerates in a wallet. Mom and Dad have to work to pay for your clothes, your toys, your worthless politically correct overpriced education and really work is often the thing you know least about your parents. I remember my dad taking me to work and it was thrilling. I drove the getaway car, but that's where I learned about the magical money in the wallet. And it's great to see another place where your parents were somebody else and not in a bathrobe. They had a role outside your world. It's where you learn your parents aren't just parents but human beings who are hated by other human beings. So, enjoy this day. But if your kid touches anything on my desk, you're dead. So, you know by the way, it's Earth Day. They've made Earth Day, Earth Week and today is Take Your Child to Work. So, I've combined it. I take my plant to Work Day. This is--",

The young linebacker is described by his former teacher by the way as being having been kind of a class clown. And she said they had their differences, didn't get along while he was in school. But now he's a star in the NFL. Jesse knows he leads the league in tackles and he still has a big heart apparently. The video of Darius changing his teacher's tire went viral more than a half million viewers on Twitter alone and the teacher says, she has a new appreciation for her old student writing on Facebook.

He was like lecturing us about how the park department cares for the grass and we shouldn't have our dogs on it. And I have to force myself to keep watching Biden's video patiently for work because I didn't want to be told by some old crypt keeper. It's not going to bode well. In addition to the out of touch-ness of that video and his stance when people start bringing up things like his authoring of punitive criminal justice bills and laws and whatnot. When they combine the two and actually point to what he's done, he will go nowhere in these primaries."

That might not appeal to Republicans or conservatives, but I would imagine that they did a ton of message testing, and it wasn't just instinct for him. Like, they were like figuring out like what exactly -- precisely would works. The video, I wish that we could have seen is the one that was done by Mark Putnam, but it was -- apparently they threw it out and they didn't want to use it. He does very biographical things if you remember, the fighter pilot from the 2018 midterms. He did those pieces and they're very biographical and little bit younger, I think.

      "utterance": "Sleepy Joe, it's not bad. So it's about energy. Jesse was talking about this earlier. He's always -- is able to portray his opposition as having low stamina. But what Biden did was he said that Trump is a threat unlike anything else in his lifetime. I guess it's worse than war, 9/11, disease. I think Kathy Griffin is running his campaign. But here's why it's bad for my perspective. That wasn't an argument for Biden. That was an argument for anyone but Trump. The argument was orange man evil. It wasn't Joe Biden good. And I don't believe for a second that he talked to Obama, and told Obama don't endorse me. I assume he also told Oprah not to endorse him, Jesus Christ, and the Pope. And he got, actually, Avenatti's endorsement, so that means, maybe, Jussie Smollett will be next? But what's Biden's primary message, everything was great before Trump. I guess that's true with Anita Hill. That was true when he said that Barack Obama was the first mainstream African-American who is articulate, bright, and clean, remember that? So everything was great before Trump, so we need to get rid of Trump and get back to the way things were. OK, so that's a lie because a lot of stuff sucked back then. The economy, the jobs, military excursion, the spying, Benghazi, remember ISIS? Almost every day we talked about ISIS. North Korea was a threat. We have problems with Russia that were ignored. There was the Ukraine. So contrary to Joe Biden, America has actually gotten better, stronger. It's more peaceful, more prosperity, safer. The psychological stuff that he's talking about, that's on them. That's a derangement disorder that they haven't gotten over since 2016. So Trump's -- so they don't have anything. They don't have anything except Trump's response to Charlottesville. That's all they have. And his response could have been better, except Biden got it wrong. When he was talking out both sides, he was talking about the monument debate. I have the transcript right here. I can read it for you. When Trump talks about both sides, he was talking about the monument debate. Having said that, Trump could have done a better job at the start. But whenever a big or ugly thing happens like what happened in Charlottesville, there is a fog of war. The first response is always terrible because nobody knows what going on. I can say I never even knew what was going on in Charlottesville that day. I have no idea. If somebody asked me about it, I wouldn't know. I think the first press conference is always the worst. But he said, he called out the racists, he called out the bigots, and he said that the both sides -- he was talking about the monument debate. It's in the actual transcript. So his whole opening, dark and dishonest."

And Allegheny County is a county that Obama performed very well in, so I think he's going back home there. But to the video, I completely agree with Greg. That was not a launch. That was an attack. It was an attack against President Trump's character. He's not running on the economy. He's running on policy. He's seeded policy. He's seeding the great economy to the president. He's going directly after the character of the President of the United States. And he looks like he's going to make this race about race, about identity, and about hate. And I thought it was small to launch your campaign over something like Charlottesville. I think there are other issues that are much more important to the American people, although I'm not downplaying that. But this was an ad directed at black America and towards the resistance. That's who he was targeting there. But it was slick and highly produced, but I personally wasn't moved by it. He is an establishment candidate, has never polled over 1 percent. That's why before sleepy, it was 1 percent Joe. And as he gets in the race and starts getting bruised and battered, his numbers will go down. But he has no social media army to back him up. AOC is not enthusiastic about him. And he has no vision that's forward-looking. And to Greg's point, it's about a restoration. Restoring the Obama America to what it was."

No, actually, it just gives you the confidence to hire more. Know that if you give everybody these criminal background checks, you feel pretty safe. So the wall actually increases confidence and healthy immigration. If you want cause and effect, let's not forget that most -- showing up at the border are economic migrants. If you stop that, you create a tight labor market, very boring stuff. But the tight labor market, what does it do? It naturally raises wages. It's what you're seeing among a lot of blue- collar workers. You're also giving the workers more dollars per hour, but they're also getting more bargaining power because of the tight labor market.

The fact that we're doing a segment on someone in the media saying we do need a wall is a pretty big deal and indicates how crazy the left has become. This was a flare gun that the media shot up so the Democratic Party could say, wait a second, there actually may be a crisis at the border and we may need a message because Trump is going to hurt us in 2020 if we just say we're an open borders party.

Also, it's hard to fire someone who has their kid with him. How do you do that? Maybe tell the parent to wait outside and tell the kid hey your dad's fired. So, take your child to work day has now become the day you can't swear or fire anyone day. And that's wrong for people like Dana who enjoy swearing and making people cry. Also, I don't have kids so today is really no different than yesterday except with more screaming, which scares the kids when I do it. But the other half of me embraces this day. After all, it's good that your kids see what people do for a living. They need to learn that money isn't something that mysteriously regenerates in a wallet. Mom and Dad have to work to pay for your clothes, your toys, your worthless politically correct overpriced education and really work is often the thing you know least about your parents. I remember my dad taking me to work and it was thrilling. I drove the getaway car, but that's where I learned about the magical money in the wallet. And it's great to see another place where your parents were somebody else and not in a bathrobe. They had a role outside your world. It's where you learn your parents aren't just parents but human beings who are hated by other human beings. So, enjoy this day. But if your kid touches anything on my desk, you're dead.

She wasn't sure what she was going to do. But then Leonard came to her rescue and Isabel, it turns out was Leonard's high school biology teacher. The young linebacker is described by his former teacher by the way as being having been kind of a class clown. And she said they had their differences, didn't get along while he was in school. But now he's a star in the NFL. Jesse knows he leads the league in tackles and he still has a big heart apparently. The video of Darius changing his teacher's tire went viral more than a half million viewers on Twitter alone and the teacher says, she has a new appreciation for her old student writing on Facebook. Tire blew but God had a colt in the bush. Pretty sweet."
