The ones that are getting a lot of attention, New York City, Los Angeles, and in Houston, Texas, where, of course, the funeral of George Floyd, a Houston resident before he moved to Minneapolis, will be next Tuesday.  All of this comes at the same time we are hearing that a number of cities have moved up their curfew times. In New York, what was an 11:00 p.m. curfew that was supposed to start will now be 8:00 p.m. Washington, D.C., what was 11:00 p.m. will be having 7:00 p.m. And in Santa Monica, California, what was 4:00 p.m. will now be moved up to 1:30 p.m.  What they find out in a lot of these cities, when they set a curfew time, protesters just work around that and move a little bit earlier. It's one of those kind of events.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD. The very latest right now, we will be hearing from the New York City police commissioner, Dermot Shea.  Ahead of that, we want to update you on what's happening around the country and how these earlier curfews are sorting out right now, some easier said than, well, at least implement. So, we will get the latest now from Laura Ingle, who's following all of that very, very closely out of New York -- Laura.",

And we have seen people march through the streets. But, of course, what happens at night is totally different. Scenes like this are playing out. Check out -- we're outside of a Foot Locker. Take a look inside of this. This is the kind of destruction we're seeing, these metal gates absolutely torn apart, shoes scattered everywhere. And the rioting and the looting last night was absolutely out of control. That is despite an 11:00 p.m. curfew that took place. As we looked at the mayhem that went down last night all throughout the city, including midtown Manhattan, where Macy's flagship store was even hit in Herald Square, many people said that, actually, they thought the curfew worked to an extent last night.   There were over 700 arrests that happened between 11:00 and this morning. But, still, when you take a look at the damage, you take a look at what we saw happen last night, we heard from the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, today, who said it just wasn't enough. Listen.",

When you look at the incident in Minneapolis, horrible, denounced almost immediately by police executives across the country. But there is a bigger story, and it's not just about this incident, I think. And we recognize that. And we recognize and I have said publicly many times welcoming protests. We respect the concerns.   I think we have to look in the mirror, as police executives across this country, and recognize that we have to do better at times too. But there are protests, and there are honest discussions that have to take place from both sides. We will get out of this together, I think. But what you see on some of these videos, whether it's in New York City or other parts of this state or this country, with the looting, with the attacks on police officers, Neil, it's very difficult times, and it's disheartening. We have had, just in the last 24 hours, police officers shot at, run over with a car, Molotov cocktails thrown.   So, I would appreciate a little bit of leadership from the executives across this state that run for public office. This is where you shine, or this is where you are exposed. And we're not seeing enough support, in my opinion, for the men and women of this police department that are the best, the best that this country has to offer.",

It is an extremely difficult time. You heard him on the news today. You may have heard his comments denouncing the actions of those that are attacking the cops.  And, again, what we need is probably less press conferences by many people and more support, and more coming out and making difficult decisions that may not be the most popular, but decisions that will state the truth, with honesty, with where we are as a country and a state, as a -- and a city, and what we need to get out of this, instead of taking easy shots at the men and women, not only of this police department, but law enforcement in general.

But I think that you know that, when you look at what's transpired across the country, I mean, we have been very fortunate, in some ways, here in New York City. We have had officers injured, and it's terrible.   We have not had loss of life here. There's been loss of life in places across this country. I think all leadership, all elected officials, law enforcement professionals, clergy, community leaders, everyone, this is the time to come together, not to throw -- throw barbs, throw press conferences, and advance self-interest. Let's come together and decide, how do we get out of this, before innocent people are hurt, before unnecessary public property is destroyed? That's what we should be concentrating on.",

We come to discover, in another video -- and I think we have it here as we're speaking to you, sir -- where that protester was flinging a brick, or trying to, at a lieutenant.

That's what was responded to by the officer. So, again, there will be times that we do things wrong. There will certainly be times that we do things wrong in the middle of a riot as well. I think we do the best we can. We have to own the mistakes and own up to them. When we do egregious things, we have to tell people that we recognize it as quickly as possible and take corrective action. And that took corrective action could be a multitude of things. Officers need to be disciplined when they do things wrong. But there is a very toxic environment right now, fed by a lot of misinformation, a lot of it organized. And I think that people are smarter than some of the news reports and Twitter feeds that are going on. But it's a -- it's a time that we need, again, leadership, calmer heads to prevail to get us out of this, to lead us out of this. I spent today talking with -- this morning with a reverend, planning, what can we do this week? We can't wait until next week. We can't wait until tomorrow. What can you do today? What can we do together? What improve -- what improvements can we make to start turning the tide here? And I think everyone needs to think that way.",

The United Negro College Fund president said clearly that the level of funding the last year was the highest ever. Think about the jobs created. Under this administration, we created over seven million jobs, two-thirds of those jobs with the minorities and to women. We had an increase in the labor force participation rate among African- Americans. Homeownership, I believe, was up by two points under this administration, access to quality education improved, help for sickle cell anemia secured under this president. So, when you look at the actual accomplishments -- put aside all the vitriol, all the rhetoric, all the things that some may find distasteful. The actual policy positions have been incredibly concrete. And I would say this has been the best policy position of a president in my lifetime.

Speaking of George Floyd, he was originally from Houston. His funeral is planned a week from now in Houston, large crowds gathering today to remember him. These have been very peaceful protesters thus far, and we hope it stays that way. Stay with us. We will follow the latest protest movements in Washington, D.C., and across the country. The significance of that, as more and more are now calling on the National Guard, including the president, advocating that states get more in front of this.

It's preferable that the governors do it. It's preferable that the feds do it, with the government -- with cooperation with the state authorities. And I think one of the real unfortunate things in a series of unfortunate things is that this thing has, in many ways, sunk into partisan politics in an election year in a country that's deeply divided to begin with. And the unfortunate thing about that is that, if the politicians on each side look like they're setting the stage to blame the others for failure, the insurrectionists on the street will understand that we're calculating that we're going to have failure, and that just makes the problem worse. So, what we really need here is statesmen to rise above this. We need an American reaction, not a Republican or Democrat or president or blue state governor reaction. We need an American rule of law reaction to this to make it clear to the street that order is going to be reimposed, not because President Trump wants it or somebody else wants it, but because we have to have it in order to have ordered liberty.",

Does it make a difference at this point to just clarify, no tear gas was used, the president's across the street, he wanted to go there to make a statement? Any there legal snafus with that?

The ones that are getting a lot of attention, New York City, Los Angeles, and in Houston, Texas, where, of course, the funeral of George Floyd, a Houston resident before he moved to Minneapolis, will be next Tuesday. All of this comes at the same time we are hearing that a number of cities have moved up their curfew times. In New York, what was an 11:00 p.m. curfew that was supposed to start will now be 8:00 p.m. Washington, D.C., what was 11:00 p.m. will be having 7:00 p.m. And in Santa Monica, California, what was 4:00 p.m. will now be moved up to 1:30 p.m. What they find out in a lot of these cities, when they set a curfew time, protesters just work around that and move a little bit earlier. It's one of those kind of events. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD. The very latest right now, we will be hearing from the New York City police commissioner, Dermot Shea. Ahead of that, we want to update you on what's happening around the country and how these earlier curfews are sorting out right now, some easier said than, well, at least implement. So, we will get the latest now from Laura Ingle, who's following all of that very, very closely out of New York -- Laura."

But, of course, what happens at night is totally different. Scenes like this are playing out. Check out -- we're outside of a Foot Locker. Take a look inside of this. This is the kind of destruction we're seeing, these metal gates absolutely torn apart, shoes scattered everywhere. And the rioting and the looting last night was absolutely out of control. That is despite an 11:00 p.m. curfew that took place. As we looked at the mayhem that went down last night all throughout the city, including midtown Manhattan, where Macy's flagship store was even hit in Herald Square, many people said that, actually, they thought the curfew worked to an extent last night. There were over 700 arrests that happened between 11:00 and this morning. But, still, when you take a look at the damage, you take a look at what we saw happen last night, we heard from the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, today, who said it just wasn't enough. Listen."

And as we take a look at people trying so hard to clean up, they have got to clean everything up and board it up again. There's still -- there's still a lot of merchandise in here. And earlier today, we actually saw the arrest of an alleged looter at this very store. He was caught with a big bag of shoes that clearly look like it came out of the store. We watched him get taken away, handcuffed, put in a patrol car, driven away. That's one more down, allegedly.

Any comments that are placing the blame for where we are with this situation on the backs of the men and women of this police department that are putting their lives on the line, Neil, I think, is disgraceful.

    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, obviously, Neil, it's a difficult situation. When you step back, this isn't a New York story. It's a countrywide story. When you look at the incident in Minneapolis, horrible, denounced almost immediately by police executives across the country. But there is a bigger story, and it's not just about this incident, I think. And we recognize that. And we recognize and I have said publicly many times welcoming protests. We respect the concerns. I think we have to look in the mirror, as police executives across this country, and recognize that we have to do better at times too. But there are protests, and there are honest discussions that have to take place from both sides. We will get out of this together, I think. But what you see on some of these videos, whether it's in New York City or other parts of this state or this country, with the looting, with the attacks on police officers, Neil, it's very difficult times, and it's disheartening. We have had, just in the last 24 hours, police officers shot at, run over with a car, Molotov cocktails thrown. So, I would appreciate a little bit of leadership from the executives across this state that run for public office. This is where you shine, or this is where you are exposed. And we're not seeing enough support, in my opinion, for the men and women of this police department that are the best, the best that this country has to offer."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Does that include -- does that include, Commissioner, the mayor? Do you feel that the mayor, as some critics of the mayors have said, have sort of tied one arm behind your back, that you can't respond or reply the way you might want? Is that true?"

    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "He has absolutely not tied his -- our hands behind his back. I mean, I speak to the mayor multiple, multiple times every day. Do we see eye to eye on every issue? Absolutely not. I have said many times the world would be a boring place if everyone had the exact viewpoints. But I can tell you definitively that he has the backs of the men and women of this police department. It is an extremely difficult time. You heard him on the news today. You may have heard his comments denouncing the actions of those that are attacking the cops. And, again, what we need is probably less press conferences by many people and more support, and more coming out and making difficult decisions that may not be the most popular, but decisions that will state the truth, with honesty, with where we are as a country and a state, as a -- and a city, and what we need to get out of this, instead of taking easy shots at the men and women, not only of this police department, but law enforcement in general. Law enforcement is far from perfect."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "Neil, I don't think this is productive. I really don't. When you look at -- when you look at the -- there's politics at play here, obviously. What everyone should be concentrating on here is, how do we get out of this situation? There's marches across New York City going on right now, and they are peaceful. But I think that you know that, when you look at what's transpired across the country, I mean, we have been very fortunate, in some ways, here in New York City. We have had officers injured, and it's terrible. We have not had loss of life here. There's been loss of life in places across this country. I think all leadership, all elected officials, law enforcement professionals, clergy, community leaders, everyone, this is the time to come together, not to throw -- throw barbs, throw press conferences, and advance self-interest. Let's come together and decide, how do we get out of this, before innocent people are hurt, before unnecessary public property is destroyed? That's what we should be concentrating on."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

There's one famous incident, of course, that emerged of an officer brandishing a gun on a protester. We come to discover, in another video -- and I think we have it here as we're speaking to you, sir -- where that protester was flinging a brick, or trying to, at a lieutenant. So, it's possible that this officer saved that lieutenant's life. Do you worry that the image that some in the force are getting is that they're just prone to violence, and you're not getting the whole story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "Yes, but I think it's a two-way street there, Neil. I think that you also have to recognize that we make mistakes too. And a lot of what's going on now is, people have lost faith..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "... and believe there's not enough transparency when an officer does do something wrong. But this is a complicated situation. And when that -- when that first video came out, it was a video of an officer pointing a gun at the crowd. It doesn't look good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "It doesn't look pretty. But when you heard the whole story, you had the lieutenant standing there, minding his own business, and a criminal -- some would say protester, but I'm drawing a line between people that are actively looking to commit crimes and harm people -- walked up from behind, like a coward, with a brick in his hand and tried to basically take the head off of that lieutenant. That's what was responded to by the officer. So, again, there will be times that we do things wrong. There will certainly be times that we do things wrong in the middle of a riot as well. I think we do the best we can. We have to own the mistakes and own up to them. When we do egregious things, we have to tell people that we recognize it as quickly as possible and take corrective action. And that took corrective action could be a multitude of things. Officers need to be disciplined when they do things wrong. But there is a very toxic environment right now, fed by a lot of misinformation, a lot of it organized. And I think that people are smarter than some of the news reports and Twitter feeds that are going on. But it's a -- it's a time that we need, again, leadership, calmer heads to prevail to get us out of this, to lead us out of this. I spent today talking with -- this morning with a reverend, planning, what can we do this week? We can't wait until next week. We can't wait until tomorrow. What can you do today? What can we do together? What improve -- what improvements can we make to start turning the tide here? And I think everyone needs to think that way."

I guess he was referring to military presence or action in cities and states. How do you feel about that?"

There's been many videos of members of this department standing in solidarity with the protesters, kneeling with the protesters. I 100 percent support that. We are -- we need more of that, to see each other. What is a cowardly act, and it needs to be called out, and it has been called many times, is using or hijacking, if you will, a peaceful protest that is trying to enact change, trying to do what they think is right, and using that as cover..."

They'd improve to the extent that, for the last couple of nights, they moved it back for another couple of hours, because they had said they had seen those improvements. And those improvements were also evident just on the streets, but also in the government's response. The National Guard has started sending a number of its soldiers back home because they feel the situation here is becoming much more stable, and they're hoping that stays the case. We know things can kick up at any point, but they're feeling confident about where they're at right now -- Neil."

He's getting an earful from bishops, who say he went too far, incorporating the use of a Bible to make a statement and also visiting a shrine in honor of John Paul II. And then there's Joe Biden piling on him as well. Senator Tim Scott on whether that's fair -- after this."

So was the local bishop, Reverend Gina Gerbasi, who had said that it was a cheap political stunt. Now, South Carolina Republican Tim Scott wasn't going so far as to call it that, but said that, by clearing the area out for the president, it probably did not help his cause. Senator, do you still stand by that, that maybe the president's intent to wave a Bible and to do all of that, but to be cleared ahead of time with tear gas and everything else, it just rattled a lot of folks, including the bishop? What did you think?"

      "utterance": "Yes, there's no doubt that the -- an attempt to show solidarity for Mr. Floyd is very important. How we do that and where we do that is also important as well. And so one of the reasons why I said it wasn't helpful is because of the concept of tear gas to clear the area. I hope the president, as I heard him in the Rose Garden, focusing on justice for Mr. Floyd, that's a very important sentiment, one that everyone wanted to hear the president talk about. He said that. He got to the topic. He was focused on how to move the country forward. I thought, for the speech itself, we were heading in the right direction."

Even though it might be a legitimate criticism, in this day and age, and with everything going on in this heated environment, Senator, do you think that the president should do less of that?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think, when you're running for reelection, your opponent is calling you out in any way, shape or form, this president and any president would respond in kind to that, based on the facts. What I think we should have more of is a concrete conversation about the policies of Vice President Joe Biden vs. the policies of President Trump. If we have that conversation, there will be a clear delineation about progress that has been made on behalf of the most vulnerable communities in this country under President Trump and some of the challenges that were inspired and enacted by Vice President Biden. So, that would be a clear contrast, and one that would be worthy of actual investment of time, energy to hear that debate. I hope we have that debate, frankly, in the future. In order for us to have the margin in our lives to hear that debate, we have to eliminate, A, first the awful death of George Floyd that needs to have justice. And, second, the violent protesters and the agitators in that crowd are eliminating the possibility to getting to the real issue of race and justice in America, and then later having a debate between the president and his opponent on how we move this country forward, and which policy positions have actually worked."

      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "So let me just talk about what I can talk about, which is in my lifetime. I will say, without any question, the last three years of progress have been unprecedented in my lifetime. The fact that we have secured permanent funding for HBCUs under President Trump is something that was surprising, I think, frankly, to the HBCUs. The United Negro College Fund president said clearly that the level of funding the last year was the highest ever. Think about the jobs created. Under this administration, we created over seven million jobs, two-thirds of those jobs with the minorities and to women. We had an increase in the labor force participation rate among African- Americans. Homeownership, I believe, was up by two points under this administration, access to quality education improved, help for sickle cell anemia secured under this president. So, when you look at the actual accomplishments -- put aside all the vitriol, all the rhetoric, all the things that some may find distasteful. The actual policy positions have been incredibly concrete. And I would say this has been the best policy position of a president in my lifetime. And that's what I know from just personal experience and having watched this for the last 30 years of my life."

      "speaker": "SCOTT",

There's no doubt in my mind, watching the video, it was murder by the officer. The other three standing there, having the power to stop it, are they culpable? Absolutely. Responsible? Without doubt. What the charges should be, I don't know. I'm not an attorney. But, certainly, I hope that there's more to come. And I'm confident that the attorney general of Minnesota will do everything in his power to discern the actual necessary next steps. I think there should be next steps. I just don't know what they are."

That's understandable, but that there are many in your party who are concerned that his language and his terminology and in-your- face style is not constructive in this environment. Even the archbishop of Washington criticized the president for all but having a political prop in going to this shrine for, obviously, John Paul II. Do you think he's got to dial it back?"

Anyway, the president is meeting with the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, as we speak at the White House. Investors are a lot more focused on promising developments here, and eventually that things will subside on the protests front in the near future.

But there are a lot of areas in the country that actually are just kind of in the thralls of their first wave, particularly more rural areas here in the South, Southeast, and some areas in the Midwest. A lot of these are oriented around clusters, workplace outbreaks that you have seen and we have talked about, meat processing plants, and socially, economically disadvantaged people, so on and so forth.

Our surgeon general came out just recently and said that there will be clusters associated with some of these protests and gathering of people in closed spaces. And I agree with him. There will be. It's just a matter of waiting to see the two to three weeks exactly what happens. But, as we move into the summer, we're -- large gatherings of people, no matter if it's for a protest or political convention or a funeral or a family gathering, are the things that are worrisome to us right now, because we can -- we can do stuff to reduce the risk in small gatherings and in small workplaces and retail stores and even some restaurants and such. But, in large gatherings, all you need is one super-spreader, and you can have something like the NextGen meeting happened in Boston, where one meeting over two, three days, and you have over 100 people infected."

And the crowds, as the Doctor said, are large. So, leaving the politics and obviously the fury out of there, there is that practical concern that people are endangering themselves, both those protesting and those trying to shield themselves from the protesters. We're monitoring that. We're also monitoring what's been going on, on the lockdown front and coming out of that, because that has been one favorable development for the economy.

They just wanted to cause mass destruction and go down the line in downtown Raleigh and destroy businesses. And I saw it for the first night, broke in the store, all the front windows, many, many showcases, my security gates. And that continued. The looting continued at about -- until about 3:00 a.m., 3:30, I think. We boarded up the next day, cleaned up the best we could, hoping that it was not going to continue into the second night.

There's just so many downtown businesses that got destroyed, and they have to rebuild because of this.

      "utterance": "Well, I think, Neil, what's going on is some prodding, because the president obviously has the authority, if he wanted to, unilaterally to take action here. It's preferable that the governors do it. It's preferable that the feds do it, with the government -- with cooperation with the state authorities. And I think one of the real unfortunate things in a series of unfortunate things is that this thing has, in many ways, sunk into partisan politics in an election year in a country that's deeply divided to begin with. And the unfortunate thing about that is that, if the politicians on each side look like they're setting the stage to blame the others for failure, the insurrectionists on the street will understand that we're calculating that we're going to have failure, and that just makes the problem worse. So, what we really need here is statesmen to rise above this. We need an American reaction, not a Republican or Democrat or president or blue state governor reaction. We need an American rule of law reaction to this to make it clear to the street that order is going to be reimposed, not because President Trump wants it or somebody else wants it, but because we have to have it in order to have ordered liberty."

When the president visited the St. John's Episcopal Church, the so-called Church of Presidents, there was rage expressed there because charges that they used tear gas to clear the area. Now we're hearing from the Park Police that was never the case, even though the bishop there, Reverend Gina Gerbasi, called it a cheap political stunt, and that it was unnecessary to clear protesters with tear gas. Does it make a difference at this point to just clarify, no tear gas was used, the president's across the street, he wanted to go there to make a statement? Any there legal snafus with that? Is -- does it send any different signals on this, and is it somewhat mitigated by the fact that he didn't -- or tear gas wasn't used at all?"

And you and I had this very conversation probably two or three weeks ago about the pandemic and the responses to the coronavirus. And it's kind of the same thing. We have all these legal niceties, and we can lay them out. And we can say what the court tests are and what the president's authority is, et cetera. But this is really one of these times where the politics overwhelms the law. And I don't mean politics, necessarily, in the nitty-gritty sense. I mean we have political actors who are responsible for national security, and they have to act. And, really, if they're going to do it successfully, they have to act cooperatively. And you can say all day that they have got the unilateral authority to do this and that, but we need them, like in a post-9/11 way, to pull together and act."

A lot of it has to do that they think that this will be short-lived, these protests, cooler, calmer heads will prevail, but at the corner of Wall and Broad advancing on the belief that, between that and eventually finding a cure or some resolution on the virus front, and people calming down in this country, better times are ahead, they hope.
