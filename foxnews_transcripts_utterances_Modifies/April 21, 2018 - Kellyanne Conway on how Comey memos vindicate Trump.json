      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Watters' World.\" I am Jesse Watters. James Comey and Hillary Clinton, the perfect pair. That's the subject tonight of \"Watters' Words.\" Donald Trump's rise to real estate reality TV and politics has left a lot of people in the dust.  The two most prominent opponents Trump has vanquished, James Comey and Hillary Clinton handled their losses in the exact same way and for the exact same reasons. We will break it down in a second, but here's the real reason this should matter to you.  Losing to Donald Trump has become a cottage industry in America. Certain individuals are now trafficking in their defeats for financial, psychological and reputational reasons. We want you to identify these people and their true motivations before drinking their Kool-Aid.  So, let's begin. Comey and Hillary fired and defeated by Trump. Both write books collecting multimillion dollar advances and a piece of the action on the sales side. Comey and Hillary both go on national mainstream media tours, free book promotion facilitated by friendly questions and largely ignoring territory where their narratives are challenged. A critical component to the media blitz is reputation rehab, getting their story out there. Their stories are the same. They are not really the losers. They are victims. Victims of unethical Trump who cheated them out of their rightful titles.  Both Comey and Hillary share in the same delusion. They are incapable of seeing the other side's viewpoint and unable to admit their own faults. It's too painful for them. Comey still can't see why Trump fired him because the president didn't trust him and thought he was incompetent; and Hillary, still can't see why she lost because Trump was a better campaigner and voters disliked her.  And because they are so self-righteous, they make excuses. The Russians, obstruction, collusion, sexism, the list goes on and on.",

It's just a ridiculous thing to distract from the agenda and to distract from the really good policies that have been implemented. And so that's what they've got to do.  I mean, it's politics of distraction, scandals incorporated and all this stuff. I am a little upset with the director though because he came across when he was in New York as a straight up guy and the power went to his head and now he's actually equivocating in a way that even he doesn't understand. At one point, he said on the BBC a couple of night ago that he wouldn't give the president, if he was the Director, he wouldn't give the president certain intelligence information, but you just wrote a 350-page book about sanctimony and loyalty and process and rule of law, but now you're above the law and making decisions that would abrogate authority from the Commander-in-Chief?

That's the subject tonight of \"Watters' Words.\" Donald Trump's rise to real estate reality TV and politics has left a lot of people in the dust. The two most prominent opponents Trump has vanquished, James Comey and Hillary Clinton handled their losses in the exact same way and for the exact same reasons. We will break it down in a second, but here's the real reason this should matter to you. Losing to Donald Trump has become a cottage industry in America. Certain individuals are now trafficking in their defeats for financial, psychological and reputational reasons. We want you to identify these people and their true motivations before drinking their Kool-Aid. So, let's begin. Comey and Hillary fired and defeated by Trump. Both write books collecting multimillion dollar advances and a piece of the action on the sales side. Comey and Hillary both go on national mainstream media tours, free book promotion facilitated by friendly questions and largely ignoring territory where their narratives are challenged. A critical component to the media blitz is reputation rehab, getting their story out there. Their stories are the same. They are not really the losers. They are victims. Victims of unethical Trump who cheated them out of their rightful titles. Both Comey and Hillary share in the same delusion. They are incapable of seeing the other side's viewpoint and unable to admit their own faults. It's too painful for them. Comey still can't see why Trump fired him because the president didn't trust him and thought he was incompetent; and Hillary, still can't see why she lost because Trump was a better campaigner and voters disliked her. And because they are so self-righteous, they make excuses. The Russians, obstruction, collusion, sexism, the list goes on and on."

It's just a ridiculous thing to distract from the agenda and to distract from the really good policies that have been implemented. And so that's what they've got to do. I mean, it's politics of distraction, scandals incorporated and all this stuff. I am a little upset with the director though because he came across when he was in New York as a straight up guy and the power went to his head and now he's actually equivocating in a way that even he doesn't understand. At one point, he said on the BBC a couple of night ago that he wouldn't give the president, if he was the Director, he wouldn't give the president certain intelligence information, but you just wrote a 350-page book about sanctimony and loyalty and process and rule of law, but now you're above the law and making decisions that would abrogate authority from the Commander-in-Chief? This is nonsensical stuff. My recommendation to him is get off the air, take a chill and develop a little bit of self-awareness about the problems you yourself have because guess what? We all have problems."

Is it a credible document?\" And James Comey says the answer is, \"I don't know.\" This is huge, Anthony and this is why, because you are only allowed to present credible substantiated document to a FISA judge when you are looking to get a warrant on another American. If the FBI Director knows or doesn't know about the credibility of a document and he's proffering that to a FISA judge, that's perpetrating fraud on a FISA court judge."

Today's services attended by an estimated 1,500 people including First Lady, Melania Trump, as well as former Presidents Obama and Clinton and their wives. The funeral was held in Houston at the Bush's family church and per the former first lady's request, was a very simple service. Mrs. Bush died Tuesday at the age of 92. Meanwhile, President Trump coming to the defense of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen who is under Federal investigation for his business practices. A New York Times story suggests Cohen may turn on his client, but Mr. Trump attacked that idea and the newspaper in a series of tweets. Saying The Times is going out of its way to destroy Cohen and their relationship. I am Molly Line, now back to \"Watters' World\"."

First up, a tenured professor at California State University at Fresno taking to Twitter just hours after the passing of Former First Lady Barbara Bush to write this vile message. \"Barbara Bush was a generous, smart and amazing racist who along with her husband raised a war criminal. F' outta here with your nice words.\" Adding, \"PSA, either you're against these pieces of-- and their genocidal ways or you're part of the problem. That's actually how simple this is. I am happy the witch is dead. Can't wait for the rest of her family to fall to their demise the way 1.5 million Iraqis have.\" Joining me now, Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren and actor, Stephen Baldwin. I mean disgusting individual. She is tenured. She is bragging about how she is tenured, Tomi, so you can't fire her. I am not so sure about that because Fresno is actually reviewing her status at the University. You're a California person, I think you should pay this professor a visit."
