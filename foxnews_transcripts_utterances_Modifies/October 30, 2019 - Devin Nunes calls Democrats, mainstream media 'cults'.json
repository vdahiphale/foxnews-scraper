In moments, Congressman Devin Nunes, Lee Zeldin and Bradley Byrne are here to expose Pelosi and Schiff's impeachment parlor and they're going to tell us what we need to know about what witnesses are really saying what they're not saying.  Also tonight I have a question. Is the Democrats impeachment spectacle essentially a prebuttal meant to blunt Horowitz and Durham's investigate? Ken Starr and Kim Strassel are here on that.  Plus it's time for scene and unseen with Raymond Arroyo. Now the Biden Hispanic outreach that wasn't Kanye West contradicts the narrative with Jesus, while John Legend rewrites a Christmas Chestnut for the MeToo generation.  But, first Republican voters are watching, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. In last night's ANGLE, I urged Senate leadership to step up and oppose the Democrats partisan impeachment of this President. Well it seems like Mitch McConnell may have gotten the message.",

Now, it would be one thing if there was any indication of an underlying crime. There is not. Not in the transcript and not in the secret witness testimony that Dems have selectively leaked. Nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the President as he sought information on possible Ukrainian corruption leading up to the 2016 election. Remember the President knew that that call with Zelensky was being heard and documented by more than a dozen people. So anyone with actual intent to violate a U.S. law would be a tad more discreet, don't you think? This autumnal farce should never be allowed to roll into a winter show trial. Indeed, as noted last night, allowing a long dragged out process in the Senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the House.   Naturally, Republican senators are being bombarded by Never Trumpers and Democrats. \"Take a principled stand against the White House, protect your party's future, stand against Trump.\"",

So, tonight, I offer some further reminders to the GOP Senate as it awaits whatever articles of phony impeachment come from Senator Schiffless. First, there is no GOP in 2020 without Trump. Should you abandon him on these spurious grounds ginned up by the venal Adam Schiff, you'll not only not grow the party, you lose everything.  Historically, siding against a President from your own party in an impeachment battle doesn't offer any political benefit and merely ensures the political dominance of the opposition. Second, GOP Senators need to spend less time agonizing over the daily impeachment drama and more time advancing and championing Trump's proven record of success. Now as the economies of Europe and South America and China are slowing, ours is still the envy of the world.",

Republicans need to get off the defensive and stay on the offensive. Demand action by the House that actually helps working families. Remind voters that the Democrats real motivation behind impeachment is rage and hatred and vengeance. An impeachment travesty is the Democrats only deliverable at this time. They're cooked up endlessly hyped impeachment narrative is all they have to cling to. Think about it, in Democrat runs cities and states what do they have to show for themselves? Well, Americans see chaos, criminality in ruin.  The far left runs California state government and it's been a disaster. Wildfires are fought with rolling blackouts, they have the homeless epidemic, a public health crisis from the spread of new diseases, a growing drug culture, sanctuary city lawlessness, people are fleeing the state. And you have a good picture of life if Elizabeth Warren wins the White House, that's pretty much it.  Liberals took over New York City, a place now hemorrhaging citizens with crime on the rise. And there homeless situation in New York City is so out of control that do-good or de Blasio pays to export the homeless to your hometown. Chicago - we love Chicago, it's hardly any better, ditto for Baltimore and St. Louis. Republicans should be giving voters there are a sober warning, and also hope. These are beautiful American cities.   Tell the people there, you've tried the Democrat Party, and tried Democrat rule, why not try something different? As a trump would say, what do you have to lose? The Democratic Party today exists solely to oppose and bludgeon Donald Trump. As far as I can tell, it has little other purpose. But his agenda is actually working, and the Democrats don't even try to propose a better way forward. Not really. Their only message is we don't like him.",

And they don't expect any Republican will try to short-circuit the right to vote for him again.  The partisan impeachment of an American President who had no criminal intent, who committed no crime, must not be validated or even, frankly, taken seriously by the Senate. Any Republican hamming or hawing or making opaque comments or playing them Hamlet role in this saga to the media, will essentially be providing cover for the unconscionable perversion of the extraordinary power of impeachment.  Republicans stood united, remember, during the attempt to take down of Brett Kavanaugh and they succeeded in getting him confirmed. Republicans didn't buckle during the Mueller hysteria. So learn the lesson. Support the President now against these baseless charges or you'll face the wrath of voters tomorrow, and that's “The Angle.” Joining me now Congressman Devin Nunes, Ranking Member of the House Intel Committee; Congressman Lee Zeldin of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Congressman Bradley Byrne, House Armed Services Committee Member.  Congressman Nunes, let's start with you. This is obviously in the hands of the Senate, because you just don't have the majority in the House to stop this. Are you concerned, though, that some Senate Republicans aren't with most overwhelming majority of Republicans nationwide thinking this is a farce.",

And speaking of impeachment and the Democrats' process, are pollsters also to blame for driving this impeachment narrative? Are they part of this narrative to gin up support for impeachment? Case in point, this is the \"USA Today\"/Suffolk poll. It looks kind of troubling for Trump, 46 percent believing that Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But then when you break it all down, the findings look a bit shakier than what the resistance crowd believes -- 36 percent believe the House should impeach Trump, 22 percent believe they should continue the inquiry but not impeach, 37 percent believe they should drop the investigation. Joining me not to analyze is John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign pollster. John, what do these numbers tell us, because the headline, of course, is always couched to look the worst for this president? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: Right. They are arguing and framing the impeachment -- the media bias is framing it for the Democrats. And you are exactly right. The Republicans in the Senate should step up and cut this off right now because tomorrow there is a sham resolution being proposed by Pelosi in the House precisely because they are reacting to the numbers. We had a poll that we put out last Thursday where 52 to 36 percent among likely voters, they said this is a political, not a legal impeachment. So only a third thinks it has to do with illegal. And 47 to 33 percent, the voters said the president shouldn't comply with this because it is being held in secret and he doesn't have due process. And 59 percent of all voters said this is a waste of time, and Congress needs to start solving the nation's problems. And \"The Washington Post\" the next day attacked us for the worst impeachment poll ever, because their poll when they put it out last time, they had too few Republicans, too many independents, and framed the arguments for the Democrats.",

In moments, Congressman Devin Nunes, Lee Zeldin and Bradley Byrne are here to expose Pelosi and Schiff's impeachment parlor and they're going to tell us what we need to know about what witnesses are really saying what they're not saying. Also tonight I have a question. Is the Democrats impeachment spectacle essentially a prebuttal meant to blunt Horowitz and Durham's investigate? Ken Starr and Kim Strassel are here on that. Plus it's time for scene and unseen with Raymond Arroyo. Now the Biden Hispanic outreach that wasn't Kanye West contradicts the narrative with Jesus, while John Legend rewrites a Christmas Chestnut for the MeToo generation. But, first Republican voters are watching, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. In last night's ANGLE, I urged Senate leadership to step up and oppose the Democrats partisan impeachment of this President. Well it seems like Mitch McConnell may have gotten the message."

Now, it would be one thing if there was any indication of an underlying crime. There is not. Not in the transcript and not in the secret witness testimony that Dems have selectively leaked. Nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the President as he sought information on possible Ukrainian corruption leading up to the 2016 election. Remember the President knew that that call with Zelensky was being heard and documented by more than a dozen people. So anyone with actual intent to violate a U.S. law would be a tad more discreet, don't you think? This autumnal farce should never be allowed to roll into a winter show trial. Indeed, as noted last night, allowing a long dragged out process in the Senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the House. Naturally, Republican senators are being bombarded by Never Trumpers and Democrats. \"Take a principled stand against the White House, protect your party's future, stand against Trump.\""

So, tonight, I offer some further reminders to the GOP Senate as it awaits whatever articles of phony impeachment come from Senator Schiffless. First, there is no GOP in 2020 without Trump. Should you abandon him on these spurious grounds ginned up by the venal Adam Schiff, you'll not only not grow the party, you lose everything. Historically, siding against a President from your own party in an impeachment battle doesn't offer any political benefit and merely ensures the political dominance of the opposition. Second, GOP Senators need to spend less time agonizing over the daily impeachment drama and more time advancing and championing Trump's proven record of success. Now as the economies of Europe and South America and China are slowing, ours is still the envy of the world."

Republicans need to get off the defensive and stay on the offensive. Demand action by the House that actually helps working families. Remind voters that the Democrats real motivation behind impeachment is rage and hatred and vengeance. An impeachment travesty is the Democrats only deliverable at this time. They're cooked up endlessly hyped impeachment narrative is all they have to cling to. Think about it, in Democrat runs cities and states what do they have to show for themselves? Well, Americans see chaos, criminality in ruin. The far left runs California state government and it's been a disaster. Wildfires are fought with rolling blackouts, they have the homeless epidemic, a public health crisis from the spread of new diseases, a growing drug culture, sanctuary city lawlessness, people are fleeing the state. And you have a good picture of life if Elizabeth Warren wins the White House, that's pretty much it. Liberals took over New York City, a place now hemorrhaging citizens with crime on the rise. And there homeless situation in New York City is so out of control that do-good or de Blasio pays to export the homeless to your hometown. Chicago - we love Chicago, it's hardly any better, ditto for Baltimore and St. Louis. Republicans should be giving voters there are a sober warning, and also hope. These are beautiful American cities. Tell the people there, you've tried the Democrat Party, and tried Democrat rule, why not try something different? As a trump would say, what do you have to lose? The Democratic Party today exists solely to oppose and bludgeon Donald Trump. As far as I can tell, it has little other purpose.

And they don't expect any Republican will try to short-circuit the right to vote for him again. The partisan impeachment of an American President who had no criminal intent, who committed no crime, must not be validated or even, frankly, taken seriously by the Senate. Any Republican hamming or hawing or making opaque comments or playing them Hamlet role in this saga to the media, will essentially be providing cover for the unconscionable perversion of the extraordinary power of impeachment. Republicans stood united, remember, during the attempt to take down of Brett Kavanaugh and they succeeded in getting him confirmed. Republicans didn't buckle during the Mueller hysteria. So learn the lesson. Support the President now against these baseless charges or you'll face the wrath of voters tomorrow, and that's “The Angle.” Joining me now Congressman Devin Nunes, Ranking Member of the House Intel Committee; Congressman Lee Zeldin of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; and Congressman Bradley Byrne, House Armed Services Committee Member. Congressman Nunes, let's start with you. This is obviously in the hands of the Senate, because you just don't have the majority in the House to stop this.

This is going to be another missed opportunity for an illegitimate charade - a circus that lacks credibility, fairness, transparency. So, listen, they're losing the process argument. You want to have a substance argument, bring it on Adam Schiff, because we know that Ukraine didn't even ask about a hold on aid until after August 29th, and it was released shortly thereafter.

And I'd say to, its it's one thing to level that at Bill Barr and that he's a political figure, I don't think it's right or correct he's been very straight up in that job. But what is really detestable are the attacks you are seeing on John Durham and even Inspector General Michael Horowitz. I mean, Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff came out and essentially accused Durham as serving as a lapdog to the Attorney General. This is a guy who served his country most of his adult professional life, taking on the Mafia, looked into the CIA. He deserves a lot better than that. And I think those kind of things are shocking and should be shocking to Americans that that they're willing to even go to that level.

But, yes, when you analyze what powers the Republicans have, it really is at the discretion of Adam Schiff. And I think there's another colossal blunder by the Speaker of the House who is empowered Adam Schiff who in contrast to past impeachment inquiries, first of all he's not the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, but leave that aside. Here is the fundamental problem in contrast to Peter Rodino Democrat, Nixon. In contrast to Henry Hyde, republican, Clinton. Those two impeachment on both sides of the aisle people said we have a Chair of the committee who's fundamentally fair and is fundamentally a good person who loves his country. And their great stories, very briefly, that after Peter Rodino voted in favor of the impeachment of Richard Nixon he retired to his private chambers and cried like a baby, because he loves the country. We're so far removed from that."

And speaking of impeachment and the Democrats' process, are pollsters also to blame for driving this impeachment narrative? Are they part of this narrative to gin up support for impeachment? Case in point, this is the \"USA Today\"/Suffolk poll. It looks kind of troubling for Trump, 46 percent believing that Trump should be impeached and removed from office. But then when you break it all down, the findings look a bit shakier than what the resistance crowd believes -- 36 percent believe the House should impeach Trump, 22 percent believe they should continue the inquiry but not impeach, 37 percent believe they should drop the investigation. Joining me not to analyze is John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign pollster. John, what do these numbers tell us, because the headline, of course, is always couched to look the worst for this president? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: Right. They are arguing and framing the impeachment -- the media bias is framing it for the Democrats. And you are exactly right. The Republicans in the Senate should step up and cut this off right now because tomorrow there is a sham resolution being proposed by Pelosi in the House precisely because they are reacting to the numbers. We had a poll that we put out last Thursday where 52 to 36 percent among likely voters, they said this is a political, not a legal impeachment. So only a third thinks it has to do with illegal. And 47 to 33 percent, the voters said the president shouldn't comply with this because it is being held in secret and he doesn't have due process. And 59 percent of all voters said this is a waste of time, and Congress needs to start solving the nation's problems. And \"The Washington Post\" the next day attacked us for the worst impeachment poll ever, because their poll when they put it out last time, they had too few Republicans, too many independents, and framed the arguments for the Democrats."

Listen, Laura, I have the unique experience of having been a Secret Service agent for the Obamas, and I will say in advance, personally, they were very kind to me. I have no interest in disparaging them personally and I never will. But for them to say people were running from them, Laura, we had to beat people away from the Obamas.
