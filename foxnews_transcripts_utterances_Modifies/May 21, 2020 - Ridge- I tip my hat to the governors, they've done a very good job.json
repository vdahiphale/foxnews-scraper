The president is going to be touring this Ford Motor Company facility that has been retrofitted to produce everything from ventilators to personal protection equipment, PPEs, as you know probably better by the acronym right now.  And this is a facility that has been churning them out fast and furiously right now. But it comes at a dicey time for the president's relationship with Ford. It's an on-again/off-again. Because of some coronavirus issues, it has had to shut down temporarily a couple of other plants.  We will get into that a little bit later. But very happy to have you everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. You're watching \"Your World.\"  And we are keeping a close eye on what the president plans to do and say here, but we should also stress that the Michigan roots there are not growing strong here. There has been a battle back and forth between he and the state's governor, particularly right now over this mail-in ballot approach, and whether he can or will withhold funds to the state.  We're going to get into that in just a second.   But first to David Spunt at the White House, where -- the importance of this trip in a key battleground state -- David.",

He's doing this as his transition to greatness to reopening the economy.   You just saw he wrapped just a couple of minutes ago on Bill Hemmer's show. President Trump was at a roundtable with African American leaders talking about how COVID-19 specifically affects that community and other minority communities. The president, though, says one concern for this administration, making sure people can worship as states begin to open up. Listen to this.",

Well, the Michigan secretary of state, she sent out ballot applications, not actual ballots, as in the president's original tweet. He later changed it to ballot applications.  Today, on the South Lawn, the president would not assure Michigan residents that he would back off his funding threat. Also, today, President Trump announced that AstraZeneca will get a $1.2 billion contract from the federal government to produce some $100 million -- or 100 million doses, I should say, of a vaccine they're currently working on.  This is part of this public-private partnership, which is known as Operation Warp Speed. Now, the president says that he will wrap up his hydroxychloroquine regimen. This is news that he made earlier this week, Neil, when he said that he was taking it. He said he will wrap it up tomorrow after about two weeks.  Neil, coincidentally, this coincides with the same day two weeks after he found out that Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for coronavirus.   In a couple minutes, he's going to be touring that plant. And a lot of people are wondering, Neil, if he's going to be wearing a mask. He said, \"We will see\" on the South Lawn. But, actually, the attorney general in Michigan put out a letter today that said that he is supposed to be wearing a mask because that's what the policy is there at that Ford plant.

In case you're counting, that is close to 39 million Americans who have done so over the last nine weeks, many arguing, since that trend has been down week after week after week, even though it's just still eye-popping, that this is about the worst of it.  The second quarter we're in, by the way, is forecast to see a drop of anywhere from 35 to 40 percent in gross domestic product, GDP, as it's better known. And it's from those levels that the president is hoping, with this slow unwinding and opening up of the economy, that that's the worst of it, it gets better.

So, there is this push and pull, because each of these states feels the pressure of the economic situation that really is like a tidal wave of economic devastation, as these businesses close down.

But here's the difference when it comes to President Trump vs. the rest of the population. President Trump is testing every single day for the virus causing COVID-19. And he even stated that he was tested this morning and tested negative.   So the reason that we were masks are because this virus has such asymptomatic spread, meaning, you may feel fine, but you're actually contagious, and you can be infecting other people. So if he has tested negative, then he -- necessarily, he doesn't actually have to be wearing a mask because he's not going to be spreading it to somebody else. But, that being said, he could contract the virus himself. So, look, we're all kind of wading through these waters right now. Should he wear a mask? I mean, I don't know. It'd be great if he did. But we do know that he tested negative, so he's not putting anybody else at risk. And I think that's what people are really concerned about right now.",

But it does not look like, at least, like he's wearing a mask with them. Let me take a look again. It's very hard to hear. The two Ford executives -- now there are two others, so, four gentlemen, they're all wearing a mask, for those of you listening on the radio. They're all wearing masks. The president is not.  The attorney general of the state, Dr. Saphier, if you're still with us, had said that that's the policy there. You should wear a mask. Obviously, he's not. But I did have a question on the mask issue in general, where the CDC, I think you remember, Doctor, kind of dismissed talk that you had to wear one, that it wouldn't be that beneficial, and then changed that policy.

So, yes, we know, when we don't feel well, you stay home, you kind of stay away from other people. But if you feel fine, and you're actually transmitting the virus, that's where the concern is.

But here's what we do know, that, in December and January, about 22,000 people were flying from mainland China into the United States every single day. That's why, in mid-January, as soon as I learned about this virus and its very dangerous features in Wuhan, I began urging the president to shut down air travel. And against the recommendations of a lot of people, that's exactly what he did in late January, buying us critical days. He did the same thing from Europe as well. We now know that we probably would be a little bit better off in the United States if New York City had shut down activity there a little bit earlier.

So, you can count on the American people to do the right thing on an individual basis, like keeping their distance, wearing a mask if they can't, washing their hands, not touching their faces, so on and so forth. That's very different from where we were in early February, when a lot of people were saying that this virus is not going to reach the United States, we don't need to be worried about it, you can go about your business. Some leaders, unfortunately, were even saying that into March as well. So, I just think the American people recognize how contagious this virus is and how deadly it is, especially for our elderly and those who are infirm. So, I think that's one reason why we can get the economy back on its feet, obviously looking for surges and implementing countermeasures if we see any surges, but, so far, things to be -- things seem to be going pretty well in the states that opened up a little bit earlier, just like in some of the countries that opened up a little bit earlier.

Can I use it for maybe myself, built Trump tough. I don't know. They may say that's a takeoff. That's no good. You can't do that. And you've made really America proud, and you've made Ford proud. And America is very proud of Ford right here at the Rawsonville component plant. You're building a great medical arsenal to defeat the virus and cement America's place as the leading manufacturer and exporter of ventilators anywhere in the world. We're now getting calls from other countries, many other countries, both friend and foe, believe it or not. We get calls from foe, and we want to help them out too. And we're making thousands and thousands of ventilators. And I think we really sort of started right over here. We got a call very early on from Bill and the group. And this is incredible what's happened and what you've done. With your help, not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, not one. And, as you remember, we took over empty cupboards. The cupboards were bare. And we got into the business of ventilators and testing and all of these other things. Now we've done 14 million tests. The second country is at three million and less than three million, Germany, South Korea. And they've done a good job, but we're at 14 million tests. And the tests are the best of all. But on behalf of our entire nation, I want to say thank you very much. Thank you very much for doing a great job. Driven by the love and sweat and devotion of everyone here today, we're saving lives. We're forging ahead. And, as of this week, the beating heart of the American auto industry is back open for business. That started right away, didn't it? It starts right now. And you have all those supply chains coming in. They're going to come through, because, if they don't come through, just build product right here, OK, because, you know, that can happen too. But we heard that. It's a big story that we're starting with the cars now, and it's going to be a big success. In addition to many wonderful UAW workers, we're joined by Secretary Ben Carson, who's done a fantastic job. Where's Ben? Ben is here. Thank you. Ben, where is he? Oh, there he is. Hi, Ben.

Before I get to that special guest, I do want to bring you up to date that the president did make a little bit of news there, that he has talked to the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, earlier today. He's gone ahead and declared that an emergency does indeed exist in the state of Michigan over this multiple dam rupture in the state, that federal assistance to supplement state and local response efforts, quoting from the White House statements, \"due to the emergency conditions resulting from severe storms and flooding beginning on May 16, 2020 and continuing.\" So, concerns that were out there that, because of this dispute over mail-in ballots and the states wanting to go that way for all voting in the state, did not preclude or exclude that from happening. So, there is that news, and the president making plenty of it today. But this AstraZeneca news started the day out. That was big, big news, and a Marshall medical plan, if you will, that calls for the U.S. the government working with those who are working on promising technologies, treatments, vaccines, maybe, and AstraZeneca, a big beneficiary of that.

The development and manufacturing of a vaccine typically takes years to do. And we are trying to compress this into less than nine months. So, this is absolutely a massive undertaking. So, what we would do now, with this agreement and support from the U.S. government, we would, as I say, with the positive data coming out with a phase one-two trial, we would start the phase three trial immediately, as soon as we can, over the summer. And at the same time, we will work in parallel. We are standing up supply chains as we speak. We will be starting to do technology transfers. We will start to do scale-ups. And we will prepare for manufacturing. And we will manufacture at risk, such that, if this vaccine works, if we get positive data over the summer, we can really get into sort of manufacturing at major scale and releasing of this vaccine as quickly as in October.

And this is a facility that has been churning them out fast and furiously right now. But it comes at a dicey time for the president's relationship with Ford. It's an on-again/off-again.

Today, on the South Lawn, the president would not assure Michigan residents that he would back off his funding threat. Also, today, President Trump announced that AstraZeneca will get a $1.2 billion contract from the federal government to produce some $100 million -- or 100 million doses, I should say, of a vaccine they're currently working on. This is part of this public-private partnership, which is known as Operation Warp Speed. Now, the president says that he will wrap up his hydroxychloroquine regimen. This is news that he made earlier this week, Neil, when he said that he was taking it. He said he will wrap it up tomorrow after about two weeks. Neil, coincidentally, this coincides with the same day two weeks after he found out that Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for coronavirus. In a couple minutes, he's going to be touring that plant. And a lot of people are wondering, Neil, if he's going to be wearing a mask. He said, \"We will see\" on the South Lawn.

The second quarter we're in, by the way, is forecast to see a drop of anywhere from 35 to 40 percent in gross domestic product, GDP, as it's better known. And it's from those levels that the president is hoping, with this slow unwinding and opening up of the economy, that that's the worst of it, it gets better.

So, there is this push and pull, because each of these states feels the pressure of the economic situation that really is like a tidal wave of economic devastation, as these businesses close down.

So I think it goes away. I think it was just kind of a threat on Twitter. He obviously is concerned about the mail-in voting process.

I mean, if the factory is saying it's a policy that people have to wear a mask, then he should consider wearing one. I mean, I think that's -- that would make for very good optics. But here's the difference when it comes to President Trump vs. the rest of the population. President Trump is testing every single day for the virus causing COVID-19. And he even stated that he was tested this morning and tested negative. So the reason that we were masks are because this virus has such asymptomatic spread, meaning, you may feel fine, but you're actually contagious, and you can be infecting other people. So if he has tested negative, then he -- necessarily, he doesn't actually have to be wearing a mask because he's not going to be spreading it to somebody else. But, that being said, he could contract the virus himself. So, look, we're all kind of wading through these waters right now. Should he wear a mask? I mean, I don't know. It'd be great if he did. But we do know that he tested negative, so he's not putting anybody else at risk. And I think that's what people are really concerned about right now."

I can remember, when all this started, they kind of pooh-poohed that talk. Before I get to react to that, Doctor, I'm going to listen in on the president here, what he's telling executives. But it does not look like, at least, like he's wearing a mask with them. Let me take a look again. It's very hard to hear. The two Ford executives -- now there are two others, so, four gentlemen, they're all wearing a mask, for those of you listening on the radio. They're all wearing masks. The president is not. The attorney general of the state, Dr. Saphier, if you're still with us, had said that that's the policy there. You should wear a mask. Obviously, he's not. But I did have a question on the mask issue in general, where the CDC, I think you remember, Doctor, kind of dismissed talk that you had to wear one, that it wouldn't be that beneficial, and then changed that policy. Do you ever know why it did that?"

But the biggest issue is because of this asymptomatic spread, where you have 25 to 50 percent of people who actually have the virus and spreading it to other people have no symptoms. So, yes, we know, when we don't feel well, you stay home, you kind of stay away from other people. But if you feel fine, and you're actually transmitting the virus, that's where the concern is. And that is why masks were recommended."

I mean, look at -- look at the big message of what President Trump is doing at that factory right now. He took a -- they took a Ford factory, and all of a sudden they're ramping up production of ventilators and PPE, all of this within the United States. And that is what people have been calling for. They are saying that, not only do we have enough ventilators and PPE, but they're going to be shipping it to other places in the world. We have many clinical trials going on in terms of treatments and vaccines. We are positioned much better now than we were two months ago. We have a lot more knowledge about this virus.

We have various -- various countries, France, Spain. We have a lot going to Italy. We have a lot going to a different probably 15, 18 countries. They're calling us. We had the capacity to do this. Nobody else did. So, every state now has more than they need. And our stockpile is totally full. We have a tremendous amount. So now we're really helping other countries, where they're losing a lot of people because they don't have ventilators. Ventilators are hard to do. And I want to say that Ford and General Electric have done an incredible job, working together. And also the companies that worked with you, they really did -- they did a great job.

We were at Honeywell the other day. They make masks. Who would think Honeywell is making a mask? But that's what they're making now, is a mask. It's a very high-tech company. You know, they make the dashboards to an airplane and lots of other things. And now they're making masks. Our companies geared up so quickly, so fast.

Maybe, one day, in the future, when we have all the facts and all the evidence about this virus, which we still lack, in part because of Chinese dishonesty, we may know that. But here's what we do know, that, in December and January, about 22,000 people were flying from mainland China into the United States every single day. That's why, in mid-January, as soon as I learned about this virus and its very dangerous features in Wuhan, I began urging the president to shut down air travel. And against the recommendations of a lot of people, that's exactly what he did in late January, buying us critical days. He did the same thing from Europe as well. We now know that we probably would be a little bit better off in the United States if New York City had shut down activity there a little bit earlier. But there's -- even if you can't quantify it, I think there's no doubt that those early shutdowns of travel from China and Europe helped save a lot of time and ultimately save a lot of lives."

So, you can count on the American people to do the right thing on an individual basis, like keeping their distance, wearing a mask if they can't, washing their hands, not touching their faces, so on and so forth. That's very different from where we were in early February, when a lot of people were saying that this virus is not going to reach the United States, we don't need to be worried about it, you can go about your business. Some leaders, unfortunately, were even saying that into March as well. So, I just think the American people recognize how contagious this virus is and how deadly it is, especially for our elderly and those who are infirm. So, I think that's one reason why we can get the economy back on its feet, obviously looking for surges and implementing countermeasures if we see any surges, but, so far, things to be -- things seem to be going pretty well in the states that opened up a little bit earlier, just like in some of the countries that opened up a little bit earlier.

After that, he announced the proposal you're talking about, which was that, in order for us to get this help for the emergency responders and teachers, people have to surrender their rights if they are injured, in other words, if they go into a store or they go into a workplace where the employer or the owner is grossly negligent.

It's not as if we're going to eliminate COVID-19. It's now become a part of our -- Mother Nature's infrastructure. So, I do have to -- we do have to worry about a resurgence. And, at the same time, I think we have to understand it's going to be a permanent risk. We have to learn how to manage it.

This is a different beast here. And I'm wondering, will we be overly gun- shy? You know what I mean? Will we take measures that, every time there is an emergence of a case or a series of cases, we shut the country down again? What should our kind of policy be going forward?

And one of those risks is the reoccurrence of not only COVID-19, but Mother Nature may fire COVID-24 or 25 at us. I mean, the point is, is that -- excuse me -- disease is now. Global, transportation, finance, communication was global before. This is exhibit A for disease becoming global. And the other challenge, I think, we have -- and I think of my friends that are now governors, both Republicans and Democrats -- make sure that it doesn't interfere with our electoral process. And so I think, in addition to trying to get us back to work, keeping us safe and at least mitigating the impact of Mother Nature, we can't let institutions of democracy go to -- we can't ignore those basic institutions.

Before I get to that special guest, I do want to bring you up to date that the president did make a little bit of news there, that he has talked to the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, earlier today. He's gone ahead and declared that an emergency does indeed exist in the state of Michigan over this multiple dam rupture in the state, that federal assistance to supplement state and local response efforts, quoting from the White House statements, \"due to the emergency conditions resulting from severe storms and flooding beginning on May 16, 2020 and continuing.\" So, concerns that were out there that, because of this dispute over mail-in ballots and the states wanting to go that way for all voting in the state, did not preclude or exclude that from happening.

The president of its global operations, via Skype right now, Pam Cheng. Ms. Cheng, thank you for taking the time. What will this mean, not only, obviously, for AstraZeneca and your efforts to get this out, but the speed at which you think this vaccine, potential vaccine, is going?"

      "speaker": "PAM CHENG, VICE PRESIDENT OF GLOBAL OPERATIONS, ASTRAZENECA",
      "utterance": "This is amazing. So, thank you, Neil. So, let me start by thanking the U.S. government. We have been incredibly impressed by Secretary Azar's leadership and the commitment of his team, and the willingness of the administration to really move at pace. And this agreement will really allow AstraZeneca to accelerate the development, the manufacturing and the delivery of a potential vaccine for the American population. And we, as a company, are immensely proud to take part in this massive undertaking, being able to supply at no profit at a time of pandemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Obviously, there's something very promising that you're doing and working on here that caught the government's attention, certainly the president's attention. How close do you think we are to a vaccine here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENG",
      "utterance": "So, as you know, this vaccine, we are in phase one-two clinical trial in the U.K. And this is -- has been administered in over 1,000 healthy volunteers. The initial data are very encouraging. So, we are immensely motivated and encouraged by the data that we see. We should get data from this phase one-two to trial by June. And from that trial, with the positive data, we will begin a large phase three trial here in the United States of 30,000 healthy volunteers. So, we are very encouraged by what we see. And we are absolutely confident that, as we get the positive data out of these trials, that -- and with this agreement in place, we will be able to accelerate, and not lose a single day in being able to bring doses to the American population."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That is half the battle, right? You can come up with a groundbreaking vaccine or treatment, and it costs a lot and commits a lot of time to get the number of treatments out there, into the millions, because, obviously, you would have to do that. Do how that is decided and how you go about, let's say, you do come upon a vaccine that works, and it's available maybe by the end of this year, or early next year -- as you said, it's hard to tell. How do you -- how does that happen? What's the next phase of just getting it out there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENG",
      "utterance": "So, yes, getting it out there. This is -- so, this is a time, Neil -- this is not the time for conservatism or business as usual. This is the time where we harness all of the energy, partnerships between private and public entities, to really harness our efforts and our powers together to be able to deliver this at the quickest pace possible. The development and manufacturing of a vaccine typically takes years to do. And we are trying to compress this into less than nine months. So, this is absolutely a massive undertaking. So, what we would do now, with this agreement and support from the U.S. government, we would, as I say, with the positive data coming out with a phase one-two trial, we would start the phase three trial immediately, as soon as we can, over the summer. And at the same time, we will work in parallel. We are standing up supply chains as we speak. We will be starting to do technology transfers. We will start to do scale-ups. And we will prepare for manufacturing. And we will manufacture at risk, such that, if this vaccine works, if we get positive data over the summer, we can really get into sort of manufacturing at major scale and releasing of this vaccine as quickly as in October. So, we are projecting that, all goes well, we can have 100 million doses of vaccine coming out for the American population in October, and 300 million doses by early 2021. So, this is unprecedented. And it's only possible that, if we have partners like the U.S. government to work with us, to take the right risks, and to really push forward, as you say, to save lives in the quickest way possible."

      "utterance": "We don't have much more time here. You have been great, Ms. Cheng. I would be curious to get your take. There are so many colleges in the United States that are rejiggering their fall semesters, some going earlier and stopping around Thanksgiving, so they can be off or the kids could be off during what is typically the flu season. So, obviously, they're a little gun-shy going back. Should they be? Do you think that's a real threat, a real possibility, the reemergence of the virus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENG",
      "utterance": "Well, it's possible. It's absolutely possible. And I think, because of that, it's more important to -- for all of us to put all these energies into developing a potential vaccine, right? So, there are many vaccines that are in the development right now. And we hope -- we are racing against the virus. We're racing against time. This is a battle against COVID-19. And we want to harness the energy of the entire industry. We hope that multiple of these vaccines will ultimately work. And if it does, whether it being at one or 10, it will really conquer some of the issues that you are talking about, Neil, that it will really give the comfort level of returning to normal, right..."
