You're looking live at the scene outside of the hospital, President Trump tweeting earlier that he is quote, \"feeling really good.\" And the president's doctor has met or exceed all the criteria to return to the White House, Kevin Corke is at Walter Reed with the latest, hey, Kevin.",

Feeling really good to come, as you pointed out, don't be afraid of COVID, don't let it dominate your life. We have developed under the Trump administration some really great drugs and knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago. Here is Dr. Sean Conley.",

Listen, everybody knows Washington goes crazy. He says what he means. He does what he says. That drives people nuts. But at least you know where you stand. And for him to be able to use this as a pivot point to move in a different direction from Coronavirus, go back to the populism that made him so popular and got him elected in 2016. Don't make it about himself. Make it about the people who he is fighting for, and that can be very effective. Do you remember what kind of supportive team in the spring? It was when the George Floyd protest got everybody out of their house. It kind of broke the fever. And People were not a squared. They left the basement. They got out on the streets and they protested. This is a similar thing. This kind of breaks the fear factor. The president of the United States surrounded by medical professionals gets tested all the time.  He is out there traveling and every thing like that. He got sick. But you know what, he recovered. This puts things in perspective. And I'm not saying you don't fear the virus. You don't live in fear. You're not going to be crippled by yet.

You know, I think it is funny that people who read the worst intentions in Trump going to look at his tweet and when he says don't fear COVID. Look, he's playing it down again. He is dismissing fear. Know what he is basically saying you have to live your life.  You can't live under the thumb of this forever. And I -- it really came home to me. I was watching this clip of a funeral, in which everybody, the mourners were socially distanced. And the widow was by herself in the front row weeping for her dead husband. And her son is like 12 feet away, gets up, walks over to sit with his mother and hugs her and is holding her and comforting.  And the funeral director comes over and says no, separate. You have to separate. We cannot go down that road anymore. So there are untold people suffering from, I would say, the consequences of this. And I think that is what he's trying to say. And as Americans, and as the leader of America, it is important that you understand that there are benefits, but there are also risks. And I think that is lesson. He's going to talk about this a lot. This is going to be the new free bird in his rally. He's going to say they said don't go outside, sir. Don't see the people outside. No, I went out there. And I beat that virus like a drum. I beat it like drum. So it's going to be another story arc in this unbelievable tale of the last four years. This is what he is. He is a programmer.

So he is just seconding what makes this country great and showing strength to everybody, regardless of who you might vote for in November. And I said on Friday, the virus and the economy are inextricably linked. He is speaking to the American people of don't be afraid. You need to be optimistic. You need to feel secure enough you can go about your day.  You can go to work. And you can continue, because that literally is the difference between a recovery that continues and the great depression.

Oh, and that steroid-induced psychosis, so now you're admitting that he never had psychosis to begin with? How nice of you. The fact is everyone was wrong on the virus even the experts, especially the experts. The measure of the leader is to listen to advice and to what is right. Trump actually sent a vote to NYC. He sent tons of ventilators to NYC. He sent money to everyone and they shut down the economy. He stopped travel even when Dems called him racist. He stayed calm when others wouldn't.  But he knew as a leader he must endure risk to expect risk from others. You go to work, so must he. Why do you think THE FIVE came back to Studio F? If said if he goes back to work, we should too. While the media minds for misery encourage compassion. So what happens when a fearless, bombastic personality has a health scare? Will he change? Of course, Trump might be Trump forever. But the scary thing for never-Trumpers is a healthy Trump in a country that prefers it. Still, a health shock can change people for good. Look at me. I went through childbirth at an early age, and I haven't been the same since. Dana, so they sounded the alarm. The media sounds the alarm that it's way worse than Friday.

And he pulled out of a campaign event today.

This is a Fox News alert. President Trump set to leave Walter Reed Medical Center 90 minutes from now after a three day stay battling Coronavirus. You're looking live at the scene outside of the hospital, President Trump tweeting earlier that he is quote, \"feeling really good.\" And the president's doctor has met or exceed all the criteria to return to the White House, Kevin Corke is at Walter Reed with the latest, hey, Kevin."

Let me take you to Twitter, the president talking about his departure from Walter Reed. He said he going to leave the Walter Reed Medical Center at 6:30. Feeling really good to come, as you pointed out, don't be afraid of COVID, don't let it dominate your life. We have developed under the Trump administration some really great drugs and knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago. Here is Dr. Sean Conley."

The team and I agree that all of our evaluations, and most importantly his clinical status, support the president's safe return home where he going to be surrounded by world-class care appear. The president has been a phenomenal patient. We have been back and forth on what is safe and what's reasonable. And he has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond safe and reasonable practice."

This is like when the general gets wounded by the invisible enemy and goes and gets patched up and gets right back to the front line, fighting this invisible enemy. I expect him to give a big speech to the nation. I think the speech should be humble and empathetic. And I think you should say acknowledged that he was scared when he was diagnosed."

Listen, everybody knows Washington goes crazy. He says what he means. He does what he says. That drives people nuts. But at least you know where you stand. And for him to be able to use this as a pivot point to move in a different direction from Coronavirus, go back to the populism that made him so popular and got him elected in 2016. Don't make it about himself. Make it about the people who he is fighting for, and that can be very effective. Do you remember what kind of supportive team in the spring? It was when the George Floyd protest got everybody out of their house. It kind of broke the fever. And People were not a squared. They left the basement. They got out on the streets and they protested. This is a similar thing. This kind of breaks the fear factor. The president of the United States surrounded by medical professionals gets tested all the time. He is out there traveling and every thing like that. He got sick. But you know what, he recovered. This puts things in perspective. And I'm not saying you don't fear the virus. You don't live in fear. You're not going to be crippled by yet. And hopefully, that can be a good symbol for the rest of the country to reopen safely and strongly."

You know, I think it is funny that people who read the worst intentions in Trump going to look at his tweet and when he says don't fear COVID. Look, he's playing it down again. He is dismissing fear. Know what he is basically saying you have to live your life. You can't live under the thumb of this forever. And I -- it really came home to me. I was watching this clip of a funeral, in which everybody, the mourners were socially distanced. And the widow was by herself in the front row weeping for her dead husband. And her son is like 12 feet away, gets up, walks over to sit with his mother and hugs her and is holding her and comforting. And the funeral director comes over and says no, separate. You have to separate. We cannot go down that road anymore. So there are untold people suffering from, I would say, the consequences of this. And I think that is what he's trying to say. And as Americans, and as the leader of America, it is important that you understand that there are benefits, but there are also risks. And I think that is lesson. He's going to talk about this a lot. This is going to be the new free bird in his rally. He's going to say they said don't go outside, sir. Don't see the people outside. No, I went out there. And I beat that virus like a drum. I beat it like drum. So it's going to be another story arc in this unbelievable tale of the last four years. This is what he is. He is a programmer. And it is an interesting plot twist for the last month if you look at it that way."

On Friday, I said I hope this experience would allow him to become more of a model for how you responsibly deal with this in terms of mass social distancing.

We don't know that. He just has not been transparent with us. And as a result, I think it is hard to trust. And when he comes out with this statement today, I just thought that was, as I say, reckless. I hope he is OK. But by his own doctors' admission, he is not out of the woods. And the doctors come, as Kevin Corke said, going to not tell us when he got the last negative test or the first negative test, won't say anything about his lungs or his scan.

So the investors were upbeat that the president is on the mend, getting out of the hospital. But President Trump is only speaking to us as a nation. We are resilient in the face of adversity. So he is just seconding what makes this country great and showing strength to everybody, regardless of who you might vote for in November. And I said on Friday, the virus and the economy are inextricably linked. He is speaking to the American people of don't be afraid. You need to be optimistic. You need to feel secure enough you can go about your day. You can go to work. And you can continue, because that literally is the difference between a recovery that continues and the great depression. Because slow growth in the economy begets slow growth, and if you are sending the American people in the right direction with the right message about resiliency, this economy could fall flat on its face.

They hardly said much early on, too busy gorging on impeachment, and now they arm chair quarterback as if wisdom is knowing what happened after it happened. Oh, and that steroid-induced psychosis, so now you're admitting that he never had psychosis to begin with? How nice of you. The fact is everyone was wrong on the virus even the experts, especially the experts. The measure of the leader is to listen to advice and to what is right. Trump actually sent a vote to NYC. He sent tons of ventilators to NYC. He sent money to everyone and they shut down the economy. He stopped travel even when Dems called him racist. He stayed calm when others wouldn't. But he knew as a leader he must endure risk to expect risk from others. You go to work, so must he. Why do you think THE FIVE came back to Studio F? If said if he goes back to work, we should too. While the media minds for misery encourage compassion. So what happens when a fearless, bombastic personality has a health scare? Will he change? Of course, Trump might be Trump forever. But the scary thing for never-Trumpers is a healthy Trump in a country that prefers it. Still, a health shock can change people for good. Look at me. I went through childbirth at an early age, and I haven't been the same since. Dana, so they sounded the alarm. The media sounds the alarm that it's way worse than Friday.

And I think, you know, I think that the debate didn't go as well as the president's team said that it did for them, and in terms of the audience reaction or battle ground reaction, but in terms of the battleground states, those polls are actually still fairly tight. And you have a situation, for example, in North Carolina. I know that vice president's in Florida today. There are some who think North Carolina is as vital as Pennsylvania. The Democrat in the Senate race, for example, has been running away far ahead of Senator Tillis. But all of a sudden, over the weekend, something that didn't get a lot of attention, it turns out that not only was he with sexting with one mistress but now there's a second mistress. And he pulled out of a campaign event today. And so you could start to see that there is a possibility within the next 30 days that a state like North Carolina, instead of being, you know, just with Biden slightly ahead, maybe there is a way to close that gap, and that the turnout. We know enthusiasm is going to be for President Trump. I don't know if it'll be the same for Joe Biden. It will be the highest turnout election that we have ever had, I believe, in history."

So let's pick up on that, Jesse, because what Dana is talking about so critical, battleground states and the New York Times/CNN poll has him -- the vice -- former Vice President Biden up by eight in Arizona. CBS has Biden up by seven in Pennsylvania. And the thing that struck me about Arizona is Trump is losing in Maricopa County, which you would think is a strong Republican, you know, base."

I don't believe that poll for a minute. I don't believe the 14 point deficit either. That was a D9 poll. They interviewed under 1,000 and a thousand people, registered voters, a month away from the election? I wouldn't run a poll like that. Everybody knows it's not true. Joe Biden took the weekend off a month out. Think about it. He called lids on Saturday and Sunday morning. What is that? I guess you could just take the weekend off and let the media campaign for him. But that wasn't good. I think the President, he's got a strong digital team, he's a great communicator. The whole family can get out and hit the battlegrounds. I'm not worried about it at all. He knew the risks. He assessed the risks. He was comfortable with the risk getting out there in terms of the Coronavirus, and he understands that part of the job as President, you cannot hide in the basement for months and let other people do frontline duties. He's an essential worker. He happened to catch the virus. He's recovering, hopefully, and it's going to go well. And he's going to come back, and I think he's going to beat Sleepy hard in November."

It shows that Biden's lead has been sliced. It's an IBD/TIPP poll, and shows that it's within three points which is basically margin of error, but nobody's reporting that. I find that so strange. Like, why do the people in the news decide that one poll which weighs heavily to Dems is more important. Meanwhile, in the post-debate, the percentage of registered voters who switched, 90 percent did, 11 percent went to Trump and eight percent went to Joe Biden.

And that Wall Street Journal poll that he is leading in with 14-point lead, President Trump still leads on his handling of the economy, 48 to 41 percent. Joe Biden pledged to eliminate all President Trump's tax cuts. How are you going to make the case to the American people, oh, I'm going to raise taxes on your employers, so they pay you less or maybe don't bring you back from furlough. I think that he needs to address that. A well-known pollster texted me earlier and said, if this go around, we don't have really good numbers and polling on enthusiasm. But we do know a couple of things. One-third of Biden voters are voting for Joe Biden, but 70 percent of Trump voters are voting for Trump. Therein lies the enthusiasm, and in an election where people might be reticent to get out and vote in public, that could make the difference for President Trump."

That's a steroid used to treat those seriously ill with COVID. The President will return to a quieter White House this evening. With additional infections among White House staff, officials say many here at the West Wing are working from home. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany says she has no symptoms though she did test positive this morning. She briefed reporters here yesterday at the White House, and the White House official is responding to criticism that she put reporters at risk saying the briefing was outside and that she was at a social distance from the reporters she was speaking to.

And no doubt his family will be glad to see him come home. And there's something about being in your own bed. Like if you are getting better -- I mean, I know he says he feels better than he has in 20 years. Clearly, the doctors are still concerned. They're still administering some pretty hefty doses of medicine to help make sure that he recovers fully.

Both Vice President Pence and Senator Kamala Harris are reportedly being forced to change their attack plans because of it. According to Axios, Harris will skip her planned anti-Trump one-liners to make things less personal. There also will be increased safety measures. The candidates will be 12 feet apart, instead of seven. Dana, you and Juan are both going. What are you watching for?"

      "utterance": "Well, apparently, there's going to be Plexiglas between them as well. So you got 12 feet and Plexiglas. I think everyone's going to be OK. And I'll be with Juan and our colleagues. So, I'm really looking forward to this. Usually, vice presidential debate wouldn't really affect a race at all. And I don't think it will, in this case, either. I do you think it's very interesting that Kamala Harris had this amazing rollout as the vice presidential choice, and you really have not seen anything from her since. She does very few interviews. Now, she's out and about on the campaign trail a little bit, but we really haven't heard from her and she has not been pressed on policy at all. And if there's one thing Mike Pence can do, he can press on policy. So, I'm looking forward to it."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this has to be about Joe Biden's policies. I mean, this is -- he's the head of the ticket. He's what people anticipate that they're voting for. As Dana said, in normal circumstances, the vice presidential debate is pretty forgettable. But you've got one candidate who's had Coronavirus, or has Coronavirus, and you got another candidate who's elderly, both in their 70s, I should say. So, everybody's going to be looking at this with more attention because the potential for either of these people to actually take over is very real. I will say in terms of the safety precautions this weekend, we had Jamie Harrison, the Senate candidate down in South Carolina running against Lindsey Graham, and they had the petition there. It was the first time I'd seen it in place. And it seemed to work pretty effectively. I think the second thing to say about safety is I'm not sure they're going to have anybody in that auditorium. I think there's a push to say why do you have people in. Last time in Cleveland, there's great upset to this day about the fact that the Trump family wasn't wearing masks. Why take the risk?"

This is a big debate just because of the age of the -- of the people on the top of the ticket. And Kamala Harris hasn't answered about fracking, she hasn't answered about court-packing. She definitely has to answer for some of the radical things she ran on. And she's not talented enough politically to defend her record and Biden's record. Remember, she dropped out before I think 2020. She was unliked by the Democratic primary voters and she wasn't a great debater. But I do think the media will crown her winner just because she'll have some sort of sassy hip liner to that they'll say was a real clap backer zinger, and that's all you need in the media today."

You said this is an important debate because of the age of the other candidates. And you have two candidates working into their eighth decade which are dealing with two different risks or comorbidities. So, you're almost saying like the spare tire is more important than the tire on the car because it's in better condition. That's kind of -- what -- so what does that tell you? It tells you that is it time to have age limits on the primary candidates that we're actually -- the reason why this is important is because the main attraction is so old, that the opening band is more important than the main attraction. That's kind of interesting. Having said that though, this to me is like a cold -- this debate is like a cold glass of milk after eating a plate of spicy hot wings from last week. You know? So, don't know. It might be a little soothing, but it also might be a little boring. How long is it? Is it like an hour?"
