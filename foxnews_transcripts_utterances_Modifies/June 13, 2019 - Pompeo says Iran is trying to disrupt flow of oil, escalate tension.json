You meet your handler in a public park in Vienna and pass him the nuclear codes, or instead have a shortwave radio transmitter in your basement and call in troop movements to the enemy. That's how people used to betray their country. The standards are much lower now though.  According to Democrats, Donald Trump committed treason merely by answering a hypothetical question from a reporter. Here's how it happened.  In a recent interview, George Stephanopoulos asked the President, what he might do if a foreign government offered his campaign damaging information about one of his opponents.  Here's how the President responded.",

Okay, just so we're clear on the terms. Wait a second. Are we sure we're comfortable with this new definition? It seems like it might have some unintended consequences.  Some of the very people making red-faced accusations of treason appear by their own standard to have committed treason themselves. Consider, for example, the Trump dossier. Remember that? Everybody in Washington read the Trump dossier. John McCain's staff made absolutely certain of that. Our Intelligence services then used the dossier to justify extensive spying on American citizens. But here's the thing with the dossier. It wasn't American. Our agencies -- the C.I.A. and F.B.I., they did not compile the dossier. The dossier came from a man called Christopher Steele, a longtime employee of British Intelligence.   In other words, a foreign operative. Steele's information, the information that from the basis of the dossier didn't come from this country. It came from foreigners, it came from Russians.  Everybody knew this at the time. Steele said so out loud. Here's a 2017 tweet from Hillary Clinton's Press Secretary Brian Fallon, quote, \"I regret I didn't know about Christopher Steele's hiring (by the Hillary campaign) pre-election,\" he said. \"If I had known, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him,\" end quote.  Fallon went on to say that the Hillary campaign was proud to get opposition research from foreigners, quote, \"I probably would have volunteered to go to Europe myself to try and verify if it would have helped get more of this out there before the election,\" end quote.  Now when Fallon says \"this,\" Fallon was referring to salacious dirt from Russians. So by Ted Lieu standards, you just heard them, that's anti American. That's treason. And yet the funny thing is, Brian Fallon is not behind bars tonight. He's never been charged with treason or anything else.  Nobody on Hillary Clinton's campaign has. They're all still walking free despite being -- and we're quoting MSNBC here, \"Traitors to the pillars of our democracy,\" whatever the hell that means. But at this point, some of them have probably moved on, maybe they are lobbying for foreign governments. That's common. It's a well-worn path for political consultants hoping to cash in. It's also by definition, a betrayal of America.   And yet, it's so common in Washington that nobody really notices anymore, which tells you a lot.

So if we're concerned about foreign dirt, I mean, certainly I think it's fair to highlight the foreign dirt that the Clinton campaign was paying for from Christopher Steele.  It's also fair, I think, to highlight the hypocrisy of the Clinton camp and Democrats who are, you know, fulminating about foreign dirt when they themselves met with Ukrainian officials in the early campaign in 2016, spring of 2016. And they use dirt obtained from Ukraine to basically help oust Paul Manafort because Ukrainian officials shared dirt on Paul Manafort, which ultimately led to his resignation.

You're not going to be surprised to hear 80 percent chose some sort of diplomatic remedy, some diplomatic solution, but what you might be surprised is actually a majority of both Republicans and Democrats of the remaining 20 percent thought that Iran had the right to have nuclear weapons to defend itself. More said that than we should launch some sort of preventive war or preventive attack or strike on Iran. So the American public wants no piece of war. I think what we're seeing here is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, frankly, the National Security adviser, whispering in the presidency who are serving their own agenda, not necessarily his agenda. I think the President's instincts here are correct. He has been restraint in this. He wants to negotiate a better deal for Iran. So you know, I think he is -- I don't he wants to go to a war.

As a result, prisoners are now allowed to bring marijuana with them into prison. The state can't do anything about it.

And the County Judge and myself got together with the Border Patrol, which we have a great relationship with in the Uvalde and we were able to work up a system where we could would, as these immigrants were released, we could put them on a bus and send them to San Antonio, to the bus station there where they could go into further areas. You know, it's really sad what's going on with the border and the City of Del Rio -- Manzano in Del Rio, and Maverick County in Eagle Pass. They're just getting slammed. They're getting -- they're really getting 120 to 160 a day released in their community. In Eagle Pass, 500.",

One thing that's very interesting, you note the political bias here is that they're tracking literal violence, but only against protected groups of people. They're not protecting it -- they're not tracking violence, if it is not against a non-protected person. For example, illegal aliens, Facebook is tracking violence against them, but they're not tracking them against non-protected people.

That's how people used to betray their country. The standards are much lower now though. According to Democrats, Donald Trump committed treason merely by answering a hypothetical question from a reporter. Here's how it happened.

Okay, just so we're clear on the terms. Wait a second. Are we sure we're comfortable with this new definition? It seems like it might have some unintended consequences. Some of the very people making red-faced accusations of treason appear by their own standard to have committed treason themselves. Consider, for example, the Trump dossier. Remember that? Everybody in Washington read the Trump dossier. John McCain's staff made absolutely certain of that. Our Intelligence services then used the dossier to justify extensive spying on American citizens. But here's the thing with the dossier. It wasn't American. Our agencies -- the C.I.A. and F.B.I., they did not compile the dossier. The dossier came from a man called Christopher Steele, a longtime employee of British Intelligence. In other words, a foreign operative. Steele's information, the information that from the basis of the dossier didn't come from this country. It came from foreigners, it came from Russians. Everybody knew this at the time. Steele said so out loud. Here's a 2017 tweet from Hillary Clinton's Press Secretary Brian Fallon, quote, \"I regret I didn't know about Christopher Steele's hiring (by the Hillary campaign) pre-election,\" he said. \"If I had known, I would have volunteered to go to Europe and try to help him,\" end quote. Fallon went on to say that the Hillary campaign was proud to get opposition research from foreigners, quote, \"I probably would have volunteered to go to Europe myself to try and verify if it would have helped get more of this out there before the election,\" end quote. Now when Fallon says \"this,\" Fallon was referring to salacious dirt from Russians. So by Ted Lieu standards, you just heard them, that's anti American. That's treason. And yet the funny thing is, Brian Fallon is not behind bars tonight. He's never been charged with treason or anything else. Nobody on Hillary Clinton's campaign has. They're all still walking free despite being -- and we're quoting MSNBC here, \"Traitors to the pillars of our democracy,\" whatever the hell that means. But at this point, some of them have probably moved on, maybe they are lobbying for foreign governments. That's common. It's a well-worn path for political consultants hoping to cash in. It's also by definition, a betrayal of America. And yet, it's so common in Washington that nobody really notices anymore, which tells you a lot. Jay Jacobs is Chairman of the New York State Democratic Party. He joins us tonight. Mr. Jacobs, thanks a lot for coming on."

And that intelligence from him or quote unquote, \"intelligence\" from him was being used to, you know -- as part of Clinton campaign messaging, calling Trump a Russian agent. It helped inform the F.B.I.'s investigation. It was even used in a FISA warrant. So if we're concerned about foreign dirt, I mean, certainly I think it's fair to highlight the foreign dirt that the Clinton campaign was paying for from Christopher Steele. It's also fair, I think, to highlight the hypocrisy of the Clinton camp and Democrats who are, you know, fulminating about foreign dirt when they themselves met with Ukrainian officials in the early campaign in 2016, spring of 2016. And they use dirt obtained from Ukraine to basically help oust Paul Manafort because Ukrainian officials shared dirt on Paul Manafort, which ultimately led to his resignation. Nobody is calling on Democrats to call the F.B.I. to report their own dealings with the Ukrainian officials."

The U.S. Navy responded to both emergency calls and evacuated a total of 44 crew members. There were no fatalities and senior U.S. officials now reportedly say the U.S. has picture of an unexploded mine near the side of one of the tankers.

But the broad outlines are clear, there are people in Washington, quite a large faction in our foreign policy establishment that would very much like to see a conflict between the United States and Iran. You have done a lot of polling on what the public wants and thinks about this. Tell us what you found?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNAH",
      "utterance": "Sure. So at the Eurasia Group Foundation, we conducted a poll called Worlds Apart - American Public Opinion and U.S. Foreign Policy, and we asked a question about Iran. If you remember, back in last May, when President Trump withdrew from the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, we asked the American public if they were to get back on track with a nuclear weapons program, what kind of response would be warranted? You're not going to be surprised to hear 80 percent chose some sort of diplomatic remedy, some diplomatic solution, but what you might be surprised is actually a majority of both Republicans and Democrats of the remaining 20 percent thought that Iran had the right to have nuclear weapons to defend itself. More said that than we should launch some sort of preventive war or preventive attack or strike on Iran. So the American public wants no piece of war. I think what we're seeing here is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, frankly, the National Security adviser, whispering in the presidency who are serving their own agenda, not necessarily his agenda. I think the President's instincts here are correct. He has been restraint in this. He wants to negotiate a better deal for Iran. So you know, I think he is -- I don't he wants to go to a war. He knows how catastrophic that will be for American lives, for American treasure, for American prosperity and it's not worth two oil tankers -- a Japanese and a Norwegian oil tanker aren't worth getting quagmired in another war in the Middle East."

And what we found on a number of issues, the American people want a more restrained U.S. foreign policy, and they're not getting that from the kind of neoconservative hawks that want to flex American military muscles every time there's a skirmish somewhere in the world and liberal interventionists who want to parachute in and promote democracy at the tip of a rifle. The foreign policy establishment inside the beltway is largely out of touch with the American people. This is what we found in our report that you can read on our website, egfound.org, and it's a problem that needs to be addressed."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, they seem to have no interest at all in what the public wants -- at all. I mean, the poll that I read that you all did, and maybe you're talking about a different one, I think it was eight percent wanted a preemptive attack on Iran."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNAH",
      "utterance": "That's right. Yes, 80 percent want diplomatic action; eight percent want a preventive attack, and there are 12 percent of people who think that Iran -- we shouldn't intervene at all, we shouldn't even do economic sanctions because Iran has the right to have nuclear weapons as a deterrent. So this President, you said this time last year on your show that a war with Iran would destroy the Trump presidency. I agree wholeheartedly with you. I think it would be a disaster for him."

But the problem this time around, you know Ilhan Omar has a problem when she's not talking. And what isn't she talking about now? We learned exactly a week ago that in 2014 and 2015, she filed joint tax returns with a guy who was not her husband. In fact, she was married to another man, and that is just blatantly illegal. \"The Star Tribune\" has run one news story on that fact, and Omar has given a statement written for her by somebody else and refused to talk, and that's how you can know when she has a big problem going. The obvious follow up question is, over what period of years did you file joint tax returns with this guy who wasn't your husband? Well, eight years she was married to this guy whom she filed the tax returns to illegally with in 2014 and 2015. So the story shouldn't be over. You say it's hard to turn your eyes away.

In the State of California, a judge has just ruled that the state's legalization of marijuana applies to prison inmates as much as anyone else. As a result, prisoners are now allowed to bring marijuana with them into prison. The state can't do anything about it. For now, the state is still allowed to stop inmates from smoking marijuana, but of course that will go away eventually, too. That's infringing on the rights. Prisons you'll remember used to be about protecting society first and foremost, and then trying to rehabilitate prisoners. Now, Soros-funded prosecutors do their best to keep dangerous criminals on the streets, while judges hand addictive drugs to the people who actually are put away. It's like we've invented the dumbest possible system and then codified into law.

Some candidates though are going even farther than that, they want full communism right now. In the city of Denver, a woman called Candi Cdebaca just won a seat in the city council. Cdebaca says her political agenda is quote, \"community ownership of land, labor, resources and distribution of resources.\" That is a word communism. Comrade Cdebaca said she is willing to bring it about, quote -- this is a real quote, by the way, \"by any means necessary.\" Now, it's possible she has no idea what she's talking about, or a just rhetorical flourish, but you don't really know. Communists have been very literal about by any means necessary in the past, just ask 50 million dead Russians and Chinese. We look forward to finding out what exactly Cdebaca meant. We will follow her when she is inevitably elected to Congress in the next few years, at least we hope that's where she goes. The alternative would be running a labor camp. Well President Trump is touting his new agreement with Mexico to secure the border, but for the time being. Border communities are still struggling to cope with tens of thousands of migrants. This is happening across the country. It's especially intense in the town of Uvalde, Texas. That's a small town 60 miles of the Mexican border. Despite its small size, the town is receiving two dozen or more migrants from the Border Patrol every single day. Some of these migrants have come all the way from Africa lured by the knowledge that if they can get across the border, they almost certainly won't be deported. Don McLaughlin is the mayor of Uvalde and he joins us tonight. Mr. Mayor, thank you for coming on."

    {
      "speaker": "MCLAUGHLIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Tucker, the towns of Del Rio, Texas, and he you Eagle Pass, Texas. Eagle Pass is about 55 miles from Uvalde, Del Rio is about 68. They're getting inundated with illegal immigrants every day. They're catching anywhere from 750 to 1,500 a day. They're taking them into the stations and processing them and they just don't have the capacity to hold them. And so the Border Patrol came to us and told us they were going to have to start releasing these immigrants in our community. When they first came to us, we had a choice of letting be released at our HEB, our Stripes or at Walmart. And the County Judge and myself got together with the Border Patrol, which we have a great relationship with in the Uvalde and we were able to work up a system where we could would, as these immigrants were released, we could put them on a bus and send them to San Antonio, to the bus station there where they could go into further areas. You know, it's really sad what's going on with the border and the City of Del Rio -- Manzano in Del Rio, and Maverick County in Eagle Pass. They're just getting slammed. They're getting -- they're really getting 120 to 160 a day released in their community. In Eagle Pass, 500."

It's not that we don't want to help people, but we're not equipped to handle it. And the problem that we're doing, we're acting like we're doing these people a favor, and we're setting them up to fail. They don't -- they don't -- they're not even allowed to work. They're being released in the United States, 250,000 people have been released in the United States in the last two months. Those people by law are not allowed to get a job. But yet we're sending them all over the country in all of these places where they have no way to take care of themselves. We're setting them up to fail. We're not doing them a favor."

Allum Bokhari, who's the best in the game on this is reporting details behind the hate agents list. And what they're doing is they're tracking, they're giving you a literal score, a hate agent score, and how do you get a point, you commit hate? And how do you commit hate? Well, Facebook -- it is up to them. And they're doing it entirely anonymously, they're not providing the details. And when you get a certain threshold, then you get de-platformed. And this is what they're doing, as I believe a pilot program, which will be used to apply to whoever they want to get them off of their platform to sanitize it."

And in fact, Tucker, as you noted, they don't apply only to things that are reported on Facebook or posted to Facebook. These are things that happen if you're in public life, they are things that happen in your personal life. It could even be conversations you had private if Facebook becomes aware of them, you're tattooed. You could have a hate item, you could literally have a piece of merchandise that could be determined hateful, a MAGA hat, maybe perhaps, we don't know, because Facebook won't explain even to the people who are being de-platformed."

Trump supporters in particular, of course, and also some people from other groups as well. But the key factor here is that they're trying to sanitize their platform in a major way. And after they're done sanitizing the people who are the low hanging fruit, they could be going after you next."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARLOW",
      "utterance": "They don't define hate and they acknowledge that is per our definition. They literally admit in the document that they are the ones who are defining it. Remember, they're collecting two years' worth of data to give you your hate agent score, they can redefine at any moment, Tucker, so things you and I could have done two years ago, might not categorize as hate today, but they can just move the definition whenever they feel. One thing that's very interesting, you note the political bias here is that they're tracking literal violence, but only against protected groups of people. They're not protecting it -- they're not tracking violence, if it is not against a non-protected person. For example, illegal aliens, Facebook is tracking violence against them, but they're not tracking them against non-protected people. So I'm guessing, Tucker, when you were attacked at your home and your family was attacked, that might not be an example of hate, according to Facebook, but if a non-American is attacked, then it is hate."

Mark Zuckerberg himself admitted, it's a single party town and these people are so powerful and part of the danger, Tucker is they will not come clean and no one has had a peek under the hood. This is the closest we've gotten. \"The Daily Caller,\" the great scoop earlier this week on Google literally having blacklist that are referred to as blacklist, these are real. This is happening.
