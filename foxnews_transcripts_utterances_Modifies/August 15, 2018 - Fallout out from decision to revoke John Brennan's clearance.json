Well, how do you solve a problem like Omarosa? By having something to lead with today. This document is actually dated July 26. They didn't change that today when they release it. So they've been holding onto it, maybe because of Brennan's comments last night on MSNBC they decided that was just the last straw, and they decided to move forward. But it did provide the White House a way to pivot to the story that they want to talk about of the day, and that is this issue. It's very clever, the use of the word erratic because it's not just a word that they pick out of thin air. Erratic is one of the words that you're asked about when you are going to a clearance or when your friends and colleagues or your former work associates, they'll be asked, did you ever see Jesse exhibit erratic behavior because that would be a tell that there might be something wrong with them and they would not be able to deal with that. I do think it looks a little bit like political retaliation that the president has the ability to do it, so if he wants to do it, fine.

You can still think he's a jerk. He still beat the pants off you, so get over it. So, there's two big reasons here. Brennan is just another person who was broken by 2016. He's like the reverse version of the movie Big. Instead of a child becoming a man, he is transformed from a man to a petulant child by some supernatural surreal event, which was the 2016 election.

So he puts them on the list because, essentially, and you hear this now from the Democrats, he's created an enemies list. So he attacks the press as the enemy of the American people. He attacks his critics. He makes people who work for him sign nondisclosure agreements. Transparency, huh? And them, of course, he's trying now politicizing intelligence gathering. He does not consult with Jim Clapper, his own director of national intelligence, about this move.

Well, how do you solve a problem like Omarosa? By having something to lead with today. This document is actually dated July 26. They didn't change that today when they release it. So they've been holding onto it, maybe because of Brennan's comments last night on MSNBC they decided that was just the last straw, and they decided to move forward. But it did provide the White House a way to pivot to the story that they want to talk about of the day, and that is this issue. It's very clever, the use of the word erratic because it's not just a word that they pick out of thin air. Erratic is one of the words that you're asked about when you are going to a clearance or when your friends and colleagues or your former work associates, they'll be asked, did you ever see Jesse exhibit erratic behavior because that would be a tell that there might be something wrong with them and they would not be able to deal with that. I do think it looks a little bit like political retaliation that the president has the ability to do it, so if he wants to do it, fine. I just don't think it actually does anything beyond this new cycle because john Brennan is not going to stop talking. He's not even using his security clearance anyway."

And so -- also when you have complaints about behavior, emotional behavior, Brennan's criticisms of Trump are also pointless because we've been through that. He still won. You can still think he's a jerk. He still beat the pants off you, so get over it. So, there's two big reasons here. Brennan is just another person who was broken by 2016. He's like the reverse version of the movie Big. Instead of a child becoming a man, he is transformed from a man to a petulant child by some supernatural surreal event, which was the 2016 election. This has happened to a lot of people. He's fallen and he can't get up."

He cheer lead at a time when we really needed people there to fight -- to be anti-communist. So the fact that he got this far is outstanding. I look forward to his book because I know there will be one. And the other thing about this, I understand the idea of pivoting, but in Trump world, news is bocce ball. So, a ball comes, a ball be Omarosa, and the next ball would be Brennan. But, the fact is, you can't tell the difference between that being pivoting and or just being another day because it's used every day."

I was at the Nixon Library over the weekend. The first -- when you walk in, you see the first year which is 1968 in the museum, you walked through there, war, riots, domestic bombings, domestic terror, internal-external threats, assassinations, communists were ascended during that period. The only thing missing was asteroids and Rosie O'Donnell. It was a terrifying era. So people have to realize that this is not an era of great conflict. Right now we are in an era of peace and prosperity. But we're being sold that this is the worst possible time to be alive. When in fact, you know, pace Cuomo, America is great. We are -- we are -- we've never eradicated more poverty in history. We have more people working. We have the highest rate of optimism, in what, almost two decades.

I just wanted to mention that earlier this week, it kind of got lost in all the other news, New Jersey was hit with this staggering amount of rain, and it led to a lot of devastating flash floods. Northern Brick was one of the hardest hit areas, receiving 7.8 inches of rain in just over seven hours on Monday. They had to evacuate 100 homes in the 55 and older Green Briar One community. And the U.S. Coast Guard -- I just wanted to point this out -- they were out there helping everybody. The governor has declared a state of emergency in five counties. Lots of volunteers have been helping, too. And Jim Murdoch of News 12 New Jersey gave me that tip, so thanks to Jim."
