Eric -- your sense first. First of all there is a rare element that the North Koreans came out and hold a press conference. Clearly they wanted to put their point of view out there. Your sense of where things are after the summit fell apart?",

And you don't get from there on Friday to a triumphant ribbon cutting ceremony on the Thursday the following week where we don't even have an inventory of what weapons they have in the country. We don't know where everything is. We don't have inspectors on the ground.

And he said he had never been to Prague and he said that to Congress. So apparently there were people who actually thought even at this late date that Michael Cohen was going to be this key to the whole Russia conspiracy. So the testimony that he gave yesterday gave them nothing, no collusion, no trip to Prague, no blackmail.

Eric -- your sense first. First of all there is a rare element that the North Koreans came out and hold a press conference. Clearly they wanted to put their point of view out there.

Because that leaves you less likely to be in a situation where you fly a thousand miles and you don't have anything physical to show for it. Now this is a unique situation and Kim Jong-un is not the leader of every country in the world.

Lawyers for Jared Ramos are said to be considering changing his please to not criminally responsible due to insanity. Fox 2 in San Francisco as floodwaters that turned two Northern California communities into islands have started to recede after inundating about 2,000 buildings. The Russian River north of San Francisco reached about 46 feet Wednesday night, its highest level in 25 years. And this is a live look at Philadelphia from Fox 29.

First beyond our borders tonight. Heavy rain turned roads into shallow rivers outside Jerusalem today. One commuter was stranded atop his car in gushing floodwaters. Israeli rescuers soon responded wading through the waist deep water to ferry that trapped man to land. In the past few days the Jerusalem area has seen thunderstorms and rainfall that has swamped the streets. Authorities say the accident that killed at least 25 people yesterday in Cairo was caused by a fight between two train conductors. A single rail car collided head-on with the barrier at the city's main train station. Egypt's prosecutor general says the locomotive's conductor forgot to put on the brakes before leaving his car to fight with another conductor whose railcar was blocking his. Cabinet ministers are rallying around Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau a day after his former attorney general testified Trudeau had inappropriately tried to pressure her to avoid prosecution of a major Canadian engineering company in order to save jobs. Trudeau has acknowledged raising the issue with the official but says it was done appropriately. Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight. As we head to break, Hanoi's economy here is booming. But one area in particular has a very long history of commerce."

It used to be the hotel for the White House press corps too, but when the North Korean leader arrived, he said no, this is not going to work. And the White House press corps was kicked out.

The latest is an allegation that first lady Pam Northam handed raw cotton to only black students during a student tour of the governor's mansion and asked them to imagine being and having to pick it. A spokesman for Governor Ralph Northam says Mrs. Northam hosted about 100 House and Senate pages, and she invited all of them to touch agricultural products such as dried tobacco, produce, and cotton. The first lady says she has provided the same educational tour to executive mansion visitors over the past few months, and she has used agricultural crops to illustrate a painful period in Virginia history. In a statement provided to Fox News, Pam Northam says, quote, \"I regret that I have upset anyone.\" Governor Northam has been under intense pressure since the revelation of a racist picture on his medical school yearbook page and after admitting he once wore a blackface.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Donald Trump certainly doesn't need to make North Korea's human rights abuses the centerpiece of his messaging, but neither does he need to speak on behalf or defend the regime leader in this horrible case of Otto Warmbier's death. At the same time, neither do critics need to make this the sole talking point of the post summit analysis. There is a lot of good that came from this summit. As Winston Churchill liked to say, meeting jaw to job is better than war. This was an important thing. There's a lot to focus on in terms of the positive compared to where we were a couple of years ago."

JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": There are certainly people like John Bolton, the vice president, Mike Pence, and some hawkish senators like Marco Rubio, are much, much happier than with this outcome than the would have been with a deal that may have not been worth the paper it was written on. The real tell for me was, I think it was Friday when Steve Biegun, who is the envoy to North Korea working with Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, he admitted on the record that he didn't believe that the North Koreans had made the basic decision to denuclearize. And you don't get from there on Friday to a triumphant ribbon cutting ceremony on the Thursday the following week where we don't even have an inventory of what weapons they have in the country. We don't know where everything is. We don't have inspectors on the ground. So no one who has followed a seriously, and we wrote this a week ago, no one who has followed this issue seriously thought that North Korea was going to get to where the Trump administration has wanted them. So if you're worrying about North Korea and you are hawkish on this issue, you're much happier with an outcome like this than with the alternative, which would have been a victory declaration and something pretty light."

TOM ROGAN, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes, and I think there is. I think it is quite notable that President Trump, that the White House is pushing this line. It is what happens, so it's fair that President Trump walked away because it shows for the first time that ability to push back against the North Koreans even in the different state of being that Trump has with Kim Jong-un in terms of going to Hanoi and meeting with him. And I think the rationale behind that was to say, listen, I am amenable to a deal. I'm going to carry water for you in terms of things like Otto Warmbier. I'm going to do these unconventional things, but you must make the decision to make the necessary concessions to us. And I think when they saw the kind of demands, basically a really significant chunk of sanctions release that they were demanding in return for just the closure of Yongbyon, that frankly, Kim Jong-un is not there yet. He needs to go back and have that jockeying. Again, the key guy to look for here is Yong- chol who si the guy you always see with Kim Jong-un who is the hardliner behind the scenes. And I think Trump is saying, figure out your own internal stuff and then let's go for it again."

And he said he had never been to Prague and he said that to Congress. So apparently there were people who actually thought even at this late date that Michael Cohen was going to be this key to the whole Russia conspiracy. So the testimony that he gave yesterday gave them nothing, no collusion, no trip to Prague, no blackmail.
