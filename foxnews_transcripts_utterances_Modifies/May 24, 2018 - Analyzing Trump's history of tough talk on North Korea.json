If and when Kim Jong Un's uses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting. In the meantime, our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed, and maximum pressure campaign will continue.

But a short time ago, the president seemed to be vindicated as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un sent out some officials to basically back down and say they want to revive face-to-face talks and believe they can bridge some of the tensions they have with the Trump administration. That's a dramatic reversal that came after the president, remember after weeks of being more gentle and encouraging to the man he once dubbed Little Rocket Man, went back to the tough talk by saying he would not stand for the saber-rattling that we've seen by North Korean officials in recent days.   The president furious that North Korean's deputy foreign minister blew up over in the interview that our own Martha MacCallum did with Vice President Mike Pence. The vice president warned about the example of Libya and how things will end badly for Kim if he does not make a deal. North Korea's deputy foreign minister reacted by warning of a nuclear showdown and called Pence a, quote, political dummy. So, in a letter to Kim that officials here say the president dictated himself, the commander-in-chief cited the recent, quote, anger and open hostility as the reason for scrapping the summit and added the warning, you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.  Now, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi reacted to the letter to Kim by mocking the president's tone which they called soft. But she may eat those words now that North Korea appears to be backing down.  Watch. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D—CALIF., MINORITY LEADER: I think it's a good thing for Kim Jong Un, when he got this letter from the president saying, OK, never mind, he must be having a giggle fit. In this very chummy palsy-walsy letter to Kim Jong-un. He, Kim Jong-un, is the big winner.",

Next thing that happens is you've got Pompeo then reading Trump's letter, saying I look forward but from Kim saying, I look forward to meeting with you.

You may recall that that Secretary Pompeo visited North Korea, had very good discussions in private, and we've also been having these overt negotiations.   They've already begun.

And President Trump understands that he is a commander-in-chief of the most powerful country in the world and he mentioned $700 billion twice, you know, in during his press conference today and that number is are the size of our defense budget and this was a strategic messaging to North Korea. He understands the leverage that he has here and that $700 billions number of our defense budget is 25 to 30 times the size of the gross domestic product of North Korea. So, if you're on the North Korean side and you hear that number, that's an overwhelming figure.

I mean, do you think that the Chinese want to see thousands of U.S. soldiers 200 miles off their border sitting there in South Korea. So, there -- they've been playing us all along and we have to be very careful what we do here. But I think what we've seen just overall with these talks is we've been witnessing today a master class in negotiation that's been playing out on the world stage. The fact of the matter is that these deals are all about leverage, OK? And we're the strongest country in the entire world. We have -- we don't need to listen to a country or bow down to a country that has the economic GDP of less than the size of Honduras. And so, it's very important when it comes to all these talks that Trump is very careful about being too accommodating to Kim Jong Un because what it does is it risks this recognition for him of what he's always believed would happen all along when it comes to having this nuclear arsenal.

This -- you know, President Trump knows and has always known that diplomacy needs the credible use -- it needs the credible threat of military force.

But a short time ago, the president seemed to be vindicated as North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un sent out some officials to basically back down and say they want to revive face-to-face talks and believe they can bridge some of the tensions they have with the Trump administration. That's a dramatic reversal that came after the president, remember after weeks of being more gentle and encouraging to the man he once dubbed Little Rocket Man, went back to the tough talk by saying he would not stand for the saber-rattling that we've seen by North Korean officials in recent days. The president furious that North Korean's deputy foreign minister blew up over in the interview that our own Martha MacCallum did with Vice President Mike Pence. The vice president warned about the example of Libya and how things will end badly for Kim if he does not make a deal. North Korea's deputy foreign minister reacted by warning of a nuclear showdown and called Pence a, quote, political dummy. So, in a letter to Kim that officials here say the president dictated himself, the commander-in-chief cited the recent, quote, anger and open hostility as the reason for scrapping the summit and added the warning, you talk about your nuclear capabilities but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used. Now, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi reacted to the letter to Kim by mocking the president's tone which they called soft. But she may eat those words now that North Korea appears to be backing down. Watch. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D—CALIF., MINORITY LEADER: I think it's a good thing for Kim Jong Un, when he got this letter from the president saying, OK, never mind, he must be having a giggle fit. In this very chummy palsy-walsy letter to Kim Jong-un. He, Kim Jong-un, is the big winner."

They're trying to enhance their own standing and anticipation of a summit and weaken ours. And we saw the president respond strongly, forcefully, with a reminder that our military is able and ready to strike if needed, that we're working with our allies. We're going to continue maximum pressure. But at the same time if North Korea is ready to, talk we're here to listen."

Next thing that happens is you've got Pompeo then reading Trump's letter, saying I look forward but from Kim saying, I look forward to meeting with you. But the president is also saying at the same time, our nuclear capabilities are bigger than yours and I pray to God we'll never use them. Now, we have North Korea saying, hey, we're ready to sit down. Is this negotiations -- is this how they do it or is this a poker game?"

I think all those comments about our national security advisor John Bolton and Vice President Pence, those were just excuses for policies North Korea was or tactics North Korea was going to use regardless, and I think we are in for -- we've been conducting private negotiations. You may recall that that Secretary Pompeo visited North Korea, had very good discussions in private, and we've also been having these overt negotiations. They've already begun. The problem is we have decades of failed policy and the North Koreans have this muscle memory of being used to receiving economic benefits just for showing up at the table.

But my final question to you, Daniel, is it that we had people waiting three days to establish where the meet would actually take place and the North Koreans didn't meet with us to make those final plans?"

At the center of this military cult is a deranged belief in the leader's destiny to rule as parent protector over a conquered Korean peninsula and an enslaved Korean people. This man will not get away with what he's doing, believe me. And if he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat, which by the way he has been uttering for years and his family has been uttering for years or if he does anything with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."

And President Trump understands that he is a commander-in-chief of the most powerful country in the world and he mentioned $700 billion twice, you know, in during his press conference today and that number is are the size of our defense budget and this was a strategic messaging to North Korea. He understands the leverage that he has here and that $700 billions number of our defense budget is 25 to 30 times the size of the gross domestic product of North Korea. So, if you're on the North Korean side and you hear that number, that's an overwhelming figure.

BRETT VELICOVICH, U.S. ARMY VETERAN AND \"DRONE WARRIOR\" AUTHOR: (AUDIO GAP) and playing puppet master this whole entire time. From day one, this has always been just as much in negotiation with China as it is with North Korea. I mean, do you think that the Chinese want to see thousands of U.S. soldiers 200 miles off their border sitting there in South Korea. So, there -- they've been playing us all along and we have to be very careful what we do here. But I think what we've seen just overall with these talks is we've been witnessing today a master class in negotiation that's been playing out on the world stage. The fact of the matter is that these deals are all about leverage, OK? And we're the strongest country in the entire world. We have -- we don't need to listen to a country or bow down to a country that has the economic GDP of less than the size of Honduras. And so, it's very important when it comes to all these talks that Trump is very careful about being too accommodating to Kim Jong Un because what it does is it risks this recognition for him of what he's always believed would happen all along when it comes to having this nuclear arsenal. So, this deal has to get done but it needs to be done right or not at all. And in the end, we've taken back control here."

This -- you know, President Trump knows and has always known that diplomacy needs the credible use -- it needs the credible threat of military force. And not only do we have that, the North Koreans have seen President Trump train and equip and fund our military how it needs to be fund. So, he has come into this with three key preconditions in that military exercises with our South Korean allies and our Japanese allies will continue, denuclearization means exactly that that, that it is full, verifiable denuclearization. And that key here is that the sanctions will continue. So, what do we -- what do I hope to see next from our commander-in-chief is that another round of sanctions the 7th Fleet sitting off the coast of North Korea, and that for everyone calling him a war-monger, they're absolutely wrong.

You remember Obama's hostage deal when they sent the Taliban five to get Bergdahl who was a deserter, all those people were saying what a great thing that was.

And so, the president has done more to engage North Korea than any president, but he's doing it from a position of strength, and that's the key thing. I think if Kim Jong Un is going to evaluate this in the road that he may have chosen, with their recent behavior, that's not the best road for him.

      "utterance": "They're drawing a distinction without a difference. If an undercover informant infiltrates a campaign, insinuates himself into conservations to gather evidence secretly, that's fine. Now you can call it other things as well but you have to have the proper legal justification to do it, and I'm guessing that they didn't have that."

So either James Comey went rogue on this thing or Loretta Lynch approved it which shows the Obama administration is all over it.

      "utterance": "Well, they hear James Clapper talking about how the former director of national intelligence has an aversion to spying. Judge, it's kind of like the former director of the Food and Drug Administration saying they have an aversion to broccoli. I mean, this wording that Washington likes to use is what makes most Americans shake their head. And then we find out news that you have the FBI trying to redact information that has nothing to do with national security. Chuck Grassley, the senator from Iowa came out today saying they wanted to redact the fact that Andrew McCabe who Donald Trump fired paid $70,000 for a conference room table that they wanted to keep Congress from knowing about. Now it's information like that that American saved well, wait a second. Maybe we do need to get more Republicans put into Congress so that we can get some spending cuts put under control and get Congress to rein in the spending that the Justice Department is doing."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think there's any question they need to housecleaning. And I'll go back to you, David. I mean, first of all, James Comey is fired. Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI he's out. They really had to push him out. Christopher Wray didn't want to out. Ribicki is out, chief of staff for the FBI. Baker is out, counsel for the FBI. Page of the Strzok-Page lovebirds, she's out. I mean, right now, doesn't this signal to the American people that this is a cabal that is so corrupt that we have no choice but to recognize that the obama administration was an administration that was focus on making sure that Hillary Clinton won?"

      "speaker": "AVELLA",
      "utterance": "Yes. And you had Eric Holder who left the job as attorney general to go run an organization whose chief focus was to elect Democrats. That's what he is doing right now. His goal is to elect more Democrats to state and local offices around the country. He left the Obama administration to run this organization. Add to that, you now have the constant drumbeat by Democratic congressional candidates that it's time for impeachment. And the more Americans hear about that -- and that's what's happening in these primaries. They are not nominating men and women who are out talking about job creation and how to keep the economy going, and how to bring down more regulations and increase trade opportunities, no. What are they -- their message is all anti-President Trump, and the drumbeat for impeachment is going to continue, the closer and closer we get to elections as they continue to nominate more and more progressive candidates."

I think a thing that I've done for the country, the firing of James Comey is going to go down as a very good thing. The FBI is great, I know so many people. The FBI is a fantastic institution.

That's normally why you don't hand over something when you were supposed to have morally superior framework. You do that when you want to hide something. But let's remember the president there, it's very comfortable, it's obvious. Because at this point, let's remember the context, every single prediction he's made has come true, including one of the earliest ones were he declared that his campaign was being spied on. He was mocked, he was ridiculed."

We've seen the behavior of Mr. Comey, decline, the nature of his book, the spy -- effectively the leaking of material that he wrote down with meetings with the president, all of these things indicate a man that had some problems.

And on top of that, the most important thing that he can do right now at the stroke of a pen, he needs to pull the clearances of Clapper, Comey, Brennan and Hillary.

When I was a secret service agent you wrote a case report on a case, paragraph one says how that case started. I received a call about a stolen credit card, whatever it is. No one has given us paragraph one on why they started a counterintelligence investigation against Trump. We've heard three different stories. Point number two, there are felony leaks in this case. There was on October 31st leak to the New York Times about the existence of the case before they disclosed it to Congress, and a leak to the Washington Post about the investigation to Mike Flynn. I believe by the way that's why they're not declassifying everything because they may have a serious felony case against the leakers."

And this is where, and again, the man, the right man at the right time. If anyone has got the discipline to see it through to face these individuals who had enormous worldwide power, it's Donald Trump. So this is the man not just of the hour but a man of fate, and this is the time where we've got to be able to get this done. It's being handed to us.

They shouldn't be in the country. But we are doing from the standpoint of law enforcement, a great job. The Democrats are sticking up for MS-13.
