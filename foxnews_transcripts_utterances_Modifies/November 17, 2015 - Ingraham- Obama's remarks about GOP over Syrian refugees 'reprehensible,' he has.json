But, I think what most people are looking for and I think all the polling on this shows that this is the case. We want American leaders, Republicans, Democrats, to look out for America. We have to be first compassionate to the American people. The American workers, the American families and when you have the reports that you just aired on Fox, about individuals trying to make their way up from Honduras to the United States using fraudulent identification, it reminds us of just how dangerous this situation is, Martha.   And I think all the people watching tonight have to remember that the federal government has failed to vet refugees in the past. We had Somali refugees returning to fight with al Shabaab, the Islamist group in Africa. We've obviously had massive fraud that the \"Wall Street Journal\" has written about with refugees using false identification to get family members in. So, I think a pause, absolutely. Nobody is talking about a religious test.

So they call for compassion. Give me a break.   When is the last time the White House had compassion, for instance, in the IRS scandal or compassion for what's happened to the American workers who have seen a marketplace flooded with illegal immigrant labor and fraudulent push for stem workers.
