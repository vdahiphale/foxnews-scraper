So, like we saw in the House, the longer the American public listens to these Democrats drawn on and on and on, support for impeachment drops. Now the Democrats have put all of their political capital on impeachment. They didn't do it with health care, they decided not to rebuild America, they decided to not talk about loans, they went after political revenge and they are going to pay a price for it. They didn't read the room because this country was so exhausted for three years. Investigation after investigation and finally when Mueller said no collusion, everyone in this country kind of exhaled. And what did the Democrats do? They teed up a swing with the whistleblower and put us all through this again. Force feeding us hearing after hearing, constitutional crisis after crisis. And at the end of the day, 17 percent, that is the approval rating for Congress, which is horrific. They didn't put one single fact witness on in the last six months to say the president committed a crime, or the president should be impeached. Remember those videos the House hearings all of the Democrat witnesses themselves said, no, I didn't witness a crime, I didn't see anything impeachable. And that's on tape and you will see that tomorrow. Americans watch so much television. When you promise to deliver the goods, a smoking gun, and you don't deliver they're just going to turn the , and that's what has happened. To lead with an abuse of power article is so vague. Everyone can interpret that whichever way they want. It's so flimsy. And then obstruction by asking a judge to get involved? Everyone American knows when you have two parties, they're in dispute, you go to a judge and he settles it. That's not an impeachable offense. If you see this from a big picture perspective and you're watching Fox, because Fox is the only network that is going to tell you the truth about this, there are no principles on the Democrat side because Jerry Nadler himself voted against the legal aid to Ukraine.   Joe Biden himself is on tape bragging about a quid pro quo. Hillary Clinton herself paid for an agent to dig up dirt on the political opponent in an election year.",

If Mitt Romney as reported is dying throughout this process, I doubt that he and the others who are on the fence with the moderates are going to want to extend this any further. And it's just the matter of what the relevant is here. The House called the witnesses that they said were important, they didn't call John Bolton and go through the court system to force him to testify. And if they want to go down that road of trades, they've also said they don't want to do that either. This argument they're making is that Democrats are the only ones who are allowed to call witnesses, that's not going to fly. And Hunter Biden, I'm sure, may not be called as a witness for impeachment but based on what Lindsey Graham said today, he may be called to testify in a Senate judiciary committee hearing --",

So, like we saw in the House, the longer the American public listens to these Democrats drawn on and on and on, support for impeachment drops. Now the Democrats have put all of their political capital on impeachment. They didn't do it with health care, they decided not to rebuild America, they decided to not talk about loans, they went after political revenge and they are going to pay a price for it. They didn't read the room because this country was so exhausted for three years. Investigation after investigation and finally when Mueller said no collusion, everyone in this country kind of exhaled. And what did the Democrats do? They teed up a swing with the whistleblower and put us all through this again. Force feeding us hearing after hearing, constitutional crisis after crisis. And at the end of the day, 17 percent, that is the approval rating for Congress, which is horrific. They didn't put one single fact witness on in the last six months to say the president committed a crime, or the president should be impeached. Remember those videos the House hearings all of the Democrat witnesses themselves said, no, I didn't witness a crime, I didn't see anything impeachable. And that's on tape and you will see that tomorrow. Americans watch so much television. When you promise to deliver the goods, a smoking gun, and you don't deliver they're just going to turn the , and that's what has happened. To lead with an abuse of power article is so vague. Everyone can interpret that whichever way they want. It's so flimsy. And then obstruction by asking a judge to get involved? Everyone American knows when you have two parties, they're in dispute, you go to a judge and he settles it. That's not an impeachable offense. If you see this from a big picture perspective and you're watching Fox, because Fox is the only network that is going to tell you the truth about this, there are no principles on the Democrat side because Jerry Nadler himself voted against the legal aid to Ukraine. Joe Biden himself is on tape bragging about a quid pro quo. Hillary Clinton herself paid for an agent to dig up dirt on the political opponent in an election year."

Adam Schiff, who was the lead impeachment manager on this, try to make the argument today that this is all about the Mueller investigation. Which if you are a Republican senator or even someone like Joe Manchin who is a Democrat sitting and listening to this argument, you are going, this is a really bad sequel the last three days of the really bad Mueller testimony we saw a year ago. It proves what the president has been saying all along.

You had Lindsey Graham saying today, if you told me four times, it's twice too many. They're heard everything and they're looking at it and going, you don't have a case and you're begging us to do all of this legal work for you so that you have more to talk about to drag this out. If Mitt Romney as reported is dying throughout this process, I doubt that he and the others who are on the fence with the moderates are going to want to extend this any further. And it's just the matter of what the relevant is here. The House called the witnesses that they said were important, they didn't call John Bolton and go through the court system to force him to testify. And if they want to go down that road of trades, they've also said they don't want to do that either. This argument they're making is that Democrats are the only ones who are allowed to call witnesses, that's not going to fly. And Hunter Biden, I'm sure, may not be called as a witness for impeachment but based on what Lindsey Graham said today, he may be called to testify in a Senate judiciary committee hearing --"

You boasted you had an airtight case. Too late. And your choice of witness is simply backfilling your three-year obsession so there's no point even discussing it, it's not going to happen. So, the montage that we played that the media is swooning, I don't see how the media cannot step aside and wonder why they like it. It's because the show is for them. The reason why they like it is it's designed for them. Impeachment is the birthday clown for the brats and the party hats known as the media, the trial, another analogy, is like the hotel black light, right, that reveals the stain of bias on the media mattress."

And the left has never been afraid to go to the extremes on abortion when it comes to politics and fund-raising. And it's interesting to see the president saying, I'm not afraid of controversy, I'm going to jump right in, support this people who yes, are going to knock on doors and come out for me in 2020, but also not just allowing the left to have a monopoly on the conversation. And every single Democrat who is running for president right now will not talk about or condemn late-term abortion. There is no room there. When it comes to these types of politics the right is always seen as the extremists but yet, when you look at the way that the left has handled these issues, they don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of what these things actually mean. The president isn't afraid to go there.

Look, why does this story keep happening? Like you see this with Kavanaugh, you saw it with Covington, and you saw recently with the Virginia gun rally where they predicted death and disorder and nothing happened. The media keeps, keeps committing these offenses because they never -- they're never forced to learn. They never learned from the mistakes until Nick Sandmann's suit, thank God. But to me, I think -- I think it's really about class. The media is an elite class that is separate from the rest of America. These are people that are overly educated, right? They -- most of these people went to journalism school, which is thoroughly unnecessary. And for the media to improve, to actually improve, they have to open their doors to people who do not go to journalism school, who may not go to college at all, because there was a time when people were journalists who didn't have a college education. It wasn't that long ago. But now you've got these completely isolated, secluded elite snobs who look down at people who are pro-life, or Catholic kids, or whoever, and just see them as aliens, space aliens that they can degrade and mock. And that's how you get these stories, that's how you get the gun right story, that's how you get every time -- every time a story is wrong, it's because of that class difference."

It's always treated as yes, we're going to cover both sides. But if you look at the numbers, ABC poll, Monmouth poll, Wall Street Journal, 60 percent of Americans think that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. And in fact, Gallup has new numbers out that say that there's more discontent right now with abortion law in the country. Why is that? More people who are pro-choice feel that they're more and more restrictions being put in place and abortion, and they don't like it, so they say they're not happy right now with abortion law in the country. That's where the energy and the passion is coming from. But to me when I see the president do this, you know, as someone who's been around awhile, I saw Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan didn't do this. George W. Bush, his dad, none of them did it. Why did -- why did -- why does Donald Trump think that this is good? It divides the country --"

I'm a pro- lifer, but I can understand abortion is like war. Pro-choice has changed so much that if you voice any of the slightest thought that a late-term abortion is bad, you are wrong.

I think about somebody who's close to me who just recently paid off her student loans from a university, and that was 10 years of -- she had no extra spending money, but she paid it all off.

But now we have social security, now we have Medicare, Medicaid so should we go backwards? No, I think we want to improve as a society. We want to do better. And I think the society benefits from a higher level of education, in my opinion. So I just think that this is an improvement. But I understand his frustration. He did the right thing.

So if you don't have an answer with that, Trump is going to roll over you. You better find another nominee. Also, I mean, who is this benefiting? It's benefiting a specific class, right? This is -- this is benefiting the educated middle to upper class, gender studies major. If you want to really cancel debt that affects all Americans, why not car to car loans, why not to that? Everybody has got a car. Why wouldn't we do that? Because at that point, you will never get another loan."

She's buying votes, except she's only buying votes from debtors. She's not buying votes from savers. If you save, you're a sucker, you got screwed. And then you're just mad at your neighbor who didn't save and spent like an idiot and got bailed out.
