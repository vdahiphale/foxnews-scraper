But one thing we know that if you are vaccinated, the likelihood of you -- of this Delta variant causing hospitalization or death or serious health challenges, the science certainly says that is far muted. I listened to my old friend Chris Christie. I read some of his comments this Sunday, and I thought he had about right when he said look, we shouldn't try to indoctrinate people. We should try to educate help people. We've got to meet people where they are in their lives, and unless there's an overwhelming health challenge, try to persuade them that this is the right thing to do. I give Sean Hannity and Donald Trump great credit for urging every American, as I do President Biden and others for urging every American to get the vaccine. I've said it on this show and I'll say it again. If we want the economy reopen, if we want our schools reopened and our kids back in school without any of the politics -- and there is politics all the way around, Trey, I would agree -- and if we want to be on the best footing we can possibly be to combat and compete with China, we should get this vaccine. And 48.8 percent double dose, 56.4 percent single dose. Those numbers need to be higher for us to head into the fall stronger, safer, and with the likelihood of not having to wear masks in public.",

One thing that has been consistent, unfortunately, from a lot of Democrats, a lot of progressive officials, and a few Republicans, too, is their willingness to turn to the weapon of mandates when it comes to any aspect of policy dealing with this pandemic. And, yet, when you look at the actual performance of those mandates, we see that they really don't make much of a difference in terms of the way that this virus runs through different societies and different parts and communities of our nation. This is something that I think is not going to solve and not going to prevent any kind of upheaval related to the latest Delta variant. We do need to get more people vaccinated. But these mandates have not been proven to be successful. Yet government feels like they have to take steps. They feel like they have to have action, and this is the only thing that they want to turn to in a time when in reality what they ought to be doing is assessing their own approach and why it hasn't worked to get those resistant members of the population, particularly minority Americans, to go in and get vaccinated.",
