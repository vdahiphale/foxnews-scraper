Joining us straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Senator Marsha Blackburn responds exclusively to new escalations from Iran, leaders there defying U.S. pressure, saying they will keep enriching uranium. How should Washington respond?  Plus, Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs on the growing crisis at our southern border and President Trump's threat to resume mass deportations, what he thinks or he plans to ask special counsel Robert Mueller when he testifies later this month.  Plus, Anthony Scaramucci is with us. He's going to weigh in on the record stock market highs here, strong job growth, as well as the U.S. economy bucking signs of recession. Will the Federal Reserve now reconsider cutting interest rates?  All that and more as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Iran showing no signs of caving to U.S. pressure, saying today it is prepared to enrich uranium at any level. Senior officials in Tehran will keep reducing its commitment to Obama era nuclear deal every 60 days unless other nations signed onto the pact can salvage the deal.  President Trump pulled the U.S. from that deal a little over a year ago. Republican lawmakers in Congress say Iran's threat amounts to blackmail, and they are urging the president to impose more sanctions. Joining me now, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Senator, thanks for joining us.",

The problem is that Huawei can use smartphones to spy on the U.S. But there's a more fundamental issue, and that is, money is fungible.

And when I talk to friends who are Iranian immigrants and people who are a part of the Baha'i faith, what they tell me is, they are working desperately to support some of the Iranian people who really have a lot of problems with what this regime is doing, because they are suffering. They are standing in line trying to buy things. The pressure is having an effect. Iran knows that. They know their people are suffering. They know the country is suffering.

Now, as we look at what is happening in Iran, I think you have to look at who is working in conjunction with them. Look at what China is doing. Look at what Russia is doing. Look at what's happening in North Korea. And then you have to ask, is this the new axis of evil? Of course, I think you put those four countries together, and it probably is.

And I think the Republicans and what I want them to get to is the origins, which the inspector general is looking at, but we should get some of that out of Robert Mueller as well, the origins of the Russia investigation. And the second thing -- and I think is really critical -- is when did they know that President Trump was no longer the focus of some kind of Russian conspiracy investigation? And why did they wait so very long, in fact, waited until after the midterm elections, to get to it? And then I would say the third thing that I think is really interesting and critical is, how much money? They looked into President Trump and all of his campaign, but I would like to know how much money that Hillary Clinton and the DNC received from foreign nationals and foreign governments in that campaign."

The unemployment rate ticked up to -- from its 50-year low to 3.7 percent. But get this. That's because the strong economy lured more people, 335,000, to be exact. So, after this, the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 still closing at record highs just on July 3. Meantime, the Federal Reserve, they are prepared to make a key decision on interest rates later this month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due also to testify on Capitol Hill later this week. Joining me now, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. Anthony, let's start with the jobs reports. People were bracing for something really ugly; 224,000 was magnificent, 335,000 people back in the labor force. It's really -- I mean, this is the ultimate economic data point. What do you make of it?"

      "speaker": "ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, there's a lot of great things going on. I think, just to dovetail it into your last conversation, the reduction of illegal immigration at the border, Charles, has actually increased wages for lower- and middle-income families. So you have just got the labor -- there's more people that are looking -- there's more jobs available than there are people looking for jobs. So, for me -- I have been studying the economy for 30 years -- you're going to see trending growth through the 2020 election. And that's going to be very good for President Trump. And it's also good for his trade strategy. So, for us right now, I don't think the Fed can cut rates here, given how strong the economy is. I know the president wants them to do that, and I know that there are signs of weakness and deflation around the world, but we are literally witnessing an economic miracle, mostly born by the president's policies."

So, if there's not a rate cut, it won't be the president that will be outraged. It will be the stock market down 500 points. You're OK with that?"

      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, again, I feel the pressure on Jerome Powell is immense, but he has to -- the number one thing that he is looking for is some stability to the currency. And so you definitely have the growth element and you have low inflation right now. I think one of the things the president is saying to people, look at those inflation numbers. It is 1.6 percent, when you have 3.2 percent growth. But if you have been studying this thing for 50 or, in Warren Buffett's case, 75 years, that sort of pattern is typically not sustainable. So, for me, I can't see, from an economist's point of view, how he puts in a rate cut in July. Having said that, you know, obviously, I have got a lot of money in the stock market, $12 billion under management at SkyBridge."

Remember, he only has got 250 basis points. And you need about 400 basis points of stimulus, Charles, to smooth out the sharp edges of a recession. And so he doesn't have a lot of bullets in the tank."

What are your thoughts on this restarting of the negotiations. Where do we go from here?"

      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",

I think what you are seeing is that the Chinese economy, despite Western media, is probably not as broad and as deep as the media was celebrating, very, very similar to what was going on when they were celebrating the Japanese economy 30 years ago. And so the president has the cards. He's been patient on this thing. I do think he will get the deal that he wants, but it is just not going to come as quickly as Wall Street wants. So -- but, if I had to predict it, I would say, by the end of the summer, into mid-September, I do think Steven Mnuchin and Lighthizer get a deal done with the Chinese. Both sides want the deal. I think the Chinese need it more than we do. And I bet -- I'm betting that they are going to curve closer towards what the president wants here over the next 10 weeks."

The figures are starting to come in. President Trump's second-quarter fund- raising, it was $54 million. The GOP had another $50 million. You see on the screen there Buttigieg at 24, almost -- let's call it $25 million, Biden $22 million, and Sanders $18 million. What do these numbers suggest to you, not just the total numbers, Anthony, but the amount of donors, with respect to how much passion perhaps is -- are behind these campaigns?"

      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",

So, if you add up all those numbers on their side, you are like, whoa, that is really impressive. The president has the incumbency, the presidency, and he's the one candidate on the Republican side. He will have over a billion dollars to spend by the time this is over. And these guys are going to be fighting it out until July of next year. So, it's going to be very, very hard for them to amass, in my opinion, the same amount of money. And, plus, the president has a story now. He is an experienced president in a rising economy. And so he's the odds-on favorite to win reelection, Charles. But I'm impressed that those Democrats were able to raise those amounts of money, but they're diffusing themselves by having that much volume in the race against the president."

But if they lurch very far to the left, it plays right into the president's sweet spot. At the end of the day, when you look at the president's policies, shut off the Twitter account, just look at the policies, they have been staggeringly good for the American people and for the American economy and actually for the global economy. So, at the end of the day, you're going to run a socialist model, 150 years of failed socialism. Everybody in the world knows you can't systematize an equal outcome. We should be more focused, Charles, on creating more equal opportunity for people, younger people in the education system, as opposed to trying to force it down or confiscate wealth from other people that have worked their whole lives to build it up. So, for me, America is not ready for that. And it's surprising to me that the Democrats are moving in that direction. That's a sign that they have allowed extremists to control their party."

Joining me now, Gordon Chang, Asia analyst and author of \"The Coming Collapse of China.\" Gordon, this is something that you have been adamant -- adamantly against as well. GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Yes. You just can't separate Huawei into those parts of the companies that pose a national security threat and those that don't. The administration is making the argument that smartphones aren't a problem. The problem is that Huawei can use smartphones to spy on the U.S. But there's a more fundamental issue, and that is, money is fungible. So profits from smartphone sales are going to help Huawei on their servers and router business. And that clearly is a national security threat. We should just ring-fence off this company and say, no business at all."

People can argue about how much China's stealing. But it's somewhere between $150 billion and maybe $600 billion. That's a grievous wound to the United States, which has an innovation-based economy. That's our goal. Our goal is to get the Chinese to stop stealing our intellectual property. And, also, it would be a nice thing if they actually honor their trade agreements with us. That's what the goal of all of this is."

Their consumer numbers are not very good. The first indications from June on the manufacturing sector show a contracting economy. So they're not in a good position. But they think that they can bluff President Trump.

There's been a lot about China saving face in this.

The protesters are going to places where these tourists go, and they're talking to them about what they want in Hong Kong. This is really bad for China because, although those tourists are probably not going to sympathize with the Hong Kong protesters, those Hong Kong tourists are going to be inspired by the protesters, in the sense of, oh, look, these guys are protesting.
