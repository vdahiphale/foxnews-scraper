But it's crickets from the Obamas on the Cuties uproar that would require guts from the Obamas. It would mean criticizing the decision of the Netflix CEO who also happens to be a Democrat mega donor. Well, despite the fact that as of this evening, more than 616,000 have signed the https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Change.org&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=JxXRR2m9hSmX30za_jIiqRPO-_CUFFty5qvfag3ofa4&s=LXZIh1bD3b8XORxWNywgUILwaP9YWheM89UuLDrSQqc&e= petition urging Netflix subscribers to cancel their subscription over Cuties. I don't have much of an expectation that Hastings will pull the stream.  Democrats will always side with pornographers over the regular people by citing the need to protect artistic expression. But entertainment companies all run by Left wingers, routinely trample on the principle of artistic freedom when their own issues are impacted. Now, recall the push recently to remove police shows from major networks. And then there was the purge from TV and streaming services of shows that ever depicted blackface.  Netflix happily obliged, censoring a slew of shows. Now, when the controversy currently erupted, the Cuties' director, well, she acted kind of surprised. She urged everyone to see the film because she said we're both on the same side of the fight against young children's hyper sexualization. On the same side, would Netflix accept the same defense of, I don't know, a film about a young boy who became fascinated with the KKK, which chronicled his friendships and humanize the main characters? No, they wouldn't, which would be the right thing to do. Such a film would be universally denounced and rightfully so.",

Now, why not support moms and dads who are trying to protect their daughter's innocence. Why not refuse to accept support from anyone who turns pre-adolescent girls into sex objects? Because Democrats have made a devil's bargain, that's why. And they're hoping that you will become numb to the degradation as they count their money. Let's surprise them now, shall we, by voting our values, and that's the angle.  Joining me now is Matt Walsh, writer for The Daily Wire, host of the Matt Walsh Show podcast, and more importantly, a parent like myself. I have a teenage daughter and two young sons. Matt, you have kids. What is your message to those who are defending this Netflix film as some sort of legitimate social commentary?  MATT WALSH, THE MATT WALSH SHOW: Well, first of all, I don't believe that they believe what they're saying. In fact, it's interesting if you go back and you look at what the - look at the rave reviews of this movie when it first was released at Sundance about a year ago, and the media, they were very excited about it, but they didn't say anything then really about how it was some sort of searing indictment of child sexual exploitation. They use words like, oh, it's about freedom. It's about liberty, it's about choice. It's about a girl discovering her feminine identity. That's, in fact, what the director said herself at the Sundance Film Festival. She was interviewed. But it's only after the backlash that all of a sudden, it's oh, no, no, this is actually a commentary on child sexual exploitation. But the thing is, it doesn't even matter. That doesn't even make a difference because there is no context. There's no plot, there's no story. There's no intention that could ever make it OK to film 11-year-old girls dancing, sexually twerking the camera zooming in for lurid close-ups, of their body parts.   Nothing could ever make that OK. It doesn't even matter what your intention was. It is sexual exploitation by definition. So, you're commentating on sexual exploitation by doing it. That's the commentary. I don't buy it.  INGRAHAM: And Matt, like clockwork after this uproar, the media, as you wrote about, came rushing in to defend the film and the director. The New Yorker's Richard Brody praised the film as the story of a girl's outrage at in defiance of a patriarchal order. The Telegraph's Tim Robey demanded readers forget the moral panic. And The Washington Post Alyssa Rosenberg attack critics saying, it's a shame a movie about an 11-year-old moral education has made so many adults act stupid. Matt, your response?  WALSH: Well, look, when you've got leftists, I guess telling us now that being against pedophilia and being against the sexualization of 11-year- olds is a Right-wing position. Well, hey, I'll take that as a Right-wing as myself proudly. I will take I will take ownership of that position if you guys on the Left don't want it, because that's apparently what we're being told. And I think that's important for people to realize, is that this is not just some fringe movie that came out at Sundance and is out in the hinterlands somewhere and nobody's watching it. You've got major media figures, not just the billion-dollar Netflix, but also major figures in media that are circling the perv wagons around this thing and defending it, which shouldn't be a surprise, by the way. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that we have movies like this in a country where children are sent to the library to be read stories by drag queens. It shouldn't be surprising that movies like this exist.  INGRAHAM: Well, let me just say the video that we're showing tonight that doesn't capture what's in the film. I mean, we're showing kind of - this is not the stuff that we're talking about. We're showing and we're talking about girls who are spreading their legs, motioning to touch their own body parts. I want to say all because it's so disgusting, basically making a motion on the floor that is a pornographic motion and it goes on and on and on. And it's completely not necessary really for any type of dramatic representation, Matt.  So, this is being done to titillate a predator. That's the stuff, to titillate a certain audience. And that audience is an audience sorry, but it's comprised of pedophiles who have a lot of fare to choose from, frankly, right now in the culture.  WALSH: Yes, they do, unfortunately. And look, I think an actual story that calls out exposes child sexual exploitation. That would be great. I think we need stories like that. But when it comes to a film or TV show, what gives it all away is what the camera is doing. What does the camera want you to focus on? And that's what gives the attention away on this movie is what the camera is doing, what it zooms in on, it focuses on. There's just no way, you don't do that.  If you're trying to commentate and protest against child sexual exploitation, you can't actually do the thing that you're calling out, especially when you consider that these actresses are themselves 11 and 12- years-old. These aren't adults posing as children. So, you are exploiting these kids to send whatever message you're trying to send.  And Matt, I feel so bad for the children, and it just actually just broke my heart, me on the politics of it and the mega donor behind Netflix. It's a heartbreaking thing for our kids and we all have to speak out against this and get active. Your piece was great. Thank you for writing it, Matt.  WALSH: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.  INGRAHAM: And they praise the director of Cuties as some sort of feminist icon. But the Left doesn't seem at all concerned with the well-being of the next generation of women. What kind of effect will these hypersexualized films have on these little girls and the culture at large? Here to help us understand this, Cynthia Garrett, founder of Cynthia Garrett Ministries, who works with a lot of young women and the author of I Choose Victory. Cynthia. I actually thought the film wouldn't be as bad as people were saying, I thought, people must be - but I watched it the entire thing today and I had to keep turning it off when I heard my kids coming down the hallway. I didn't want them to even come near what I was watching. Your reaction to what you're hearing about this?  CYNTHIA GARRETT, CYNTHIA GARRETT MINISTRIES FOUNDER: Well Laura, first of all, I'm so happy that you're covering this because I think the problem is that people want to stick their head in the sand. My reaction to this was, I mean, I was mortified. I was the victim of child sexual abuse. And for any woman or leader from, a former first lady to these men who are heads of these streaming services, Netflix, for them to justify this is really an attempt to justify the fact that they don't want to deal with truth. They wouldn't let their children have made this movie, I'm quite sure. And I think Netflix has just declared open season on our children. This is about the normalization of pedophilia. I hate to say it, but out here in California, we're dealing with SB-145 being pushed to the floor, and that is truly about making pedophilia a normal sexual orientation. So, where are we going with this? I know where we're going with it. We're trying to get kids used to, minor attracted persons, maps, this whole new category of what you call grownups who are attracted to children. And when you start changing these names, Laura, this is about taking the stigma away from the word pedophilia. You're not a pedophile, you're a map.  INGRAHAM: There's massive effort underway for everyone who hasn't been tuned into this. And we're going to cover this in-depth next week. Massive effort underway in California to destigmatize pedophilia by lowering the age, by essentially getting rid of the age of consent for certain sexual activity. It is horrific and it has to be stopped. Here's the director of Cuties, Cynthia defending the film. Take a look.",

It's hard to believe it was 19 years ago after these tragic events. And we still hold dear our promise to never forget. But that's exactly what some on the Left seem to want. So, how do we make sure that never happens?  My next guest was the commissioner of the NYPD on that tragic day. And Bernie Kerik joins me now. Bernie, I know it's impossible for any of us to believe that it was 19 years ago, but with this new attitude that we need to somehow tear down our history to cleanse ourselves and replace our old heroes with new radical ones, how does that honor the memory of those who lost their lives on 9/11?  BERNIE KERIK, NYPD COMMISSIONER DURING 9/11: It doesn't, it doesn't, but I got to be honest, Laura, I think that's about, you know, maybe 10 to 15 percent of the American public. That's these Left-wing radical Marxist, you know, lunatics that are out there trying to, you know, diminish the police, victimize the thugs of villainize the police. The bottom line is, I think 80 to 85 percent of America, maybe 90. I think they know and understand what the police did. And on that day in 2001, the men and women of the NYPD, the Port Authority police, the fire department, they basically affected the greatest rescue mission in the history of this country by taking 20,000 to 25,000 people out of those buildings in the surrounding buildings and evacuating, evacuating more than a million people out of southern Manhattan into the four boroughs, which has never been done in the history of this country. And it was effortlessly that it was done.  INGRAHAM: And Bernie, I was in Washington and I remember riding my bike over to the Pentagon because after seeing all the roads were closed, I wanted to see it. I remember standing there on this intersection with maybe two or three other people who walked from, I guess there were at the White House and they walked across.  We were just we couldn't even speak. We could even we couldn't see that our nation was under attack. Yet all these years later, we seem to be attacking each other, not attacking basic institutions that are essential to our well-being and essential in case, heaven forbid, we have another tragedy like this.  KERIK: You know what, Laura, you need the right people in command, you need the right leaders, and I'm going to get political for a second. There was one person that was at ground zero that walked through ground zero, motivated the troops, incentivized the troops, brought hundreds of his own civilian workers down there. And that was Donald Trump. He wasn't running for president at the time. He had no idea he was ever going to run for president. He was down there for days. I saw him regularly down there.   And for anybody to talk about him today and make any kind of negative comment about the president and his leadership ability, he was leading then. But you know who I didn't see at Ground Zero? I didn't see Joe Biden. Joe Biden was like the kiddie parade that came in for show and tell, took a look around and then skated back to Delaware. That's what Joe Biden was. Donald Trump was down there inspiring the troops, getting people motivated and doing anything he could for the mayor and I to make our job easier.  INGRAHAM: Personally, I only have a few moments left. But personally, just take us back to that day, Bernie. In the last few seconds, we have.  KERIK: When the first plane hit the tower, I was in my office. When the second plane hit tower two, I was standing in front of it and in about 30 minutes later, the mayor and I were inside 75 Barkley when Tower two imploded on top of us and around us, trapping us in that building. By the end of the day, I lost 23 people. Port Authority cops lost 37. The fire department was 343.",

That very province is where the CCP is carrying out vicious genocidal campaigns against the Muslim Uyghurs. Why would Disney do this? China is poised to become the world's biggest box office, that's why, and studios remember what happened the last time they offended China. Back in 1997, the CCP slapped a five-year ban on all these studios behind the movie \"Seven Years in Tibet,\" which cast China, of course, in a negative light, and that's a big no-no. Filming for \"Mulan\" began two years ago when Bob Iger was the CEO of Disney. Remember, he threatened to stop filming in Georgia, that is in the United States, over its antiabortion law, yet was perfectly happy rewarding a country that has put more than 1 million Muslims in concentration camps?

Netflix saying it's an award-winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up and would encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie. Nice try. But what about the other prominent people affiliated with Netflix like Susan Rice, Obama's former national security adviser. She's paid handsomely to sit on the board of Netflix. And what about the Obamas. Their deal with Netflix is reportedly worth over $50 million. Michelle prides herself on efforts to help promote girl power worldwide."

But it's crickets from the Obamas on the Cuties uproar that would require guts from the Obamas. It would mean criticizing the decision of the Netflix CEO who also happens to be a Democrat mega donor. Well, despite the fact that as of this evening, more than 616,000 have signed the https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Change.org&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=JxXRR2m9hSmX30za_jIiqRPO-_CUFFty5qvfag3ofa4&s=LXZIh1bD3b8XORxWNywgUILwaP9YWheM89UuLDrSQqc&e= petition urging Netflix subscribers to cancel their subscription over Cuties. I don't have much of an expectation that Hastings will pull the stream. Democrats will always side with pornographers over the regular people by citing the need to protect artistic expression. But entertainment companies all run by Left wingers, routinely trample on the principle of artistic freedom when their own issues are impacted. Now, recall the push recently to remove police shows from major networks. And then there was the purge from TV and streaming services of shows that ever depicted blackface. Netflix happily obliged, censoring a slew of shows. Now, when the controversy currently erupted, the Cuties' director, well, she acted kind of surprised. She urged everyone to see the film because she said we're both on the same side of the fight against young children's hyper sexualization. On the same side, would Netflix accept the same defense of, I don't know, a film about a young boy who became fascinated with the KKK, which chronicled his friendships and humanize the main characters? No, they wouldn't, which would be the right thing to do. Such a film would be universally denounced and rightfully so. There was one line in the film though that really stuck with me. It was said by an elderly Muslim aunt of the protagonist mom. Now, after a prayer meeting, she asked how the transition to the new housing project where they lived was going. She leaned toward her niece, her face deep with wrinkles, and said.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)"

Because Democrats have made a devil's bargain, that's why. And they're hoping that you will become numb to the degradation as they count their money. Let's surprise them now, shall we, by voting our values, and that's the angle. Joining me now is Matt Walsh, writer for The Daily Wire, host of the Matt Walsh Show podcast, and more importantly, a parent like myself. I have a teenage daughter and two young sons. Matt, you have kids. What is your message to those who are defending this Netflix film as some sort of legitimate social commentary?  MATT WALSH, THE MATT WALSH SHOW: Well, first of all, I don't believe that they believe what they're saying. In fact, it's interesting if you go back and you look at what the - look at the rave reviews of this movie when it first was released at Sundance about a year ago, and the media, they were very excited about it, but they didn't say anything then really about how it was some sort of searing indictment of child sexual exploitation. They use words like, oh, it's about freedom. It's about liberty, it's about choice. It's about a girl discovering her feminine identity. That's, in fact, what the director said herself at the Sundance Film Festival. She was interviewed. But it's only after the backlash that all of a sudden, it's oh, no, no, this is actually a commentary on child sexual exploitation. But the thing is, it doesn't even matter. That doesn't even make a difference because there is no context. There's no plot, there's no story. There's no intention that could ever make it OK to film 11-year-old girls dancing, sexually twerking the camera zooming in for lurid close-ups, of their body parts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nothing could ever make that OK. It doesn't even matter what your intention was. It is sexual exploitation by definition. So, you're commentating on sexual exploitation by doing it. That's the commentary. I don't buy it.  INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Matt, like clockwork after this uproar, the media, as you wrote about, came rushing in to defend the film and the director. The New Yorker's Richard Brody praised the film as the story of a girl's outrage at in defiance of a patriarchal order. The Telegraph's Tim Robey demanded readers forget the moral panic. And The Washington Post Alyssa Rosenberg attack critics saying, it's a shame a movie about an 11-year-old moral education has made so many adults act stupid. Matt, your response?  WALSH: Well, look, when you've got leftists, I guess telling us now that being against pedophilia and being against the sexualization of 11-year- olds is a Right-wing position. Well, hey, I'll take that as a Right-wing as myself proudly. I will take I will take ownership of that position if you guys on the Left don't want it, because that's apparently what we're being told. And I think that's important for people to realize, is that this is not just some fringe movie that came out at Sundance and is out in the hinterlands somewhere and nobody's watching it."

It shouldn't be surprising that movies like this exist.  INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, let me just say the video that we're showing tonight that doesn't capture what's in the film. I mean, we're showing kind of - this is not the stuff that we're talking about. We're showing and we're talking about girls who are spreading their legs, motioning to touch their own body parts. I want to say all because it's so disgusting, basically making a motion on the floor that is a pornographic motion and it goes on and on and on. And it's completely not necessary really for any type of dramatic representation, Matt."

      "utterance": "Yes, they do, unfortunately. And look, I think an actual story that calls out exposes child sexual exploitation. That would be great. I think we need stories like that. But when it comes to a film or TV show, what gives it all away is what the camera is doing. What does the camera want you to focus on? And that's what gives the attention away on this movie is what the camera is doing, what it zooms in on, it focuses on. There's just no way, you don't do that. If you're trying to commentate and protest against child sexual exploitation, you can't actually do the thing that you're calling out, especially when you consider that these actresses are themselves 11 and 12- years-old. These aren't adults posing as children. So, you are exploiting these kids to send whatever message you're trying to send.  And Matt, I feel so bad for the children, and it just actually just broke my heart, me on the politics of it and the mega donor behind Netflix. It's a heartbreaking thing for our kids and we all have to speak out against this and get active. Your piece was great. Thank you for writing it, Matt.  WALSH: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.  INGRAHAM: And they praise the director of Cuties as some sort of feminist icon. But the Left doesn't seem at all concerned with the well-being of the next generation of women. What kind of effect will these hypersexualized films have on these little girls and the culture at large? Here to help us understand this, Cynthia Garrett, founder of Cynthia Garrett Ministries, who works with a lot of young women and the author of I Choose Victory. Cynthia. I actually thought the film wouldn't be as bad as people were saying, I thought, people must be - but I watched it the entire thing today and I had to keep turning it off when I heard my kids coming down the hallway. I didn't want them to even come near what I was watching. Your reaction to what you're hearing about this?  CYNTHIA GARRETT, CYNTHIA GARRETT MINISTRIES FOUNDER: Well Laura, first of all, I'm so happy that you're covering this because I think the problem is that people want to stick their head in the sand. My reaction to this was, I mean, I was mortified. I was the victim of child sexual abuse. And for any woman or leader from, a former first lady to these men who are heads of these streaming services, Netflix, for them to justify this is really an attempt to justify the fact that they don't want to deal with truth. They wouldn't let their children have made this movie, I'm quite sure. And I think Netflix has just declared open season on our children. This is about the normalization of pedophilia. I hate to say it, but out here in California, we're dealing with SB-145 being pushed to the floor, and that is truly about making pedophilia a normal sexual orientation. So, where are we going with this? I know where we're going with it. We're trying to get kids used to, minor attracted persons, maps, this whole new category of what you call grownups who are attracted to children. And when you start changing these names, Laura, this is about taking the stigma away from the word pedophilia. You're not a pedophile, you're a map.  INGRAHAM: There's massive effort underway for everyone who hasn't been tuned into this. And we're going to cover this in-depth next week. Massive effort underway in California to destigmatize pedophilia by lowering the age, by essentially getting rid of the age of consent for certain sexual activity. It is horrific and it has to be stopped. Here's the director of Cuties, Cynthia defending the film. Take a look."

It's hard to believe it was 19 years ago after these tragic events. And we still hold dear our promise to never forget. But that's exactly what some on the Left seem to want. So, how do we make sure that never happens? My next guest was the commissioner of the NYPD on that tragic day. And Bernie Kerik joins me now. Bernie, I know it's impossible for any of us to believe that it was 19 years ago, but with this new attitude that we need to somehow tear down our history to cleanse ourselves and replace our old heroes with new radical ones, how does that honor the memory of those who lost their lives on 9/11?  BERNIE KERIK, NYPD COMMISSIONER DURING 9/11: It doesn't, it doesn't, but I got to be honest, Laura, I think that's about, you know, maybe 10 to 15 percent of the American public. That's these Left-wing radical Marxist, you know, lunatics that are out there trying to, you know, diminish the police, victimize the thugs of villainize the police. The bottom line is, I think 80 to 85 percent of America, maybe 90. I think they know and understand what the police did. And on that day in 2001, the men and women of the NYPD, the Port Authority police, the fire department, they basically affected the greatest rescue mission in the history of this country by taking 20,000 to 25,000 people out of those buildings in the surrounding buildings and evacuating, evacuating more than a million people out of southern Manhattan into the four boroughs, which has never been done in the history of this country. And it was effortlessly that it was done.  INGRAHAM: And Bernie, I was in Washington and I remember riding my bike over to the Pentagon because after seeing all the roads were closed, I wanted to see it. I remember standing there on this intersection with maybe two or three other people who walked from, I guess there were at the White House and they walked across.  We were just we couldn't even speak. We could even we couldn't see that our nation was under attack. Yet all these years later, we seem to be attacking each other, not attacking basic institutions that are essential to our well-being and essential in case, heaven forbid, we have another tragedy like this.  KERIK: You know what, Laura, you need the right people in command, you need the right leaders, and I'm going to get political for a second. There was one person that was at ground zero that walked through ground zero, motivated the troops, incentivized the troops, brought hundreds of his own civilian workers down there. And that was Donald Trump. He wasn't running for president at the time. He had no idea he was ever going to run for president. He was down there for days. I saw him regularly down there. And for anybody to talk about him today and make any kind of negative comment about the president and his leadership ability, he was leading then. But you know who I didn't see at Ground Zero? I didn't see Joe Biden. Joe Biden was like the kiddie parade that came in for show and tell, took a look around and then skated back to Delaware. That's what Joe Biden was. Donald Trump was down there inspiring the troops, getting people motivated and doing anything he could for the mayor and I to make our job easier.  INGRAHAM: Personally, I only have a few moments left. But personally, just take us back to that day, Bernie. In the last few seconds, we have.  KERIK: When the first plane hit the tower, I was in my office. When the second plane hit tower two, I was standing in front of it and in about 30 minutes later, the mayor and I were inside 75 Barkley when Tower two imploded on top of us and around us, trapping us in that building. By the end of the day, I lost 23 people. Port Authority cops lost 37. The fire department was 343."

She's a very pretty woman, very attractive woman, but she has this proclivity for laughing at awkward times when things really aren't that funny. Wouldn't you just want to really see her laugh at something really funny? What does that look like? She laughs. It's a constant stream of laughter at odd moments. All right, Ray, did you see that the NFL season opener, Kansas City last night. The players stood at one-point arm-in-arm while \"We Believe Black Lives Matter\" and \"We Must End Racism\" were broadcasted on jumbotrons. And the fans reacted this way."

It's not that they dislike the unity. It's that they dislike the lecture. That was what they heard there. And it's a pity that this is what has become of a once great sports franchise."

In moments, a daughter of a Uyghur currently being held in a Chinese concentration camp delivers a stunning rebuke to Disney. Stay there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "While Hollywood elites lecture Americans about how racist our country is, they're making billions off actual racial injustice. The latest example of this disgusting hypocrisy, Disney's live-action remake of \"Mulan.\" In the film's credits they actually include a special thank you to Chinese government agencies, including the Public Security Bureau in the province of Xinjiang. That very province is where the CCP is carrying out vicious genocidal campaigns against the Muslim Uyghurs. Why would Disney do this? China is poised to become the world's biggest box office, that's why, and studios remember what happened the last time they offended China. Back in 1997, the CCP slapped a five-year ban on all these studios behind the movie \"Seven Years in Tibet,\" which cast China, of course, in a negative light, and that's a big no-no. Filming for \"Mulan\" began two years ago when Bob Iger was the CEO of Disney. Remember, he threatened to stop filming in Georgia, that is in the United States, over its antiabortion law, yet was perfectly happy rewarding a country that has put more than 1 million Muslims in concentration camps? That includes the father of my next guest. Jewher Ilham is a Uyghur human rights fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Jewher, what's your message, given your family's suffering, to Disney tonight?"

      "utterance": "Hello, Laura, thank you for having me. It's quite a disappointment to see that Disney had not only filmed some of their shots in the Uyghur region, especially close to several camp locations. It's even heartbreaking for me to know that they publicly thanked the bureau of the Uyghur region. Now Disney is profiting from the oppression of my people despite widespread international condemnation of the Chinese government's brutal tactics in the Uyghur region. I won't really believe it if Disney claimed that they had no idea this was going on, and Disney still chose to go there to film this movie, delivering money and the prestige of an international family brand to those directly engaged in genocide."

What's happening in these camps?"

      "utterance": "First of all, my father, Ilham Tohti, is currently serving a life sentence for advocating for peaceful coexistence between the Uyghurs and Han Chinese on his website, and talking to journalists. And there are so many other people just like my father who might have not even spoken up and have never involved in politics, but because of their ethnic identities or because of their religion, they are sent to a concentration camp or a forced labor camp. They are forced to -- a lot of them are forced to work with very minimal payments, and in very bad working environments. Some have been released, some have been disappeared, and some have even died."

I do understand that promises of access, having access to the massive Chinese market is irresistible for a movie industry, and desperate for revenue, especially in the COVID time when movie ticket sales are simply just down. But at the same time, I'm quite disappointed in them, and I did expect that Hollywood or other companies, big companies like Hollywood could stop being complicit in a genocide."
