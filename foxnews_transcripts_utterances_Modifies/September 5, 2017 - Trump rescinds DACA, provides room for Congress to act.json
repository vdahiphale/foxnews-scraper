Today, the Trump administration announced it's putting an end to DACA, President Obama's controversial program that bars the federal government from deporting illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. Under the President Trump's plan, DACA will begin phasing out six months from now. And in the meantime, the President is urging Congress to act on the issue.",

But what you see the president doing there, is throwing down the -- and saying, Congress has to do with its job. He is facing political minefields from the left to the right. Basically some Republicans warning that the president can lose control.  Republican control of Congress if this issue is not handled well. But people inside the White House tell me, they are still hopeful they can get a compromise where they show the president is moving to the middle. Trying to be humane towards the dreamers and exchange, wants Democrats to compromise as well and get tough on illegal immigration. Either down payment on the wall or other measures to go after illegal immigration.   The attacks though, fast and furious from the Left as I've mentioned, you see former President Barack Obama there breaking with recent tradition of formers of not blasting the decisions of the current acumen of the office because he believes this is a matter of conscience. Obama declaring, quote, 'Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America or rather we treat them the way we'd want our own kids to be treated. It's about who we are as people and who we want to be.' Of course, we should note, the former president did not codify this into law when he had a chance to do that. One of the many problems he handed off to President Trump. So, President Trump now taking flak as well from the right. You have hard liners against illegal immigration like Republicans Steve King of Iowa insisting the commander-in-chief should have simply ended DACA altogether, not giving Congress a six-month window to try and codify it into law. King saying, the president may, quote, 'Cause a great big civil war among the Republicans.' But Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General who took the lead on the issue today insisted compromise can be found. Watch.",

He knows how easy it is to underwrite a memo like that. But he was toying with 800,000 lives.   Eight hundred thousand people who are brought here, essentially against their will. Most of whom, a vast majority, work, they want to be Americans, they've done nothing wrong. If that were so important, so critically important and I argue that our immigration policies, if it's such a mess that it is, then the President back in 2009 had the moral obligation to take care of immigration instead of screwing up the health care system like he did with the implicit failure that is ObamaCare.",

Today, the Trump administration announced it's putting an end to DACA, President Obama's controversial program that bars the federal government from deporting illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. Under the President Trump's plan, DACA will begin phasing out six months from now. And in the meantime, the President is urging Congress to act on the issue."

And I can tell you in speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. And really, we have no choice. We have to be able to do something and I think it's going to work out very well and long term, it's going to be the right solution."

But what you see the president doing there, is throwing down the -- and saying, Congress has to do with its job. He is facing political minefields from the left to the right. Basically some Republicans warning that the president can lose control. Republican control of Congress if this issue is not handled well. But people inside the White House tell me, they are still hopeful they can get a compromise where they show the president is moving to the middle. Trying to be humane towards the dreamers and exchange, wants Democrats to compromise as well and get tough on illegal immigration. Either down payment on the wall or other measures to go after illegal immigration. The attacks though, fast and furious from the Left as I've mentioned, you see former President Barack Obama there breaking with recent tradition of formers of not blasting the decisions of the current acumen of the office because he believes this is a matter of conscience. Obama declaring, quote, 'Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America or rather we treat them the way we'd want our own kids to be treated. It's about who we are as people and who we want to be.' Of course, we should note, the former president did not codify this into law when he had a chance to do that. One of the many problems he handed off to President Trump. So, President Trump now taking flak as well from the right. You have hard liners against illegal immigration like Republicans Steve King of Iowa insisting the commander-in-chief should have simply ended DACA altogether, not giving Congress a six-month window to try and codify it into law. King saying, the president may, quote, 'Cause a great big civil war among the Republicans.' But Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General who took the lead on the issue today insisted compromise can be found. Watch."

And here's the key, in fact, President Obama said much of the same in June of 2012 when he issued this executive order on DACA. He said look, this is an executive action in the middle of an election year, 2012. He called it, quote, 'A temporary stop gap measure.' Clearly President Obama at that time was saying, he wanted to move forward but eventually, Congress would have to try and codify this into la -- Dana."

This thing that President Obama left there, another stink bomb that he leaves. By the way, President Obama is really good at this and to turning people into reverse Santas. He gives something away, knowing that nobody wants to be a reverse Santa. So, he is making Donald Trump, fix his mess. All Donald Trump is saying is, this has to be fixed. This is something that you left, you yourself said it was a makeshift stop gap to help noncitizens. Now, I got to clean up this mess. I just wanted done. That's all he's doing. It's just -- it's amazing that how the good guy in this is the guy that created this faulty Band-Aid and the bad guy is the one looking out for American interests and seeking to fix this Band-Aid.

And all of a sudden, Sheriff Trump comes along and sees the hot car back and says, you know, what, we are not going to arrest you but we are going to drive you to the dealership, we are going to get you some good numbers on a new lease.

He knows how easy it is to underwrite a memo like that. But he was toying with 800,000 lives. Eight hundred thousand people who are brought here, essentially against their will. Most of whom, a vast majority, work, they want to be Americans, they've done nothing wrong. If that were so important, so critically important and I argue that our immigration policies, if it's such a mess that it is, then the President back in 2009 had the moral obligation to take care of immigration instead of screwing up the health care system like he did with the implicit failure that is ObamaCare."

I think 90 percent of the trade from North Korea comes through China. They have extreme leverage. I think it's time to call their bluff and start messing around with the Chinese and slap some tariffs on these guys. I'd rather have a trade war. I don't like what's going on right now.

Sit down and say we don't want a war with you. You don't want a war with us. If you point those missiles, it alarms us and bothers us. Don't point the missiles anymore. You are a cruel, heartless leader but you know what? That is life. Leave us alone and leave our allies alone and everything is good. The thing is, these are rational actors. There's not going to be a war. All this is, is building up. Maybe he sees something in Trump, and ability to deal that he did not see before. Because you are right, he is different."

After seeing Donald Trump handle the catastrophe, they can't call him racist or Hitler or unstable, mocking a photo op is all they've got. When the response is this people. It says that the cartoon demonization of Trump, it's petering out. After seeing how Americans and the president reacted to Harvey, it's dawning on them that America ain't so bad and it's getting better, perhaps even under Trump. Case in point, and not just Dianne Feinstein but Nancy Pelosi have defended President Trump suggesting we should give the guy a chance. Then there's the rise and immediate fall of Antifa. Has any violent mob had a shorter honeymoon then that pile of dung? They made Occupy Wall Street look like Gandhi, so as the hate blows over, Dems realize it's a losing proposition so they are disowning it on the streets and in their own party. What caused this? Maybe Harvey had an effect beyond the obvious damage. It rewound toxic perspectives. What we saw was good stuff coming from bad, morality and motion. The hurricane took the wind out of the whiners, leaving only a few chortling Chuckle buckets, bolstered by forced laughter of co-host quietly wishing for a better gig. Hurricane Harvey has moved on and so with that, so has America. Morning Joe hasn't. It's easy, Jesse, to make fun of a photo op. They are always clumsy and stupid. I guess he was holding cement for the guy. Oh, my god. What low low-hanging fruit, even for those low-hanging fruit pickers."

It was only accessible by trail at the Glacier National Park. There's a silver lining, like in Houston, we see the volunteer firefighters are working to protect the 103 year old lake McDonald lodge in the park. Secretary of Interior thanking those volunteer firefighters today. Praised the help of American Red Cross of Montana. They are helping people that were forced from their homes.
