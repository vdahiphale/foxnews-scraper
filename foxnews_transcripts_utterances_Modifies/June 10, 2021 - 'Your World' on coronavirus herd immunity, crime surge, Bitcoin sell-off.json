It reads similarly in other cities, like Philadelphia, 67.4 percent have been vaccinated, in Denver, close to 70 percent, in San Diego, north of 65 percent, and, in New York City, more than 52 percent. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And FOX on top of vaccinations that are surprisingly robust across a country that is rapidly leading the world in finally putting a spike in this horrific, horrific disease. Now, the implications of all of this are being weighed in the medical community, as well as the political community, as to how much longer term this means we get to, well, herd immunity, if we even need to get to that, technically, at the rate we're going. Let's go to Claudia Cowan following all of this in San Francisco -- Claudia.",

The city is reporting that nearly 80 percent of teens and adults have been vaccinated with at least one dose against COVID-19, while 68 percent are fully vaccinated. The number of new cases is the lowest since the city shut down in March of 2020. And no one has died of COVID in over a month. San Francisco pushed people to get the shot while infections hospitalizations and death rates were low. Officials believe that made a world of difference. While there is some debate over what exactly constitutes herd immunity, one expert says the numbers here are among the best in the country.",

So that means the number of people vaccinated going up and the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths going down. I always urge caution, though, in focusing on large national numbers. You're focusing on city numbers, which is really good. I'm here in the state of New Jersey, where, overall, 63 percent of adults are vaccinated. The town I'm in, Princeton, it's 68 percent. But right next door, Trenton, New Jersey, it's 34 percent. And so it's really important for people to know, what are the rates in their community? Because you may see overall a state is doing really, really well, but what matters is your community. And what we see are that there are pockets of people where the vaccination rates are actually quite low. And that means that they are more vulnerable to the introduction of new strains of variants and of this -- the strains that are circulating in the United States.",

But if young people decide not to get vaccinated, young people don't stick with young people. Last summer, we saw a lot of young people spreading it to older people. Thankfully, the vaccination rates for people who are elderly are quite high. So, hopefully, it won't have the same -- the same burden, but it will have some spread. Black and Latino vaccination rates are lower. The vaccination rates among conservatives are lower. In rural communities, it's lower. Some have to do with barriers to vaccination, and some have to do with people's decision and -- that they don't want to get vaccinated. But I'm encouraged that, as more and more people know, people, friends and family members, that, slowly, those numbers in each group are creeping up. There's hardcore in each group that will never -- never say yes to vaccination.

So I'm really excited. I go outside without my mask. I go to the store without a mask, but I keep it in my pocket. If I go into a grocery store and just about everyone's wearing a mask in there, I know the vaccine rate is very high in my town, but I will throw the mask on just to make people around me more comfortable, recognizing it's going to take a little time for people to come down for that.

And look, there's a grain of truth to what AOC and the left say about there being other root causes, with things like climate change. Yes, climate change is slightly impacting it. Yes, regime instability as a result of the cold war is impacting this. But if you're looking at why these numbers changed on a dime, it was because the Biden/Harris administration decided to revoke a number of diplomatic agreements, such as safe third country agreements with the Northern Triangle countries and remain in Mexico, and that has incentivized trafficking, coyotes all traveling up to the border. Look, if Kamala wants to tell Guatemalan migrants who are currently facing the threat of racial persecution, which is something that we know is prevalent because of the history of the Guatemalan genocide, that they can seek asylum in Mexico, yes, they can, and they should. But it would be a fool's errand and, quite frankly, unethical for her to say, come up if you do not have legitimate claim to seek asylum in America. It's a dangerous trek.

It's 85 percent accurate, and it will take 80 percent of the orders. But it's still going to take a few years before you see them in your local Golden Arches. You have CEO Chris Kempczinski saying: \"Do I think in five years from now, you're going to see a voice in the drive-through? I do. But I don't think this is going to be something that happens in the next year or so.\" A big leap, he says going, from 10 restaurants to 14,000 across the country, which might take a while. Now, automation, though, might help McDonald's bring down their labor costs. They just raised wages last month. Pay starts now at 11 bucks an hour for regular staff, up to 20 bucks for managers. Now, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi says that a push for a $15 minimum wage is going to \"force the costs of labor up, which means it's going to force management to find alternatives, which means they're going to lose jobs. And technology is always cheaper than people.\" Now, it's not just McDonald's. You have Domino's testing out a self-driving delivery van made by Nuro. You might see them across Houston.

This morning, we heard from the National Federation of Small Businesses, and the numbers from them were just staggering; 57 percent of these business owners said they could find few or no qualified applicants; 48 percent have job openings. In other words, these jobs are ready. They need people to come fill them. And 27 percent are looking for more workers. That's a higher number than we have seen in a long time. You put all of this together, and you're a business owner, particularly a small business owner, you don't know how you're going to compete. Conversely, when it comes to the larger businesses, particularly manufacturing, they're already telegraphing they're going to spend more money on what they call capital expenditures, technology and equipment, software. Those things, you're going to see huge. And it's been going on for a while, but I'm really concerned that they really are speeding this up. The technology of course, has gotten a lot better. You pull into a McDonald's, you make the order. By the time you get to the window the food is almost ready and it's hot. And it's -- listen, it's a tough one, Neil, because some people have priced themselves out of the labor market. And some people want to work, but I don't think our education system is such that we're producing the sort of workers -- and you don't need a college degree. The CEO of IBM, she coined it very well. Said that it's not a white-collar job or a blue-collar job. It's a new-collar job. So there are so many opportunities out there. We learned today 9.3 million jobs are open his country right now. It's by far a record, and we have got to find a way to match people with those jobs at reasonable wages for everyone, for them and for businesses, particularly small business.",

It reads similarly in other cities, like Philadelphia, 67.4 percent have been vaccinated, in Denver, close to 70 percent, in San Diego, north of 65 percent, and, in New York City, more than 52 percent. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And FOX on top of vaccinations that are surprisingly robust across a country that is rapidly leading the world in finally putting a spike in this horrific, horrific disease. Now, the implications of all of this are being weighed in the medical community, as well as the political community, as to how much longer term this means we get to, well, herd immunity, if we even need to get to that, technically, at the rate we're going.

The number of new cases is the lowest since the city shut down in March of 2020. And no one has died of COVID in over a month. San Francisco pushed people to get the shot while infections hospitalizations and death rates were low. Officials believe that made a world of difference.

So that means the number of people vaccinated going up and the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths going down. I always urge caution, though, in focusing on large national numbers. You're focusing on city numbers, which is really good. I'm here in the state of New Jersey, where, overall, 63 percent of adults are vaccinated. The town I'm in, Princeton, it's 68 percent. But right next door, Trenton, New Jersey, it's 34 percent. And so it's really important for people to know, what are the rates in their community? Because you may see overall a state is doing really, really well, but what matters is your community. And what we see are that there are pockets of people where the vaccination rates are actually quite low. And that means that they are more vulnerable to the introduction of new strains of variants and of this -- the strains that are circulating in the United States."

      "utterance": "Well, the problem, Neil, is, it's not limited to that population. And so I would hold off on declaring victory on COVID. I'm excited about the direction of the numbers. But if young people decide not to get vaccinated, young people don't stick with young people. Last summer, we saw a lot of young people spreading it to older people. Thankfully, the vaccination rates for people who are elderly are quite high. So, hopefully, it won't have the same -- the same burden, but it will have some spread. Black and Latino vaccination rates are lower. The vaccination rates among conservatives are lower. In rural communities, it's lower. Some have to do with barriers to vaccination, and some have to do with people's decision and -- that they don't want to get vaccinated. But I'm encouraged that, as more and more people know, people, friends and family members, that, slowly, those numbers in each group are creeping up. There's hardcore in each group that will never -- never say yes to vaccination. But if you can make it as easy as possible for people who are on the fence, that will take us far down the road towards the protection we want to see in every community."

How do you think that's going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BESSER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a challenge. The challenge I see is that, for so many people, we have gotten comfortable wearing a mask. And it's going to take people a little while to come down from that and say, OK, if you're fully vaccinated, you are protected and the science said you don't need to wear a mask. So I'm really excited. I go outside without my mask. I go to the store without a mask, but I keep it in my pocket. If I go into a grocery store and just about everyone's wearing a mask in there, I know the vaccine rate is very high in my town, but I will throw the mask on just to make people around me more comfortable, recognizing it's going to take a little time for people to come down for that. For those who aren't vaccinated, wearing a mask is a good way to increase your protection. That's a -- that's a safe thing to do."

She's been to Guatemala. She's now in Mexico. She's been everywhere but the border. And she seems to have a greater affinity for people from other countries. She seems to be more interested in the perspectives of those people, rather than spending time in the United States of America, speaking to regular, everyday, ordinary Americans who are worried about their safety, who are worried about what's going on, on the border, and particularly those people that live around those areas.

And the treatment, particularly of migrant minors, was a big issue for her. But it's its operation, like, I don't know, crickets now. And that's what sort of alarms me.

And, historically speaking, contrary to what Biden said, the real peak begins now, not in April, but heading into the hot, hot summer. And look, there's a grain of truth to what AOC and the left say about there being other root causes, with things like climate change. Yes, climate change is slightly impacting it. Yes, regime instability as a result of the cold war is impacting this. But if you're looking at why these numbers changed on a dime, it was because the Biden/Harris administration decided to revoke a number of diplomatic agreements, such as safe third country agreements with the Northern Triangle countries and remain in Mexico, and that has incentivized trafficking, coyotes all traveling up to the border. Look, if Kamala wants to tell Guatemalan migrants who are currently facing the threat of racial persecution, which is something that we know is prevalent because of the history of the Guatemalan genocide, that they can seek asylum in Mexico, yes, they can, and they should. But it would be a fool's errand and, quite frankly, unethical for her to say, come up if you do not have legitimate claim to seek asylum in America. It's a dangerous trek. And the reason why we have this backlog of asylum claims is because you have a lot of people who are coming just for more economic opportunity. And you know what? If you want to come to America that way, you don't seek asylum."

And we're hinting or teasing or dangling the possibility of more aid. Do you really believe that that is going to make a difference, especially that it will get to all the right people to mitigate all the Guatemalans who go north and get to the border?

And nowhere does it seem to be in decline at the moment, seems to be on the incline. It's certainly shaking up the mayor's race here in New York.

Maya and several of the others who were talking about getting rid of 2,000, 3,000 more cops, taking another billion, $2 billion out of the budget of the NYPD, after already taking a billion dollars away, I think they're hearing from the public at large they want to refund the police (AUDIO GAP) the police."

But one of them is the idea that the reform that everybody is looking for, that we were doing that in New York, and doing it so successfully that crime was continuing to go down, summonses, citations, arrests, number of young men, typically minority men, going off to prison and jail reduced dramatically. And New York up until about '19 was really leading the way with its neighborhood policing initiative, that we had effectively solved the problem."

I'm told the president walks away with a view that these talks were completed in good faith. But moving on to the spending and this hearing on the Hill, the big price tag that really came into play with the infrastructure tax and then also in this hearing is just the amount of spending that this president wants to do. You can ask pretty much any Republican on the Hill about the $6 trillion spending proposal, the budget proposal from this White House, and you're going to hear two words. You're going to hear debt and inflation. We knew that was going to be a major theme of today's hearing with the deputy budget director, Shalanda Young. But Republican senator Lindsey Graham also drilled down in this hearing on the enhanced federal unemployment benefits, with those 20-plus states no longer taking the extra $300 a week, saying that it's deterring people from going back to work. Young said that she hasn't met Americans who don't want to work. And the White House has historically defended these benefits as a critical lifeline.

In other words, these jobs are ready. They need people to come fill them. And 27 percent are looking for more workers. That's a higher number than we have seen in a long time. You put all of this together, and you're a business owner, particularly a small business owner, you don't know how you're going to compete. Conversely, when it comes to the larger businesses, particularly manufacturing, they're already telegraphing they're going to spend more money on what they call capital expenditures, technology and equipment, software. Those things, you're going to see huge. And it's been going on for a while, but I'm really concerned that they really are speeding this up. The technology of course, has gotten a lot better. You pull into a McDonald's, you make the order. By the time you get to the window the food is almost ready and it's hot. And it's -- listen, it's a tough one, Neil, because some people have priced themselves out of the labor market. And some people want to work, but I don't think our education system is such that we're producing the sort of workers -- and you don't need a college degree. The CEO of IBM, she coined it very well. Said that it's not a white-collar job or a blue-collar job. It's a new-collar job. So there are so many opportunities out there. We learned today 9.3 million jobs are open his country right now.

He ended our infrastructure negotiations. As Republicans, we believe in our nation's infrastructure, which is why our negotiating team consistently worked in good faith with the president. We were optimistic that we could reach a bipartisan agreement for the sake of the country.\" Just sort of rocketing ahead here, that has not happened. Those talks have officially broken down. We will have more after this."

      "utterance": "All right, a Republican who won by a couple of 100 votes in McAllen, Texas, a big border town. It's a big deal. They're still sort of going through this. And the Democratic candidate has not yet conceded. But the fact of the matter is, this guy won in a district that Hillary Clinton had won by better than 40 points in 2016 over Donald Trump and that Joe Biden had won by about 20 points over Donald Trump in the last election. Kelly Jane Torrance on the significance of all this, of course, Kelly with The New York Post. Kelly Jane, what do you think?"

      "speaker": "KELLY JANE TORRANCE, NEW YORK POST",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, this is fascinating, Neil, for so many reasons. Donald Trump actually gained a lot in the Hispanic vote in 2020, I think at least about a 10 percent higher share of the electorate than he had in 2016. And a lot of people have been wondering, can the Republicans keep that now that Trump is pretty much gone? And the answer, I think, is yes. This shows it. McAllen hasn't had a Republican mayor in over two decades, and the city is 85 percent Hispanic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Now, what's interesting, we're no stranger to what's been happening at the border. And it cuts anyone's way here, that whether you're white, American, Hispanic, what have you, you're upset, you're anxious, you're getting nervous. And you reflect that in your vote in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that a lot of the reasons that Republicans did increase their share of the Hispanic vote still applies. But, again, Biden won Hidalgo County by 17 points, much lower than Hillary Clinton's 50. But, again, he won."

      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "So what changed between now -- between November now? And what changed, of course, is the border crisis. People at the border towns, they see the coyotes, the human smugglers, who are leaving children alone. They see drugs coming through. They see all of the problems that low to no border security leaves. They are the ones experiencing -- we here in New York and people in D.C., we can watch the pictures, read the articles, but they are living it. And the fact that they decided to vote against the Democrats, I think, says a lot. And it shows also that Hispanics are not necessarily for illegal immigration. A lot of them came here legally, of course. They have done -- they have stood in line. They have they have done what they had to do. And they're not happy about people just coming in willy-nilly. They want law and order, like a lot of other groups in this country. And I think that's one reason that we saw them increase the GOP share in 2020, was, again, law and order. They saw rioting in the streets."

      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "I do think that a lot of people, the Hispanic community throughout the country, communicate with each other about what's going on. But keep in mind that one of the reasons Republicans, I think, gained with Hispanics was, there was a record low unemployment started in September 2019 of 3.9 percent Hispanic unemployment. That's a record. And it's amazing. And I think that Hispanics appreciated that. They're hardworking, like many immigrants. And they want to keep their money. And they see that President Biden and his administration is looking to tax growth, tax jobs. They're -- I think they're going to be open to the Republican message for quite some time."

Before I go here and throw to \"The Five\" here, just some news that you probably expected, that the negotiations between Republicans and the White House have broken off right now on infrastructure. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia saying she's disappointed by that, but maybe this could be a negotiating tactic. Who knows? But, for now, those talks have stopped. What happens? Who knows?
