      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Emily Compagno, Jason Chaffetz, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” James Comey broke FBI rules but the Justice Department, they will not prosecute him. A scathing new DOJ inspector general report details how the former FBI director handled memos about President Trump. They report laying out numerous violations by Comey, among them Comey violated policy by giving one memo to a friend with instructions to share it with \"The New York Times.\"  He also kept copies of the memos in a safe at his home. The inspector general saying the former head of the FBI set a \"dangerous example\" for the bureau. But Comey, he is insisting he's been cleared and even taunting his critics.  Here I'm quoting, \"And to all those who spent two years talking about me going to jail or being a liar and a leaker, ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long including the president.\"  President Trump, he is responding by saying Comey should be ashamed of himself. As someone who's been in our Congress, I'm going to ask, do you agree with what the inspector general found and the decision not to prosecute.",

I find it very troubling there are multiple times where the inspector general has made her recommendations to prosecute including the deputy assistant director and others and they haven't prosecuted. I think that's a problem. I think it sets a terrible precedent. I think Michael Horowitz who was confirmed unanimously as an Obama appointee did a very thorough job. But if James Comey thinks that he has won the day, are you kidding me?  The first report on him said that he, you know, he acted as insubordinate. This is as damning as any report you will ever see from an inspector general. And I do think they should have prosecuted.   But James Comey is not out of the woods yet. You have two places of vulnerability. One is actually the chief justice of the Supreme Court because once the inspector general does the FISA report, they could very well hold people in contempt and James Comey's autograph is on one of those things. And the Supreme Court should actually hold them accountable for misleading on the FISA abuse. The second one is the report on the FISA abuse. James Comey is not out of the woods on that yet.",

He's doing a victory lap sort of like Hillary Clinton did a victory lap after he -- James Comey declined to officially charge her for having the private e-mail server. And a lot of these things are very similar, right? The retention and handling of government documents. It's almost as if it's kind of the mirror image because it's the same statute or the same policy guideline that he decided not to officially charge. And now the Justice Department is saying we are not going to prosecute, but nobody is saying this is a good thing to do. I have a feeling that if somebody that worked for Jim Comey at the FBI had done this very thing and Jim Comey found out about it, that person probably would've been fired or at least put on a suspension and while there is investigation.  But his tweet, I have to say, it's good to be on offense if you can be. Even when it looks like you should be on defense, he's just on offense and he learned that from our recent politics.

It was a one-man fist bump. He just went up like this. There's nobody there. There's nobody there to fist bump like congrats. He's doing a one-man high five. He's claiming victory. It reminds me of me like claiming victory when my wife finds only four empty beer bottles and not eight. I mean, they only got me for leaking phony stuff to the press and I'm not going to jail. I win. My worry is I hope this doesn't hinder his chances in becoming a CNN contributor because I think he just proved them right. But what did we learn from -- what did we learn from what he did wrong? So he designated a buddy to leak info from the FBI to \"The New York Times.\"  That this was a guy who's always interested in the media piece. More than anything he was always into the spotlight and he always used to cover it up in this aw shucks jolly gee willikers Andy Griffith show mentality, but that camouflage a narcissistic man.

And the second point I'd like to make is what I worry -- I think the Obama- Biden legacy is going to be the politicization -- putting politics into the worst of the worst. You're supposed to have an FBI, a Department of Justice, the IRS, the Federal Reserve, they are all supposed to be above and beyond politics.  And yet where we are eight years later, nine years later, is they have politicized some of the institutions that should be on politics. If there is nothing else from James Comey and what you saw in the first and second report from the I.G., it's that they used this for their own personal gratification, their own personal political agenda.  And they politicized these departments and agencies and that's in part what's tearing up this country because they don't believe there is an equal application of justice under the law.",

CNN and MSNBC did way more to undermine our election system than the Russians simply by exaggerating that narrative in order to unseat the orange monster they despise. Putin must be thinking about the upside of having a free press. Look what it did for him in America. He achieved more through Jeff Zucker and Rachel Maddow than a farm of Russian bots spending a hundred grand on Facebook ads ever could. But that story collapsed, yet the obsessed media didn't stop. They are still seeing Russians in their sleep, which has hurt us. The media, out of bitterness over defeat, they could not move past, has left us with a country questioning whether any election could be legitimate.

To your point, absolutely right. 50 years ago, if people were vaping, a lot of relatives would be alive right now if they had this nicotine delivery system which wasn't wrapped in tar, you know. Now to the victims, to your point. There was one study in Minnesota. They were mixing nicotine and pot, so that could have played a role. In Wisconsin, and I think this is - I don't know if this pertains to the new patients, but all of them were dabbing, which means vaping THC oil, which has an uncertain purity and it's not about the nicotine. So, it's not about the nicotine vaping, it's about street drugs. What are they buying and what are they putting in there? What we do know there's an independent review that if you switch from cigarettes to e-cigs, that leads to a risk reduction of 95 percent in lung disease. That's an independent review. So, these stories need to be taken seriously. But if the hype reduces the use of this and people go back to smoking that will actually cost lives. And you could argue they could be held accountable.

It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” James Comey broke FBI rules but the Justice Department, they will not prosecute him. A scathing new DOJ inspector general report details how the former FBI director handled memos about President Trump. They report laying out numerous violations by Comey, among them Comey violated policy by giving one memo to a friend with instructions to share it with \"The New York Times.\" He also kept copies of the memos in a safe at his home. The inspector general saying the former head of the FBI set a \"dangerous example\" for the bureau. But Comey, he is insisting he's been cleared and even taunting his critics. Here I'm quoting, \"And to all those who spent two years talking about me going to jail or being a liar and a leaker, ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long including the president.\" President Trump, he is responding by saying Comey should be ashamed of himself. As someone who's been in our Congress, I'm going to ask, do you agree with what the inspector general found and the decision not to prosecute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASON CHAFFETZ, HOST",
      "utterance": "I wish -- well, the inspector general recommended that he be prosecuted. It's the Department of Justice in operating at a different level that decided not to do this. I find it very troubling there are multiple times where the inspector general has made her recommendations to prosecute including the deputy assistant director and others and they haven't prosecuted. I think that's a problem. I think it sets a terrible precedent. I think Michael Horowitz who was confirmed unanimously as an Obama appointee did a very thorough job. But if James Comey thinks that he has won the day, are you kidding me? The first report on him said that he, you know, he acted as insubordinate. This is as damning as any report you will ever see from an inspector general. And I do think they should have prosecuted. But James Comey is not out of the woods yet. You have two places of vulnerability. One is actually the chief justice of the Supreme Court because once the inspector general does the FISA report, they could very well hold people in contempt and James Comey's autograph is on one of those things. And the Supreme Court should actually hold them accountable for misleading on the FISA abuse. The second one is the report on the FISA abuse. James Comey is not out of the woods on that yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, we haven't seen anything out of all the talk about FISA warrants and the like to this point. And Dana, just in asking about this, what do you think should be the penalty? He did, according to the report, violate policy but they are saying he didn't break the law. Apparently these memos were not classified at the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Right. So this feels a lot to me like something that happened back in 2015 and '16 when he was the FBI director. He's doing a victory lap sort of like Hillary Clinton did a victory lap after he -- James Comey declined to officially charge her for having the private e-mail server. And a lot of these things are very similar, right? The retention and handling of government documents. It's almost as if it's kind of the mirror image because it's the same statute or the same policy guideline that he decided not to officially charge. And now the Justice Department is saying we are not going to prosecute, but nobody is saying this is a good thing to do. I have a feeling that if somebody that worked for Jim Comey at the FBI had done this very thing and Jim Comey found out about it, that person probably would've been fired or at least put on a suspension and while there is investigation. But his tweet, I have to say, it's good to be on offense if you can be. Even when it looks like you should be on defense, he's just on offense and he learned that from our recent politics. It works."

It was a one-man fist bump. He just went up like this. There's nobody there. There's nobody there to fist bump like congrats. He's doing a one-man high five. He's claiming victory. It reminds me of me like claiming victory when my wife finds only four empty beer bottles and not eight. I mean, they only got me for leaking phony stuff to the press and I'm not going to jail. I win. My worry is I hope this doesn't hinder his chances in becoming a CNN contributor because I think he just proved them right. But what did we learn from -- what did we learn from what he did wrong? So he designated a buddy to leak info from the FBI to \"The New York Times.\" That this was a guy who's always interested in the media piece. More than anything he was always into the spotlight and he always used to cover it up in this aw shucks jolly gee willikers Andy Griffith show mentality, but that camouflage a narcissistic man.

And the second point I'd like to make is what I worry -- I think the Obama- Biden legacy is going to be the politicization -- putting politics into the worst of the worst. You're supposed to have an FBI, a Department of Justice, the IRS, the Federal Reserve, they are all supposed to be above and beyond politics. And yet where we are eight years later, nine years later, is they have politicized some of the institutions that should be on politics. If there is nothing else from James Comey and what you saw in the first and second report from the I.G., it's that they used this for their own personal gratification, their own personal political agenda. And they politicized these departments and agencies and that's in part what's tearing up this country because they don't believe there is an equal application of justice under the law."

They spent three years chasing the flame of Russian collusion only to turn up with empty, charred hands. You think that didn't mess with America's mind? That's the irony. CNN and MSNBC did way more to undermine our election system than the Russians simply by exaggerating that narrative in order to unseat the orange monster they despise. Putin must be thinking about the upside of having a free press. Look what it did for him in America. He achieved more through Jeff Zucker and Rachel Maddow than a farm of Russian bots spending a hundred grand on Facebook ads ever could. But that story collapsed, yet the obsessed media didn't stop. They are still seeing Russians in their sleep, which has hurt us. The media, out of bitterness over defeat, they could not move past, has left us with a country questioning whether any election could be legitimate.

Basically, all vaping is, is you're delivering nicotine through vapor, not smoking. To your point, absolutely right. 50 years ago, if people were vaping, a lot of relatives would be alive right now if they had this nicotine delivery system which wasn't wrapped in tar, you know. Now to the victims, to your point. There was one study in Minnesota. They were mixing nicotine and pot, so that could have played a role. In Wisconsin, and I think this is - I don't know if this pertains to the new patients, but all of them were dabbing, which means vaping THC oil, which has an uncertain purity and it's not about the nicotine. So, it's not about the nicotine vaping, it's about street drugs. What are they buying and what are they putting in there? What we do know there's an independent review that if you switch from cigarettes to e-cigs, that leads to a risk reduction of 95 percent in lung disease. That's an independent review. So, these stories need to be taken seriously. But if the hype reduces the use of this and people go back to smoking that will actually cost lives. And you could argue they could be held accountable.
