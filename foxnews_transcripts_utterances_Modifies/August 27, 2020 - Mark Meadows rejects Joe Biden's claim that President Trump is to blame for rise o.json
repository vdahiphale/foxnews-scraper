So we are just a couple of hours away now from President Trump taking the stage to again accept the nomination of his party and it is his party now after nearly four years in office, he will make the case that America should re-elect him to finish the work that he started, granting him four more years. It is also been very much his convention from start to finish. Tonight we expect that the president will come out swinging, saying that he and Mike Pence have spent the last four years repairing the damage of the Obama- Biden White House.  He will also push for law and order amidst rising chaos in American cities.",

They should not happen in the United States and he's denounced them and has called for a full and thorough and prompt investigation. And he joins the family of Jacob Blake in rejecting violence in saying that protesters who are peaceful and orderly, that's terrific.

And I can tell you it wasn't Joe Biden from his basement that send actual National Guard troops and law enforcement officers into Kenosha, Wisconsin. It was the President of the United States.

They want to try to hide the Vice President of the Obama-Biden administration in a basement as long as they can so there's no tough questions so that you don't get to ask the tough questions or anyone else in the hopes that they can hoodwink the American people.

And so she's hoping that she can spin her story just like Joe Biden is hoping to spin his story but I think really the ultimate thing is they're afraid of the record. Listen, 47 years of service and you have two bills of which the Vice President Joe Biden actually passed, one of which he's running away from and that we're having to fix.

      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Well Martha, here's what I heard in the last few minutes in Mark Meadows interview and earlier today from Joe Biden. The Chief of Staff to President Trump just said something that is flat out demonstrably untrue and Joe Biden spoke to it earlier today. Former Vice President Biden is clear both that he finds these incidents, like the attack on Jacob Blake, like the brutal murder of George Floyd absolutely unacceptable. He thinks these are horrible. They should not happen in the United States and he's denounced them and has called for a full and thorough and prompt investigation. And he joins the family of Jacob Blake in rejecting violence in saying that protesters who are peaceful and orderly, that's terrific. That is an appropriate way in the United States to express your concerns but when it becomes a riot, when there's violence, when there's looting, that violates our laws and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris do not support that."

There was no discussion about the violence is happening in our cities and that's what you heard from that Democrat voter. She said I've changed my mind. I can't believe that no one is talking about what's happening. The looting, the rioting. Every time I brought up the question about what's happening in the cities, I was told it's not a big deal. And you know, that it's mostly peaceful protests. We don't have mostly peaceful protests with huge fires burning in the back of them and now suddenly there's a recognition on the part of Joe Biden and I think that's great. I think everybody says yes, it is time to recognize the pain of these people who have their buildings and their businesses destroyed, Sir."

President Trump has talked out of both sides of his mouth about healthcare. He promised in 2016 that he would replace the Affordable Care Act with something that costs less and protect more. Instead we've got a system where he is still trying to take away healthcare for more than 100 million Americans. I think he should present in dignity his defense for that course of action."

Joining me now is Dr. Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

There was a suggestion that it was because they want to see more positive tests in this political season.

In fact, almost all of our antibiotics a large percent of them are made in China. Now a prominent Chinese official is threatening that China might use that lever to restrict our access to their drug exports which we very much need to have in this country suggesting that Beijing should, quote, \"weaponize its export of medicine if the United States blocks companies like Huawei from access to American computer chips.\" So, can you see where this whole fight is going? Tonight, China is also accusing the United States of violating international law after Washington slapped Beijing with new sanctions over their military buildup in the disputed South China Sea.

This latest threat by a high-ranking advisor to the Chinese communist reveals once again their true nature and the malicious intent they have to kill Americans because that's what it is withholding vital medications. Even basic medication is like Ibuprofen or Penicillin or other antibiotics. If your child is sick and has a high fever of 104 to 105 and you can't get access to those, your child can die. And that's what they are proposing to do. Now they are doing so because we're going to restrict the export of high technology like semiconductor software and other semiconductor related technology. Here's the difference. We can make Ibuprofen and Penicillin and antibiotics in this country if we choose to and we should. China cannot make in its country what we make here.

What Joe Biden says on the campaign trail right now matters a lot less than what he has done for 47 years and supporting terrible trade deals that send so much of our manufacturing to China. Drug manufacturing or high-tech manufacturing sent so many jobs overseas to China. It's rich for them now to act like all of a sudden, they are the China hawks. It was Joe Biden after all who was responsible for China policy early in the Obama administration when China didn't have naval bases in the middle of the South China Sea. And they stood idly by while China built them from rocks in the middle of the sea extending their bombers and their fighters and their missile ranges by hundreds and hundreds of miles. It was Donald Trump in just this week sanctioned all the companies and officials who were responsible for building those naval bases.

We're the ones getting killed. We are the ones getting shot. It's amazing. While we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back."

      "utterance": "Well, it's very passionate but let me say this. I know Doc -- Coach Rivers. And I will tell you what, I think you are a fine coach, you are fine gentleman. But let me tell you this here. This president here has said that violence got to stop. What was so strange to me is until another station, someone on another station said, you know, we are losing in the polls so I think we better speak out on this violence. When did the Democratic side decided to speak out? It should have been spoken out a long time ago not just now. And so, don't blame this president here. Don't blame anyone. Quit pointing fingers. If you want to solve it, what we got to do we got to get together and talk about it. Not protest. Not go off the court. Not do any of that. We need to get together leaderships and vote. Every league, go to Washington and you decide what you want to do. I said I'm happy to join you because I do know this has got to stop. We cannot go on like this."

There is a pain and you want to get past the point. You want to move it towards the conversation that actually gets us somewhere because it does feel like the protest leads to the violence and that leads to both sides just backing harder into their corners."

    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, they are doing that because you are taking videos. You know, this looks terrible when you see the video it looks terrible. But everyone doesn't know all the facts. And the first thing they said was racism. You know, I'm not going to say this is racism. That is just an incident that happened, but I think whenever white cops shoots a black guy, the first thing they say is racism. You know, wait a minute, there may have been more to the story to just that. So why don't we wait until all the details come out before we make a conclusion."
