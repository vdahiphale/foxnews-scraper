      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" What's interesting about so many of the people you see talking on television is not just that they tell you things that they know are not true. They do. They lie regularly and they shade the truth even more than that. You, of course, knew that. It's obvious.  What's amazing is how they do it in unison. One will say something false and then, within, what seems like, minutes, all the others are saying it too, the exact same thing, sometimes word-for-word. It's like they're all texting each other in commercial breaks, or maybe they just know instinctively what the latest Democratic Party talking points will be.  We could give you endless examples of this. But here's the most recent one. In the days since last week's midterm elections, all the geniuses on cable have simultaneously decided that the migrant Caravan marching toward the United States is a mirage. It's not real. It never has been real. It was always a fake threat created by unscrupulous Right-wing politicians to win the last election.  Watch them sing that tune in perfect harmony.",

In the meantime, those same people are overwhelming city services in Tijuana and causing a crisis there. The people from the Caravan are doing all of this because they actually exist. They are a physical reality, no matter what they're telling you on CNN. Well apparently, nobody has alerted California Senator Kamala Harris.

Democrats told them that. They encouraged this whole thing from the very first day. Now, it's a disaster.  The Mayor of Tijuana says his city is buckling under the weight of the migrants. Many of them are criminals, the Mayor of Tijuana says. Violence has broken out. People have been hurt. Dozens of migrants never even made it to the border, by the way. They are still missing, presumably kidnapped by drug cartels. The human cost has been very high. Democrats are not talking about that cost, somehow. It's not interesting to them. It won't win them elections. We'd like to talk about it though. That's why we invited Chris Hahn on. He's an attorney, radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. He joins us tonight.

Just this morning, they were considering a legal challenge that would have sought to order another round of voting on the grounds of alleged voter suppression and fraud. But this afternoon, bowing to reality, apparently, Abrams announced she'd be dropping her legal challenges and that effectively ended the race. And yet, Abrams refused to actually concede. In fact, in her remarks, which are so Orwellian, you should go on the internet and watch them, the woman who got fewer votes than her opponent said that, we're quoting now, \"Democracy failed in Georgia.\" OK. Well, the Senate race in Florida is still dragging on though. Hand recounts of some ballots are continuing across the state. But the Democrat in the Senate race, Bill Nelson doesn't like he will win. His path to victory is getting very narrow at this point. Craig Patrick is Political Editor and Chief Investigator for FOX 13 in Tampa Bay. He's been on (ph) every night this week. We're going to miss the recount because we're going to miss having him on, but he joins us tonight. Craig, what is going on? CRAIG PATRICK, FOX13 TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: Well the hand recount is going to continue until Sunday. But we can tell you that Bill Nelson is surely doomed. And he is doomed, in large part, because he had placed his hopes and his trust in Broward County, which as we've seen a time or two, that's kind of like placing your - your trust and hope in Harry Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber. But the irony here is that Bill Nelson thought that Broward County would be dumber and less effective than it actually was, because there were some 30,000 votes that had flown through the machines, not once, but twice, that did not register a vote, mostly Democrats in Broward County. So Nelson was saying, \"Oh, these machines! Broward, here you go again.\" But what we found out today is when election workers looked at those ballots by hand they discovered that the scanners didn't register votes because most of the voters, around 98 percent, left that race blank. Maybe these Democrats didn't vote for Rick Scott because he's a Republican, maybe they didn't vote for Bill Nelson because he's Bill Nelson, who knows? But that's the fact of the matter here. And with this, it puts Bill Nelson in an impossible position. There is chatter and speculation. Some Democrats say they couldn't see the race on the ballot because it had been tucked in the lower-left and perhaps a poor ballot designed by Broward County. But even so, that's just tough luck for Nelson. There's - there's history for that too. Remember, Tucker, I know you do, in Palm Beach County when it designed the butterfly ballot in 2000 that that Democrats wound up tricking Democrats and voting for Pat Buchanan. And Democrats will never forgive themselves for that.",

Her saga began nine years ago when she went to get a drink of water and quarreled with several Muslim women who objected to drinking from the same cup as a Christian. A mob leader descended on Bibi. They insulted her and then they accused her of insulting the Prophet Mohammed. They assaulted her. Afterward, she was arrested. She was convicted of blasphemy. She was sentenced to death. Two weeks ago, Bibi got a break. The Pakistani Supreme Court decided there was not enough evidence that she had actually blasphemed anyone, so the Court vacated her conviction. But her ordeal is not over. Islamists in Pakistan have staged massive riots demanding that she be executed. One cleric put a bounty on her head. A lawyer who defended Bibi has fled the country but Bibi herself has been forbidden to leave. Her family has pleaded for asylum in the West. If their pleas are not answered, obviously, Bibi may be killed. Cases like this are why the West created asylum laws in the first place. But the United Kingdom is taking a pass, so far. The U.K. has refused to shelter Bibi despite the fact it has accepted countless other immigrants from that region or, more precisely, because it has accepted those immigrants. According to news accounts, the British government believes that accepting Asia Bibi would cause, quote, security concerns and unrest among certain sections of the community. Ponder that for a second. The United Kingdom gave us the rights that Americans take for granted, the core rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, all of those freedoms are now dying in Britain. In their place remains fear, a fear of offending the very people who have made it impossible to sustain those ancient freedoms. Well, not surprisingly, CNN has found a way to use this tragedy to attack the White House, somehow. A piece on CNN's website warns, quote, Trump, take notice. If you court religious extremists, you're in danger of letting mobs weaken democracy. Right. But there's another lesson to be learned here, a lesson that Trump has accepted and CNN has not. The kind of religious extremists willing to behead you for apostasy should not be allowed into your country. When we make room for him or people like him, we very soon run out of room for the values that made us proud to live here in the first place. That story is not yet over, by the way. It's developing, and we plan to follow it, and bring you updates, as we get them. But first, a weekend, which I hope all of us can enjoy. We'll be back Monday night 8 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. We hope to see you there. By the way, Mike Huckabee, up next, in for Sean. He'll be interviewing the White House Press Secretary whom he knows well. It's going to be a great show. Have a great weekend. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I mean we don't care about education for less-skilled workers. We say college for all. And if you don't complete college, you just you fell out somewhere along the way, and all of our money goes to the folks who are actually completing college even though they're the ones who need the least help."

More low- skilled immigration, it can't be good for low-skilled workers. You're just adding more competition to the market."

      "speaker": "CASS",

Given that we're going to have high- skilled immigration, is it good to also have a lot of low-skilled immigration or is it good to have less low-skilled immigration? And what you would say is the less low-skilled immigration you have, the better things are going to be for the low-skilled workers who are here."

You go down to the bottom end of the ladder, that's where you find the people who say, \"No, we don't just want money. We want the jobs,\" because they understand how critical work is not just to their own satisfaction, their own lives, to their families, to their communities.

      "utterance": "Democrat Stacey Abrams (ph) has finally conceded in the Governor's race in Georgia. Abrams had trailed the Republican there, Brian Kemp, by a big margin since Election Night. But she and her team of lawyers fought on. Just this morning, they were considering a legal challenge that would have sought to order another round of voting on the grounds of alleged voter suppression and fraud. But this afternoon, bowing to reality, apparently, Abrams announced she'd be dropping her legal challenges and that effectively ended the race. And yet, Abrams refused to actually concede. In fact, in her remarks, which are so Orwellian, you should go on the internet and watch them, the woman who got fewer votes than her opponent said that, we're quoting now, \"Democracy failed in Georgia.\" OK. Well, the Senate race in Florida is still dragging on though. Hand recounts of some ballots are continuing across the state. But the Democrat in the Senate race, Bill Nelson doesn't like he will win. His path to victory is getting very narrow at this point. Craig Patrick is Political Editor and Chief Investigator for FOX 13 in Tampa Bay. He's been on (ph) every night this week. We're going to miss the recount because we're going to miss having him on, but he joins us tonight. Craig, what is going on? CRAIG PATRICK, FOX13 TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: Well the hand recount is going to continue until Sunday. But we can tell you that Bill Nelson is surely doomed. And he is doomed, in large part, because he had placed his hopes and his trust in Broward County, which as we've seen a time or two, that's kind of like placing your - your trust and hope in Harry Lloyd from Dumb and Dumber. But the irony here is that Bill Nelson thought that Broward County would be dumber and less effective than it actually was, because there were some 30,000 votes that had flown through the machines, not once, but twice, that did not register a vote, mostly Democrats in Broward County. So Nelson was saying, \"Oh, these machines! Broward, here you go again.\" But what we found out today is when election workers looked at those ballots by hand they discovered that the scanners didn't register votes because most of the voters, around 98 percent, left that race blank. Maybe these Democrats didn't vote for Rick Scott because he's a Republican, maybe they didn't vote for Bill Nelson because he's Bill Nelson, who knows? But that's the fact of the matter here. And with this, it puts Bill Nelson in an impossible position. There is chatter and speculation. Some Democrats say they couldn't see the race on the ballot because it had been tucked in the lower-left and perhaps a poor ballot designed by Broward County. But even so, that's just tough luck for Nelson. There's - there's history for that too. Remember, Tucker, I know you do, in Palm Beach County when it designed the butterfly ballot in 2000 that that Democrats wound up tricking Democrats and voting for Pat Buchanan.

Bill Priestap, who was the Head of the Division investigating this case, when asked about verifying the dossier, Tucker, you know what he said? \"Oh, it's in its infancy, the verification process.\" The lead investigator in the case, Peter Strzok, when asked about the case, he said, \"Hey, there could be no there, there.\" And here's one more for you. Lisa Page, the lawyer in the case, the FBI lawyer, said to Congressional investigators, this is just months ago, not two years ago when it started. She said, \"Hey, it still could be literally nothing.\" Literally nothing? We've upended the whole country--"

Well the recidivism rate's going up because you're not doing anything for the people in the system. This incentivizes good behavior. It gives them programs they need to be better citizens when they go out on the street. And it reduces the recidivism because they don't have to revert to crime and go back, you know.

Now he's saying, \"Well we may delay it till next year.\" I'm here to predict, if they delay it till next year, it'll never happen. They did this in '16. They were going to delay it till next year, it never happened. He has the votes now. To not do this now with the votes is an intentional attempt to embarrass the President, where (ph) it's some self-serving declaration by Mitch McConnell and the couple of people that is opposing it.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Here's a name you may have heard recently. If you haven't, you should. Asia Bibi. Bibi is a Christian, a mother of five. She's a farm worker from Pakistan. Her saga began nine years ago when she went to get a drink of water and quarreled with several Muslim women who objected to drinking from the same cup as a Christian. A mob leader descended on Bibi. They insulted her and then they accused her of insulting the Prophet Mohammed. They assaulted her. Afterward, she was arrested. She was convicted of blasphemy. She was sentenced to death. Two weeks ago, Bibi got a break. The Pakistani Supreme Court decided there was not enough evidence that she had actually blasphemed anyone, so the Court vacated her conviction. But her ordeal is not over. Islamists in Pakistan have staged massive riots demanding that she be executed. One cleric put a bounty on her head. A lawyer who defended Bibi has fled the country but Bibi herself has been forbidden to leave. Her family has pleaded for asylum in the West. If their pleas are not answered, obviously, Bibi may be killed. Cases like this are why the West created asylum laws in the first place. But the United Kingdom is taking a pass, so far. The U.K. has refused to shelter Bibi despite the fact it has accepted countless other immigrants from that region or, more precisely, because it has accepted those immigrants. According to news accounts, the British government believes that accepting Asia Bibi would cause, quote, security concerns and unrest among certain sections of the community. Ponder that for a second. The United Kingdom gave us the rights that Americans take for granted, the core rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, all of those freedoms are now dying in Britain. In their place remains fear, a fear of offending the very people who have made it impossible to sustain those ancient freedoms. Well, not surprisingly, CNN has found a way to use this tragedy to attack the White House, somehow. A piece on CNN's website warns, quote, Trump, take notice. If you court religious extremists, you're in danger of letting mobs weaken democracy. Right. But there's another lesson to be learned here, a lesson that Trump has accepted and CNN has not. The kind of religious extremists willing to behead you for apostasy should not be allowed into your country. When we make room for him or people like him, we very soon run out of room for the values that made us proud to live here in the first place. That story is not yet over, by the way. It's developing, and we plan to follow it, and bring you updates, as we get them. But first, a weekend, which I hope all of us can enjoy. We'll be back Monday night 8 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. We hope to see you there. By the way, Mike Huckabee, up next, in for Sean. He'll be interviewing the White House Press Secretary whom he knows well. It's going to be a great show. Have a great weekend. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
