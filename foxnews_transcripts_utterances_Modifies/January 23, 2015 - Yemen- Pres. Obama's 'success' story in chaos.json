Now, Yemen is without a government. The prime minister of the cabinet resigned clearly and there is no president. On Sunday, what will happen next is, on Sunday, we will learn whether this resignation has been accepted or rejected. If it is accepted, then, effectively, the interim heads will be the speaker of the parliament for about 60 days.
