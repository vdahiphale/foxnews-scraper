      "sentences": "Well, yes, I kind of sounded the alarms during election time because I was on the ground and I was seeing the demographics change, the ground game change. You know, it's true that the Republicans are correct on the merits of this. The Washington Post has already destroyed the Democratic Party on this. When you have lost the Washington Post, then you know you are straight up lying.   Most of the businesses that are over here virtue signaling they don't care about the issue. They care about the people that are going to make them suffer from a business standpoint, right? They don't care about what's happening in Georgia. But, none of that really matters. Winning the argument on the merits doesn't matter if you don't win the people. And Republicans often fall in this trap. I've been watching the governor of Georgia all day -- all week, actually, talk about how he saw this coming from the left, that they purchased the domain weeks ago. Then why weren't you prepared for it?  I watched the guy say well, if they just read the bill. Most of the legislators don't even read the bill. Do you think the people are going to read the bill? So, I've seen this circling from Republicans and it is an often mistake that they make. You have to win the people. Now, Republicans and conservatives like Ben Shapiro would say, listen, facts don't care about your feelings. That is true. Based on the merits. But, guess what? Voters based on how they feel. And until Republicans win the people on the ground, they are going to continue to go through this circling squad when it comes to race.  Republicans always lose the battle when it comes to race because they don't win the battle of ideas. What do you mean by that? If Republicans dominate on the ground when it comes to school choice, if they dominate when it comes down to gun issues, education, the economy, then they won't have to worry about the race.  Look at Ron DeSantis in Florida? He has won people on school choice. He has won Black voters and Latino voters because, guess what? He won the battle of ideas. When they try to attack him on race, it doesn't work.",

      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "sentences": "Yes. It was the president speaking. And the language was very carefully selected after President Joe Biden went to Georgia and had a meeting with Stacey Abrams who was the one who has been pushing the narrative this is Jim Crow 2.0. When it comes to all these boycotts the Democrats own this.  Stacey Abrams is the one who came up with this hyperbolic language to describe this legislation. She is the one who has been leading the charge and lying about what is in the legislation. And Joe Biden simply amplified it during that interview on ESPN, and Jen Psaki when she was asked about it multiple times at the White House briefing, she also repeated the lies about what is in this legislation. Now, when it comes to the argument that Lawrence made about Republicans needing to win the people, on the issue of voter I.D., 80 percent of the country, nobody agrees on anything but 80 percent of the country according to Gallup agrees that voter identification, using it to vote is a valid requirement when it comes to casting your ballot.   And so, Republicans, I think, are not backing down on this. That's a good thing. They are standing up and saying we are not doing. This I love that Marco Rubio called out the commissioner of the MLB saying, well, Georgia is such a racist awful Jim Crow 2.0 state. I assume you'll be giving up your membership at Augusta where the Masters are held, because how could you support that? But of course, that would be a personal thing that he would have to give up. The bottom line is as soon as the MLB announced this the Atlanta Braves came out against it. Cobb County commissioners and tourism officials have come out against this and all the small businesses are going to suffer and the Democrats own this.  They drove the narrative. This is Jim Crow and then there is a reaction to their being Jim Crow laws back in place and now they are all surprised about there being a boycott. This is on Democrats, not Republicans.",

I really believe that in my heart but I think our system is set up where our politicians, whether they are Republicans of Democrats, are designed to make us not like each other so they can keep their grasp of money and power, they divide and conquer. Any thoughts on that? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I love Charles Barkley, I think is he really great. But I must say I think if Charles Barkley was a Major League Baseball player right now, he might be one of those players who wouldn't even go to an all-star game in Georgia given the current law. I mean, you think about Delta, Coke, other CEOs, they're not, you know, just reacting to nothing, they are not stupid people, and they care deeply about their bottom line. But they are indicating here that they don't want to be caught off guard again.   They saw what happened January 6th in terms of the attack on the Congress. They don't want to see democracy undermined and along with it the economic base of this country. They don't want to see that, Dana. I think they understand that's dangerous.  What Republican politicians are counting on is that people will not read the law, that people will allow them to get away with what I think of as just a naked power grab that allows them to strip power from the secretary of state, to take power from local election boards, and to give all the power to count votes and to certify elections to the Republican majority in the state Senate.

That's what they are doing.  This is, we know this is happening. The media has weaponized the accusation of racism on all potential behaviors, and corporations only want to make money so they will do anything. And I will tell you this, if I were the woke right now, I would go for everything. Because they have companies on the run. They should go to MLB and they should say look, a family of four cost 215 bucks for them to go see a baseball game. Why not make it more affordable? There should be different tiers of pricing for race. Right? Let's have Black families free tickets. Do you know what? MLB, they will probably go for it as a form of corporate reparations because they are terrified. Now, I do have a solution for this. But it makes too much sense. We need an Operation Warp Speed for free I.D.s. Because I asked this before last week. And nobody had an answer. Even up to today.  Do you know any people who don't have I.D.s?

You know, it's true that the Republicans are correct on the merits of this. The Washington Post has already destroyed the Democratic Party on this. When you have lost the Washington Post, then you know you are straight up lying. Most of the businesses that are over here virtue signaling they don't care about the issue. They care about the people that are going to make them suffer from a business standpoint, right? They don't care about what's happening in Georgia. But, none of that really matters. Winning the argument on the merits doesn't matter if you don't win the people. And Republicans often fall in this trap. I've been watching the governor of Georgia all day -- all week, actually, talk about how he saw this coming from the left, that they purchased the domain weeks ago. Then why weren't you prepared for it? I watched the guy say well, if they just read the bill. Most of the legislators don't even read the bill. Do you think the people are going to read the bill? So, I've seen this circling from Republicans and it is an often mistake that they make. You have to win the people. Now, Republicans and conservatives like Ben Shapiro would say, listen, facts don't care about your feelings. That is true. Based on the merits. But, guess what? Voters based on how they feel. And until Republicans win the people on the ground, they are going to continue to go through this circling squad when it comes to race. Republicans always lose the battle when it comes to race because they don't win the battle of ideas. What do you mean by that? If Republicans dominate on the ground when it comes to school choice, if they dominate when it comes down to gun issues, education, the economy, then they won't have to worry about the race. Look at Ron DeSantis in Florida? He has won people on school choice. He has won Black voters and Latino voters because, guess what? He won the battle of ideas. When they try to attack him on race, it doesn't work."

She is the one who has been leading the charge and lying about what is in the legislation. And Joe Biden simply amplified it during that interview on ESPN, and Jen Psaki when she was asked about it multiple times at the White House briefing, she also repeated the lies about what is in this legislation. Now, when it comes to the argument that Lawrence made about Republicans needing to win the people, on the issue of voter I.D., 80 percent of the country, nobody agrees on anything but 80 percent of the country according to Gallup agrees that voter identification, using it to vote is a valid requirement when it comes to casting your ballot. And so, Republicans, I think, are not backing down on this. That's a good thing. They are standing up and saying we are not doing. This I love that Marco Rubio called out the commissioner of the MLB saying, well, Georgia is such a racist awful Jim Crow 2.0 state. I assume you'll be giving up your membership at Augusta where the Masters are held, because how could you support that? But of course, that would be a personal thing that he would have to give up. The bottom line is as soon as the MLB announced this the Atlanta Braves came out against it. Cobb County commissioners and tourism officials have come out against this and all the small businesses are going to suffer and the Democrats own this. They drove the narrative. This is Jim Crow and then there is a reaction to their being Jim Crow laws back in place and now they are all surprised about there being a boycott. This is on Democrats, not Republicans."

Any thoughts on that? JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I love Charles Barkley, I think is he really great. But I must say I think if Charles Barkley was a Major League Baseball player right now, he might be one of those players who wouldn't even go to an all-star game in Georgia given the current law. I mean, you think about Delta, Coke, other CEOs, they're not, you know, just reacting to nothing, they are not stupid people, and they care deeply about their bottom line. But they are indicating here that they don't want to be caught off guard again. They saw what happened January 6th in terms of the attack on the Congress. They don't want to see democracy undermined and along with it the economic base of this country. They don't want to see that, Dana. I think they understand that's dangerous. What Republican politicians are counting on is that people will not read the law, that people will allow them to get away with what I think of as just a naked power grab that allows them to strip power from the secretary of state, to take power from local election boards, and to give all the power to count votes and to certify elections to the Republican majority in the state Senate.

And I will tell you this, if I were the woke right now, I would go for everything. Because they have companies on the run. They should go to MLB and they should say look, a family of four cost 215 bucks for them to go see a baseball game. Why not make it more affordable? There should be different tiers of pricing for race. Right? Let's have Black families free tickets. Do you know what? MLB, they will probably go for it as a form of corporate reparations because they are terrified. Now, I do have a solution for this. But it makes too much sense.

That's exactly what he is trying to do here by pushing the Democrats further to the left and I think, Dana, you had the governor of Tennessee on your program this morning. And he said, look, all this free money, everyone likes free money. Wall Street likes it, Moody's likes it, everyone likes it, but it's like a meth hit. And eventually if you do too much meth, all of your teeth fall out and your face starts falling off and you eventually die.

But it just goes to show that wherever race and politics invades, it creates a stifling and discontent. You must believe a certain assumption or you could be ruined. And he just decided, look, I'm at a certain point in my life where I don't have to do that. But it's also weird how canceled culture is now creating strange bedfellows, because all you got to do is be burned, and then you find friendship in other people that you didn't like. You know, I never really cared for Piers Morgan's opinions because his nonsense on guns used to drive me crazy.

You know, he's not starting out. I think that's one of the questions I keep getting when I do some of these book events is from people asking me, do you have any advice of what I can advise my college student who's about to enter the workforce of what they can do about cancel culture and the woke.

But this comes back to what Greg was talking about how he canceled himself because the -- what provoked that whole incident was I think it was the weatherman who said, you know, mental health issues are very real and in all societies, and you shouldn't be dismissive of people who say they're having a tough time and feeling the stress and need some help. And then he felt somehow that he was offended, that his opinion wasn't being welcomed and all this. I think you have to really go back and remember that it was about mental health."

I don't like how he's always commented on Americans' business. He can take that back to the U.K. But I think that is the principle about all of this. It's not about me agreeing with Piers Morgan.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "H. BIDEN",
      "utterance": "Not that I know of. But you know, read the book and you realize that I wasn't keeping tabs on possessions very well for about a four-year period of time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "All right, Dana, I'm going to test the questions later, but from a communication standpoint, why is he out there with a book, A? Number two, why is he out there doing interviews? Can they not control this guy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So, I think of it in two ways. One, you can imagine that you got through the -- you got through the election fine. Like, your dad is president. You're getting through your scandals fine. You are newly married again and there's a young baby in the picture. And, you know, in some ways, you could think, well, you know, that's pretty good given the tumultuous and difficult life that he's had with his addiction, and he writes about that very openly here. But on the other hand, I think that there's probably -- you can't tell him anything unless you read the book, or if -- I haven't read the book, but if you read these excerpts, or you read the reviews that are coming out, I mean, there was no controlling him at all. So, I also imagine that he wants to be able to be next to his father, and he wants to be able to be photographed. So, he writes this book hoping that when -- that will provide some sort of a buffer between him and his father and these scandals, so that he can say, I wrote about it in the book, I'm positive I'll be cleared, I'm moving on here. And maybe -- and that could work. A lot of the stuff that he said is -- like on the laptop, that's just not believable. But it also does remind all of us that the media and social media companies were really, really derelict in their duties last October."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, they are, Dana. And, Greg, part of my concern about this interview is no one decided to print out the e-mails and said, did you write this or did you lose your laptop, or there's plenty of questions. When did you lose your laptop? Is this you in this picture?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I wonder how -- what the ground rules behind these interviews were for and why any -- you know, there is a period interest in his life because it's gross. But if you have if you haven't -- if you've lived an interesting life, you know -- you may not know Hunter, but you know five of them, right? These are basically dopamine, compulsive -- dopamine addicted, compulsive people who put the consequences of your act -- of their actions on you, right? Dana, I have to take issue with your saying that he had a difficult -- his lifestyle was difficult. It wasn't that difficult, right? He got away with it. He's someone who was able to do what he wanted to do because of Biden privilege. Any Black kid, any poor White would be in prison for years for or they might even be dead, because we don't -- I mean, because clearly, Hunter had the best of everything. And let's not forget, again, that if this story had gone public, we might not have Biden as President. We might not have -- so there is another like nice little privilege. Juan, you shake your head, but there were polls."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Sure. I mean, if you're a rich kid coming from a prominent American family. But here's the other side to this. I think Republicans are trying to turn Hunter Biden into the next Benghazi. The problem with that, Lawrence is that, I think, most Americans, I think all of us on this panel say this is a deeply troubled person, drugs, alcohol, mental health issues, relationship issues. But you know, so we just know. It's like, you know, he's a son of a prominent family, always been compared to his more successful brother who's now deceased, and where he's trying to seek redemption in the public spotlight while his father is president. He's having a tough time. I don't think his scandals add up too much in terms of, you know, indictment of Joe Biden. I don't see that at all."

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "To Greg's -- to Greg's point Katie, Juan just set up that he's very troubled, that everyone knew that he was troubled, he's struggling. How did he get these jobs and I mean, the White House not know anything about this? I mean, he set it up. You're right, Juan. He was troubled. So, Katie, how does he get the job?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, first, I want to say that Benghazi was no small thing. Four Americans were killed as a result of that terrorist attack. So, that's no small thing. The second thing is he got the job because his last name was Biden, which Hunter Biden has admitted in interviews prior to writing his book. And the third thing is that we know this was Hunter's laptop. So, when he's asked about this, he gives all these excuses for it may be mine, it may not be mine. We know it's his. Fox News has done plenty of reporting on it. Mike Emanuel got the sheet with his signature on it. There's an eyewitness and then Tony Bobulinski sends all the information that came off of the laptop including all the text messages about the big guy being Joe Biden are true. So, the laptop is Hunter Biden's?"

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Yes. I wish they're giving me an interview. I have some questions. Anyway, straight ahead, is AOC all talk and no action? Why she's getting called out as one of the least effective members of Congress next on THE FIVE."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "She talks a big game on Twitter, but when it comes to actually getting stuff done, New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is coming up short. A new nonpartisan study says AOC was among the least effective members of the last Congress introducing 21 bills that went nowhere. I hate bills that go nowhere. All right, I'm going to say something, Lawrence, that I don't -- I think this study is bogus. It's like they're measuring the amount of blood in a - - in a sponge."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Yes. These people are dumb. And this is why we continue to lose. Look, AOC -- the Congress is a representation of the current population, right? AOC is not after the current population. She's after your kids and your grandkids and she's very effective at it. And the amount of people in the Progressive Caucus that exists now because of her going around the country to rally them, oh, she's been quite effective, and you should be afraid."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Wow. I think you gave her a big promotion there. I don't know if she'll ever be president, but we'll see. I mean, I think Lawrence is exactly right. I think you have to think about the measure. In terms of legislation, she's not as effective as some people who were in her incoming class. I'm thinking of Abigail Spanberger, Lauren Underwood from Illinois, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, they all have higher scores. But when you stop and think about it, it could be that we have an antiquated measure of what impact means because Twitter does have impact in terms of public opinion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Consequential. But I do think that actually this -- I think that she should assign her staff to do a better job of helping her get some things passed. You know, just basically have some solid base hits so she can continue doing what she's doing. That's what staff is for. They should help you on that front. But also, this isn't her fault. This is Nancy Pelosi's fault. Think of all the things that were held up so that President Trump wouldn't have a win, including COVID relief. So, you can't really pass bills if Nancy Pelosi is preventing you from doing so."
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Katie, what do you -- what do you make of her? I mean, at one hand -- on one hand, she doesn't pass the bill, but she's pushing the party -- she's pushing the party in the direction she desires, right or no?"

So, she may not have her name on the legislation, but she has pushed the party to the left, and she is a highly effective activist. And she's going after Democrats in their primaries to continue pushing the party to the left. So, don't underestimate her. She's not stupid."

Even though I've been doing Red Eye -- not Red Eye, THE FIVE and the \"GG SHOW\" for years, she didn't seem to mind. But now, it's really, really important. And as you could tell, I have to do something about this. But it's going to be very exciting. We're going to have some surprise guests, including somebody who might be at this table or this table. And we're going to have a live studio audience which is going to be very interesting, a much smaller -- a much smaller group. I have no idea what that's going to sound like, but I'm hoping that they laugh a lot. And if they don't, they will all die. No, I will -- but anyway, wish me luck. I think it's going to be great.
