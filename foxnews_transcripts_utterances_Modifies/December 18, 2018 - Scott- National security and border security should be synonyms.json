On multiple occasions federal judge Emmet Sullivan pressed Flynn and his lawyers on whether he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea of lying to federal agents, or challenge the circumstances surrounding the January 2017 FBI interview.  Flynn was discouraged from having a lawyer present and not formally warned that false statements could be prosecuted. A critical moment came when Flynn told the court that he knew with the FBI asked him about the Russian ambassador and a December 2016 conversation about sanctions that his lies would be criminal and punishable.   The judge responded, \"I can't hide my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense. Not only did you lied to FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\" He then asked, \"Are you continuing to accept responsibility for his false statements?\" Flynn replied, \"I am your honor.\" The judge seemed to chastise Flynn for making false statements in the West Wing including lies about the conversation to members of the Trump transition team and the Vice President and FBI.   \"You sold out your country,\" the judge added. Sullivan also questioned the basis of the case asking the special counsel's lawyer whether the Flynn phone call with the Russian ambassador was criminal. After a long pause, the government lawyer said it might be a violation of the Logan Act to which the judge seemed to laugh suggesting no one had ever been charged with that law criminalizing unauthorized contact by U.S. officials with foreign government. President Trump tweeted good luck to Flynn before the sentencing and his aides slammed Flynn's treatment by the FBI.",

We had an open investigation, criminal investigation, counterintelligence investigation.\" He added, \"There was no way I would discuss that with the President.\"   That's significant because the FBI director really has two hats -- one is building cases for prosecution and another is bearing a responsibility to warn if a government official poses, pardon me, a security threat.

They have to go back to Congress and ask that it be reprogrammed into a new purpose. Trump is clearly saying he's not going to do that. So we'll see, continuing fights.

On multiple occasions federal judge Emmet Sullivan pressed Flynn and his lawyers on whether he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea of lying to federal agents, or challenge the circumstances surrounding the January 2017 FBI interview. Flynn was discouraged from having a lawyer present and not formally warned that false statements could be prosecuted. A critical moment came when Flynn told the court that he knew with the FBI asked him about the Russian ambassador and a December 2016 conversation about sanctions that his lies would be criminal and punishable. The judge responded, \"I can't hide my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense. Not only did you lied to FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration.\" He then asked, \"Are you continuing to accept responsibility for his false statements?\" Flynn replied, \"I am your honor.\" The judge seemed to chastise Flynn for making false statements in the West Wing including lies about the conversation to members of the Trump transition team and the Vice President and FBI. \"You sold out your country,\" the judge added. Sullivan also questioned the basis of the case asking the special counsel's lawyer whether the Flynn phone call with the Russian ambassador was criminal. After a long pause, the government lawyer said it might be a violation of the Logan Act to which the judge seemed to laugh suggesting no one had ever been charged with that law criminalizing unauthorized contact by U.S. officials with foreign government. President Trump tweeted good luck to Flynn before the sentencing and his aides slammed Flynn's treatment by the FBI."

What we should think about is the fact this is really community justice reform bill. I say that because 76 percent of the time within five years the prisoner is committing another crime What this actually does is it takes the model of Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina and we reduce the number of crimes committed by folks who come back to the community so it improves community safety. So if you are for community safety going up, you're for this bill. If you're for the status quo you may not like this bill."

      "utterance": "Bret -- I was a kid who grew up in a single-parent household mired in poverty. What this bill does is it says to kids like me that there is reason to be more hopeful this year than ever because President Trump has decided to focus more resources in the private sector to descend upon communities that are distressed. This is not a new government program and there are no new bureaucrats.  This is simply redirecting private sector capital into areas where the average poverty rate is 31 percent and providing an incentive through the tax code to develop property, to open businesses so that people can walk to work and have a more even recovery that we have been experiencing."

There's real dollars which means that we'll have more development and frankly more development also means more revenue to the government because these areas are maybe blighted today will be developed tomorrow which means that the resources coming to the government will increase, resources going into the community will increase and employment rates which according -- because of President Trump, we have the best reporting on unemployment in the African-American community and the Hispanic community. Those numbers will even get better."

Fox 32 in Chicago with the death of two Chicago police officers. They died when they were struck by a South Shore Line train Monday evening as they chased an armed suspect. Police officials says a suspect was taken into custody and a gun recovered at that scene. Fox 2 in San Francisco as another effort to allow bars and some California cities to sell alcohol for an additional two hours until four in the morning is expected to be reintroduced today. That bill would be in effect in nine cities if passed. It would reportedly apply only to bars and restaurants in San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento and at six cities in southern California. And this is a live look at Detroit from our affiliate Fox 2. One of the big stories there tonight, General Motors saying it will cut 50 jobs at a suburban Detroit lithium ion battery assembly plant.

The bottom line, for all that was said about him being cornered or the FBI not acting right, he had the opportunity to take back his plea, and he said no, I want to move forward. Let's start there with the panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner. Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com. Byron, your thoughts on all this?"

      "utterance": "It was a weird day, and it was a bad day for Michael Flynn. He goes into court thinking that it's basically a formality. The prosecutor has recommended no time in jail for him, have a little meeting, say you're guilty again, walk out, no time in prison, move on with your life. Before it was over the judge had raised this question over whether Flynn had committed treason, which was outrageous, especially coming from a federal judge on the bench, had suggested maybe Flynn had sold out his country and that he was on unregistered foreign agent inside the White House, which he was not."

      "utterance": "Well, a judge can bring up uncharged conduct in a sentencing case, but to suggest that he was an unregistered foreign agent in the White House was false because even the prosecutor, I believe, corrected the judge to say that that had ended before. So by the end of the day it was this weird situation in which all of these things had been raised, it was almost like the craziness of the whole Trump debate moved into the courtroom for a day, and Michael Flynn future is completely uncertain now."

And then he suggested that he was guilty of things that he hadn't been charged with yet. So yes, very confusing, but the bottom line is this goes on until March, and that's a pretty long time."

      "utterance": "But again, the comments by James Comey to assert that someone maybe shouldn't be told that they are allowed and have a right to an attorney, that is not just alarming for Michael Flynn who is a high-profile person, that is alarming for everybody who's watching those comments and anybody who ever gets into any kind of situation where they have to discuss with the FBI. But going to the White House today and the comments that Sarah Sanders made about Michael Flynn, for the first time somewhat distancing themselves from him, saying there are concerns about what happened in the courtroom. My question is whether President Trump still stands by firing and asking for his resignation when he found out about these comments that were given to Vice President Mike Pence and then being inaccurate or, as we know now, lies. And so the White House continues to back Michael Flynn through the president as he tweet said this morning. But in terms of whether there is a consistency of what was said, that's still to be determined."

And the FBI and the Justice Department made one judgment to begin with up until about May of 2017, which was not to prosecute them.

And they leave the courtroom today with prison time possibly on the table with what the judge said. And I want to go back to what Byron said initially. The judge knows that this is one of the most high-profile cases that has been in the public atmosphere in a very long time, and for him to state things publicly when the room is packed full of reporters and everybody is watching of things that aren't true and then he has to walk them back, insinuating treason, is pretty reckless."

And you heard from Senator Scott earlier on this show that they believe they do have the votes to pass that. So that's one element. The other one is this possible government shutdown, a partial, and where the way forward is. Back with the panel. Mara, it doesn't seem like they are making a lot of headway, but I think the White House may think that they can move money around and still declare a win."

I think a little bit of progress is being made. The president did not say the word w-a-l-l today. He said \"border security.\" That's generally a sign of flexibility.

It's up to you guys to figure out what you're going to do and come to us with an offer, and then the president will decide what he's willing to work with. On the wall, of course that is an issue that is not just a current issue for the president but it's a campaign issue past and present that he is going to need to fulfill in some way. And when it comes down to this current situation, he is going to have to decide what he can live with in terms of governing and what he can keep up with on the campaign trail in terms of promises."

Just say the shell game as far as moving money around."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "First of all, remember where we started, which was getting $5 billion for the wall, which is just not going to happen right now. The idea of reprogramming the money is kind of an Obama-esque solution to this.  You basically go to all of the departments, look under the cushions for quarters and nickels and dimes and see what's there. Now, what Nancy Pelosi is saying is when Congress appropriates money for a specific purpose, the executive branch can't just spend it for something else. They have to go back to Congress and ask that it be reprogrammed into a new purpose. Trump is clearly saying he's not going to do that. So we'll see, continuing fights. One solution to this might be you said the w-a-l-l word. I heard Senator Durbin today speaking approvingly of a physical barrier at the border. If they can just avoid using the \"w\" word he might get some Democrats to support a 30-foot double fence, which is the equivalent of a wall."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "It's not just going back to 2013. You go back all the way to 2006 when Chuck Schumer along with a number of his fellow Democrats voted in favor of the fence act. There is no difference between necessarily the wall and a fence in terms of what they are talking about with security.  There are a lot of similarities here. I do think that Democrats are making a big mistake when they are calling President Trump's request for this money a slush fund, which, again, puts border security in the public sphere according to Democrats as something they're not taking seriously. And whether you are against a wall or whatever, the American people do believe in sovereignty and some kind of border security, and they know that there has to be some kind of fix when it comes to securing the southern border, and calling it a slush fund makes it not seem like a serious prospect for Democrats."

So I think it helps her. And the public is divided over this, and it does matter which words you use and polls and the like. The one thing you are going to hear is everybody talk about how much they support border security. And if you are a conservative or pro-wall, the more you hear people talk about electronic measures and surveillance and things like that, the more you view it as a dodge to trying to build an actual, physical barrier."

And again, let's not forget, this isn't just about border security, either.  This is about Congress changing the law so that asylum-seekers have a higher threshold because the Central American problem isn't necessarily a border barrier problem. It's also a problem with the current law which is not going to get changed."
