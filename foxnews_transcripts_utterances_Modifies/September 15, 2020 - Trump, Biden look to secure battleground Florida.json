Seven weeks today, what is sure to be a hard-fought battle with some of the most intense political warfare this country has ever seen, perhaps. It's another type of war -- warfare we begin with tonight, though the literal kind. And what the Trump administration hopes is a major step toward avoiding what the president calls blood in the sand.  Israel has established formal diplomatic relations with two of its Arab neighbors in what is supposed to be the first step towards securing Middle East peace, President Trump promising today more countries are lining up.  Chief White House correspondent John Roberts, starts us off live tonight from the North Lawn. Good evening, John.",

We've gotten out of that, we put maximum pressure on the Iranians. As a result, the Israelis and the Arab countries that have been harassed and molested by Iran for so many years had renewed confidence both in us as a partner but in each other. And so, we're seeing the direct fruits of -- in these peace agreements of the president's tough action on Iran. With respect to the Palestinians, the president has come forward with the most comprehensive plan for peace between Israel and Palestine ever. And that vision for Middle East peace that senior advisor Kushner and Secretary Pompeo, myself, and others have been working on throughout the region, gives the Palestinians an opportunity to double their GDP, it calls for a two-state solution.   To the Palestinian impasse, it provides territorial integrity for the Palestinians. It's a terrific offer for the -- terrific first offer for the Palestinians to come to the table. So, we really hope they take advantage of this, this opportunity as peace is breaking out to come to the table with the Israelis to be supported by their Arab brethren, and to reach a peace deal.  And it would be just terrific for their -- especially for the young Palestinians. I mean, this is an older government, there's a lot of corruption in the Palestinian authority. We'd like to see young Palestinians who want a great future and want to participate in technological boom that's taking place in Israel and across certain parts of the Middle East like UAE. We want them to be part of it and have a great future. The president loves them, and we want to see a great deal.",

I think he's going to leave office, hopefully, four years from now, and he's been known as a peacemaker.   And what he did is he took a radically different approach than the Washington foreign policy establishment would take. He recognized the facts on the ground in Israel and moved our embassy to Israel's capital, Jerusalem. Everyone knew it was the capital of Israel, every presidential candidate promised to do so, the president kept his promise, he recognized the Golan Heights. So, we developed a tremendous amount of political capital with Israel. At the same time, we got out of the terrible JCPOA, which had alienated our gulf Arab friends in Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, and Bahrain, and other country, Kuwait, other countries in the gulf. So, he developed tremendous credibility with the Gulf States, and he used that political capital that he gained with both Israel and with the Gulf States, which many politicians never want to do, but he used that political capital to bring them to the table and to really push for an agreement that would be great for both sides, and today we saw the fruits of it. So, I'm - - I couldn't be more prouder to serve under President Trump today, which is really a day -- a historic day of peace.",

And so, it -- as we're decimating al-Qaeda, but as these threats pop up or these threats emerge, the United States military which defends us every day and keeps us safe from another 9/11 is going to look to see where they pop up, and we're going to try and put out those brush fires wherever we can.  I'm not going to comment on specific operations, but there has been al- Shabaab as an affiliate of al-Qaeda in Somalia. They had -- they have been operating and have attacked civilians in Kenya. So, it's certainly an area that we're concerned about and we'd like to defeat them because what we want to do is bring our troops home. And so, that's what the president's been doing. We either get peace deals or we defeat the terrorists, and then, we can bring our troops back to the United States.",

The difference is that instead of conciliating Iran, as the previous administration tried to do, the Israelis and the Gulf Arabs want to confront and oppose and form a united front against Iranian. It really overturns decades of conventional wisdom about Middle East peace making, that the key was a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and then everything else, the recognition from Arab states, would flow from that.

But it's so -- Americans have been used to the Middle East being a quagmire for 25 years or so. And what we are seeing now, whether it's withdraw of troops or these peace deals really shows something that Bibi Netanyahu said today, which is that the Trump administration had found a new way toward doing peace, which has been addressed by the other panelists. But this does strongly refute what we were told about what was possible. We had a foreign policy establishment that said that it was wrong to move the embassy to Jerusalem, that it was wrong to get out of the JCPOA, that Kushner could not broker peace deals.

    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, with respect to Iran, the president was -- the one of the reason we had peace breaking out with the Arab and Israeli sides is because the president got out of the terrible JCPOA that gave the Iranians $150 billion in sanctions relief, and put them on path -- the pathway to a nuclear weapon. We've gotten out of that, we put maximum pressure on the Iranians. As a result, the Israelis and the Arab countries that have been harassed and molested by Iran for so many years had renewed confidence both in us as a partner but in each other. And so, we're seeing the direct fruits of -- in these peace agreements of the president's tough action on Iran. With respect to the Palestinians, the president has come forward with the most comprehensive plan for peace between Israel and Palestine ever. And that vision for Middle East peace that senior advisor Kushner and Secretary Pompeo, myself, and others have been working on throughout the region, gives the Palestinians an opportunity to double their GDP, it calls for a two-state solution. To the Palestinian impasse, it provides territorial integrity for the Palestinians. It's a terrific offer for the -- terrific first offer for the Palestinians to come to the table. So, we really hope they take advantage of this, this opportunity as peace is breaking out to come to the table with the Israelis to be supported by their Arab brethren, and to reach a peace deal. And it would be just terrific for their -- especially for the young Palestinians. I mean, this is an older government, there's a lot of corruption in the Palestinian authority. We'd like to see young Palestinians who want a great future and want to participate in technological boom that's taking place in Israel and across certain parts of the Middle East like UAE. We want them to be part of it and have a great future. The president loves them, and we want to see a great deal."

You know, at the beginning of the administration, a lot of your critics were saying this was not possible. Then, the embassy moved to Jerusalem was said to cause an explosion on the Arab street. John Kerry said that at the time. Yet, those things didn't happen, and this did happen. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, what I've said before is the president came into office and he was known as a dealmaker, and he'd written art of the deal. I think he's going to leave office, hopefully, four years from now, and he's been known as a peacemaker. And what he did is he took a radically different approach than the Washington foreign policy establishment would take. He recognized the facts on the ground in Israel and moved our embassy to Israel's capital, Jerusalem. Everyone knew it was the capital of Israel, every presidential candidate promised to do so, the president kept his promise, he recognized the Golan Heights. So, we developed a tremendous amount of political capital with Israel. At the same time, we got out of the terrible JCPOA, which had alienated our gulf Arab friends in Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, and Bahrain, and other country, Kuwait, other countries in the gulf. So, he developed tremendous credibility with the Gulf States, and he used that political capital that he gained with both Israel and with the Gulf States, which many politicians never want to do, but he used that political capital to bring them to the table and to really push for an agreement that would be great for both sides, and today we saw the fruits of it. So, I'm - - I couldn't be more prouder to serve under President Trump today, which is really a day -- a historic day of peace."

New York Times in the past few minutes had moved -- has moved a story which says the U.S. military seeks authority to expand counter-terrorism drone wars in Kenya. Saying that the U.S.-Africa command is pressing for new authorities to carry out drone strikes on al-Shabaab fighters, al-Qaeda linked, in portions of Kenya across from Somalia. Is that true?"

They're down to just a couple of 100 fighters in Afghanistan, the Pakistanis have helped us deal with al-Qaeda and Pakistan, we've taken out numerous leaders in Yemen, and we just took out one of the al-Qaeda affiliate leaders in Mali, in the Sahel in West Africa. And so, it -- as we're decimating al-Qaeda, but as these threats pop up or these threats emerge, the United States military which defends us every day and keeps us safe from another 9/11 is going to look to see where they pop up, and we're going to try and put out those brush fires wherever we can. I'm not going to comment on specific operations, but there has been al- Shabaab as an affiliate of al-Qaeda in Somalia. They had -- they have been operating and have attacked civilians in Kenya. So, it's certainly an area that we're concerned about and we'd like to defeat them because what we want to do is bring our troops home. And so, that's what the president's been doing. We either get peace deals or we defeat the terrorists, and then, we can bring our troops back to the United States."

I think the president is been very tough when it comes to Syria. There was a -- there was a caliphate, an ISIS caliphate the size of Great Britain that was spreading across Syria and Iraq when the president took office that had been ignored. The president, you know, took out that caliphate and then brought justice to al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. And so, we've -- and while doing all that, we've provided a protective screen and protected the Kurds who are in Syria. So, we've done a lot in Syria and it's a lot to be proud of in Syria. But again, I think I was serving as a hostage envoy when General Mattis relayed those conversations. And again, it's -- he's got a different approach than I do. I don't -- I don't talk about my conversations with the president. Apparently, General Mattis has a different view of that."

FOX News has also confirmed the Justice Department Inspector General is investigating the sentence reduction recommendation for political consultant and friend of President Trump, Roger Stone. Michael Horowitz is investigating whether political pressure played into the final recommendation of Stone's sentence of 40 months for lying to Congress and witness tampering. That was a significant change from the original seven to nine year recommendation. Four prosecutors quit the case over the lighter sentence, which was eventually commuted by the president. The November presidential election could come down to a single state, and perhaps a handful of seniors, independents, and Latinos in Florida.

Democratic leaders have publicly expressed concern the Biden campaign is under performing not just with traditionally conservative Cuban Americans but also with Venezuelan and Nicaraguan Americans. Trump's strength with Hispanic voters in Florida comes despite his harsh rhetoric on immigration. The Republican strategy is blunt -- target Biden as a socialist in a state where many people have fled socialist dictators."

We haven't seen a signing ceremony like that in almost three decades. What's it mean big picture? Let's bring in our panel and start there, Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Steve, it's a significant shift, a geopolitical shift in how to deal with the Middle East, and it is seeing success there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. There is no question about it. This is a big deal, and Donald Trump and the Trump administration -- You see the shifting dynamics behind the scenes. The things that have been private, the kinds of discussions in the basement have been taking place in private between Israel and the UAE, between Israel and Bahrain, facilitated by the United States, not exclusively, but certainly helpfully have been taking place for a long time. But it's a big deal to play this out in the open. And I expect the president is right we he says that we'll soon see others follow. We know that Mohammed bin Salman has been making noises in this direction privately certainly for a couple. He's been hinting at this publicly I think for the same amount of time. And it's an accomplishment. I wish the Democrats could get beyond sort of petty partisanship on this, Nancy Pelosi calling this a distraction, the Obama bros shrugging their shoulders and wishing that it hadn't happened because they invested so heavily in a relationship with Iran. This is really a repudiation of Obama administration's Iran policy as much as anything else."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER",
      "utterance": "With respect to Iran, one of the reason we have peace breaking out with the Arab-Israeli sides is because the president got out of terrible JCPOA that the Israelis and the Arab countries that have been harassed and molested by Iran for so many years had renewed confidence both in us as a partner but in each other. And so we're seeing the direct fruits in these peace agreements."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "They have essentially turned it on its head. The Obama-Biden thought Iran was the key to the Middle East. The president started his foreign trips in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": In a way Iran still is the key to the Middle East, Bret. The difference is that instead of conciliating Iran, as the previous administration tried to do, the Israelis and the Gulf Arabs want to confront and oppose and form a united front against Iranian. It really overturns decades of conventional wisdom about Middle East peace making, that the key was a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and then everything else, the recognition from Arab states, would flow from that. This shows that the fundamental schism, conflict in the Middle East is really between Shia and Sunni. These states are all Sunni dominated states who are terrified of Iran, and in effect seeking U.S. and, quietly, Israeli support or protection against that larger threat."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Iran has not been a good player in the Middle East for a while, has been funding terrorist organizations all over the region, and this changes that dynamic. The question is whether countries, whether it's Gulf states or European countries waiting this, are waiting 49 days, Mollie, to see what happens in this election and if President Trump wins again. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It's very interesting that these peace deals are being announced before the election. But it's so -- Americans have been used to the Middle East being a quagmire for 25 years or so. And what we are seeing now, whether it's withdraw of troops or these peace deals really shows something that Bibi Netanyahu said today, which is that the Trump administration had found a new way toward doing peace, which has been addressed by the other panelists. But this does strongly refute what we were told about what was possible. We had a foreign policy establishment that said that it was wrong to move the embassy to Jerusalem, that it was wrong to get out of the JCPOA, that Kushner could not broker peace deals. And what we're seeing really is showing that everything that these people dreamed or thought possible, it's going very much against them. And also isolating Iran is showing that the Obama administration played a role, too, by having this bad deal that people could react against."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, it was interesting hear General Jack Keane today saying he has not seen Iran back on its heels like this in a long, long time. Let's turn now to domestic politics. The Monmouth poll out of Florida, which is why everybody is focused on Florida. Registered voters, 50-45 Joe Biden. This is Monmouth out recently. Highly likely turnout 50-45, low likely turnout 49-46. Florida looks like, Steve, it's going to be at least one ground zero in a number of key battleground states."

    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Yes, it sure does. And the Trump administration and Trump campaign have been crowing about favorable polling among Latinos in Florida, and I think rightfully so. It's still a competitive state. I think Joe Biden's campaign looks at Florida and says we'd love to have Florida if we can get it but we don't absolutely need it. I think the Trump administration, on the other hand, really needs to get to 270. And that's why I think you're seeing an intensified effort there. That's why you have seen President Trump say like mail-in voting in Florida, they know how to do this down in Florida where he's been skeptical elsewhere. I think they look at it as a pretty key state to their victory."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and we should point out Joe Biden is down in Florida right now waiting on an event. We could look at that live and I think you will probably see that next hour when it happens. We thought we'd be able to dip in at some point. Chuck, these Biden events look a lot different than Trump events. The president was on with \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" today. Here is what he said about Joe Biden."

      "utterance": "This is all a set-up, really, to the first debate, which is going to be quite something, moderated by Chris Wallace, our own Chris Wallace, September 29th. But it seems like the president continues to lower the bar, doesn't he, for Joe Biden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, he's coming right out -- he's coming right up to the edge of saying let's face it, that Joe Biden is too old and decrepit to be president. And he is creating very low expectations for the debate performance. It could be a strategic mistake. I strongly agree with Steve that Florida is a state Biden would love but he can win without. Not so much Trump. Trump really has to have it, and I think that's part of the reason they are kind of promoting the idea that he is gaining on Biden. Polls have been very misleading historically recently in Florida, generally overstating Democratic chances. So I think Biden's people are going to be nervous when it shows them up by two points because they know that hasn't been a safe margin in the past for people like Bill Nelson or Andrew Gillum."

Polls showed that they would win both the governor's and Senate race, and Republicans ended up winning both of those. So I think there is a reason why Democrats seem like they are very nervous about losing Florida, dealing with enthusiasm problems down there that are pretty hard to ignore."
