      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is a special edition of THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. All right, if it's Friday, you know, I'm going to ask the question, How low can he go? As in Biden in those polls measuring his job performance, of course. I knew AP-NORC poll has Biden's approval at 39 percent, the lowest of his presidency. And among Democrats, his approval is that just 73 percent when for all of 2021, it never dropped below 82. Among Hispanics, in a new Quinnipiac poll, he's at 26. Now, a key takeaway from the AP piece is that only two in 10 Americans say our country is on the right track. Who are the two? What's most striking are that some of the comments from Americans about Biden's performance, they're stunning. One saying, \"I don't know how much worse it can get.\" Or \"he hasn't delivered on any of the promises.\" His policies are destroying the economy. Now one of the more charitable ones was, \"I think he's tired.\" Of course, all of these remarks are on point. Americans are not stupid. They see what's happening to the family budget, they feel it. They know how bad the crime is. They see food and bus tickets given to the illegals as they debate themselves even having a family vacation this summer. And the overwhelming majority of Americans tell Quinnipiac they're seeing what we've been warning you about, an economic recession is just around the corner. And finally, we wondered when this has started happening. Biden's boosters are even seeing the writing on the wall.",

They wouldn't have waived off Larry Summers on the inflation issue a year ago. They wouldn't have put us deeper in debt with COVID and stupid Build Back Better spending. They certainly wouldn't have killed our energy independence. And they wouldn't be turning American against American on race. They wouldn't have let our borders go to the cartels. They wouldn't have set in motion the policies that are causing so much pain and suffering to those who deserve at least.

Two, the 39 percent job approval. People don't like the President. And three the wrong track. People think America is in bad shape. All of this lower the whole litany of what you just walk through, adds up to a democracy that breathes. And the way we breathe, is we go to the polls, and the Democrats are in for a massive, massive, historically large repudiation of their policies. And I predict to you, it's going to stretch so far and deep into safe Democratic seats that watch Washington State, where Patty Murray is likely going to lose to Tiffany Smiley if these trends continue.

And I think, you know, the American people are really forgiving. If you make a mistake as a politician, and you repent, and you change your ways, they'll forgive you for it. But Joe Biden has stacked his White House with so many left wing believers on open borders, attack oil and gas, you know, let's reimagine law enforcement. He stacked them so much, he has no one to say, help me change course. How do we get on a new path? And by the way, this is not complicated stuff.

I want as much of that as possible. But the fact is, you can only squeeze the apple so much to get enough juice. And there's just not that much in wind and solar to generate, so that's why you need oil and gas. So the Democrats need high gas prices. And what their problem is, they see the results on middle class, low income consumers, and that's why they're driving them into the Republican Party. So the Democrats are in a squeeze of their own making, but that's why they can't acknowledge they need gas prices to be high.",

But I thought it was interesting. Again, it was confirmed on the stand, under oath that Hillary Clinton was brought up to speed on this and actually gave the green light to move forward with shooting out this this bogus story about Donald Trump and Russia. And again, what's sad about that is Donald Trump last three years, he was fighting the media and these attacks as opposed to leading the country and trying to make us great again, and he still did a wonderful job.

Just to give you an idea, a Border Patrol report said more than 1,800 illegal crossings in just 24 hours. Those are some huge numbers for this sector. And we want to show you what that looks like. Take a look at this video. You mentioned this group right off the top. This was a single massive group of 167 we witnessed cross illegally and Eagle Pass this morning at around 8:00 am. Mostly all single adults. Not really those massive family units like we were seeing last summer. Typically, these have been mostly Cubans, Venezuelans, Colombians, and Peruvians. But the Eagle Pass area has been getting hammered by these big groups. We saw six or seven of them last week alone. You take a look at the second piece of video also of that same group. From the ground perspective, the Del Rio sector, just since October 1st has had more than a quarter million illegal crossings. Those numbers are up about 150 percent over the same time last year and that has been with Title 42 in place. Also want to show you this video. Take a look at this. This was last night in Brackettville. We were embedded with Texas DPS, they were chasing a human smuggler. Boom! All of a sudden illegal immigrants start bailing out of the vehicle and running off into the brush in an effort to evade. The driver stayed behind, as did some of the men who are hiding in the bed of that pickup truck. You'll see our camera get right up on them. Those men decided it wasn't worth it to run. But this is something we've been seeing constantly down here at the border. That driver, that smuggler was a woman from Florida, a U.S. citizen. We have been seeing U.S. citizens heavily recruited down here to the border to participate in human smuggling. With Texas DPS telling us since they launched Operation Lonestar last year, they have been involved in more than 2,000 of these pursuits. Laura, we'll send it back to you.",

Now remember, it's been the subject of intense controversy over the last few years, after one of the league's top owners was criticized after he tweeted a rather innocuous comment in support of a free Hong Kong and then LeBron James piped in and other people. Anyway. A new report from ESPN reveals just how much though that the owners have at stake in China. 40 principal owners of teams have $10 billion in Chinese investments. First to Miami Heat owner Micky Arison. He has more than $375 million tied up in China through his team and his business, Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise operator. Then Sacramento Kings Co-Owner, Paul Jacobs' total China exposure is at about $140 million, more than 30 percent of his net worth, mostly due to his investments in Qualcomm. Then Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera's exposure in China is about $369 million through his company Ubiquiti. That's a wireless equipment manufacturer whose operations are based primarily in Southern China. Now Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta is the President and CEO of Landry's which operates 10 restaurants in China, they generate an estimated $57 million in annual sales. His estimated total exposure to China is over $160 million. And the biggest name of them all is Charlotte Hornets owner, Michael Jordan, who donated $100 million to social justice efforts here in the United States, remember, he has an estimated $85 million wrapped up in China. Now could that be part of the reason we're hesitant to criticize China, as we criticize the United States?

Let's start with the big numbers showing that since 2020 public schools across America are down 1.2 million students. And remember, school funding is tied to enrollment, so public schools are simultaneously losing students and hemorrhaging money. And for midsize cities like Denver, Albuquerque and Oakland, California, where funding is not nearly as robust as in the bigger districts, the cuts mean schools are combining classrooms, laying off teachers and shutting down schools all together. But the bigger cities is where the numbers are stunning. New York City, the nation's largest school district lost some 50,000 students in the past two years. And get this in Los Angeles Unified, the nation's second largest district, enrollment is expected to plummet by 30 percent over the next decade. Even Orange County, California where parents have fought for years to get their kids into the public schools is seeing a significant drop. Now there are no major studies yet showing an exact cause for the drop in the number of public students. But experts say there is one very prevalent common denominator and it appears to be the COVID school closures and mask mandates. Even lifelong public school people are moving their kids to private and Catholic schools. Watch.",

With liberal Republican Larry Hogan as Governor of Maryland instead of someone like, I don't know, Ron DeSantis, well, the education establishment in the state is intent on talking to students as young as pre-K, about sex and gender. New guidance in the state for high school students instructs teachers to examine the impact of gender expression and gender identity on members of marginalized communities and analyze the intersectionality of race, culture, gender for members of those communities. It also advises teaching kindergarteners, how to recognize a range of ways that people express their identity and gender. And if you're a parent of a student from pre-K to third grade, by the way, and you think you can opt out, there is no opt out. And that's not the only state it's happening. In Illinois, a school district is teaching preschoolers about sexual orientation. But don't worry, they don't learn about being transgender until kindergarten. In the first grade, they introduce new pronouns and social justice standards. Joining us now are two parents who have been on the front lines protecting our kids and advancing real excellence in education. Asra Nomani, Senior Contributor at the Federalist, and Ian Prior, former DOJ Deputy of Public Affairs and Senior Advisor for America First Legal. Asra, we'll start with you.

The group called \"Secure MI Vote\" is running a petition drive to bring voter I.D. and other commonsense security provisions to the electoral process there. It just makes sense. The effort is in response to the Zucker-buck, Mark Zuckerberg's money, nearly $17 million of which were poured into Michigan to fund voter turnout efforts last time, and of course, only and Democrat nominated areas. Much of the money went to Detroit where Biden got 94 percent of the vote. Nothing to see there, I'm sure. That's the city, of course, that cost the Republicans a Senate seat as well. But the swampy development as reported by \"The Washington Free Beacon\" is that Andy Blunt, who is the son of the Republican senator in leadership, Roy Blunt, has joined forces with the George Soros group called the 1630 Fund to spend $2.5 million to pay workers not to work on the petition drive. Can you believe this? Swamped in a swamp, that's what we're going to say. Joining me to discuss this tonight is Harmeet Dhillon, CEO and founder of the Center for American Liberty. Before we get into these establishment, typical swamp tactics, Harmeet, I understand we are down to the final two weeks of this petition drive. How many signatures do you need?",

And so one of the guys who got this money got a payoff by this Republican bagman fronting for Soros money, blew the whistle on it a few weeks ago, and so there is a pending complaint about it, and that's how we learned that that's how Soros is spending their money. So in addition to giving money to try to do counter-petitioning, they are actually trying to constrict the supply of people to do this work, which I believe is all kinds of legal violations and they are in a heap of trouble. And the worst part about this, Laura, as you mention, is that it's a Republican front. It's a company that is called Ground Game Political Solutions, which is a division of Husch Blackwell Strategies, which is a mild-mannered midwestern, middle American outfit.

All right, if it's Friday, you know, I'm going to ask the question, How low can he go? As in Biden in those polls measuring his job performance, of course. I knew AP-NORC poll has Biden's approval at 39 percent, the lowest of his presidency. And among Democrats, his approval is that just 73 percent when for all of 2021, it never dropped below 82. Among Hispanics, in a new Quinnipiac poll, he's at 26. Now, a key takeaway from the AP piece is that only two in 10 Americans say our country is on the right track. Who are the two? What's most striking are that some of the comments from Americans about Biden's performance, they're stunning. One saying, \"I don't know how much worse it can get.\" Or \"he hasn't delivered on any of the promises.\" His policies are destroying the economy. Now one of the more charitable ones was, \"I think he's tired.\" Of course, all of these remarks are on point. Americans are not stupid. They see what's happening to the family budget, they feel it. They know how bad the crime is. They see food and bus tickets given to the illegals as they debate themselves even having a family vacation this summer. And the overwhelming majority of Americans tell Quinnipiac they're seeing what we've been warning you about, an economic recession is just around the corner. And finally, we wondered when this has started happening. Biden's boosters are even seeing the writing on the wall."

And both are now badly compromised because of the policies and decisions made by Biden and the Democrats. After a botched withdrawal, a disgusting withdrawal in Afghanistan, now a prolonged proxy war in Ukraine, that slow pivot to Asia and a rising China, our allies and our adversaries see America at - its adrift. And can you blame them? How does anyone expect our enemies to fear us if so many of our own elites seem embarrassed by our history, disdainful of our founding and disgusted, frankly, by our traditions.

They wouldn't have waived off Larry Summers on the inflation issue a year ago. They wouldn't have put us deeper in debt with COVID and stupid Build Back Better spending. They certainly wouldn't have killed our energy independence. And they wouldn't be turning American against American on race. They wouldn't have let our borders go to the cartels. They wouldn't have set in motion the policies that are causing so much pain and suffering to those who deserve at least. Joining me now is Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary, Fox News contributor and Sean Duffy, former Wisconsin Congressman, and Fox News Contributor. Ari, these numbers, we keep talking about this. It seems like every time you come on it's another, \"How low can he go question.\" But the 39 percent approval he has now and the 26 percent, among Latino voters, where is this all headed?"

      "utterance": "Well, it's where it's always headed in a democracy, and that means to the people, to election day. And that's exactly how it should work. Look, there are three devastating numbers for Joe Biden. One is the fact that it's 2022, a midterm presidential election. History says, throw the bums out, that's what happens to both parties. Two, the 39 percent job approval. People don't like the President. And three the wrong track. People think America is in bad shape. All of this lower the whole litany of what you just walk through, adds up to a democracy that breathes. And the way we breathe, is we go to the polls, and the Democrats are in for a massive, massive, historically large repudiation of their policies. And I predict to you, it's going to stretch so far and deep into safe Democratic seats that watch Washington State, where Patty Murray is likely going to lose to Tiffany Smiley if these trends continue. The history shows there's always a safe incumbent or two who get swept out in this storm, and a storm is coming."

But they go back to COVID, because they actually aren't as bad with the American people and how they handled COVID, though, I think everyone here on the panel agrees that it was disastrous. And I think, you know, the American people are really forgiving. If you make a mistake as a politician, and you repent, and you change your ways, they'll forgive you for it. But Joe Biden has stacked his White House with so many left wing believers on open borders, attack oil and gas, you know, let's reimagine law enforcement. He stacked them so much, he has no one to say, help me change course. How do we get on a new path? And by the way, this is not complicated stuff.

But, Ari, to this point, Ted Cruz said earlier this week, something I've been saying for a while, that this is their policy, high gas prices is what they've wanted for decades. They hated our low gas prices."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And here's why. It's simple. If you want wind and solar to replace oil and gas, wind and solar cannot compete with oil and gas. Economically, it's impossible. It's anti-science. It's anti-science of economics. So you need oil and gas to be at sky high prices. So you can substitute more wind substitute more solar. Look, I'm all for wind and solar. I want as much of that as possible. But the fact is, you can only squeeze the apple so much to get enough juice. And there's just not that much in wind and solar to generate, so that's why you need oil and gas. So the Democrats need high gas prices. And what their problem is, they see the results on middle class, low income consumers, and that's why they're driving them into the Republican Party. So the Democrats are in a squeeze of their own making, but that's why they can't acknowledge they need gas prices to be high."

But I thought it was interesting. Again, it was confirmed on the stand, under oath that Hillary Clinton was brought up to speed on this and actually gave the green light to move forward with shooting out this this bogus story about Donald Trump and Russia. And again, what's sad about that is Donald Trump last three years, he was fighting the media and these attacks as opposed to leading the country and trying to make us great again, and he still did a wonderful job. But I remember during those times, I would have been in the corner cowering at all the incoming attacks. And I give Donald Trump credit that he stood up and punch back and fought back--"

Just to give you an idea, a Border Patrol report said more than 1,800 illegal crossings in just 24 hours. Those are some huge numbers for this sector. And we want to show you what that looks like. Take a look at this video. You mentioned this group right off the top. This was a single massive group of 167 we witnessed cross illegally and Eagle Pass this morning at around 8:00 am. Mostly all single adults. Not really those massive family units like we were seeing last summer. Typically, these have been mostly Cubans, Venezuelans, Colombians, and Peruvians. But the Eagle Pass area has been getting hammered by these big groups. We saw six or seven of them last week alone. You take a look at the second piece of video also of that same group. From the ground perspective, the Del Rio sector, just since October 1st has had more than a quarter million illegal crossings. Those numbers are up about 150 percent over the same time last year and that has been with Title 42 in place. Also want to show you this video. Take a look at this. This was last night in Brackettville. We were embedded with Texas DPS, they were chasing a human smuggler. Boom! All of a sudden illegal immigrants start bailing out of the vehicle and running off into the brush in an effort to evade. The driver stayed behind, as did some of the men who are hiding in the bed of that pickup truck. You'll see our camera get right up on them. Those men decided it wasn't worth it to run. But this is something we've been seeing constantly down here at the border. That driver, that smuggler was a woman from Florida, a U.S. citizen. We have been seeing U.S. citizens heavily recruited down here to the border to participate in human smuggling. With Texas DPS telling us since they launched Operation Lonestar last year, they have been involved in more than 2,000 of these pursuits. Laura, we'll send it back to you."

Now remember, it's been the subject of intense controversy over the last few years, after one of the league's top owners was criticized after he tweeted a rather innocuous comment in support of a free Hong Kong and then LeBron James piped in and other people. Anyway. A new report from ESPN reveals just how much though that the owners have at stake in China. 40 principal owners of teams have $10 billion in Chinese investments. First to Miami Heat owner Micky Arison. He has more than $375 million tied up in China through his team and his business, Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise operator. Then Sacramento Kings Co-Owner, Paul Jacobs' total China exposure is at about $140 million, more than 30 percent of his net worth, mostly due to his investments in Qualcomm. Then Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera's exposure in China is about $369 million through his company Ubiquiti. That's a wireless equipment manufacturer whose operations are based primarily in Southern China. Now Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta is the President and CEO of Landry's which operates 10 restaurants in China, they generate an estimated $57 million in annual sales. His estimated total exposure to China is over $160 million. And the biggest name of them all is Charlotte Hornets owner, Michael Jordan, who donated $100 million to social justice efforts here in the United States, remember, he has an estimated $85 million wrapped up in China. Now could that be part of the reason we're hesitant to criticize China, as we criticize the United States?

And it doesn't matter, you know, human rights violations happening - well, all around the world, we have to call them out like it is, you know. And moral matters - for the NBA moral matters until money or business are involved. So that is the one thing that was breaking my heart. And all these owners - there are 50 NBA owners - are making profit off of slave labor. So we have to, call them out, because they love to sit down and give us this all the social justice talk to us, but in reality they're scared.

But in China, of course, his company partners with other companies that are blacklisted by the US government for supporting a campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention and high tech surveillance through state of the art racial profiling.

Let's start with the big numbers showing that since 2020 public schools across America are down 1.2 million students. And remember, school funding is tied to enrollment, so public schools are simultaneously losing students and hemorrhaging money. And for midsize cities like Denver, Albuquerque and Oakland, California, where funding is not nearly as robust as in the bigger districts, the cuts mean schools are combining classrooms, laying off teachers and shutting down schools all together. But the bigger cities is where the numbers are stunning. New York City, the nation's largest school district lost some 50,000 students in the past two years. And get this in Los Angeles Unified, the nation's second largest district, enrollment is expected to plummet by 30 percent over the next decade. Even Orange County, California where parents have fought for years to get their kids into the public schools is seeing a significant drop. Now there are no major studies yet showing an exact cause for the drop in the number of public students. But experts say there is one very prevalent common denominator and it appears to be the COVID school closures and mask mandates. Even lifelong public school people are moving their kids to private and Catholic schools. Watch."

With liberal Republican Larry Hogan as Governor of Maryland instead of someone like, I don't know, Ron DeSantis, well, the education establishment in the state is intent on talking to students as young as pre-K, about sex and gender. New guidance in the state for high school students instructs teachers to examine the impact of gender expression and gender identity on members of marginalized communities and analyze the intersectionality of race, culture, gender for members of those communities. It also advises teaching kindergarteners, how to recognize a range of ways that people express their identity and gender. And if you're a parent of a student from pre-K to third grade, by the way, and you think you can opt out, there is no opt out. And that's not the only state it's happening. In Illinois, a school district is teaching preschoolers about sexual orientation. But don't worry, they don't learn about being transgender until kindergarten. In the first grade, they introduce new pronouns and social justice standards. Joining us now are two parents who have been on the front lines protecting our kids and advancing real excellence in education. Asra Nomani, Senior Contributor at the Federalist, and Ian Prior, former DOJ Deputy of Public Affairs and Senior Advisor for America First Legal. Asra, we'll start with you.

They're saying, you don't get to know about your child's gender identity, unless the child gives us permission to tell you. Here you have in Maryland, where it's - OK, if you're up until third grade, you can't opt out. But after fourth grade, you can. Well that's an equal protection issue right there. And what is the compelling government interest that they need to have? They won't tell you.

The effort is in response to the Zucker-buck, Mark Zuckerberg's money, nearly $17 million of which were poured into Michigan to fund voter turnout efforts last time, and of course, only and Democrat nominated areas. Much of the money went to Detroit where Biden got 94 percent of the vote. Nothing to see there, I'm sure. That's the city, of course, that cost the Republicans a Senate seat as well. But the swampy development as reported by \"The Washington Free Beacon\" is that Andy Blunt, who is the son of the Republican senator in leadership, Roy Blunt, has joined forces with the George Soros group called the 1630 Fund to spend $2.5 million to pay workers not to work on the petition drive. Can you believe this? Swamped in a swamp, that's what we're going to say. Joining me to discuss this tonight is Harmeet Dhillon, CEO and founder of the Center for American Liberty.

We have been on pace to collect these signatures, volunteers and paid workers in Michigan, up until the time that this effort developed to actually, literally pay people off to not participate. And so one of the guys who got this money got a payoff by this Republican bagman fronting for Soros money, blew the whistle on it a few weeks ago, and so there is a pending complaint about it, and that's how we learned that that's how Soros is spending their money. So in addition to giving money to try to do counter-petitioning, they are actually trying to constrict the supply of people to do this work, which I believe is all kinds of legal violations and they are in a heap of trouble. And the worst part about this, Laura, as you mention, is that it's a Republican front. It's a company that is called Ground Game Political Solutions, which is a division of Husch Blackwell Strategies, which is a mild-mannered midwestern, middle American outfit.
