      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Kimberly Guilfoyle, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters and Dana Perino -- this is \"The Five.\" So as students plan gun violence protests, let's be honest: no one trusts each other in this debate. If you say \"sensible gun control,\" others hear code for \"you're taking away my guns.\" If you say \"protect my gun rights,\" others will call you a murderer.  I say let's make it simple:  We need to harden soft targets. Big companies do this already -- they're surrounded by guards. So should schools. It's a trillion-dollar industry waiting to happen.  Bring back psychiatric hospitals. Right now, they house less than one-tenth of the people they did 60 years ago. A Florida agency looked at this latest creep in 2016, but they let him go. Do you want to bet it was based on space, that he wasn't worth a bed? We also must slash the media footprint of killers and reduce the appeal for infamy. Creeps obsess over the fame of previous creeps. It's their drug. Let's take away that drug.  We need to think offensively. Instead of asking how do we rig the system to stop perps from getting guns? Ask, how do we tag the perps and keep them from getting guns? We want to get the bad eggs, not the law-abiding ones. You see the difference? Florida was preventable. The fiend was all red flags, perfect for a database of nuts and perps who shouldn't get guns. This guy had no violent felonies, so a civil tag is what could have nailed him. Based on testimony from cops, students and school officials, a judge could then issue a simple court order.  Rather than defensively cast a wide net that catches tons of fish we don't want, you tag the right people who are placed into one single database along with violent felons. If you're in it, no gun. And if you violate the database, that's mandatory prison time.   This isn't just see something, say something, it's actually do something. So by all means protest, but it won't do much when you're targeting the haystack while letting the needle slip through. We learned about the FBI screw-up, Kimberly.",

That's the only way we're going to get better. Unless you do these kinds of thoughtful, deliberate and deep probing investigations to figure out how we can do it better for the next time because this cannot continue to happen, especially when someone is basically screaming out for help, presenting these problems and having this violent ideation and saying that they want to become a school shooter, they have the weapons, they have the means and ability to do so. They go in front of a mental health professional. The FBI has them on the screen.

That while there's been a huge focus on the Mueller probe, that if you go back to now we know in 2014 that was one when Russia started this operation to come after us in our election in all sorts of different ways, this is at the same time that they're invading Ukraine. And so, the Obama administration would say we're really focused on the fact that we're trying to protect the actual people. They don't get ahead of this one. And I think that, you know, history will have to decide what it will on that front. There are a lot of people on the Democratic side very frustrated that not more was done. I look back and think I don't know what more could have been done in the middle of it because I understand the sensitivity about not getting in the middle of the election and acting like the Russians were trying to help President Trump, and then it would look like Obama was trying to help Hillary. So that's another reason why there are a lot of people that want Mueller to finish his investigation at least in the late spring because the later you get, then you're getting involved in another election, this time the midterm elections of 2018. On the other front, I think that talking about the FBI being distracted by doing too much on Russia and that's why it couldn't prevent 17 children from being murdered, a fine line for a pundit. Not a good one for a president. If the president believes that the Mueller indictment of the 13 Russians was a good news for him just let that sit.

They will try because the Russians do not play favorites. They play the hand that they have. Right now, they were going after the Dems and the RNC, but it was easier on the Dems. The Russians realized they're 1/8 the size that they use to be. It's not about territory. It's about broadband.  So this to my more scary point, people bring up paper ballots. We talked about this, to combat this intrusion. We don't have that remedy for our banking system. We don't have paper ballots for our banking system or for our electric grid. So when somebody hacked that stuff, then it's over. That's what scares me. It's not about -- the marginal attacks on our election system, we do that already. I mean, we do that to ourselves.

We sent missiles right on their doorstep to Syria. And, you know, we slapped some sanctions on them. So going back, I think we're overstating the whole issue when it comes to this interference. They spent $40,000 on Facebook ads. Hillary and Trump spent $81 million. And if you talk about the propaganda that was injected into this election, think about the corruption that really happens. CNN and Donna Brazile gave information, questions to Hillary beforehand. NBC leaked the locker room talk tape. There was a lot of really dirty stuff that went on through the media and through Hillary. The dossier I would argue is more impactful than a few Russian bots on twitter. That infected the entire mainstream media. They reported that Trump was a traitor for the last three months of the election. So, just imagine if Donald Trump had paid a foreign agent millions of dollars to bring Russian dirt and pump it into Fox News and smear Hillary as a traitor, he would have been the biggest colluder ever.

But he is, when it comes to protecting himself, he's the only president to fight back against the biased media.

I don't mind if CBS is tough on Trump, but they're only tough on Trump. They don't treat people of different parties the same. I don't care if you're tough on Republicans but be tough on Democrats. If you want to do softer, more personal interviews with Democrats, do some with Trump, too. There's no balance at CBS, and they have a poor track record.

Bring back psychiatric hospitals. Right now, they house less than one-tenth of the people they did 60 years ago. A Florida agency looked at this latest creep in 2016, but they let him go. Do you want to bet it was based on space, that he wasn't worth a bed? We also must slash the media footprint of killers and reduce the appeal for infamy. Creeps obsess over the fame of previous creeps. It's their drug. Let's take away that drug. We need to think offensively. Instead of asking how do we rig the system to stop perps from getting guns? Ask, how do we tag the perps and keep them from getting guns? We want to get the bad eggs, not the law-abiding ones. You see the difference? Florida was preventable. The fiend was all red flags, perfect for a database of nuts and perps who shouldn't get guns. This guy had no violent felonies, so a civil tag is what could have nailed him. Based on testimony from cops, students and school officials, a judge could then issue a simple court order. Rather than defensively cast a wide net that catches tons of fish we don't want, you tag the right people who are placed into one single database along with violent felons. If you're in it, no gun. And if you violate the database, that's mandatory prison time. This isn't just see something, say something, it's actually do something. So by all means protest, but it won't do much when you're targeting the haystack while letting the needle slip through. We learned about the FBI screw-up, Kimberly."

They're going to have to go back and talk to the people who is in charge, and who is the supervisor on duty, who actually had contact with him and made that determination. That's the only way we're going to get better. Unless you do these kinds of thoughtful, deliberate and deep probing investigations to figure out how we can do it better for the next time because this cannot continue to happen, especially when someone is basically screaming out for help, presenting these problems and having this violent ideation and saying that they want to become a school shooter, they have the weapons, they have the means and ability to do so.

But I think we have high rates of people who, for example, veterans who have traumatic syndrome as homeless people. I see more homeless people all over the country, to me, than ever. And I think that's a lot of mental illness. I will say, I think it's great that the young people are willing to march in Washington. I think that hopefully it will change the tenor of the debate because -- maybe if young people are saying you've got to do something, it will appeal to people who, as you point out, are just locked into, oh, you're going to take my guns.

Everybody knows something, even the FBI and no one is sharing this information. So you look at a threat matrix on a kid like this. He's diagnosed autistic. He's diagnosed depressed. He's diagnosed mentally unstable by the agency that looked at him and someone who is an at risk adults because of mental instability. He was developed mentally disabled. And you have a mobile crisis unit that is dispatched to the school. He is expelled for violent behavior at the school. The police are called dozens of times to the house. If you add that up, all those different things, and you say, you know, if someone qualifies for 60 percent of all those things, then maybe they don't get a gun."

Sometimes the federal governments will do things like tying transportation funds in order to get a state to comply with something like the drinking age or something like that. But if this were to work in a certain place, you could try it out somewhere. And you have somebody like the mother from Connecticut at Sandy Hook. She tried to get help. She didn't know where to go. There's also a real concern about cuts to Medicaid, which is where people -- a lot of people get their mental health help if they're going to get any. I hadn't heard the autism diagnosis.

And I think they've been pretty smart. They're working together. They're using their social networks in order to gather not just in Tallahassee. They're calling for a march on March 24. That sounds weird. A march in March. March 24th. And the more they stay in this story it would be harder for people to ignore. But I don't necessarily think that this is just a congressional issue.

And I think that if Trump, if others at the NRA would finally say, listen, here's reasonable step that we can get behind, it would make a huge difference because, remember, we didn't get bump stocks. We haven't had any added steps in terms of the mental illness issue that Greg is talking about today. Medicare, as Dana was talking about, less opportunities for coverage for mental health issues.

That while there's been a huge focus on the Mueller probe, that if you go back to now we know in 2014 that was one when Russia started this operation to come after us in our election in all sorts of different ways, this is at the same time that they're invading Ukraine. And so, the Obama administration would say we're really focused on the fact that we're trying to protect the actual people. They don't get ahead of this one. And I think that, you know, history will have to decide what it will on that front. There are a lot of people on the Democratic side very frustrated that not more was done. I look back and think I don't know what more could have been done in the middle of it because I understand the sensitivity about not getting in the middle of the election and acting like the Russians were trying to help President Trump, and then it would look like Obama was trying to help Hillary. So that's another reason why there are a lot of people that want Mueller to finish his investigation at least in the late spring because the later you get, then you're getting involved in another election, this time the midterm elections of 2018. On the other front, I think that talking about the FBI being distracted by doing too much on Russia and that's why it couldn't prevent 17 children from being murdered, a fine line for a pundit. Not a good one for a president. If the president believes that the Mueller indictment of the 13 Russians was a good news for him just let that sit. Instead it stirred the pot even more and made the story last through the weekend."

For the Republicans, last year, or maybe a year and a half ago, I said this, do not take satisfactions in Russians hacking of DNC or Podesta because it's going to happen to all of us. They will try because the Russians do not play favorites. They play the hand that they have. Right now, they were going after the Dems and the RNC, but it was easier on the Dems. The Russians realized they're 1/8 the size that they use to be. It's not about territory. It's about broadband. So this to my more scary point, people bring up paper ballots. We talked about this, to combat this intrusion. We don't have that remedy for our banking system. We don't have paper ballots for our banking system or for our electric grid. So when somebody hacked that stuff, then it's over. That's what scares me. It's not about -- the marginal attacks on our election system, we do that already. I mean, we do that to ourselves. We're as negative as they are to ourselves. I'm worried about what happens when they paralyze our banking system, when you can't get money out of your atm. Then we all end up robbing each other."

He gave the Iranians a billion dollars or so in cash. And, you know, they ran wild during his administration. Trump comes in. Energy is soaring. We're now beating them in energy production. We sent missiles right on their doorstep to Syria. And, you know, we slapped some sanctions on them. So going back, I think we're overstating the whole issue when it comes to this interference. They spent $40,000 on Facebook ads. Hillary and Trump spent $81 million. And if you talk about the propaganda that was injected into this election, think about the corruption that really happens. CNN and Donna Brazile gave information, questions to Hillary beforehand. NBC leaked the locker room talk tape. There was a lot of really dirty stuff that went on through the media and through Hillary. The dossier I would argue is more impactful than a few Russian bots on twitter. That infected the entire mainstream media. They reported that Trump was a traitor for the last three months of the election. So, just imagine if Donald Trump had paid a foreign agent millions of dollars to bring Russian dirt and pump it into Fox News and smear Hillary as a traitor, he would have been the biggest colluder ever. Hillary actually did that on the other side and no one wants to talk about that."

Over the weekend he hears people say no. Guess what, the Russians may have unwittingly, but they were, in fact, involving Trump officials in their efforts. And to Jesse's point, well, if he wants to take action right now, Jesse, he could implement the sanctions that were passed by congress and that he's sitting on. He's not punishing the Russians with something that's right before him. And don't forget, When you talk about the impact of what the Russians did, there is the email hacking, they went after the Clinton speeches. Remember that?

And I understand why, though. I'd be sensitive, too. It's funny he's calling someone else insecure. But he is, when it comes to protecting himself, he's the only president to fight back against the biased media. But you have a celebrity that comes out who endorsed Hillary, who endorsed Barack Obama and then hurling slanted questions at Trump supporters. I don't mind if CBS is tough on Trump, but they're only tough on Trump. They don't treat people of different parties the same. I don't care if you're tough on Republicans but be tough on Democrats. If you want to do softer, more personal interviews with Democrats, do some with Trump, too. There's no balance at CBS, and they have a poor track record. They tried to get Bush with the forged documents on the eve of the election. Remember, they edited out the Benghazi comment by Barack Obama that was pretty critical. So, you know, CBS is in the tank.

She has, of course, her cable network, the OWN network. But I always -- I want to listen to her. I usually like the questions. But I could see why somebody would think that just does not -- there is a divide there. Right? There's an obvious bias that comes into it from both sides. Right? Everybody is suspicious of each other. I admire her for going, and maybe we can hear from her personal how she feels about that.

His name is Andrew Kurka, and he was -- when he was 13 years old, he was already a six-time Alaskan state wrestling champion. But he had a tragic ATV accident that left him sadly paralyzed from the waist down. But his physical therapist encouraged him to do this mono skiing sport. And fast forward to a couple of years. He never lost his faith and he made the U.S. Paralympic national team. He's already won four championship metals in the sport, and now, 26, he's competing in the games in PyeongChang. And cheers to Andrew, because he's a fantastic role model for so many young people, and people like you, too, Greg."
