And this is \"Your World.\"  And the message from the White House to Mexico: Tighten up the southern border, or your economy could get tight, with a dose of tariffs on all Mexican goods.  That had that stocks here feeling very tight today, the Dow closing below 25000 for the first time since January 31. So what's the fallout from all of this? We're all over it.  We have got Kevin Corke on what the president is planning, Jackie DeAngelis on why investors and consumers should be worried, and Border Patrol Union chief Brandon Judd on why his members are applauding. First to Kevin at the White House with the very latest -- Kevin.",

And he is now willing to go from tough talk on illegal immigration to very serious talks about tariffs.  Let me take you inside the numbers, but first a tweet from the president today, again, assailing the Mexican government for what he called passive cooperation with this mass migration, what he called an incursion into our country along the southern border.   To the tweet first. He says: \"Mexico has taken advantage of the U.S. for decades. Because of the Dems, our immigration laws are bad. Mexico makes a fortune from the U.S., have for decades. They can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done.\" All right, so what's he talking about here, Charles? He's talking about tariffs, 5 percent on all goods coming in from Mexico beginning on June 10. That goes all the way up to 25 percent on October 1, if he were to follow through with the threat if Mexico's government doesn't do something. In one single instance this week, more than 1,000 people, Charles, were apprehended along the southern border. That's on top of the hundreds of thousands who came here last year and the year before and so on and so forth. So the message is clear. Mexico has to help the U.S. or they will pay a very heavy price.",

With all respect, even though you have the sovereign right to say it, the slogan America first is a fallacy, because even until the end of time, justice and a universal fraternity will prevail above national borders.\" Wow.  On Capitol Hill, a bit of pushback from Republicans. Joni Ernst, the senator from the great state of Iowa, saying this: \"Listen, it's clear that we need to address the unprecedented flow of illegal immigrants coming across our border day in and day out. And it's imperative that Mexico step up and do its part to stop the stream of these migrants. That being said, the livelihoods of Iowa farmers and producers are at stake.\" No word yet, Charles, on just when we might hear from the U.S. -- make that the Mexico trade reps who are set to be on the way to Washington.

      "sentences": "Good afternoon to you, Charles. Well, investors, as you can see, not responding well to this new threat from President Trump of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports to stop migrants from crossing the border.  It was a surprise to the markets because they were actually hoping for some relief with the passage or coming passage potentially of USMCA to get some relief. But the additional issue with Mexico, it can impact millions of goods, products like cars, machinery, fruits, vegetables, really the whole gamut there.  The fear and the uncertainty, it was already in the markets because of the China threat, so now heightened. The yield on the 10-year note, 2.14 percent. We saw that dropping over the last few days. That's because investors are flying for shelter. They want safety and you get it in the 10-year note. Now, today, the Dow was down 354 points. It closed at session lows. It also closed under 25000 for the first time since January 31. Remember, that is a very key psychological mark for investors. And pretty much every stock, almost every stock on the Dow was in the red today.   Oil prices are also in lockstep telling the story too, closing today at $53.50. It wasn't long ago that we saw oil trading well over $60. But when you have fears about economic growth, oil prices drop because investors worry about demand and the future. So some of the sectors that we saw today that were hit the hardest, well, the autos were certainly one of them, companies like GM, like Ford, like Toyota, like Fiat Chrysler. You can see right across the board there. GM got hit the hardest, more than 4 percent in losses today.  And this is because these companies import steel and aluminum from Mexico. The car part makers, they also got hit, so companies like Gentherm, Stoneridge, Dana, Incorporated, all seeing red as well.  For the month, the Dow suffering about a 6.5 percent loss there, 6.7 percent, the Nasdaq getting hit hard, almost 8 percent, the S&P 6.5 percent. This was the worst May that the market has seen in nine years, Charles, so since 2010. It was pretty staggering for the losses.",

If you are a Texan, what this 5 percent tax does is it raises taxes on Texans by $5.35 billion. And if it goes to 25 percent, it'll go up to 28 percent in terms of the tax.

This is the way it really works and people should understand. First, the currencies adjust. Today, the U.S. dollar was up 3 percent against the peso. That almost wipes out the 5 percent. Then the exporters, they take a lower price.  So, if Mexico or China is going to sell something at 10 bucks, we don't have customers for it. They will sell it at nine bucks. That's why China's economy is getting crushed. And, by the way, importers take a bite. Vendors take a bit. The stores take a bite.  I watch the markets. If any store could raise prices 25 percent, Woolworths would still be in business. Macy's -- Sears would still be in business.",

And he's confirmed to me that he is the John that's referred to in the voice-mail exchange with Rob. Rob is Rob Kelner. He is the lawyer for the former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. What we see in what's been released by the court is pretty close to what is in the special counsel report in the obstruction chapter. In the voice-mail, according to Dowd, he says that it was not meant to intimidate. It was a longstanding relationship with Kelner. And he said what people need to understand is that they had what's called a joint defense agreement between Flynn and the president's legal team. So there was a broad sharing of information. Some of that information would have been sensitive or privileged. And he told me the motivation for the phone call was to say to Flynn's lawyer, if you're going to do a deal, we want to have a heads-up, because some of this material is sensitive and is privileged because of the communications with the president. The other thing I want to say, Charles, is that it's worth looking closely at the order from the judge, because my read is that he asked for two sets of documents, not only the transcript of this voice-mail, which was part of the obstruction volume in the special counsel report, but, more significantly, I think, these transcripts of phone calls between Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. And it was those phone calls that really were the catalyst to the series of events and the lies by Flynn that led to his termination shortly after the inauguration in 2017. And it was the substance of those conversations that were leaked to the media that set the chain of events into motion. And based on my reading of the records right now, it doesn't appear that we're going to get the Kislyak transcripts, at least today. And I'm not sure how the court will proceed, given that -- given that action by the government.",

Well, first of all, it does fill a pattern of aggressiveness -- aggressiveness that they have had in the region. I mean, they dominate Lebanon. They are running the war in Syria. They're encroaching on Israel from Syria, and also with all the rockets and missiles they provide to Hamas in Gaza. They toppled the regime in Yemen which was friendly to the United States and our allies lies. They're -- and they're certainly heavily involved in that civil war as well.

      "utterance": "Good afternoon to you, Charles. Well, investors, as you can see, not responding well to this new threat from President Trump of imposing tariffs on Mexican imports to stop migrants from crossing the border. It was a surprise to the markets because they were actually hoping for some relief with the passage or coming passage potentially of USMCA to get some relief. But the additional issue with Mexico, it can impact millions of goods, products like cars, machinery, fruits, vegetables, really the whole gamut there. The fear and the uncertainty, it was already in the markets because of the China threat, so now heightened. The yield on the 10-year note, 2.14 percent. We saw that dropping over the last few days. That's because investors are flying for shelter. They want safety and you get it in the 10-year note. Now, today, the Dow was down 354 points. It closed at session lows. It also closed under 25000 for the first time since January 31. Remember, that is a very key psychological mark for investors. And pretty much every stock, almost every stock on the Dow was in the red today. Oil prices are also in lockstep telling the story too, closing today at $53.50. It wasn't long ago that we saw oil trading well over $60. But when you have fears about economic growth, oil prices drop because investors worry about demand and the future. So some of the sectors that we saw today that were hit the hardest, well, the autos were certainly one of them, companies like GM, like Ford, like Toyota, like Fiat Chrysler. You can see right across the board there. GM got hit the hardest, more than 4 percent in losses today. And this is because these companies import steel and aluminum from Mexico. The car part makers, they also got hit, so companies like Gentherm, Stoneridge, Dana, Incorporated, all seeing red as well. For the month, the Dow suffering about a 6.5 percent loss there, 6.7 percent, the Nasdaq getting hit hard, almost 8 percent, the S&P 6.5 percent. This was the worst May that the market has seen in nine years, Charles, so since 2010. It was pretty staggering for the losses."

He has gone out, and he's met with people like Kim Jong-un on and developed these personal relationships and tried to get positive results as -- out of them. And he could have done that with AMLO, Mexico's president. But instead he's gone out and he's decided to implement what's essentially a tax on the American people. If you are a Texan, what this 5 percent tax does is it raises taxes on Texans by $5.35 billion. And if it goes to 25 percent, it'll go up to 28 percent in terms of the tax. And it's very, very punitive to us as Americans, as opposed to Mexico."

Perhaps the carrot comes now. We're getting word -- Kevin Corke just mentioned Kellyanne Conway. There was a question about meeting with Mexico. She did indeed say they are on their way. She was also asked, will this jeopardize USMCA? She said it shouldn't end and that this will go on, on parallel tracks. Congress can approach this and also Mexico can work on this at the same time as improving their immigration policy, Kat."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",

I really hope that this is just Trump doing that thing where he comes out with something really bold and big and kind of scary sounding, and it just amounts to rhetoric, because tariffs, as you mentioned, are a tax on the American consumer. And I know that he wants Mexico to feel the pain, but American consumers are going to feel the pain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "I want to push back on that, because there's not a single person watching this show that -- let's say Chinese tariffs went 25 percent, would pay 25 percent extra. This is the way it really works and people should understand. First, the currencies adjust. Today, the U.S. dollar was up 3 percent against the peso. That almost wipes out the 5 percent. Then the exporters, they take a lower price. So, if Mexico or China is going to sell something at 10 bucks, we don't have customers for it. They will sell it at nine bucks. That's why China's economy is getting crushed. And, by the way, importers take a bite. Vendors take a bit. The stores take a bite. I watch the markets. If any store could raise prices 25 percent, Woolworths would still be in business. Macy's -- Sears would still be in business."

If a business could raise prices 3 percent, normally, their stock goes higher. But I do want to bring this up, because Nancy Pelosi is out with a statement. Max, I got to ask you about that. She's saying that, listen, of course, she mentions USMCA, but she's saying that she now hopes that President Trump will join in bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform. I think that's what everybody wants. What is stopping that?"

I think most people will take a long, hard look at whether or not they want to subject themselves to, number one, the confirmation process, and, secondarily, the unmitigated duplicity and hypocrisy that exists in our current political environment.

And it's going to be up to interpretation.

He's an institutionalist. He's a DOJ guy from way back. He cares very much about repairing the reputation of that department and the bureau, because he's the boss of the bureau in a sense as well. So I'm glad he's there. I think if given the time and the objectivity and an open-minded jury, he can get to the bottom of some of these fact patterns. But, Charles, half the country at least, and certainly half the Congress, doesn't have any interest in getting to the factual predicate of Russia or whether or not the FISA application process was abused.

There are three kinds of Republicans Adam really likes, those that vote with Democrats, those that lose, and those that die. And for most of us, that's too steep a price to pay to curry favor with Adam Schiff. This is the same Adam Schiff that did everything his power to keep you from finding out that Hillary Clinton had her own server and classified information traversed that server. He did everything he could to make sure you never found that out, Charles. The dossier, you wouldn't know about if it was up to Adam Schiff. The FISA application what was used in it, you wouldn't know about if it was up to Adam Schiff. He went to court to make sure you didn't know that the DNC Christopher Steele's work.

And, actually, you could make an argument that they're both right, because Congressman Amash is looking at the report, saying, if you follow the Constitution, there could be impeachable conduct.

But Rand Paul is right. And if you talk about the beginning of this investigation, there are still so many outstanding questions. And what civil libertarians have been saying for a long time is, there is a far too great concentration of power that is so attractive for abuse. And if you have people who have been used to wielding that power, and feeling like they're the good guy, protecting us from the bad guys, and then all of a sudden they see this candidate as the ultimate bad guy, it's too easy for them to use and abuse that power. And Rand Paul and Justin Amash have both been saying for a long time that we have to take a rational approach to this and scale back some of those tools."

Some people argue, hey, if there was no obstruction, which, by the way, was the main purpose of this two-year foray, then, yes, the president was on Twitter. He didn't -- he didn't make secret his disdain for the process. It wasn't something that he did behind closed doors. Then how could that be obstruction of something that never occurred?"

And I think the special counsel is right not to charge him. I think that Robert Mueller, with all of his years of experience, and with all the money and resources that he had, he could have done a much better job outlining what he thought the president did wrong and said, well, we can't charge him with the crime.

He understands that the stock market is going to go down for one day. This is deja vu. We saw it with China. The stock market went down, but then it popped right back up. And the tariffs on China didn't, in fact, hurt us, like everybody said it was going to. Mexico cannot withstand the tariffs. The United States can. And the stock market will go back up. But if we do, in fact, put this pressure on Mexico, illegal immigration will go down. That 1,000 people that you saw cross the border, that pulled so many of our resources out of the field. And it allowed the cartels to have access to our border with very little resistance from the Border Patrol. This is what's taking place. And this is why this issue is so important. We can't get continue to allow drugs to flow freely into this country, kill United States citizens. We can't continue to allow illegal aliens to freely flow into the country and be released."

Allow us to send these individuals that are coming into the United States and asking for asylum, allow us to send them back to Mexico and wait their turn in Mexico, until their asylum hearing comes across. If Mexico were to do that, that would drive illegal immigration down exponentially. But the fact remains, Mexico doesn't want to do that because they want illegal immigration. The amount of money that criminal cartels make on it illegal alien smuggling and drug narcotics is a multibillion-dollar industry. That money stays mostly in Mexico. And that helps the Mexican economy, which is why they have been so reticent in helping the United States in controlling this illegal immigration crisis."

The United States is such a great country because we believe in laws, and we try to enforce those laws.

He's been put up against a situation where he has to take drastic measures. If Congress isn't going to act, if the government of Mexico isn't going to act, then the president is going to have to unilaterally come up with programs and decisions to try to control this problem. We are at a crisis. We are at a national emergency, and we have to do something -- 1,000 people in one group crossed. Charles, that's nearly tripled the size of our previous largest group. And we continue to set records month after month, and nobody is doing anything about it. And the president is left on his own to -- at his own druthers to do what he needs to do. Frankly, that's unacceptable. Congress has to do their job. Mexico has to do its job. And then the president can do his job -- his job.

They're going to have to do something. I seriously doubt that it would linger. Mexico would easily be able to control their southern border. They would easily be able to accept people under the migrant protection program, pending their asylum cases. They would have to do something. That is what I would bet.

      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Charles, thank you. I have just been speaking with John Dowd. John Dowd is a former lawyer for President Trump. And he's confirmed to me that he is the John that's referred to in the voice-mail exchange with Rob. Rob is Rob Kelner. He is the lawyer for the former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. What we see in what's been released by the court is pretty close to what is in the special counsel report in the obstruction chapter. In the voice-mail, according to Dowd, he says that it was not meant to intimidate. It was a longstanding relationship with Kelner. And he said what people need to understand is that they had what's called a joint defense agreement between Flynn and the president's legal team. So there was a broad sharing of information. Some of that information would have been sensitive or privileged. And he told me the motivation for the phone call was to say to Flynn's lawyer, if you're going to do a deal, we want to have a heads-up, because some of this material is sensitive and is privileged because of the communications with the president. The other thing I want to say, Charles, is that it's worth looking closely at the order from the judge, because my read is that he asked for two sets of documents, not only the transcript of this voice-mail, which was part of the obstruction volume in the special counsel report, but, more significantly, I think, these transcripts of phone calls between Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. And it was those phone calls that really were the catalyst to the series of events and the lies by Flynn that led to his termination shortly after the inauguration in 2017. And it was the substance of those conversations that were leaked to the media that set the chain of events into motion. And based on my reading of the records right now, it doesn't appear that we're going to get the Kislyak transcripts, at least today. And I'm not sure how the court will proceed, given that -- given that action by the government."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, these acts were done after the United States had made the announcement that we were going to put some forces back into the region that we had taken out of it, based on some credible intelligence. Obviously, this is a statement that they're making, based on evidence, that, one, they did have credible intelligence, and, number two, we need to expose the Iranians for the malign behavior that they're up to, and they lied through their teeth. They denied all of this, obviously. They're going after the UAE's tankers and the Saudi -- the Saudis' pipeline. I mean, that's an act of war, what they're doing here. And they have to be called out for it. And an international arena, like the U.N., is the proper place to do it. What are the Iranians really up to here? Well, first of all, it does fill a pattern of aggressiveness -- aggressiveness that they have had in the region. I mean, they dominate Lebanon. They are running the war in Syria. They're encroaching on Israel from Syria, and also with all the rockets and missiles they provide to Hamas in Gaza. They toppled the regime in Yemen which was friendly to the United States and our allies lies. They're -- and they're certainly heavily involved in that civil war as well. And they undermine all the other countries in the region as well. So, what the Iranians are trying to make a statement -- with all the pushback on them that this administration has imposed on them. And, by the way, Charles, no administration has ever pushed Iran to the degree that this administration is doing, despite the fact that Iran has been doing this for 39 years."

      "utterance": "General, you started, though, and you pointed out that these are indeed acts of war. And yet there's no chance of us actually getting involved in a military conflict in Iran. In the meantime, there's more and more evidence that these economic sanctions are biting, to the point you have to wonder about the internal turmoil within that country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. The economy has contracted 6 percent. Inflation is up at around 37 percent. The rial is their currency, has taken a steep dive. And unemployment is on the rise. Food shortage is routine now, power outages out once a week, rising unrest in the country, around the whole country. The elites and the upper class not touched at all by any of it -- they're well-protected. But the middle class and others are beginning to feel the bite. The other thing that's happening, which is very good news, is their proxies in the region, the Hezbollah, the Hamas, the Houthis, they're not getting the resources that they have been used to getting in the past, because Iran flat does not have it. So we have got to continue on the path we're on, Charles. The administration, I think, has called this right. Keep the pressure on these guys. Remember, job one here is to change their behavior in the region, Charles, and stop this aggressive malign behavior. Number two is, we don't want them to have nuclear weapons. And, three, the president truly wants them to come back to the negotiation table, so we can put these issues back on the agenda."

Meantime, the governor says about 500 homes statewide have taken on water. And emergency management officials fear the number will only go up, as these historic floodwaters continue rising, which is happening quickly in multiple communities lining the swollen Arkansas River, especially those furthest to the south. As all of that water makes its way downstream from Oklahoma and beyond, farmers have taken a major hit. Thousands of acres of fields of crops have taken on water, even more so after that levee breach that you spoke of, which happened overnight in Dardanelle, Arkansas. That's about 40 miles northwest of where we are. It is cause for concern, say local officials, since record water levels are putting pressure on the entire flood control system like never before."
