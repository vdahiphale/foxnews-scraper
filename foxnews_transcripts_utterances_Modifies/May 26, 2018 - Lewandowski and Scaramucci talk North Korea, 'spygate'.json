If we got that done, and if we can be successful in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, it would be a great thing for North Korea, it would be a great thing for South Korea.

      "sentences": "Well, to say the least, not a usual Saturday night at the White House, especially not on a Memorial Day weekend. I'm Ed Henry in New York. You have been seeing the President of the United States, Donald Trump with Joshua Holt. He was Mormon missionary who travelled to Venezuela from Utah to marry a woman that he had met online. You saw her there as well in the Oval Office. His parents were there, and apparently, her daughter as well, and it grew very emotional. Senator Mike Lee, one of many members of the Utah Congressional delegation there, he grew emotional as he said our country is now your country, both in English and Spanish. This caps a remarkable two-year journey for Joshua Holt and his wife and daughter as you saw there. He had been in a prison in Venezuela because of the Maduro administration, the dictatorship there that the Trump administration has been battling with. There are US sanctions that are hammering their economy right now. This move seen potentially as a goodwill gesture obviously. The Maduro government hoping, they may be wrong, but hoping that this opens the door to a broader conversation with President Trump about easing some of those sanctions. Senator Marco Rubio and others though, very active on social media, today saying this is not enough. This is a good step, a goodwill gesture, if you will, but what really needs to happen is that Maduro needs to step down, democracy needs to be restored in Venezuela before those US sanctions, those punishing sanctions should be relieved. As I mentioned, a remarkable two-year journey for Joshua and his family while he was in prison, but it also caps a remarkable day. You saw Senator Bob Corker, the Republican Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee along with Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Corker, as you can see these pictures now the left of your screen, that was Joshua with Senator Corker carrying luggage together. Senator Corker with his jacket off and boarding that plane, somewhat a light-hearted moment in the Oval Office when President Trump was pressing them on what happened, and Bob Corker said they were finally about to leave that airport you see in Caracas after this long, long journey and they were about to take off and suddenly, the pilot turned off an engine and started heading back as if they were not going to be leaving Venezuela. You heard the President press Senator Corker what exactly was going on, what were the Venezuelans up to, and Senator Corker explained that there had been something wrong with one of the instruments on the plane. President Trump saying that maybe the first time someone was happy that it was just a problem with an instrument and not being dragged back into this communist country. As you can see, everyone relieved now, that was just a light moment where now, Joshua has been released just weeks after three American hostages in North Korea were released as well, the president touting that.

It's a perfect example of the left's duplicity. A leveling narrative on North Korea has always favored the North Koreans at the expense of Trump. Fire and Fury was too tough, our allies weren't behind us, China wouldn't help us, remember the meeting got suckered into North Korean Olympic propaganda and they said, Kim Jong-un's sister was a better diplomat than Ivanka. Democrats side with America's opponents just score political points against Trump. For example, in the course of this President, Democrats have defended Hamas, MS-13, Iranian mullahs, waterboarded terrorists, risky Syrian refugees and Antifa. Trump's success has boxed Democrats into such radical positions they are becoming politically irrational. Now the North Koreans signaling they want the meeting back on. President Trump's reaction."

We have been at war for 17 years and these are people that will put a man on their knees in front of them, and slowly slit their throat on cameras. I am looking at a camera right now, imagine somebody in front of me and I slice his neck open. What kind of human can do that? Those are the people that we have waterboarded. Now, I am not saying two wrongs make a right, but they have been apologizing for what we have done since 9/11. Listen, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, we dropped atom bombs, nuclear bombs to end a war and we are still at war with people that have done even more disgusting things. So, I just don't understand -- there is no excuse for them apologizing to these people."

She was there for a long time, three years. The previous administration was unable to get her out -- a fantastic young woman and she was released. As you know, in North Korea we just had a great success. We had three wonderful people -- Americans -- that released just recently and they are now home safely with their families. You were a tough one. I have to tell you, that was a tough situation, but we have had 17 released. And we are very proud of that record, very proud, and we have others coming. We are in the midst of some very big negotiation to the get others out. In most of cases, they are Americans. but we can try to help other countries, too, where there is injustice, so we've been working very hard on it. But, I just want to welcome you to the Oval Office, welcome you to the White House. It's really very special to have you both. You have gone through a lot. You've gone through a lot, more than most people could endure. I want to thank your parents for being such loving parents. You are very, very special. You were fighting all the way.

And I don't think there is a person in the United States right now that doesn't realize that you have their back, and so I wanted to personally thank you for keeping a promise that you made to me. Every time would go and see you, I would bring up Joshua's name and you would say, \"I am going to do everything I can.\" And obviously, I believed it. I also wanted to say to Josh that your mom never let us forget about you. That is what is -- she is one of the strongest women I know. And we have started a friendship that has been -- that started through maybe some heartache and some pain, but we are going to be friends forever because of the bond that we have had. And so, you know, I just wanted to say sincerely that we are with you, Utah has been praying for you, and so happy that you are coming home, and Utah wants to thank you, Mr. President, for making this happen. We wouldn't have been able to do this without you.

She was out there pitching as was Bob, as was Mike, as was Orrin. I mean, we really had a great team, that's a strong nucleus right there, but we had a great team. Great job. I just want to mention, we are doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea. It looks like it's going along very well. As you know, there are meetings going on as we speak in a certain location which I won't name. But I like the location. It's not so far away from here. I think there is a lot of goodwill. I think people want to see if we can get the meeting and get something done. If we got that done, and if we can be successful in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, it would be a great thing for North Korea, it would be a great thing for South Korea. It will be great for Japan and great for the world, great for the United States. Great for china. A lot of people are working on it. It's moving along nicely, so we are look at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn't changed. It's moving along pretty well. So, we'll see what happens. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it.

      "utterance": "Well, to say the least, not a usual Saturday night at the White House, especially not on a Memorial Day weekend. I'm Ed Henry in New York. You have been seeing the President of the United States, Donald Trump with Joshua Holt. He was Mormon missionary who travelled to Venezuela from Utah to marry a woman that he had met online. You saw her there as well in the Oval Office. His parents were there, and apparently, her daughter as well, and it grew very emotional. Senator Mike Lee, one of many members of the Utah Congressional delegation there, he grew emotional as he said our country is now your country, both in English and Spanish. This caps a remarkable two-year journey for Joshua Holt and his wife and daughter as you saw there. He had been in a prison in Venezuela because of the Maduro administration, the dictatorship there that the Trump administration has been battling with. There are US sanctions that are hammering their economy right now. This move seen potentially as a goodwill gesture obviously. The Maduro government hoping, they may be wrong, but hoping that this opens the door to a broader conversation with President Trump about easing some of those sanctions. Senator Marco Rubio and others though, very active on social media, today saying this is not enough. This is a good step, a goodwill gesture, if you will, but what really needs to happen is that Maduro needs to step down, democracy needs to be restored in Venezuela before those US sanctions, those punishing sanctions should be relieved. As I mentioned, a remarkable two-year journey for Joshua and his family while he was in prison, but it also caps a remarkable day. You saw Senator Bob Corker, the Republican Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee along with Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator Corker, as you can see these pictures now the left of your screen, that was Joshua with Senator Corker carrying luggage together. Senator Corker with his jacket off and boarding that plane, somewhat a light-hearted moment in the Oval Office when President Trump was pressing them on what happened, and Bob Corker said they were finally about to leave that airport you see in Caracas after this long, long journey and they were about to take off and suddenly, the pilot turned off an engine and started heading back as if they were not going to be leaving Venezuela. You heard the President press Senator Corker what exactly was going on, what were the Venezuelans up to, and Senator Corker explained that there had been something wrong with one of the instruments on the plane. President Trump saying that maybe the first time someone was happy that it was just a problem with an instrument and not being dragged back into this communist country. As you can see, everyone relieved now, that was just a light moment where now, Joshua has been released just weeks after three American hostages in North Korea were released as well, the president touting that.
