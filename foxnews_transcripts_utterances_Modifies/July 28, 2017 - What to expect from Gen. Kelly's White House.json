It's 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Another night of big breaking news in Washington. A White House shake-up after reports of major infighting in recent days. President Trump is ousted his chief of staff Reince Priebus and replaced him with Homeland Security Chief General John Kelly. The announcement comes a week after the President appointed a new communications director Anthony Scaramucci who accused Priebus of trying to keep him out of the West Wing in a fiery interview.  Here was the President on his decision earlier.",

In terms of major legislation and it's worth noting, he's out mere hours after a major failure on health care. In some ways, the President has never fully in sync with the chief-of-staff dating back to Priebus' days as chairman of the RNC.  When he urged the GOP nominee in October to get out of the race because of that Access Hollywood tape. The President sometimes tweet to Priebus about that in private and the attention only grew after the arrival of Anthony Scaramucci one week ago today. Over the strong objections of Priebus and his RNC loyalist Sean Spicer who quickly resigned.   Interesting if Priebus did not see the handwriting on the wall then it was written in giant letters last night where we learned of that Scaramucci interview with the New Yorker magazine in which he savaged Priebus by calling him among other things, a bleeping paranoid schizophrenic. Awkward then that Priebus and Scaramucci run Air Force One together today before this was revealed. And where the news broke as the President was getting off the plane, Priebus' vehicle suddenly left the motorcade. Got a bit awkward. Priebus is now saying, he secretly resigned yesterday and tonight, he put out a statement that said that it was one of the greatest honors of his life to serve under the President. And then he told our own Sean Hannity this.",

Listen, the fact is he took law enforcement care border, wrapped it into this cocoon of National Security and he beat the pants off of you. Because of this very issue.

What is interesting to me maybe at one bright spot the Republicans miss is that McCain let his choice be known early on. All the rest of the Republicans stuck with McConnell to vote on it. There's some sense of unity there. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi the minority leader has sent a letter to majority leader McConnell and speaker Ryan saying we the Democrats are willing to work with you on the version that you had put forth. The Democrats were willing to come to the table at the time and now they want to do it. The thing is it is not possible that they can move on and talk about something else anymore, because every decision going forward has some part of ObamaCare in it.

Even tried to bring him to the U.S. at one point, his battle became a symbol for the ethical debate on right to life and right to patient and doctors to analyze. This is tough stuff.

It's 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Another night of big breaking news in Washington. A White House shake-up after reports of major infighting in recent days. President Trump is ousted his chief of staff Reince Priebus and replaced him with Homeland Security Chief General John Kelly. The announcement comes a week after the President appointed a new communications director Anthony Scaramucci who accused Priebus of trying to keep him out of the West Wing in a fiery interview. Here was the President on his decision earlier."

      "utterance": "Jesse, Reince Priebus gets some credit for helping to elect President Trump providing critical ground game for the campaign. But has not had anywhere near those kinds of a result. In terms of major legislation and it's worth noting, he's out mere hours after a major failure on health care. In some ways, the President has never fully in sync with the chief-of-staff dating back to Priebus' days as chairman of the RNC. When he urged the GOP nominee in October to get out of the race because of that Access Hollywood tape. The President sometimes tweet to Priebus about that in private and the attention only grew after the arrival of Anthony Scaramucci one week ago today. Over the strong objections of Priebus and his RNC loyalist Sean Spicer who quickly resigned. Interesting if Priebus did not see the handwriting on the wall then it was written in giant letters last night where we learned of that Scaramucci interview with the New Yorker magazine in which he savaged Priebus by calling him among other things, a bleeping paranoid schizophrenic. Awkward then that Priebus and Scaramucci run Air Force One together today before this was revealed. And where the news broke as the President was getting off the plane, Priebus' vehicle suddenly left the motorcade. Got a bit awkward. Priebus is now saying, he secretly resigned yesterday and tonight, he put out a statement that said that it was one of the greatest honors of his life to serve under the President. And then he told our own Sean Hannity this."

I'm honored to be asked to serve as the chief of staff to the President of the United States.\" The key is we're being told tonight that General Kelly has been empowered to control the flow of people in paper in and out of the Oval Office.

This is, the President has done more than any president in the history of the United States. And look at all of these amazing things. So, I mean, I think that if you are Reince Priebus, you could look at it both ways. Right? And I do think that the ObamaCare thing is probably something right."

I think this selection of General Kohn Kelly is really good. For all sorts of reasons that we can talk about here, the chain of command, public servant, he has the respect of the President but also this is a White House that is about to -- that is facing but will increasingly face a very hostile regimes. North Korea today testing another missile, possibly an ICBM. You have Iran and all of these, the idea, this possibility that they sent up a satellite into space. I just knew. And also he used to be southern command and knows a lot about things in South America and Venezuela is hitting up. So, now that he names another National Security adviser, but the fact that the chief of staff now has a great command of those issues is really good."

If you want to fire me, this goes back to what Greg said. If you want to fire me, fire me. But I am not going anywhere despite all of your tweets. You think about the Pentagon saying to him on the transgender front, we'll do a study here, but we're not banning transgender people like you want.

As Dana mentioned, former command of the southern command, having served in Central America as well as South America. Also having served in Iraq. He's so perfect for that job. So, I'm actually really disappointed for him to leave that post. And what I do worry about as Greg mentioned the turnover that we saw under President Obama, we've seen a lot of turnover under President Trump and I certainly hope that doesn't happen to someone who has so dutifully serve this country for 45 years. But look, I mean, I think the writing was on the wall for Priebus with Scaramucci being brought in and Sean Spicer being pushed put. I think President Trump felt like the establishment wing of the Republican Party was never with him, I think he associates Priebus and Spicer, with that wing of the party, so I would be surprised if we see some more firings in the weeks to come."

But what we have seen as you mentioned, he has surrounded himself with a lot of brass. Whether people who are CEOs of Exxon or generals. People that have served, people that have run and ran something successfully. And so, I find that to be very interesting. Because it actually turned out to be the exact opposite in terms of him surrounding himself with people that are very accomplished that can do the job on their own and to some degree allowed them to do that role.

You take that with the idea that Steve Bannon is just kind of drifting in the wind. Because gosh, Scaramucci really said awful things about physically impossible acts that he was committing."

What they do is they go into these communities, a lot of times Hispanic communities and they threaten teen Hispanics that don't speak a lot of English, into coming into their gangs. They traffic in narcotics, they traffic in humans, they uses machetes, they are very violent and they are very gory. And that's what drawing a lot of national media attention here.

His administration ran a six weeks operation, 1300 gang members were detained which is the most we have ever seen in history. And look, I look around the Northern Virginia area and there's a big problem with MS-13 in that area. If you look at Montgomery County, Maryland, they've seen 16 gang related homicides from MS-13 in just two weeks or two year period alone. So, this is a big problem for people in the country and I'm certainly glad to see him cracking down on it."

You know, but I want to talk about what Jesse was saying. Jesse was suggesting, whoa, wait a second, Latino community in fact feels threatened by MS-13 which is a fact as you just heard from Lisa. Lisa and I both live in the DC area. We know this is a reality. But the problem Jesse is there's greater fear of mass deportation in families being broken apart and people picked up who were not involved in any crime but just being swept up by this kind of anti-immigrant rhetoric that's coming from President Trump. And you see this, and you know, it's like he's promoting fear of all illegal immigrants in order to justify and to play to the political crowd that wants to blame illegal immigrants for every stand in the country. And one last point, I thought it was stunning today that you have Attorney General Sessions in El Salvador, fighting MS-13 and he doesn't get one shot out, not one mentioned from the President when he is talking about fighting MS-13. Talked about a political signal."

In six weeks, they kneaded 14 illegals over thousand were gang members, that's a big deal. But what is Juan do, he focuses on the two lines about the police. Or he talks about the facts he didn't mention Sessions. So, the media attention is always about the periphery issues. But there is a bigger issue. I've always said this before with Donald Trump, the bigger issue obliterates the littler issues. You don't have to like him. You don't like to have the fact that he forgets about things or the fact that he doesn't see a child, he doesn't shake the hands and you think that's awful. You come up with all of the stupid stuff. When in fact if you look at the bigger issue, the bigger issue matters. And this is my advice for Democrats. Listen, the fact is he took law enforcement care border, wrapped it into this cocoon of National Security and he beat the pants off of you. Because of this very issue. And what he did with law enforcement is, he made it okay to appreciate law enforcement again. Most of America appreciated from the first place. But now you can do it openly. Because we had media for the past six years that painted the law enforcement as the problem. Police brutality was exaggerated. I believe it's exaggerated and now this pendulum is swinging back to the point where we can say, we are proud of what you do."

The Democrats failed them by jacking up premiums and Republicans failed them by not lowering them. There are a few lessons here. Republicans don't have the policy chops that they've been bragging about for all this years. I don't even know if anything they put out there would lower premiums. There are a lot of Republicans that are now so-called Republicans that shows big government over small government. Once you put a lot of these Senators on federal funding, very hard to take away. Mitch McConnell is not the master of the senate that everybody thought that he would be. Pence weren't able to twist McCain arms. Speaking of McCain, I believe put the interests of his own constituents, and sacrifices it against the altar of the mysterious bipartisanship that never even existed. Premiums are out of control in Arizona. And he voted against repealing ObamaCare. It doesn't make any sense. The only thing you can do or say at this point is term limits."

If you don't like it then, then don't you can vote against it? I think stopping the process then doesn't make a lot of sense. What is interesting to me maybe at one bright spot the Republicans miss is that McCain let his choice be known early on. All the rest of the Republicans stuck with McConnell to vote on it. There's some sense of unity there. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi the minority leader has sent a letter to majority leader McConnell and speaker Ryan saying we the Democrats are willing to work with you on the version that you had put forth. The Democrats were willing to come to the table at the time and now they want to do it. The thing is it is not possible that they can move on and talk about something else anymore, because every decision going forward has some part of ObamaCare in it. When you talk about tax reform, any sort of budget issues, ObamaCare is stuck inside."

I think a lot of people didn't like this and they were too scared to say it. So we gave them some cover. ObamaCare is a big bucket of manure. This was a spoon that started around a little bit. The two percent change in this bill, it was so small what they were effecting. They still act like you are committing murder. And this is an education for young Americans who aren't sure what party you belong to or what side you are on to, this is an education. If you touch an entitlement, you are worse than ISIS and Hitler combined. They will call you a murderer and call you evil. They also planned it because they knew they were going to win. There was no plan for this because no one thought that Trump is going to win.

You are going to love this. I went to Greece and to Italy. Here's my first picture. I don't know if you can tell. Apparently it's my foot. I think I'm walking to the terminal. Let's go to my next picture. Just sitting there, a picture of my thigh, I was waiting at the gate.

He knows that kids near the engine, they're skipping class. And it's like why are you skipping class? I want you to stay in school. So he started a thing. If you bring your good report cards in, I'm going to give you a bicycle. And all the sudden, they all started coming in. Attendance increased 45 percent and within a year went up to 92 percent from an initial 20 percent. So this guy is an amazing work, flowers are tied from the police department last month and they are looking to pass the torch and searching for someone to take over the bike program. So if you have anybody in mind."

British Medical System said there was no hope that his parents held out hope for a cure. Even tried to bring him to the U.S. at one point, his battle became a symbol for the ethical debate on right to life and right to patient and doctors to analyze. This is tough stuff. Pope Francis tweeted today, \"I entrust little Charlie to the father and pray for his parents and all those who love him.\""
