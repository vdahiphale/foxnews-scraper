It certainly isn't because of the good job that he did. He is a political hack.\"  Adding to that, on the Reuters investigation this afternoon just moments before this show started, the president was talking about the perjury trap possibility if he sat down with Mueller, \"expressed fears that the investigators could compare his statements with that of others who have testified in the probe, such as a former FBI director James Comey, and that any discrepancies could be used against him. Even if I'm telling the truth, that makes me a liar, the president said. That's no good.\" He \"did not comment on whether he would agree to an interview.\" He \"also declined to say whether he would strip Mueller of his security clearance.\" That's the new news from Reuters. Let's bring in our panel: Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen; Marie Harf, Fox News analyst and co-host of \"Benson and Harf\" on Fox News Radio, and Chris Stirewalt, politics editor here at Fox News.

And what the president managed to do was to take John Brennan who was beclowning himself on the national stage and it made him into a martyr. It's like the scene in \"Spartacus\" -- in the movie in 1960 when all the slaves are standing there, and the Roman general says to them you will be denied crucifixion as long as you give up Spartacus. And all of a sudden they all start saying \"I'm Spartacus! I'm Spartacus!\" Everybody in the intelligence community, even people who don't like John Brennan, are saying I'm Spartacus.
