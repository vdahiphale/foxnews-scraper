Having a phone number and not one to a gas station, like when I was dating. But maybe it wasn't meant to be. Or it's my camp counselor said to me decades ago, you can't do this to me, Greg. I have a family. More important matters actually notably censorship. On Saturday, evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein, Weinstein tweeted this. My June 1st discussion with Dr. Pierre Kory on the DarkHorse podcast has been removed by YouTube for allegedly violating their community guidelines against spam to set the practices and scams. Now before it had been removed. I actually listened to this chat between a biologist and the clinician discussing his experience prescribing Ivermectin for a COVID. A practice done by other clinicians, given it has little to no side effects and by their understanding can reduce symptoms. Now this happened after YouTube also suspended the account of Senator Ron Johnson on Friday for seven days after he posted a pro-Hydroxychloroquine video. A YouTube spokesperson said and violated the medical misinformation policies. They also removed a video of Dr. Korey testifying to the Senate, to the Senate. Maybe they should stop calling it YouTube and start calling it MyTube and the rest of you can eat it. Meanwhile, YouTube gladly hosts medical videos with more quacks than Daffy Duck's family reunion. You can get bad advice about everything from diet and exercise to curing STDs with apple cider vinegar, which doesn't work by the way. And it ruins a nice Cobb salad. It was crazy videos. Harmless self- expression but a chat between two medical professionals. Whoa, that's dropped faster than Brian Stelter's jaw outside of corn dog factory. Now, this is happening as other tech Titans are cracking down on speech. They are the new sensors. These ministers of information can turn the spigot on or off at will. They did this with the lab leak story also with Hunter Biden. They do with every story. The story about rising crime and cities where police were defunded. Spigot goes off. A story about a white lady shouting racial slurs in a parking lot, spigot on. A story about a police officer rescuing the child, spigot off. A story about a police officer breaking the law, spigot on. It's nothing new. These tech giants learn this from their T.V. news allies who've been practicing it for years. Welcome to the USSR or at least a tinier version of it. We think we have all the freedoms we need but like Kat being grilled by the police after her husband goes missing. We're only being told part of the story. It's only time. And now we're doing to ourselves, we self-censor. We have the thoughts that we think and the thoughts that we say. There's always been a gulf between the two. And for good reason, there are some things you just shouldn't say in public. Like I'm a huge Don Lemon fan. No one says that. But while such self- control works well at Thanksgiving tables, on a societal scale in a country that prides itself on first amendment rights, it's scary. Who are we afraid of? Who knows? But that fear is driving that gulf between thoughts and words, that's wider than the gap between Michael Strahan's front teeth. Now they're training us to not have thoughts at all. What's the angry white male have to say?",

Cancel culture as a phrase is seems pretty overused but that's only because it's gaining momentum. It's coming from above and below. You have the tech company silencing legit opinions but you also have the public doing it too. With help from a drooling medium. Check out business week's ghoulish salute to so-called internet sleuths, who spent days and nights seeking out participants of the January 6th breach of the capital. They should have titled this piece Proud to Be A Rat. Or snitches no longer get stitches. It's disgusting. That's one day of unrest versus months of leftist riots across the country. Looting, arson and a spike in violent crime. But those crimes don't fit the narrative, so the armchair detectives look away. Forget murder and mayhem. Someone might be wearing a MAGA hat. Back in the days of communist Eastern Europe, governments relied on turning citizens into spies coercing them into gathering information on their neighbors, but it's happening now. Except in this case, the media is egging on citizens to hunt down other citizens. Do you find this weird? If you don't, you might be Ilhan Omar. We thought that totalitarian thinking would come from the government but it's actually coming from corporations like Google and the people who live across the street with the Biden-Harris bumper stickers. Tech giants are the police. Your neighbors are the police and the only people who can't be the police, according to the media are the police.",

Scientists on the International Space Station concluded this after exposing mouse sperm to radiation and found that it was still healthy after six years. The mouse too or is he dead? And it looked exactly like George -- it looked exactly like George Hamilton. Previously they believe that would be destroyed by solar radiation leading to -- leaving the defense that our prediction was accurate within 200 years. I haven't seen a scientist so wrong since this guy. He probably thinks masks prevent pregnancy. All right, Joe, you can pick one of those two stories.",

I have a family. More important matters actually notably censorship. On Saturday, evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein, Weinstein tweeted this. My June 1st discussion with Dr. Pierre Kory on the DarkHorse podcast has been removed by YouTube for allegedly violating their community guidelines against spam to set the practices and scams. Now before it had been removed. I actually listened to this chat between a biologist and the clinician discussing his experience prescribing Ivermectin for a COVID. A practice done by other clinicians, given it has little to no side effects and by their understanding can reduce symptoms. Now this happened after YouTube also suspended the account of Senator Ron Johnson on Friday for seven days after he posted a pro-Hydroxychloroquine video. A YouTube spokesperson said and violated the medical misinformation policies. They also removed a video of Dr. Korey testifying to the Senate, to the Senate. Maybe they should stop calling it YouTube and start calling it MyTube and the rest of you can eat it. Meanwhile, YouTube gladly hosts medical videos with more quacks than Daffy Duck's family reunion. You can get bad advice about everything from diet and exercise to curing STDs with apple cider vinegar, which doesn't work by the way. And it ruins a nice Cobb salad. It was crazy videos. Harmless self- expression but a chat between two medical professionals. Whoa, that's dropped faster than Brian Stelter's jaw outside of corn dog factory. Now, this is happening as other tech Titans are cracking down on speech. They are the new sensors. These ministers of information can turn the spigot on or off at will. They did this with the lab leak story also with Hunter Biden. They do with every story. The story about rising crime and cities where police were defunded. Spigot goes off. A story about a white lady shouting racial slurs in a parking lot, spigot on. A story about a police officer rescuing the child, spigot off. A story about a police officer breaking the law, spigot on. It's nothing new. These tech giants learn this from their T.V. news allies who've been practicing it for years. Welcome to the USSR or at least a tinier version of it. We think we have all the freedoms we need but like Kat being grilled by the police after her husband goes missing. We're only being told part of the story. It's only time. And now we're doing to ourselves, we self-censor. We have the thoughts that we think and the thoughts that we say. There's always been a gulf between the two. And for good reason, there are some things you just shouldn't say in public. Like I'm a huge Don Lemon fan. No one says that. But while such self- control works well at Thanksgiving tables, on a societal scale in a country that prides itself on first amendment rights, it's scary. Who are we afraid of? Who knows? But that fear is driving that gulf between thoughts and words, that's wider than the gap between Michael Strahan's front teeth. Now they're training us to not have thoughts at all. What's the angry white male have to say?"

Cancel culture as a phrase is seems pretty overused but that's only because it's gaining momentum. It's coming from above and below. You have the tech company silencing legit opinions but you also have the public doing it too. With help from a drooling medium. Check out business week's ghoulish salute to so-called internet sleuths, who spent days and nights seeking out participants of the January 6th breach of the capital. They should have titled this piece Proud to Be A Rat. Or snitches no longer get stitches. It's disgusting. That's one day of unrest versus months of leftist riots across the country. Looting, arson and a spike in violent crime. But those crimes don't fit the narrative, so the armchair detectives look away. Forget murder and mayhem. Someone might be wearing a MAGA hat. Back in the days of communist Eastern Europe, governments relied on turning citizens into spies coercing them into gathering information on their neighbors, but it's happening now. Except in this case, the media is egging on citizens to hunt down other citizens. Do you find this weird? If you don't, you might be Ilhan Omar. We thought that totalitarian thinking would come from the government but it's actually coming from corporations like Google and the people who live across the street with the Biden-Harris bumper stickers. Tech giants are the police. Your neighbors are the police and the only people who can't be the police, according to the media are the police."

I guess they said in this -- they said that the school district still going to teach the meaning of the holidays. But then you don't call it the holiday. When you take it off, it's just the day off day. I mean, let's put this stuff aside and teach our kids again. I don't get it, renaming schools because it's offensive.

The great majority of North Face's products, jackets, backpacks, outdoor pants, shirts, shoes, hats, etcetera are dominantly made out of the oil and gas that we so proudly produce. So, North Face is not only an extraordinary customer of the oil and gas industry, they are also a partner with your oil and gas industry. So, thank you North Face."

So, Chris, my theory is what you -- the reason I was so impressed with this and liked it was that this is kind of the model for other corporations in rejecting kind of the wokeism. You're seeing H.R. -- you know, human resource departments and companies and executives freaking out because they're scared that on Twitter they might get a mob after them. But instead, what you did was you just said, OK, here are the facts. Was that your idea?"

You take iron and you put carbon from coal, put -- and it's put in by burning natural gas at high temperature. So, you can't make a windmill, a solar farm, a nuclear power plant, or a hydroelectric dam for that matter without oil and gas. I'm proud of that. We've enabled all these other energy technologies and most of the -- most of the things we enjoy in modern life."

I learned more in that last four minutes about how things are made than I did in any basic chemistry class which is a testament to your persuasive abilities, Chris. You are more than just a spokesperson. You are a persuader. I want to thank you. Great job. And keep doing what you're doing. Up next, the game show Pandemonium that had its reaching for Imodium."

Three dozen crew members came down with the runs, and apparently it's due to the tainted or allegedly tainted H2O on the set that was to blame. Apparently this happens in water theme parks. Here's a video of a crew member learning of the news. In slightly less gross news, you can get a bun in the oven from a little space-loving. A new study claimed sperm can survive up to 200 years on Mars, especially if it's on a sock. Thank you. Scientists on the International Space Station concluded this after exposing mouse sperm to radiation and found that it was still healthy after six years. The mouse too or is he dead? And it looked exactly like George -- it looked exactly like George Hamilton. Previously they believe that would be destroyed by solar radiation leading to -- leaving the defense that our prediction was accurate within 200 years. I haven't seen a scientist so wrong since this guy. He probably thinks masks prevent pregnancy. All right, Joe, you can pick one of those two stories."

You know, I do think the absence of gravity was a huge mistake on the creator because it's very hard to corral bodily fluids in -- whether it is one or the other. My theory is gravity must be very expensive, so they only had the construction of the universe, the contractors, they ran out of money. So, they were -- they had to -- they put in the gravity on earth and then they ran out of money. So, there's no other place that has gravity which is hilarious, Kat, when you think about it.
