I'm Jason Chaffetz in for Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" There are many big developing stories tonight, after agreeing to meet with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, how should President Trump avoid walking into a trap? We will get expert insight.  Plus, a Florida school shooting survivor joins us to discuss his meeting with the president yesterday and to explain why he is not on the gun control bandwagon.  An actor and congressional candidate, Antonio Sabato Jr. joins us from California to discuss Hollywood's hypocrisy on the NRA and guns.  But we begin with news that will only intensify the battle over illegal immigration. After the president blasted her as a disgrace yesterday, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf is defending her decision to warn illegal immigrants of a recent ICE raid targeting violent criminals. The Democrat tried to present her defiance federal law and potentially obstructing justice as somehow normal, which it most certainly is not.",

I don't think the dangers and pit falls exist as much as many of the detractors are trying to say for this particular reason. At least since 1992, we have had discussions going on with the North Koreans at lower levels of the U.S. government. They ended up in an inconclusive way because we are dealing with authoritarian regime. Really a totalitarian leadership, it's important that the top of the U.S. government be involved in the initial discussions with the North Korean leader.  So, what looks unconventional, I think really reflects the reality of the failed policy of more than a couple of decades. And we're going in to this, maybe there are different messages coming out of Washington and out of North Korea as a result of this, you know, unusual announcement and unusual approach. But the fact remains that the U.S. remains committed to degrading North Korea. It's going in with a history behind its back and having learned lessons of all failures of negotiations in the past.",

I think when you start getting into some of the blanket restrictions on people's second amendment rights, I think that that is constitutionally vulnerable. I think those lawsuits are probably going to succeed. I mean, think about it. You have an enumerated right in the Bill of Rights. There is really no precedent to just do a blanket ban on certain adults. We wouldn't say that if you are 18 to 20 you don't have a fourth amendment right and police could search your house without a warrant. We wouldn't say that they could seize your property without just compensation if the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply. So I think that was problematic. I don't think that provision will actually prevent any gun crimes. But here's the thing, and you know more than anybody in dealing on the oversight. We worked together for years, this between the locals and Broward County, and between the federal with the FBI was the most catastrophic failure of government that I have witnessed since I have been in the Congress or when I served in the military. You guys mentioned the different warnings that were given on the scene. Obviously they went to the guy's house 23 times. They had ample opportunity to arrest him. They didn't do it. We then got a briefing this week in Washington from the FBI. Not only did they get a great tip in January. Not only did they get a tip the previous year, 2017, in Mississippi. The caller in 2018 who took it to the FBI actually connected the two to the Mississippi one. So they knew this guy was dangerous, and they made the decision not even to alert the local authorities. And so we can argue about different laws. The fact is the laws that were on the books were sufficient to prevent this had government done its job.",

And the reason is even if no one decides to do it, just the fact that it might be there, I think that gives a potential shooter pause.

He's also been ordered to forfeit more than $7 million and his coveted Wu Tang Clan CD. He was convicted on a matter unrelated to the drug price hike but one that still may be telling, defrauding hedge fund investors.

For example, let's say Kim agrees to give up all of his nuclear weapons. The question is how are you going to verify that? It takes a couple years to set up an inspection regime as we saw in Iran and even then, the president doesn't think it's that good. North Korea is much more difficult to inspect. What will you do if you don't come to an agreement? Then what next? Because Kim has been legitimized, I mean, this is a ruthless dictator who does horrible things to his own people, and now you have met with him, something he has been trying with the last four presidents who turned him down, so he walks away with something. I think those, you should have thought of that, and even today they kept sending different messages, some preconditions. No preconditions. You know, what's your plan?

      "utterance": "I think so and I disagree with Larry Korb with the way he has presented it. I don't think the dangers and pit falls exist as much as many of the detractors are trying to say for this particular reason. At least since 1992, we have had discussions going on with the North Koreans at lower levels of the U.S. government. They ended up in an inconclusive way because we are dealing with authoritarian regime. Really a totalitarian leadership, it's important that the top of the U.S. government be involved in the initial discussions with the North Korean leader. So, what looks unconventional, I think really reflects the reality of the failed policy of more than a couple of decades. And we're going in to this, maybe there are different messages coming out of Washington and out of North Korea as a result of this, you know, unusual announcement and unusual approach. But the fact remains that the U.S. remains committed to degrading North Korea. It's going in with a history behind its back and having learned lessons of all failures of negotiations in the past."

      "speaker": "KORB",

So, he is where he wants to be. And the question becomes now what next? And if he is willing to give this up, even if you can verify the question what is he going to want in return? Is he going to ask us to take our troops out of South Korea for example? Those are questions that we need to think about before we get in there. Kiron is right. I mean, we've had negotiation that haven't worked, but even again, you don't want the president to go in and make a mistake because it's not like a lower level person making a mistake if he does it, then it's very hard to undo."

I think it would send a major signal to the Asian partners if it happened there. But let me speak to the point about the president and making mistakes. The president is not going into negotiations with Kim Jong-un. He is going in to discussions and talks. And if you go back to the Reagan administration, there was no possibility of getting the first nuclear disarmament agreement of the cold war had it not been for Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev building a personal relationship and talking and Reagan talking with other Russian leaders, such as (inaudible) during those years. I think we have got to also give the president a kind of wide latitude here because he is just going to talk and begin to lay the groundwork for the negotiations that will follow."

Evidently, according to our Adam Housley, the numbers are a little fluid with this, but it does sound like it's been a tragic ending to a long day there on the ground. We will take you back. This started around 10:00 a.m. this morning when a man walked in to the largest veterans' home in the country armed with a gun. He walked in to a ding room. There was a party going on. He let some people leave. But he held a number of hostages. That led to police swarming the area. They shut everything down. There was a SWAT standoff. There was a hostage negotiation. They tried to negotiate. We know that they could not get in touch with the gunman for a long time and now, again, our Adam Housley reporting that the gunman is dead and at least two of the hostages dead as well.

      "utterance": "I think I would have approached it a little bit different. I think certainly the school security I think is long overdue. The money for mental health and being able to identify these individuals who are dangerous so that they are not able to possess weapons, I think all of those are good. I think when you start getting into some of the blanket restrictions on people's second amendment rights, I think that that is constitutionally vulnerable. I think those lawsuits are probably going to succeed. I mean, think about it. You have an enumerated right in the Bill of Rights. There is really no precedent to just do a blanket ban on certain adults. We wouldn't say that if you are 18 to 20 you don't have a fourth amendment right and police could search your house without a warrant. We wouldn't say that they could seize your property without just compensation if the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply. So I think that was problematic. I don't think that provision will actually prevent any gun crimes. But here's the thing, and you know more than anybody in dealing on the oversight. We worked together for years, this between the locals and Broward County, and between the federal with the FBI was the most catastrophic failure of government that I have witnessed since I have been in the Congress or when I served in the military. You guys mentioned the different warnings that were given on the scene. Obviously they went to the guy's house 23 times. They had ample opportunity to arrest him. They didn't do it. We then got a briefing this week in Washington from the FBI. Not only did they get a great tip in January. Not only did they get a tip the previous year, 2017, in Mississippi. The caller in 2018 who took it to the FBI actually connected the two to the Mississippi one. So they knew this guy was dangerous, and they made the decision not even to alert the local authorities. And so we can argue about different laws. The fact is the laws that were on the books were sufficient to prevent this had government done its job."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "I would not mandate any teachers to carry or administrators. What I would do is say a school should not be advertised as a, quote, gun- free zone. If you have maybe it's one or two faculty members who are licenses, who have a conceal carry permit, I don't think they should be predicted from using that bringing the firearm in a concealed way on campus. And the reason is even if no one decides to do it, just the fact that it might be there, I think that gives a potential shooter pause. And if you are beefing up the outside security and you are hardening the schools, then guess what, the schools are no longer such an inviting target. I mean, we have kind of let these things be sitting ducks and there is sickness in society with some of these really demented individuals that are attracted to that. I think just saying that a conceal carry permit holder can go to campus and teach or instruct with that, I think that would serve as deterrent to people to treat that as viable target."

A new study by the conservative Parents Television Council finds a dramatic increase in the portrayals of violence on TV in recent years. According to the study, nearly 61 percent of 287 broadcast primetime television episodes featured some form of violence during their November sweeps period, 39 percent of those 287 those featured gun-related violence.

These are the same people that went to the Academy Awards protected by LAPD, body guards wearing pieces, guns all over the place at the Academy Awards, and then they are making movies on a weekly basis with guns that they want to ban. You know, the NRA has done more to protect the American people than Hollywood could ever do. So let's talk the truth here and make sure the American people know what's going on here. And I think they know that because we elected Donald Trump. He's doing an amazing job, and that's why I'm running for office in November. I'm going to win because we have got to bring common sense into government and our common daily lives. We can't live with these lies every single day. The media are spilling lies 24 hours a day against our president, against the Republican party. That's all they do. And this time they are not going to win because the American people have woken up. We want our America back and we have got to protect our America and our constitution."

What about good stuff, positive stuff, loving, caring stuff. And I'm not talking about the Disney most. I'm talking about in general. TV shows that involves God and family and sitting down at the table and things like that, I urge them to do that. We've got to come together and talk about the real stuff here. The problems are not the guns. The problems are the people who are pulling the trigger like what we have seen in Florida. And then we keep voting these people who are sheriffs, people in government who cannot protect the American people. And this happened in Florida. So right now we have to educate people and tell them the truth."

It's always about computers and phones and this and that and all these distractions.

And unemployment remained at an 18-year low of 4.1 percent. That all throws a monkey wrench into one industry, the professional pundits who have been predicting a blue wave of Democratic victories in the upcoming midterm elections. Two new polls defy those hopes, one by Axios and Survey Monkey shows five Senate Democrats would lose to Republicans candidates if elections were held today, and a new Marist poll has the president's approval rating at 42 percent, the highest he has had since he took office. Let's get reaction from Adriana Cohen, a Boston Herald Columnist who is in Massachusetts with us this evening, and radio talk show host Leslie Marshall who is in California. California seems to see things a little bit differently. So Leslie, take a shot here because there is a lot of good news out there from more people, money in their pockets in tax returns. We have good things happening on foreign policy. You have got good unemployment numbers. Tell me why you think there is suddenly going to be this big blue wave."

Now, I have to tell you, I was once thinking it would just be the Senate the Dems would flip and they wouldn't be able to flip the House, and I'm actually turning that around because we certainly have some Senator seats in the Democratic side that are in very red, very pro-Trump districts."

      "utterance": "Right. But the Democrats have been obstructionists since President Trump was inaugurated. And they voted against the tax cuts which is benefiting millions and millions of Americans. They vote against regulatory reform, which is growing the economy. Everything Trump does they obstruct. And so, Democrats can't run on a Trump derangement syndrome. They have to actually stand for something. And if we look at the economy, it's helping women. President Trump is helping women. It's helping African-Americans. The unemployment rate is at all-time low. You know, our economy can't get any better at this point. We have the largest workforce participation rate in decades. And so at the end of the day Americans are going to care about the kitchen table issues which is how much money they can put in their pocket. And the economy is booming. They don't care so much about social issues. And unfortunately the liberals, all they care about these days is protecting criminal illegal aliens."

We have to look at who is going to be coming up, like in San Diego, Darrell Issa's seat, or if we look further north for Devin Nunes and other people like that. Those are areas that could be flipped. Listen, let's just take Texas, OK? Right now out of all the Republican states, out of all the red states, Donald Trump, the resident has the lowest approval rating in the state of Texas. In 1994, when we had the biggest surge in Democratic voters come out, one Democrat was able to flip a seat statewide in the big red Texas. And guess what? Over a million Democrats came out on Tuesday for the primary to vote. So maybe we could see flip a little blue."

No. We are looking at states like California that are blue. We're looking at other states that are purple. And if you can flip a couple seats in a state like Texas that is a definite win.

And so why on earth would voters shift course, vote for a liberal in November who is going to raise their taxes, take their guns, take their freedom away. The economy is booming. President Trump has restored the American dream. And also I want to say Democrats are the party that supposedly supported the working man. That's no longer the case. The Republicans are. All the unions are supporting this tariff reform. President Trump has created 3 million jobs since he got into office, 263,000 of those jobs were union jobs. They were manufacturing jobs. And so this is going to even grow even stronger with the infrastructure plan that's going to be put into place. And so I am curious to know who the Democrat party actually represents these days because the women are getting jobs, African-Americans are getting jobs, and blue collar workers."

I know a little something about this saga having chaired the House Oversight hearing in 2016 when Shkreli testified, or rather he didn't testify. He just kept pleading the fifth.

He then had the gall to post on Twitter, quote, \"Hard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government.\" I guess you can call members of Congress whatever you would like, but when you raise the price of drugs on people that will die without them by 5,000 percent, that's something else. Fast-forward today in a different picture. Shkreli was reportedly crying as a judge in New York sentenced him to seven years in prison. He's also been ordered to forfeit more than $7 million and his coveted Wu Tang Clan CD. He was convicted on a matter unrelated to the drug price hike but one that still may be telling, defrauding hedge fund investors. Shkreli's attorney told the judges sometimes he wants to hug his client and sometimes he wants to punch him in the face. I know more than a few people who would probably prefer the latter. That's our show for tonight. I'm Jason Chaffetz. I really thank Laura Ingraham. This is the fourth time I've been able to host this show and I appreciate her confidence in allowing me to substitute the show for her. It's truly and honor and a privilege and I appreciate the dialogue and all the guests that were with us tonight. Laura Ingraham will be back on Monday, but we've got a great show.
