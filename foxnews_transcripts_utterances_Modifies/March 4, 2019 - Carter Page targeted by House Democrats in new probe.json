And anybody who works for the government can always quit and take the fifth. But let me tell you some. This is a fraud, this investigation. It is designed to smear people as witnesses, and it is designed to perjury, trap them, and make phony referrals to the Justice Department. This is all about dirtying up the president of the United States, who we has been proven thus far has done absolutely nothing wrong."

And you know, much of this does go to the Mueller investigation. I thought and this very interesting that Jerrold Nadler is just basically admitting that he's impatient. He says, who knows what it's going to come out? I mean, you know, we keep hearings going to come up, but we don't know. So, we better just get on our way and start our own investigation, despite the fact there's already two investigations going on in the Hill?"

      "speaker": "SWIFT",

It's actually a pretty difficult argument to make -- is that they now is to say our interpretation of the statutes and conventions play are that he maintained diplomatic immunity for five months after he was fired.

That's what he's saying, and you know, that I think is what is on most Americans Minds as they listen to this story, you know, that your citizenship and your rights as an American citizen are -- can be violated by your actions. If you turn your back on the country and you go join a terrorist organization, it seems like a pretty good argument that you shouldn't be allowed back into the country because you might pose a threat to the country."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWIFT",
      "utterance": "Well, let's -- there's a lot of those. Yes, I expect the case to move forward not on an emergency basis but on an expedited basis, I would expect, because there are really only issues of law, this case to be resolved in the next few months, at least at its first stage. With regards to the threat that she may pose if she comes back, I think I put a lot of trust in the ability of law enforcement to prosecute if she's actually committed criminal actions. But we can't remove people from the United States we are citizens because we're concerned they might be dangerous."

If you're joining ISIS and they're chopping off people's heads, I think that's a pretty clear-cut, I should say, argument that you are you've joined a clearly dangerous group. But you mean, it all boils down to the citizenship issue and I think that's the legal basis of the whole question here is whether or not you win or lose the fight that she's actually a citizen and then we'll see what happens."

Eight-year-old Leia Carrico and her sister Caroline asked their mother, can we go for a walk? She says no. But 30 minutes later mom recognizes they were gone. She calls police, that's 3 p.m. Sunday morning two volunteers noticed some tiny foot prints about a mile from the house. They began tracking those prints and at around 10.30 they found Leia and Caroline huddled under a tree. Moments later the girls were united with their parents on a highway in this remote area of Northern California. Now get this. The sheriff said these tiny girls survived because of training at the 4-H club which instructed them to stop if they got lost which they did and they also learned to harvest drinking water off of huckleberry leaves. Other than being hungry and dehydrated officials say medically the girls are fine. The temperature overnight in the area 200 miles north of San Francisco 40 degrees.

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",

And I am guessing what she is conferring to is the Shelby County case that came down from the Supreme Court in 2013 said that the criteria that would be used to determine whether a state or a locality was subject to a pre-clearance requirement by the federal government before making any changes to their voting laws, whether that pre-clearance would stand. The Supreme Court ruled that the criteria had been outdated. It hadn't been revised since 1975. So, the Supreme Court said, you know, the Voting Rights Act, I think Robertson his actual opinion said it is responsible for really protecting the right to vote here for making sure that there aren't any discriminatory actions that takes place with the respect to their right to vote but this criteria is outdated. You know, we can't rely on the things that had happened in the past when we're talking about over 40 years ago, so they said we need to go back and look at that criteria.

If you look at voter registration numbers in the state the turnout was actually up 4.3 percent. So, you know, it's a little ridiculous too. I'm not aware personally of any of these stories that she cites I would love to hear about them.

But the school maintains it was not stifling their political viewpoints. Today, some 30 parents and 10 students caring American flags protested in front of the school, they want the principal and assistant principal to apologize to students and lift the punishments that were handed out. We'll see. Martha?"

Unfortunately, I wish there's a little bit more maturity here. The principal probably is claiming that it was not necessarily what they were wearing but the fact that they've unfurled a flag, though the parents were told one thing. If they were going to be told to wear a spirit stuff for this day, I think that they should have been clearer as to what they were supposed to wear and what they weren't. The students are constitutionally protected whether it's spirit day or not by a Supreme Court case that allows them to express themselves. I just I wish that it doesn't have to come to this.
