We have got an impeachment fight revving up, an economy that may be slowing down, and now a deal not about China not getting done, all three a rotten deal for investors today.  We have got Susan Li at New York Stock Exchange on where we go from here, John Roberts at the White House, where the president says, try as Democrats might, he's not going anywhere.  We began with Susan on what happened on the corner of Wall and Broad.",

      "sentences": "Hi. That is right. Hi, Neil.  So at our session lows today. At the worst, we were looking at the worst star for the fourth quarter since 2008. And this is on concerns of slowing U.S. growth. We also had private payrolls today coming in better than expected for the month of September, but pretty much solidifies the fact that we are dealing with slower growth in jobs, a slower pace than last year, when we saw 214,000 jobs created each and every quarter. And couple that with a disappointing manufacturing gauge that we got yesterday, the weakest in 10 years, and that has people concerned about a reality of slowing U.S. economy and when that will eventually hurt the U.S. consumer.  So, the likes of Kohl's, Macy's and Best Buy, the retailers, taking a hit today. Also, Wall Street felt a bit of panic on concerns and news reports that Bernie Sanders will be taking some time off the campaign trail because of chest pains and having two stents put in. And does that give the advantage to somebody like Elizabeth Warren in capturing the Democratic nomination?   Warren not seen as pro-business. She has threatened to tax every stock and bond trade and break up big tech. So that had Wall Street having a bit of a gut check. But let's keep things in perspective, since we are taking a look at the first nine months of this year. The first three quarters of this year have been the best for the S&P going back to 1997, for the Dow Jones industrial, the best since 2013, and for the Nasdaq, the best in two years. So things aren't that bad for the entire year, but a bit of a gut check for the past few days, since we are down some 900 points for the Dow -- Neil.",

This was a bombshell report that The New York Times had that hit literally a minute before President Trump walked into the East Room today for his press conference, his news conference with the president of Finland, Sauli Niinisto.   I had asked the president one question about whether he would cooperate with the subpoenas that will soon be coming to the White House from Capitol Hill. The president said he would, though I suspect that they're not going to fully comply with the subpoenas We will have to wait and see. But then it was -- I told him up front, I want you to ask you two questions here and get fresh answers to both. He tried to block me from answering the second question. I said to him, look, I think this is a question that you're going to want to answer, because it was The New York Times' report that the staff members in the House Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side got an early heads-up that this whistle-blower complaint was coming, because the whistle-blower met with a staff member and went over some of the process of filing this complaint, may have gone over some of the information as well, and that some of that information was passed on to Adam Schiff, though The New York Times says Schiff was never told the whistle-blower's identity.

We have got an impeachment fight revving up, an economy that may be slowing down, and now a deal not about China not getting done, all three a rotten deal for investors today. We have got Susan Li at New York Stock Exchange on where we go from here, John Roberts at the White House, where the president says, try as Democrats might, he's not going anywhere. We began with Susan on what happened on the corner of Wall and Broad."

      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi. That is right. Hi, Neil. So at our session lows today. At the worst, we were looking at the worst star for the fourth quarter since 2008. And this is on concerns of slowing U.S. growth. We also had private payrolls today coming in better than expected for the month of September, but pretty much solidifies the fact that we are dealing with slower growth in jobs, a slower pace than last year, when we saw 214,000 jobs created each and every quarter. And couple that with a disappointing manufacturing gauge that we got yesterday, the weakest in 10 years, and that has people concerned about a reality of slowing U.S. economy and when that will eventually hurt the U.S. consumer. So, the likes of Kohl's, Macy's and Best Buy, the retailers, taking a hit today. Also, Wall Street felt a bit of panic on concerns and news reports that Bernie Sanders will be taking some time off the campaign trail because of chest pains and having two stents put in. And does that give the advantage to somebody like Elizabeth Warren in capturing the Democratic nomination? Warren not seen as pro-business. She has threatened to tax every stock and bond trade and break up big tech. So that had Wall Street having a bit of a gut check. But let's keep things in perspective, since we are taking a look at the first nine months of this year. The first three quarters of this year have been the best for the S&P going back to 1997, for the Dow Jones industrial, the best since 2013, and for the Nasdaq, the best in two years. So things aren't that bad for the entire year, but a bit of a gut check for the past few days, since we are down some 900 points for the Dow -- Neil."

This was a bombshell report that The New York Times had that hit literally a minute before President Trump walked into the East Room today for his press conference, his news conference with the president of Finland, Sauli Niinisto. I had asked the president one question about whether he would cooperate with the subpoenas that will soon be coming to the White House from Capitol Hill. The president said he would, though I suspect that they're not going to fully comply with the subpoenas We will have to wait and see. But then it was -- I told him up front, I want you to ask you two questions here and get fresh answers to both. He tried to block me from answering the second question. I said to him, look, I think this is a question that you're going to want to answer, because it was The New York Times' report that the staff members in the House Intelligence Committee on the Democratic side got an early heads-up that this whistle-blower complaint was coming, because the whistle-blower met with a staff member and went over some of the process of filing this complaint, may have gone over some of the information as well, and that some of that information was passed on to Adam Schiff, though The New York Times says Schiff was never told the whistle-blower's identity. So I asked the president to react to that report today. Listen to the exchange."

The House committee on -- the House Select Committee on Intelligence in a statement simply said -- quote -- \"The whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community. This is a regular occurrence, given the committee's unique oversight role and responsibilities. At no point did the committee review or receive that complaint in advance.\" The president was also asked today about his increasingly harsh language about the whistle-blower and whomever at the White House it might have been that delivered the information to the whistle-blower. President Trump using the word spy and treason, prompting my colleague Jeff Mason from Reuters to ask the president if he describes anybody who disagrees with him as treasonous. Here's what the president responded."

I mean, there's a lot of things for investors to manage. The one, I would say, salvo I would offer is that, yes, manufacturing was terrible, right? I mean, it clearly was a bad number. But 10 percent of our economy is manufacturing; 90 percent is services. So I would just say, before panic sets in, there is at least that one point to keep in mind."

I can't tell you if we're going to go into slowdown, but you have conflicting numbers. You have some good numbers, and today you had some bad numbers. Today's bad numbers causes all those algorithms to kick in and you sell. And we're going to know soon enough, when you start seeing GDP prints, corporate earnings. That's when you really know."

And the first number we're going to look at is the ISM services number, which is very big, because, as Deirdre points out, manufacturing is a pretty small part, 10 percent or thereabouts, of the economy, maybe 11, only about 8 percent of jobs.

James Freeman had an interesting statistic on FOX Business today, that trade -- the sort of tariffs and everything could wipe out 40 percent of the positive stuff on the tax cuts and the deregulation.

They often and always do. So, leaving that aside, the trigger for this, Congressman, was this notion that maybe the recovery is sputtering, that certainly, on the factory floor, evidence that a lot of guys who run those factories are cutting back on spending, not spending nearly as much, cutting back on hiring, if they hire at all, that all this could be collapsing, just at the wrong time for the president."

What are we going to call it? The help wanted recession? We have got seven million open jobs. We have got unemployment down at 1969 levels.

      "utterance": "No, I think that's also over the top. I mean, the way I come out on this -- and I keep joking around about it, Neil -- is, it's like one big moot court. When you do moot court in law school, one side of students gets up and argues evenly their side, then the other. And what we see a lot of times in the discussions in the media is people arguing one side vehemently, then the other. The point is, the truth is always sort of down the middle here. So the point -- where I come out on it is, OK, it's a little different. I don't believe in running down the street, like the bulls in Pamplona, or getting way out in front of the skis and all of that. I say, if you have an allegation, we're going to look at it, we're going to interview the witnesses. OK. There's a big dust-up, by the way, it's interesting, about firsthand vs. hearsay. And everybody went crazy with that. So, I'm going to explain that."

      "utterance": "Yes, but what if all I wanted was dirt on someone, and he delivered the dirt? Did I get my -- what is that Latin term? It's this for that. That's what quid pro quo is. Did I get that?"
    },

      "speaker": "BURNS",

Put aside the personal animosity. But they disagree with his policies, and they want to remove him from office without the voting box. That's a fair argument. And then the converse is oh, no, no, he's abused his power. But I think, in the end, honestly, those who say it's not a high crime and misdemeanor have the better of the argument, honestly. I have got to be fair."

We talked to a famous Chinese dissident on this very show yesterday who says, when push comes to shove, this is what the Chinese will do, respond as they did in Tiananmen Square 30 years ago. But the vice chairman of Kissinger Associates and the former assistant secretary of state Bob Hormats disagrees with that you. You argue, Bob -- and it's very good to have you."

      "utterance": "It's a very different China today. And I think it'd be a big mistake to compare it with Tiananmen Square. I think, first of all, this is on an island. The Chinese have an interest in Hong Kong, but there's a separate system in Hong Kong. And my guess is that they will be very, very reluctant to intervene, and they will encourage the government in China to take -- in Hong Kong -- to take tough action."

But they also understand that China is looking at Hong Kong as something separate, one country, two systems. And I think they want to allow the government of Hong Kong to deal with this, without their playing a role, in part because they don't want to get involved, and in part because Chinese engagement in Hong Kong would lead to a lot of other concerns. They want to deal with their economy."

They shouldn't assume that we can intimidate them because their economy is weakening. A, it's not weakening that much. And, B, they see a lot of tools that they can use to prevent it from weakening too much. The bigger concern, I think, on their part, certainly some of their negotiators and policy-makers, is, do the Americans have the goal in mind of a deal which increases trade opportunities, a level playing field, which is a more traditional kind of trade negotiating deal, although it involves tariffs?"

      "utterance": "All right, timing is everything. The State Department has confirmed FOX just a few minutes ago that it did indeed provide the inspector general Ukraine materials as far back as May 3. That's a lot earlier than thought and is going to involve a lot more timing about who knew what and when and how much they leapt on that material, something that the president had feared was a sham of an investigation and a witch-hunt, as you just heard from his press briefing a little more than an hour ago. We will keep you posted on that. With us now is the former USS Cole Commander Kirk Lippold. And, Kirk, I did want to get into the North Korea stuff. But I did want to pick your brain very quickly on this Ukraine back and forth and who knew what and when. Where do you think it's going?"

      "speaker": "KIRK LIPPOLD, FORMER COMMANDER, USS COLE",
      "utterance": "I think what you're seeing, Neil, is a continuation of what has happened since the minute the American people learned that Donald Trump was our president. You have those people on the left that are apparently working every single day to delegitimize and undermine this president. And I think it's unfortunate, because, at the end of the day, it creates a national security concern, because there will be countries like China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia that may take and pick that one moment where they perceive vulnerability, where the American people will not back the commander in chief at a critical moment, and use that moment to gain power somewhere in the world, either regionally, like China and North Korea, or throughout Europe and Ukraine, like the Russians are attempting and still are doing."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. In the brief time -- and I apologize, Commander -- but this North Korea latest missile test, I guess they have ruled out it came from a submarine, but it definitely came from water or near water. And I'm wondering, all these little letters and cards, what the heck is going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIPPOLD",
      "utterance": "When you really look at it, Neil, what the North Koreans have continued to do is what I said they would do when I talked to you about this starting a year ago, until six months ago. They are going to continue to do research and development to try and miniaturize a nuclear weapon, to gain the capability for an intercontinental ballistic missile that can strike every place within the United States. And if we continue to allow them this R&D effort, they're eventually going to have an operational capability that will threaten the United States. They are a playing card for China. It's very clear that China is allowing them to do this. They're aiding and abetting it. And the United States, at some point, like Ambassador Bolton said the other day, they are not going to give these missiles or these nuclear weapons up willingly."
