      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "You know the craziest thing? Trump's not even impeached. Nancy's keeping the two articles in her purse. She hasn't even sent them to the Senate yet. Now, once they get sent to the Senate, then impeachment's official. But she wants to play games. She wants to wait and squeeze a little more drama out of this whole boring deal. She's afraid if she sends these weak articles, the Senate's just going to find him not guilty and be done with it all. So, Nancy's making demands. McConnell has to run the trial her way or else. Sounds like Nancy's the one demanding a quid pro quo. Not how this works. The Speaker doesn't get to set the terms. The House investigates and the Senate judges. She doesn't have any leverage. The Democrats have already denied Trump due process, and now they're denying him a right to a speedy trial. It's par for the course. I thought Trump was a dire threat to democracy and he had to be impeached before he could rig the next election. Well, I guess there's no urgency anymore. That's how you know it was pure politics. This was never about the Constitution. Nancy only cares about the PR of impeachment. She wants Trump to be impeached, but not acquitted. McConnell called her bluff. He'll just keep confirming judges and blasting the scam."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mitch McConnell",
      "utterance": "It looks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country and second-guessing whether they even want to go to trial. The Senate exists for moments like this. That's why this body has the ultimate say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Game, set, match. Nancy's so overrated. She needs to get back to work. The president's working. Just look at the last few months: North American trade deal, China Phase One almost papered, Baghdadi's dead, NATO allies have to pony up more money, Space Force got funded, border wall funding, stock market records getting smashed, dozens of judges approved. The do-nothing Democrats lost the case. As of today, more Americans are against impeachment than for it. Impeachment collapsed. Look at the trend line here. It's a nosedive. And Trump approval ratings averaging close to his all-time highs, higher than Barack Obama's was, at this point in his first term. And this latest poll has Trump beating every single Democrat head-to-head, doing even better in the swing states. Just to give you a sense of how impeachment played in the swing states, take Pennsylvania. During the height of the hearings this fall, here's what people in the swing state, P.A., were searching for on Google. See the yellow and the green spikes there? Those are Steelers and the Eagles. At the bottom, you see, you could barely see it, that's red. That's impeachment. You don't care about political football. You care about the real thing. You all knew Democrats were just throwing a temper tantrum. Nancy's out there shushing her members like moms do at church. Nancy Pelosi Article one is adopted."

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Remember, she was the one who said, \"Impeach the MF'er\" six months before the perfect phone call? The media couldn’t contain itself either. Here’s the Washington Post political team dinner, straight news reporters here, smiling and toasting, wishing everybody a, quote, “Merry Impeachmas” on the big night. They had to delete that. They wouldn’t want everyone to think they were biased or anything like that. Now, the left went crazy, and here we are. They couldn’t recover from Hillary losing, so they tried to frame Trump and kick him out. Mueller failed; impeachment failed. Now they’re out of ammo. It’s like in a movie when the bad guy runs out of bullets. Click, click. What are they going to do now? They’re going to run out another dossier, another Access Hollywood tape, another whistleblower? They don’t have any card left to play. Only Biden can save them now. Would you want your fate in sleepy Joe’s hands? Everything the left threw at Trump made him stronger. That’s because it’s not about him. It’s about you and the issues Trump’s fighting for. Trump completely changed the Republican Party. He modernized it, injected populism into it. He’s a post-post-Cold War president. He advanced new trade terms to keep jobs in America, new security deals in the Pacific, Mideast, and Europe. He strengthened the border. Energy independence, low taxes, taking care of the vets. Law and order, honoring our flag, history, and shared heritage. To hell with political correctness. This “America First” message -- that’s a majority message. That message broke down the blue wall and redrew the electoral college map. This terrifies Democrats. It’s a mortal threat to the national Democrat Party. It locks Democrats out of the heartland in a coast-only minority. Now, they’re trying to take Trump out dirty because he stole their states and their voters, and he’s going to do it again. It’s about power with the Democrats. You have it, and they want it. That’s what this is about. Here with reaction, Republican congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina. All right, Congressman, what do you think about all this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Meadows",
      "utterance": "Listen, Jesse, you’re spot-on. There’s nothing serious about what Nancy Pelosi has done, other than the fact that she was serious about trying to get a political advantage, and you’re pointing it out. They’re actually not just coming after Donald Trump; they’re coming after every single person who vote for Donald Trump. This is all about making sure that 233 Democrats -- well, excuse me, 232 Democrats -- actually, you know, will supplant their will for the will of the people. But there’s also one other glaring thing that you need to point out. Nancy Pelosi wants to control what happens in the Senate. She wants to bring new witnesses. I thought their whole case was unbelievably ironclad and certainly beyond anything that we could ever imagine, and yet she wants more witnesses. That’s because there’s a flaw in the case that she’s already made."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "And she’s exposed herself by playing these games, and it looks partisan. It looks political, and McConnell is not going to put up with any of this. I don’t know what’s going on in the Senate or how it’s going to shake out, but it’s not going to shake out in Nancy’s favor, I'll tell you that. So, you’re now -- you walk around the halls of Congress; you see your colleagues, you see Nancy, Schiff, Nadler. What’s it like? What’s the atmosphere like right now in Congress?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Meadows",
      "utterance": "Well, a lot of the Democrats were wearing black to try to put on this PR stunt as if it was a somber mood. They’re putting on black because for a lot of them, this is their political funeral. I can tell you they’re high-fiving in the hallways --"

      "speaker": "Mark Meadows",
      "utterance": "-- if they’re from a real Democrat district, a real progressive district. The rest of them are very scared, and they should be, because the American people -- just like you pointed out, the American people are seeing beyond this. This is nothing more than a political stunt, and you’re right, Mitch McConnell is not going to listen to Nancy Pelosi, and neither are the other 53 Republicans that are over there. This is ultimately going to be decided by them and the American people, and I can tell you, the American people are not buying the argument that Nancy and her colleagues have put forth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Yeah, that’s pretty selfish if these deep-blue Democrat district representatives are out there high-fiving, fist-bumping, celebrating, spiking the football, because I don’t see how Nancy keeps the gavel after this stunt, do you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Meadows",
      "utterance": "Well, I don’t. I can tell you that what happens is in some of those states that you were talking about, the traditional states that no Republican was ever supposed to win, and yet Donald Trump won them. What’s happening is many of those Democrat members of Congress will go home. This may be the only, quote, “important” vote that they ever take, because what’s going to happen is when 2020 rolls around, they’re going to find themselves on the losing side of the vote tally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

    {
      "speaker": "Mark Meadows",
      "utterance": "You know, I’m going to continue to fight for this president, I don't care where I am. We’re going to continue to fight right now. We’ve got a job to do, and that’s to make sure the American people see this impeachment scam for what it is. I’m going to fight with Jim Jordan and John Ratcliffe, Matt Gaetz, and others, and as we look at that, I can tell you we’re going to stay in the fight, because the job of actually returning America to its rightful owner, we the people, is not done. We’re going to get Donald Trump reelected, and I’m all in for that."

      "utterance": "All right. You wouldn’t tell me anyway. Thank you very much, Congressman Meadows. Let’s bring in former White House press secretary Sean Spicer; the host of “Get Tammy Bruce” on Fox Nation, Tammy Bruce, and former Republican congressman and Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz. Congressman, what do you think about impeachment? Where does it go now that Nancy is trying to play games with the Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jason Chaffetz",
      "utterance": "She is totally playing games. I think it’s an admission that Donald Trump is stronger politically that he has ever been. The fact that they very quickly had to add in the USMCA, which is good for the country, but could have done a year ago -- it was a card that Nancy Pelosi had to play and say, “Oh, we’ve been distracted by impeachment, but by the way, we can walk and chew gum, too.” But what --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Now, with the do-nothing Democrats, Tammy, that’s starting to hurt them, I think. That’s why they caved on USMCA."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tammy Bruce",
      "utterance": "Well, they’re trying to figure out. They’ve seen the numbers go down. They’ve realized they’ve convinced no one. And it’s not even a static position. The numbers have gone down for them; they’ve gone up for Trump. They remain perplexed at why Americans are responding the way they are, and it’s because they’ve refused to engage with the American people on what’s changed. I can tell you, though, this is exactly like the Kavanaugh situation, trying to destroy a man in public with a pseudo-trial and then dropping him out into the public with no real way to get that reputation back."
    },

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tammy Bruce",
      "utterance": "And this is what they’re doing. This is what they also want to do to the American society. This is the nature of this group of people. Of course, it wouldn’t be different."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Yeah, they’re --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sean Spicer",
      "utterance": "I think the other point, to touch on what Jason said; Pelosi basically made 31 of those Democrats that are in Trump districts walk the plank for her, and part of the reason she put USMCA up right away was to give them a -- “Hey, you just walked the plank. Now I’m giving you a talking point to say you did something.” The interesting thing to me was when she was caught in the hallway of the Capitol by reporters saying, “We want to talk to you about impeachment.” The morning after she voted on it, she said, “I’m done talking about it.” I mean, it was like, you just did one -- a very historic thing, and yet now you don’t want to even talk about it. The other thing that -- when you started the question with Jason, you said, “What happens next?” I think any 3-year-old or 6-year-old that’s watched Schoolhouse Rock knows the House passes a bill, it goes to the Senate. I mean, in this case, it’s a little different, but you have Nancy Pelosi who tells us how important impeachment is. “We need to pass it. Everything is at stake. The Constitution” -- it passes, and she goes, “I don’t know if I’m going to send it to the Senate.” What -- I mean, that -- it isn’t --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "-- because we needed a rest. All right. Also, big news in John Durham’s investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, New York Times reporting Durham now looking into the role of ex-CIA direction John Brennan, that he played in the investigation. Durham has requested all of his emails, his call logs, and a bunch of other documents from the Central Intelligence Agency. AG Bill Barr weighed in on this with Martha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bill Barr",
      "utterance": "He’s not just looking at the FBI. He’s looking at other agencies, and also private -- and departments and also private actors. And so, it’s a much broader investigation. And also, he’s not just looking at the FISA aspect of it. He is looking at all the conduct, both before and after the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Congressman, you think John Brennan is a little nervous?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jason Chaffetz",
      "utterance": "He should be nervous, and he should start lawyering up, because this is an admission, I think, and a hint from the Attorney General that this goes far beyond just the FBI. You know, the IG report starts with a friendly foreign government meets with Papadopoulos. Why? Like, why was a friendly foreign government meeting with a kid in his twenties with basically no background? The predicate is what they’re looking at, and most importantly, I think what Durham and Barr can do that Horowitz could never do is issue subpoenas and look at the flow of money. If you want to see the Democrats, they spent millions of dollars. Who got those millions of dollars? Why did they get those millions of dollars? Follow the money and I think that's where this is going [unintelligible]."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sean Spicer",
      "utterance": "Well, also, it's important to note the Horowitz investigation report was limited in the scope of where it could look and the subject. So, it looks -- had to stay within the Department of Justice. Durham's investigation goes across everything. So, to Jason's point, if it started somewhere but ended over here, Horowitz had to keep his investigation very, very focused and linear. The ability of Durham, now, to look across these agencies and see where it started, where it went, who touched it, when it went back is going to be, I think, mind-blowing when we finally uncover this."

    {
      "speaker": "Tammy Bruce",

On January 5th, I was in the room with the president when those intelligence chiefs briefed President-elect Trump, they asked -- Comey asked President-elect Trump to wait, stand behind in the room while we all exited, and let him know that there was this addendum to this report, it was no big deal, we should --"

    {
      "speaker": "Sean Spicer",

Trump, at the time, had said -- was questioning, you know, maybe the outcome of the election. And they said, \"We want you to have the utmost faith in the integrity of the system. When we vote, we want the parties to be able to come out and say, 'This was a fair vote, we have this under control, there's no threats.'\" So, there were no threat three weeks out. Two weeks after the election, suddenly, we're talking about Russian influence. It is just amazing how the government handled it when they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win it."

The unemployment numbers are a record low: African-Americans, Latinos, young voters. The numbers are amazing. The stock market is even greater. But what Biden is trying to do is he's trying to focus on the ideology of climate change, combining that with the economy and the cost of living. And when he talked about the middle class, the struggling middle class, that resonated with Democrats, but it will not resonate in November."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

And, Kayleigh, even CNN has a poll: 76 percent of Americans say, \"The economy is really good right now.\" I just don't see how the Democrats can sell this economic message."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kayleigh McEnany",
      "utterance": "No, they certainly can't. You know, they're trying to paint a picture that does not comport with the reality Americans are feeling, the reality that is in those poll numbers. But you're exactly right to point to Joe Biden's record under eight years of Obama and Biden. We had the slowest economic recovery since World War II, hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs hemorrhaged, and now you have Joe Biden doubling down on that policy, saying, “Yeah, I’m prepared to eliminate hundreds of thousands more,” the same ones President Trump has re-added to the economy. Not a winning message. You will be hearing that soundbite again from our campaign, I can assure you of that, in the general election."

How does he strangle himself to death with this little -- sitting on the first bunk of a bunk bed, how does he manage to get enough torque to break his neck and kill himself? I thought that the cop -- who’s facing the death penalty, incidentally; he’d be the first since the Rosenberg nuclear spies back in the ‘50s to actually be executed in the federal court system, in the New York area, at least. So, he’s facing the death penalty, accused of killing four people, and they put this guy in jail with Jeffrey Epstein, the multi-multimillionaire that everybody wants dead.
