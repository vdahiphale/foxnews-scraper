How dare Trump bad mouth his favorite fantasy.  Still, however, there was a lot here for the liberals to like, shrinking the military footprint, paid family leave, aids funding, childhood cancer treatment. Yet, all they can do is stare blankly with all the seriousness of sad pastry chefs. How do you know when you've done good? When the people who can't stand you all look like villains at the end of a Karate Kid sequel. But there was also good stuff, variety too, more defense spending, a defense for the unborn, a hardline stance on Russia and China, NATO paying its fair share. If I didn't know any different, I'd say there was something for everyone. And Trump did stress unity.",

So right on cue they react out of anger and fear, fear that Trump wasn't divisive which threatens the business model, for conflict leads to profit and compromise won't pay the bills. Then came the reality check from CBS, 76 percent of viewers actually approved of the speech.  That's a contrast with the Dems and the media. Could it be they were facing the wrong direction all this time? Which is why the Democratic response written before Trump's speech fell flat. It was like an NFL commercial after a final play. You know who won so why stick around for that?  All right, let's just go around this lovely table and ask what people's favorite or least favorite moments are. Why don't I start with you, Dana.

Another key line I thought was this was an American agenda, not a Republican or Democratic agenda. And victory isn't winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. And he challenged the Congress to choose greatness instead of partisan destruction. I agree with Dana, the socialist line telegraphed 2020. He's going to say they're for socialism. I'm for freedom. And, you know, he smoked Hillary. Imagine what he's going to do with an actual socialist. It's going to be deadly, laid out areas of cooperation, like NAFTA, and I think medicine prices and things like that. But I think I was a real sucker for the end when he said, you know, from the rocky shores of Maine, from the volcanic peaks of Hawaii, we need to kind of keep faith in American destiny, keep America first, and keep our souls together.

The latest comes from Attorney General Mark Herring, he admitted today to wearing black face during a college party in 1980. That means the three top lawmakers in the state, all Democrats, are embroiled in controversy. The governor, Ralph Northam, still resisting calls to resign. He's admitted to also wearing black face. And the states Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is in a public back-and-forth with a woman who is accusing him of sexual assault.  College professor Vanessa Tyson releasing a statement today that says in part, quote, \"Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience in service to his political ambitions and has threatened litigation. Given his false assertions I'm compelled to make clear what happened,\" end quote. Tyson goes on to detail a 2004 consensual encounter that she claims turned into a physical assault. Fairfax put out his own statement denying the charges and saying, quote, at no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions, neither during that encounter nor during the months following it when she stayed in touch with me, nor the past 15 years, end quote. How do you make sense of this, Dana?",

Yet, all they can do is stare blankly with all the seriousness of sad pastry chefs. How do you know when you've done good? When the people who can't stand you all look like villains at the end of a Karate Kid sequel. But there was also good stuff, variety too, more defense spending, a defense for the unborn, a hardline stance on Russia and China, NATO paying its fair share. If I didn't know any different, I'd say there was something for everyone. And Trump did stress unity."

Then came the reality check from CBS, 76 percent of viewers actually approved of the speech. That's a contrast with the Dems and the media. Could it be they were facing the wrong direction all this time? Which is why the Democratic response written before Trump's speech fell flat. It was like an NFL commercial after a final play.

I thought he successfully took unifying historical achievements in America like landing on the moon and landing on the beaches of Normandy, and made people focus on that towards the future and say these are the kind of patriotic things we should rally around. Another key line I thought was this was an American agenda, not a Republican or Democratic agenda. And victory isn't winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country. And he challenged the Congress to choose greatness instead of partisan destruction. I agree with Dana, the socialist line telegraphed 2020. He's going to say they're for socialism. I'm for freedom. And, you know, he smoked Hillary. Imagine what he's going to do with an actual socialist. It's going to be deadly, laid out areas of cooperation, like NAFTA, and I think medicine prices and things like that. But I think I was a real sucker for the end when he said, you know, from the rocky shores of Maine, from the volcanic peaks of Hawaii, we need to kind of keep faith in American destiny, keep America first, and keep our souls together. And it was a beautiful finish. And my part that I didn't like was when all of the women dressed in white were applauding louder for themselves than they were for American people and their accomplishment."

So they can't applaud for the life of an unborn child. In terms of 2020, he's going to force everyone running for any office in the Democratic Party to come out and say, OK, I want to be one of the seven nations in the world that allows abortions after 20 weeks.

Oh, that caravan is approaching, they're deadly. You think oh, my gosh. Is he going back to the same old song again? Look, everybody knows that was a one-hit wonder and isn't working. And he doesn't talk about the fact that the national emergency thing is totally ridiculous even among Republicans at this juncture.

The latest comes from Attorney General Mark Herring, he admitted today to wearing black face during a college party in 1980. That means the three top lawmakers in the state, all Democrats, are embroiled in controversy. The governor, Ralph Northam, still resisting calls to resign. He's admitted to also wearing black face. And the states Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is in a public back-and-forth with a woman who is accusing him of sexual assault. College professor Vanessa Tyson releasing a statement today that says in part, quote, \"Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience in service to his political ambitions and has threatened litigation. Given his false assertions I'm compelled to make clear what happened,\" end quote. Tyson goes on to detail a 2004 consensual encounter that she claims turned into a physical assault. Fairfax put out his own statement denying the charges and saying, quote, at no time did she express to me any discomfort or concern about our interactions, neither during that encounter nor during the months following it when she stayed in touch with me, nor the past 15 years, end quote. How do you make sense of this, Dana?"

So I imagine that the calls from Democrats for Northam to resign will soon start to subside. He's even floated the idea of becoming an independent, but I don't see how that gets away from the issues that people have said that they're concerned about. When it comes to Fairfax and Tyson, it's interesting -- here we go again, except for now, you know, you have Democrats who are avoiding talking to the press, and they didn't avoid before. And, I think -- I don't know where it goes from here. Hypocrisy, I guess, is what makes the political world go round. But when you're talking about people's lives, he deserves due process.

And he went, I'm 82. No. I've never seen anybody do that. And I want to just bring up the issue of -- growing up in such a tiny little town in rural Virginia, like, we had to face and try and overcome the legacy of segregation, of the Jim Crow era, of discrimination, of bigotry and racism. I think -- certainly, my family and all the people I was lucky to grow up with, black-and-white and people of all races, that there was a greater sensitivity to what was hurtful to other people, to what was offensive and objectionable.

He's been working on the statewide racial reconciliation project to commemorate the 400th anniversary, the first African slaves that were brought to the state.

And -- what he's name? The comedian Tom Arnold said something which kind of goes to your point, Dagen. He said I grew up in Iowa. I've been to a thousand parties, went to the University of Iowa, recovering alcoholic, been arrested seven times, once for nudity in an old folks home, and I have never seen anybody in blackface. Virginia is for weirdos. And a lot of people are saying to themselves, what is happening in the state of Virginia right now? We just don't understand.
