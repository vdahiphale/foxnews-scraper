They have talked about it as necessary stimulus and they've emphasized the spending aspects of that. That's not something that's going to appeal to Republicans in the House of Representatives and I don't think it ought to appeal to Republicans in the House of Representatives.

Jim Manzi is a policy analyst who has done good work on how to do smart infrastructure spending. He talks about the importance of coming up with projects that help regional or national interests and can enable private wealth generation as opposed to just being, again, these handouts. So we have a lot to learn about this infrastructure bill and how much it goes from the normal way of doing it to this better way of doing it.

And of course we know that it has to be paid for so it can pass us back. The reality is that with all of the talk of investment in infrastructure, $1.5 trillion is about the same as the tax bill.

It's really clear the nation's infrastructure is actually falling apart. Our roads, our bridges, all of it. So if Republicans are really serious about talking about infrastructure, we have to do thinks like think about how we pay for it. What about the gas tax that hasn't been increased in 25 years?
