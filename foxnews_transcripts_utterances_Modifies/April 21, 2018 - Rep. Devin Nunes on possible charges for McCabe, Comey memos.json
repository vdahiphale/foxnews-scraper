      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. And thank you once again for making \"Justice\" number one again last weekend all weekend long. I very much appreciate your tuning in.  We have a packed show tonight. My exclusive interview with House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes is moments away. Plus White House Spokesperson Hogan Gidbley, Senator Chuck Grassley and Congressman Jim Jordan are all ahead.  But first my opening statement.  Don't you love it when arrogant egomaniacs are hoisted on their own petards? FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe now know the pain of those petards. The Department of Justice is investigating Andrew McCabe now after an Obama appointed IG made a criminal referral, and pompous Cardinal Comey is now being investigated for leaking classified information. And Comey's memos were released this week and they were supposed to lay out the real reason for his firing, that Donald Trump was colluding with the Russians and Donald Trump was looking to obstruct justice. Well, unfortunately, for the Democrats and the mainstream media, they proved just the opposite and they go against virtually everything that Comey has said about Trump.  Now because he didn't trust the president, Comey made notes of his presidential meetings. The memos were written contemporaneous with the meetings, one within five minutes of the meeting. Contemporaneous notes carry great weight because they're made almost immediately after the event when the memory is fresh. But unfortunately, for Jim Comey, they do not support his narrative. In fact, they prove the opposite. They prove one, that the president encouraged the FBI Director to investigate the issue of collusion between anyone on the Trump campaign and Russia.  Number two, the president encouraged the FBI Director to investigate the Steele dossier, and number three, the president wanted to make sure that his administration was free of leaks.   And here's the rub, the meeting with the president by Comey was a set-up to allow CNN to go forward with a negative story about the president and to create the illusion of Russia collusion. Comey himself admits to the president, CNN wants to go forward with a story because some leaker gave them the dossier. But there needs to be a news hook. So, the meeting for the discussion about the dossier would be the hook, and four days later, CNN had the story that Comey told the president about that salacious dossier and Comey himself was the one who created the hook. But folks, it gets even better. James Clapper, the man I told you last week that Jim Comey said he admires most in government, who we already know is a liar, based on his -- we don't spy on Americans, well, not wittingly at least.   Clapper told Comey to meet with the president to speak about the dossier. Comey is dumb enough to admit it in the memo. He then says -- this is Comey speaking, \"I then executed the session exactly as I had planned. I said the Russians allegedly had the tapes involving him and prostitutes in Moscow,\" so that they could lend credence to the hyped up Russia collusion investigation. Trump however interjects saying there were never prostitutes. Comey lied and said the FBI is keeping a close hold on that dossier so there would be no excuse for it to expose his story. So let me make it real simple. Clapper tells Comey to meet with the president, to alert him about the prostitutes, which is a pretext to create a news hook so that CNN can leak the story about the prostitutes. But once Comey is fired, he decides he's going to leak information to get to the New York Times now that the Department of Justice is looking at that leak of classified information.",

Now you need to put things in the public square to get a special counsel? Why? Your memo, the first one, was actually sent to the FBI, to McCabe and company, and since there clearly wasn't anything criminal in that memo, then what's with your hogwash about you need to get information into the public square to get a special counsel appointed. Jim, it's so obvious. You're fired and you're mad. You're a liar and you're a leaker. You're pompous. You're egotistical and you're condescending and you violate the very laws that you are sworn to uphold because you want to make news, because you want to write a book, because you want to be a hero and because you don't think the rules apply to you and because you, like your friend, McCabe according to the Inspector General do it for personal gain.  News flash, you didn't have a right to leak that information. Once you took those memos out of the building to leak to the New York Times, you, James Comey, committed a crime. You had no right to do that. They were not personal notes. They were not memos to yourself. They were memos to other FBI agents.  And if Donald Trump needed investigating, Jim, answer me this, why didn't you investigate him when you were the highest ranking law enforcement official in the nation? Why? Because there was no investigation that was needed, and it was secondary in any event. It was phony. You needed to make yourself the protagonist, and now we know that but for those memos and your illegal leak to the New York Times, Robert Mueller wouldn't be doing what he's doing and that is tearing at the fabric of this country, and ain't it bittersweet irony, Jim, that both you and McCabe are being looked at for the same thing that Hillary was looked at. You are in the same boat as she, but you let her loose because you said she didn't intend to have classified information on her server. But Jim, you hoisted yourself on your own petard when you made it clear that you intended to release those classified memos so that you could get even with the president.  You established the intent that you say was missing in Hillary's case. Jim, the FBI is not proud of you. You're a former FBI Director out there discussing matters presently under investigation as the Special Counsel is doing that very thing. Where do you come off publishing a book about issues under investigation? Even admitting what you leaked was secret and therefore classified.   But you protest, I don't do sneaky things. I don't leak. I don't make weasel moves. Jim, are you schizo? On the one hand, you lie to the president that you don't leak and the whole point of the memo was to leak it and now on your book tour, you say it is true, I am a leaker. And Jim, you're a political operative too. You wanted Hillary Clinton to be president. You even changed the definition of the law to let her get away with it, and you played along with Loretta Lynch so that she could get away with it.",

You knew from the get go that you were going to cut Hillary loose, and you knew from your time in the Obama administration that you would go after Donald Trump. You've deceived the American people. And as a result, you, the Director of the FBI, are under investigation for leaking classified information.   You could be looked at for theft of government property, obstruction of justice yourself, and a clear abuse of power. And if I were a betting woman, I'd bet that your friend Clapper is another one soon to be under investigation. And the bittersweet irony for all Americans is that we will be able to watch you fight each other, Andrew McCabe who says you told him repeatedly that it was okay to leak to the Wall Street Journal, and Loretta Lynch whom you accused of pressuring you not to call Hillary's case an investigation.  So, now folks the whole idea of Russian collusion with the Donald Trump campaign fades into obscurity. We now know and we now see the deep state doing what it does best, state actors protecting each other and like-minded members of the system. But if there's any justice, and the Department of Justice is independently run, you'll all be made accountable. And finally, Jim, you've done more damage to the FBI as an institution than J. Edgar Hoover because your mission was to change the course of American presidential history.  The only difference between you J. Edgar is that he wore dresses and even if you wanted to, you probably couldn't get one to fit you at 6 feet 8 inches.  And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine. And according to his own words Comey says on several occasions that they were not investigating the president. Here with reaction to my opening state and all developing stories tonight, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley who joins me now.  All right, good evening, Hogan. How are you?",

So, if DOJ can't deliver them, then the executive branch is going to have to step in, or Congress is going to have to go to these great lengths to get this. And what I am worried about here and I don't think it's a big secret about it, that they are just trying to stall.

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. And thank you once again for making \"Justice\" number one again last weekend all weekend long. I very much appreciate your tuning in. We have a packed show tonight. My exclusive interview with House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes is moments away. Plus White House Spokesperson Hogan Gidbley, Senator Chuck Grassley and Congressman Jim Jordan are all ahead. But first my opening statement. Don't you love it when arrogant egomaniacs are hoisted on their own petards? FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe now know the pain of those petards. The Department of Justice is investigating Andrew McCabe now after an Obama appointed IG made a criminal referral, and pompous Cardinal Comey is now being investigated for leaking classified information. And Comey's memos were released this week and they were supposed to lay out the real reason for his firing, that Donald Trump was colluding with the Russians and Donald Trump was looking to obstruct justice. Well, unfortunately, for the Democrats and the mainstream media, they proved just the opposite and they go against virtually everything that Comey has said about Trump. Now because he didn't trust the president, Comey made notes of his presidential meetings. The memos were written contemporaneous with the meetings, one within five minutes of the meeting. Contemporaneous notes carry great weight because they're made almost immediately after the event when the memory is fresh. But unfortunately, for Jim Comey, they do not support his narrative. In fact, they prove the opposite. They prove one, that the president encouraged the FBI Director to investigate the issue of collusion between anyone on the Trump campaign and Russia. Number two, the president encouraged the FBI Director to investigate the Steele dossier, and number three, the president wanted to make sure that his administration was free of leaks. And here's the rub, the meeting with the president by Comey was a set-up to allow CNN to go forward with a negative story about the president and to create the illusion of Russia collusion. Comey himself admits to the president, CNN wants to go forward with a story because some leaker gave them the dossier. But there needs to be a news hook. So, the meeting for the discussion about the dossier would be the hook, and four days later, CNN had the story that Comey told the president about that salacious dossier and Comey himself was the one who created the hook. But folks, it gets even better. James Clapper, the man I told you last week that Jim Comey said he admires most in government, who we already know is a liar, based on his -- we don't spy on Americans, well, not wittingly at least. Clapper told Comey to meet with the president to speak about the dossier. Comey is dumb enough to admit it in the memo. He then says -- this is Comey speaking, \"I then executed the session exactly as I had planned. I said the Russians allegedly had the tapes involving him and prostitutes in Moscow,\" so that they could lend credence to the hyped up Russia collusion investigation. Trump however interjects saying there were never prostitutes. Comey lied and said the FBI is keeping a close hold on that dossier so there would be no excuse for it to expose his story. So let me make it real simple. Clapper tells Comey to meet with the president, to alert him about the prostitutes, which is a pretext to create a news hook so that CNN can leak the story about the prostitutes. But once Comey is fired, he decides he's going to leak information to get to the New York Times now that the Department of Justice is looking at that leak of classified information."

      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "My judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square, and so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter, I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a Special Counsel, and so I asked a close friend of mine to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Jim, you're the head of the FBI. You told the president in that memo repeatedly, your memos that the president wasn't under investigation. You get fired. Now you need to put things in the public square to get a special counsel? Why? Your memo, the first one, was actually sent to the FBI, to McCabe and company, and since there clearly wasn't anything criminal in that memo, then what's with your hogwash about you need to get information into the public square to get a special counsel appointed. Jim, it's so obvious. You're fired and you're mad. You're a liar and you're a leaker. You're pompous. You're egotistical and you're condescending and you violate the very laws that you are sworn to uphold because you want to make news, because you want to write a book, because you want to be a hero and because you don't think the rules apply to you and because you, like your friend, McCabe according to the Inspector General do it for personal gain. News flash, you didn't have a right to leak that information. Once you took those memos out of the building to leak to the New York Times, you, James Comey, committed a crime. You had no right to do that. They were not personal notes. They were not memos to yourself. They were memos to other FBI agents. And if Donald Trump needed investigating, Jim, answer me this, why didn't you investigate him when you were the highest ranking law enforcement official in the nation? Why? Because there was no investigation that was needed, and it was secondary in any event. It was phony. You needed to make yourself the protagonist, and now we know that but for those memos and your illegal leak to the New York Times, Robert Mueller wouldn't be doing what he's doing and that is tearing at the fabric of this country, and ain't it bittersweet irony, Jim, that both you and McCabe are being looked at for the same thing that Hillary was looked at. You are in the same boat as she, but you let her loose because you said she didn't intend to have classified information on her server. But Jim, you hoisted yourself on your own petard when you made it clear that you intended to release those classified memos so that you could get even with the president. You established the intent that you say was missing in Hillary's case. Jim, the FBI is not proud of you. You're a former FBI Director out there discussing matters presently under investigation as the Special Counsel is doing that very thing. Where do you come off publishing a book about issues under investigation? Even admitting what you leaked was secret and therefore classified. But you protest, I don't do sneaky things. I don't leak. I don't make weasel moves. Jim, are you schizo? On the one hand, you lie to the president that you don't leak and the whole point of the memo was to leak it and now on your book tour, you say it is true, I am a leaker. And Jim, you're a political operative too. You wanted Hillary Clinton to be president. You even changed the definition of the law to let her get away with it, and you played along with Loretta Lynch so that she could get away with it."

The same day that you said Hillary would be a better president, you demur and say, it's too hard to go back in time and answer whether she'd be a better president when asked a few hours earlier. Jim, do your answers depend on the time of day or on medication? Jim, it isn't working. You're trying to look like an objective individual, until you again admit that you're not."

    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "I see the Republican Party as near as I can tell reflects now entirely Donald Trump's values, which is it doesn't reflect values at all. It's transactional. It is ego driven. It is in service to his ego."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "So, she'd be a better president, but Jim, you need to be careful. You need to be very, very careful. You knew from the get go that you were going to cut Hillary loose, and you knew from your time in the Obama administration that you would go after Donald Trump. You've deceived the American people. And as a result, you, the Director of the FBI, are under investigation for leaking classified information. You could be looked at for theft of government property, obstruction of justice yourself, and a clear abuse of power. And if I were a betting woman, I'd bet that your friend Clapper is another one soon to be under investigation. And the bittersweet irony for all Americans is that we will be able to watch you fight each other, Andrew McCabe who says you told him repeatedly that it was okay to leak to the Wall Street Journal, and Loretta Lynch whom you accused of pressuring you not to call Hillary's case an investigation. So, now folks the whole idea of Russian collusion with the Donald Trump campaign fades into obscurity. We now know and we now see the deep state doing what it does best, state actors protecting each other and like-minded members of the system. But if there's any justice, and the Department of Justice is independently run, you'll all be made accountable. And finally, Jim, you've done more damage to the FBI as an institution than J. Edgar Hoover because your mission was to change the course of American presidential history. The only difference between you J. Edgar is that he wore dresses and even if you wanted to, you probably couldn't get one to fit you at 6 feet 8 inches. And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine. And according to his own words Comey says on several occasions that they were not investigating the president. Here with reaction to my opening state and all developing stories tonight, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley who joins me now. All right, good evening, Hogan. How are you?"

The Democrats say that it proves that Donald Trump was colluding with the Russians, and yet the president in James Comey's words and his own memo is saying I want you to look into this collusion thing, I want you to look into leaking. I want you to look into this dossier. He says it repeatedly. Is Comey schizo? What's going on with this guy?"

He lied it and he leaked and then lied about leaking. And the best part was, he didn't just do it once. He set up a systematic way in which he could get to one of his friends to take classified information, he classified the document."

It's incredible what this guy has done and he is disgraced at every level, the head of the FBI using politics, poll numbers and personal bias to do his job, the American people should be outraged and it is dangerous for us as American citizens when someone behaves this way."

That's the only thing that's not leaked. I mean, if you can't figure this out, you know -- go ahead, Hogan."

He's been on every single newscast, every single interview, and he can't get his own story straight. He's lying again about lying before. It's incredible what this person has done. It is incredible that he, you know, he was the most hated person in Washington, DC until President Trump fired him. Now he's the toast of the town. He's all over every network because they want him to say bad things about Donald Trump. The problem is, it's falling flat. There are no revelations in here except for one, and that is the higher loyalty James Comey talks about is to no one but himself. He has completely ignored the American people, their will in electing Donald Trump. He has done a horrible job at the FBI, not doing his job and turning his back on fairness. It's incredible what's going on."

Therefore, he broke the law. He totally made up things that he said I said and he's already a proven liar and a leaker. Where are the memos on Clinton, Lynch and others?\" The part that I want to ask you is, where do you think this ends up? Do you have a Department of Justice that you are confident can go forward with this?"

I think this is the beginning and more stuff is going to come out. There's serious problems with what he did, as you know, classified information touched his hands and then he leaked it out to the public. That's a serious problem we should all be concerned."

All right Good Evening, Mr. Chairman. One of the things that I -- in reading the president's tweet with Hogan Gidley, at the end, the president says where are the memos on Clinton, Lynch and the others? And I think that's a good place to start with you because as I understand it, you guys have received something like, I don't know, 3,000 out of 1.2 million memos and documents. When do you think you will get them?"

The good thing is that both the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee are now also fully engaged in this and we're running out of time. The thing that I don't like about all of this is it seems like we have to get to the point where we threaten subpoena or threaten contempt or threaten impeachment before we're delivered any documents and that has to stop immediately. So, if DOJ can't deliver them, then the executive branch is going to have to step in, or Congress is going to have to go to these great lengths to get this. And what I am worried about here and I don't think it's a big secret about it, that they are just trying to stall. The Democrats, the mainstream media, I think people within DOJ and FBI, they think they can take back the House of Representatives in November. So, they're trying to stall until -- so that they can shut down these investigations come November."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

Well, isn't it interesting that the president can do that but, you know, the Department of Justice and the FBI, they procrastinate, they redact, and they also what is very upsetting to me is the FBI says Mueller has the things that you want, so we can't -- we don't have it anymore. But they lied about that. They lied about not having e-mails between the Department of Justice and the FBI on the Lynch tarmac meeting. I mean, if they are able to just be dilatory and delay, then justice delayed of course is justice denied. We can't just start being nice. When are we going to start putting teeth in what we do?"

If you remember, there has been there has been several times where we've been told documents didn't exist and then we find out days, even months, several months later that in fact documents do exist. So the fact -- and I want to go back to what you were talking about in your opening statement. Here's something else I would like your viewers to think about and to see who they believe. So, in January of 2017, we were briefed on the dossier, the now famous dossier. The dirt."

And he said well, he says I think it -- it was started from Republicans. Well, he never told us that it wasn't started by Republicans. That in fact was a lie and then he came back and said that maybe some Democrats had something to do with it, but now, you know, now he claims he didn't know the Democrats had anything to do with it. So, you are the top person at the FBI, the world's premier law enforcement agency, you are getting ready to brief the president of the United States on something that you know is unverified and salacious, that's his own words, and you don't ask the FBI and all your agents hey, where did this dossier come from? That was a simple question."

And this whole idea that it is reliable for the court but it is not reliable -- and when Stephanopoulos said to him should the president have been told that, you know, this thing was paid for by Hillary and the DNC? Do you know what he said? He said, well I don't know. Not he didn't know where it came from."

They didn't report that they were paying Fusion GPS, right? That they were digging up dirt on the Trump campaign. None of that was reported, so they ought to be suing themselves. This is nothing more than a scam to keep their base fired up. This is about the extreme left, the socialist left, wanting to never accept that the president of the United States was rightfully and duly elected, carried a number of states that nobody expected him to carry. So, this is a fund-raising scheme. It's nothing more, nothing less. It's a fund-raising scheme because the Democrats are out of money, and that's what this is about."

Andy McCabe sends out a person to leak to the Wall Street Journal trying to, you know, for his personal interest, not the public interest as the report says, the next day when the story is out there, he calls up two people not associated with the leak and yells at them and says don't let these leaks happen trying to cover his tracks.

We'd have to ask the Attorney General, but one of the questions that's come up in talking with Congressmen Zeldin and Congressman Meadows and I, we are wondering was Jeff Sessions consulted on the Cohen kick in the door raid? Because understand, this happened outside the Special Counsel. So, this wasn't under the umbrella of Robert Mueller. This goes to main justice. What we've heard in the press is Rod Rosenstein said okay, southern district of New York, go kick in the door of Michael Cohen's office and business and get these documents. I want to know, was the attorney general consulted? Because if it was not under the umbrella of the Special Counsel, Jeff Sessions conceivably shouldn't be recused, and we're talking about not just any old lawyer, we're talking about a lawyer to the president of the United States of America, that seems to be something the attorney general should be consulted. So, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Zeldin and I plan to send a letter to the Attorney General and just ask him. Were consulted? Did you approve? Were you in any way a part of that decision? Because it seems to me, he should have been."

Just weeks ago, both countries enacted a number of tariffs against each other covering everything from food to technology imports sparking fears of a trade war that could impact the global economy. And boxing legend Jack Johnson could soon receive a posthumous pardon from President Trump more than a hundred years after he was convicted by an all white jury of immorality.

There's the Jim Comey in front of Congress that hid the fact that he was engaged in an illicit investigation against the president for eight months, eight months. I will put it up there -- and then by the way, so he hides that info, judge, but then when he could hurt the president by leaking memos, what does he do?

You had a reason for asking those questions. That would be a predicate for perjury, and you know it. The problem is that we now have an Attorney General who has recused himself and you are continuing to push a bill to protect Mueller. All right, first question, do you believe Comey lied to you?"

There's some question about the constitutionality of it. I said if you get together, I will bring it up. Now, I don't necessarily -- I don't think Mueller is going to be fired. I'm not sure that there's a need for legislation, but when I make a commitment to my colleagues, that if you can get a bipartisan agreement, I am chairman of the Committee, I feel like I have a responsibility to keep my word to my colleagues."

The Senate has passed virtually no bills in the last year. The House passed over 400 bills. What are you guys doing dilly dallying about whether Mueller should be fired? You yourself have said there doesn't appear to be any evidence of collusion. Why are we wasting taxpayer money?"

I think that what I would like to do is have the people that police our system, the media, if they would be more fair in their reporting and not be so liberally oriented, it would go a long ways towards re-establishing people's confidence in our government. That's what I would change. Now, you aren't going to do that by law. That's within the discipline of journalism, but they have a lot to do with whether or not people -- or whether or not government is doing its business, whether people have confidence in the government because they are always reporting on controversy, never reporting on things where people get along."
