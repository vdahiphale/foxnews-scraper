We've been around for over 30 years and for 25 of those years, it is the commission that picks the dates, the locations, the format, and the moderators without any consultation with the campaigns and with the candidates. It was created because there were so many problems back in the early 80s as to whether or not the debates would ever take place. There could never be agreement. So, we look at this thing very, very carefully. And as I've said many, many times in this particular cycle, we're going to be guided by the medicine. We're going to be guided by those people who are advising us. We're not doctors. And as you know, the Cleveland Clinic has been advising us throughout. They went along with this decision. They've - just too many questions as to whether or not we could present this with many, many people who are going to be present in Miami, who would be vulnerable if there - we're going to catch something, if we weren't comfortable. So, we thought the best thing to do to make sure that the debate continued was to do it virtually. And that's why we came out with it. We came out with an early morning hour. We made the decision yesterday, but we didn't want to put it out yesterday because of the day before yesterday, because it would have taken over the news and therefore, what happened with the debate would have been overshadowed.",

So, it's created a real difficulty for us whether or not the Miami debate will really take place. But the president said, you don't want that kind of a debate where you're sitting in front of a computer. You're not. The provisions were that they would sit wherever they wanted to. The president could do it from the Oval Office. There would be people present, press people. Also, with Biden, people there to make sure that he wasn't reading off a teleprompter, that he's answering the questions.

But I have to take issue with a lot of that first segment. Let's be honest. What happened here? I came on your show months ago and had a conversation with you about how the campaign wanted to have debates earlier and more of them, because Coronavirus prevented both men from being out on the campaign trail in a conventional way, as in a typical campaign year. The commission said, no, we've had these rules in place since the 1980s. We're not moving. Coronavirus be damned. Now, all of a sudden, after President Trump destroys Joe Biden in a debate and after Vice President Pence crushes Kamala Harris, the next morning unilaterally, without calling our campaign for sure, I can't speak on behalf of the Biden campaign.

They walked in with their masks and then they took their masks off. They are not happy about that situation. That's why you saw that the new rules, a lot of new rules were in place last night.

What you see happening in the ground and many of this sort of Midwestern rust belt states is you see suburban voters moving away from this president and they've started moving away from him on the election night of 2016. We saw them move further away from him in 2018 in the midterm elections and now as we approach November, you're seeing suburban voters especially women say we're not sure that Donald Trump is the right choice to lead our country for the next four years. Now I understand that the polls are tightening, and you expect polls to tighten but here's a caveat. Remember, by the time we get to November 3rd, Martha, I'm pretty sure everybody on this panel have already voted and the majority of Americans have already voted. So even if the polls begin to tighten a lot of ballots were already been cast based on the debate performance from last week, debate performance from this week and what has happened prior to today.",

Look, Martha, to the question about whether the president can make up this gap, the answer from four years ago is obviously we don't know yet and nothing is decided until we say as the voters that it's over, and so, to sort of paraphrase animal house there. So, there's, there's a lot of time left but not a ton. And I would say there are two interesting dynamics that I'm watching very closely to see if there could be a replay of 2016. The first is, and this one that cuts against the president. Our new Fox News poll has him down 10 points nationally and struggling in some of those key swing states. The last time out, four years ago, his personal favorability rating was terrible but so was Hillary Clinton's. They were both historically unpopular. In the new poll out yesterday, Trump is down 10, you know, minus 10 on personal favorability. Joe Biden is plus 16, he is nowhere near as disliked as Hillary Clinton. That makes that sort of that uphill climb a little bit steeper for the president. The other thing I will point out is a new Gallup poll. Asked Americans last month, are you better off today than you were four years ago at the end of the Obama administration? Fifty-six percent, a clear majority of American say, yes. So, if the Trump campaign can seize on that group of people and say we're responsible for a lot of that progress in your life, let's not turn the keys back over to the people who left office four years ago when you were feeling worse off. That could be some room there for Trump to move up.",

And the impact that COVID-19 is having on their life.

Am I really better off than I was four years ago, am I better off than I was seven months ago? Has his president really moved this country forward? Has he flattened the curve on COVID-19?

      "speaker": "FAHRENKOPF",

We've been around for over 30 years and for 25 of those years, it is the commission that picks the dates, the locations, the format, and the moderators without any consultation with the campaigns and with the candidates. It was created because there were so many problems back in the early 80s as to whether or not the debates would ever take place. There could never be agreement. So, we look at this thing very, very carefully. And as I've said many, many times in this particular cycle, we're going to be guided by the medicine. We're going to be guided by those people who are advising us. We're not doctors. And as you know, the Cleveland Clinic has been advising us throughout. They went along with this decision. They've - just too many questions as to whether or not we could present this with many, many people who are going to be present in Miami, who would be vulnerable if there - we're going to catch something, if we weren't comfortable. So, we thought the best thing to do to make sure that the debate continued was to do it virtually. And that's why we came out with it. We came out with an early morning hour. We made the decision yesterday, but we didn't want to put it out yesterday because of the day before yesterday, because it would have taken over the news and therefore, what happened with the debate would have been overshadowed."

      "speaker": "FAHRENKOPF",
      "utterance": "Not only his diagnosis and what happened in Cleveland, but what's happened in the White House in the last week or so, so many people being - having to be tested, have to be quarantined. And so, the thought was again, we're going to be driven - we're in a Coronavirus situation. And we want to make sure that everyone, not only the candidates, not only the audience, but our crew of 65 people who work in building sets and so forth, and in a town hall meeting with private citizens who are going to be there, we want to make sure that everyone is safe and we're going to go the hard way, not take a chance. And that's why we decided, if we were going to have this, we had to do it virtually to make sure that everyone was safe."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you heard President Trump's reaction to that news. He doesn't want to do it that way.

What's your response to that, Frank?"

      "speaker": "FAHRENKOPF",
      "utterance": "Our response is that certainly he knows where the Cleveland Clinic is, his doctor can work with those doctors, and when we get that certification, then we can go forward. We can't do it without that. But what's happened in the interim is when he said this morning that he wasn't going to do the debate next Thursday, the net result was the Biden people said, OK, if they're not going to do it and they decided to go elsewhere. So, it's created a real difficulty for us whether or not the Miami debate will really take place. But the president said, you don't want that kind of a debate where you're sitting in front of a computer. You're not. The provisions were that they would sit wherever they wanted to. The president could do it from the Oval Office. There would be people present, press people. Also, with Biden, people there to make sure that he wasn't reading off a teleprompter, that he's answering the questions. So, I think the president wasn't perhaps properly briefed by his people as to what we're talking about when we're talking about a virtual debate."

And the last time, as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, it's been done sort of on our system. The candidate says, yes, I've been tested, and I was negative. So that would all change now, right. It would have to be confirmed. Would both candidates be retested by the Cleveland Clinic. How would that work?"

Now, there's a new development that's just happened, Martha. I heard from someone a few hours ago from the campaign of Mr. Biden saying that while Thursday, they've got other plans, but the following week, the debate that is set in Nashville on the 22nd, they said they plan to be there and they will be there for a regular debate as it's scheduled, which will be a replica of what happened in Cleveland or if they wanted to - the Trump campaign wanted to do a town hall meeting. They would be willing to do a town hall meeting in Nashville. Subject again that we would have to be satisfied from the health standpoint. So that's brand new. I have passed that on to the president's people and we'll wait to see what happens."

They had their campaign planned and they wouldn't have a postponement or anything past the Nashville debate. But again, if the president's people can talk to them and they can reach agreement, that's another story. It takes two to tango, it takes two to debate.

They've helped shepherd him through this Coronavirus diagnosis. He's in great shape now as we all know. 24 hours, 36 hours without any symptoms. That's great news. But I have to take issue with a lot of that first segment. Let's be honest. What happened here? I came on your show months ago and had a conversation with you about how the campaign wanted to have debates earlier and more of them, because Coronavirus prevented both men from being out on the campaign trail in a conventional way, as in a typical campaign year. The commission said, no, we've had these rules in place since the 1980s. We're not moving. Coronavirus be damned. Now, all of a sudden, after President Trump destroys Joe Biden in a debate and after Vice President Pence crushes Kamala Harris, the next morning unilaterally, without calling our campaign for sure, I can't speak on behalf of the Biden campaign. They changed the debate just a week before it's supposed to happen, clearly trying to wipe off the front pages, the shellacking Kamala Harris took."

It's my understanding that the people who work in the hall were very disturbed by the fact that A, they don't know when the president got Coronavirus. So, they're wondering if maybe he had it when he was on the debate stage and didn't come clean about what his testing was or his situation. Then the first family was there. They walked in with their masks and then they took their masks off. They are not happy about that situation. That's why you saw that the new rules, a lot of new rules were in place last night. So that was a concern of theirs. So, they wanted to and obviously you can't have the debate unless you've got both sides in there. But that is also an issue here."

We know that one of our guests had on a MAGA mask and a Keep America Great hat on, they were told to take those off because they didn't want campaign propaganda.

      "utterance": "No. We know the game here. We've seen this play out now for the last four years. We get it. They're all against us. But the fact remains, the president wants to debate. He's ready, he's willing, and lord knows he's able to take it to whoever stands next to him on that debate stage. He wants more debates, but he wants them to be in-person. And he wants the debate commission to at the very least, have the conversation with the campaign. I understand people were nervous about showing up to that debate and working on behalf of the commission. Then let's have the conversation. You can't unilaterally make these decisions. It absolutely takes two to tango as Frank just talked about. The problem is the only two folks dancing are the Biden campaign and the commission, they're leaving us off to the side sitting in a chair."

And this was quite calculated on their part. But I think it tells the lie as to why the American people would rather have President Trump in the Oval Office rather than Biden-Harris ticket, which the Chinese Communist Party has endorsed.

That sound bite will live in history. I thought vice president's performance last night was masterful, but that was my sound bite, really of the night. And China, I think the most important issue in this campaign and the fact that there hasn't been enough talk about it, I think speaks to the fact that that is kind of an issue suppression.

I know the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency led by Chris Krebs has been working with state and local officials to make sure that everything goes the way it should.

So, I know there are instances that people are concerned about. And I would just mention, in my hometown where we have universal ballots going out, I have one friend who got six ballots in his mailbox for his neighbors. I have another friend who got ballots for the people who lives in their house nine years ago. So, I mean, I don't know how this can be something that you have no concerns about problems when we are seeing both nefarious acts and also just things that look like mistakes that could lead to potential nefarious acts."

Right? And start to prepare now in terms of your voting and how you are going to vote and participate, we still want you to participate. And certainly, again, be patient because on election night we may not have that official count. But again, that does not necessarily point to something wrong, it simply points to the 50 secretaries of state saying we want to get this right.

Part of that is that key race, it's a close one, a tight one in North Carolina and now this extramarital affair has that all appended. Fox News has obtained of these text messages that show Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham's apparent affair with a public relations strategist, Arlene Guzman Todd. Cunningham is married with two children. In one of these texts, Cunningham writes, quote, \"it would make my day to roll over and kiss you about now.\" And then reveals that he's, quote, \"nervous about the next 100 days.\" In another text Cunningham writes he wants to see Guzman Todd again and she replies, I don't think you realize the magnitude of what you're doing. Cunningham has canceled campaign events and largely avoided the public, though he did address this in a Facebook live event."

Then you've got some key battleground states where President Trump is behind Joe Biden but he's behind by less than he was last time around and then he ended up winning in those states, which makes people wonder if that could be the case again. So, let's a closer look at Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. North Carolina I should have said. All the states that President Trump won back in 2016, the polling averages show that President Trump is behind in those crucial states by -- there they are -- by a smaller margin than he was back then as we said. So, can he make up the ground in those states or not at this point? So, we bring in for this discussion Guy Benson, host of the Guy Benson show, and Richard Fowler, senior fellow at the New Leaders Council. Both are Fox News contributors.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I think that was a well-played approach by the vice president but let's be real. What you see happening in the ground and many of this sort of Midwestern rust belt states is you see suburban voters moving away from this president and they've started moving away from him on the election night of 2016. We saw them move further away from him in 2018 in the midterm elections and now as we approach November, you're seeing suburban voters especially women say we're not sure that Donald Trump is the right choice to lead our country for the next four years. Now I understand that the polls are tightening, and you expect polls to tighten but here's a caveat. Remember, by the time we get to November 3rd, Martha, I'm pretty sure everybody on this panel have already voted and the majority of Americans have already voted. So even if the polls begin to tighten a lot of ballots were already been cast based on the debate performance from last week, debate performance from this week and what has happened prior to today."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Although a lot of polls incorporate people have already voted saying how they voted, right? So, if the polls tighten that at least on some level would be included. Look, Martha, to the question about whether the president can make up this gap, the answer from four years ago is obviously we don't know yet and nothing is decided until we say as the voters that it's over, and so, to sort of paraphrase animal house there. So, there's, there's a lot of time left but not a ton. And I would say there are two interesting dynamics that I'm watching very closely to see if there could be a replay of 2016. The first is, and this one that cuts against the president. Our new Fox News poll has him down 10 points nationally and struggling in some of those key swing states. The last time out, four years ago, his personal favorability rating was terrible but so was Hillary Clinton's. They were both historically unpopular. In the new poll out yesterday, Trump is down 10, you know, minus 10 on personal favorability. Joe Biden is plus 16, he is nowhere near as disliked as Hillary Clinton. That makes that sort of that uphill climb a little bit steeper for the president. The other thing I will point out is a new Gallup poll. Asked Americans last month, are you better off today than you were four years ago at the end of the Obama administration? Fifty-six percent, a clear majority of American say, yes. So, if the Trump campaign can seize on that group of people and say we're responsible for a lot of that progress in your life, let's not turn the keys back over to the people who left office four years ago when you were feeling worse off. That could be some room there for Trump to move up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, it's also interesting to note that around this time in 2016, Hillary Clinton, Richard, was a under a lot of pressure. They were re-opening the e-mail investigation at that point. There was a lot downward pressure on what she was facing at this point and that doesn't appear to be the case right now for Joe Biden. What do you think, Richard, are going to be sort of the pivotal things that could change this race or could have an impact on it with 26 days to go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I think Guy is absolutely right about a couple of things. I think he's right about the likability, and he's also right about the fact that Americans will like they're doing better off. But you have to also remember what's in the front mirror -- what's in the front of the -- what's the front window for many Americans is COVID-19, right? And the impact that COVID-19 is having on their life. And the fact that the president is sort of off the chess board, right, because he is currently infected really calls us folks to look at COVID-19 once again and asked themself the critical question. Am I really better off than I was four years ago, am I better off than I was seven months ago? Has his president really moved this country forward? Has he flattened the curve on COVID-19? And that will be the argument that you're going to hear the Biden campaign push for the many -- for the next 20-some odd days."

And I think the other big issue is where do you think you're going to be four years from now because this thing will eventually be behind us, and I think Americans have to look both of these candidates to try to figure out which is the person that they want to, to lead them over the four years and we'll see what they decide.

No word on the negative tests and how many negative tests there's been so we'll continue to get the information on that. And in the meantime, the NBA signaling a, quote, \"return to normalcy next year\" doing away with some of the Black Lives Matter emblems potentially on the courts and on the jerseys and turning to other ways to support social justice.

I would say in terms of the messages you see on our courts and on the jerseys, my senses it will be somewhat a return to normalcy, that those message are -- messages will largely be left to be delivered off the floor.

They will get 15 million watching, now they were getting seven. They had an all-time low in the finals in game three in Heat and Lakers.

This is some interesting polls. Should pro athletes use their platform to express views, a 62-percent say yes. Should -- is it appropriate for athletes to kneel during the anthem to protest racial inequality? And you've got 56 percent who say it's appropriate. It's interesting, I mean, just purely anecdotal but I talked to a Vietnam veteran and a former police officer when we are out in Cleveland, and just, you know, making conversation and I said are you a Browns fan? And he said not anymore. I said why? He said the kneeling, he said it's not the team that I have supported my whole life. He grew up there, like I said, anecdotal. But what's your take?"

And he said, you know, I'm here to play sports. I don't want to get involved in black in white or politics. I don't want to turn anybody off. Now we got the other way. Everyone is involved. They are telling us to vote. We got the coach of the Seahawks yelling us to vote. We got LeBron James walking off the court with his team because of Jacob Blake, the tragedy of his shooting. What happened in Kenosha? And then we have the same thing happen in baseball and people are saying to themselves on some level, and I get it all the time, again, anecdotal.
