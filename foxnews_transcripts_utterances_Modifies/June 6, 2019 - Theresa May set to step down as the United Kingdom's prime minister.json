There are reports right now the U.S. is considering delaying tariffs, as negotiators work on a potential -- I stress -- potential deal. The Washington Post reporting that Mexico would ramp up its immigration enforcement, while giving the U.S. more latitude to deport asylum seekers.  Again, it's all tentative, but it's all anyone's talking about.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  We are live at the White House, where we believe those talks are still going on. If those negotiators come to that podium, of course, we will bring it to you live. To Rich Edson at the State Department on what he is hearing.  Hey, Rich.",

Then Mexico's foreign minister left, saying that he would very likely return to continue trying to work on this. He says they have made progress, but they have much more to make.   This is ultimately up to the president of the United States. He's the one who's going to decide that whatever agreement, if they do reach it, between U.S. and American and Mexican officials, it's up to him whether he's going to impose those tariffs come Monday. He also is saying that, because of this strategy, because of the strategy that he's essentially asking Mexico and pushing Mexico to do more on migrants and using tariffs to tie this all in, that Republicans in Congress who have been pushing back on it should be on board with the strategy.",

So I think that it makes sense. The Guatemalan border is 600 miles' long, but only less than 200 of it needs to be secured.   So offering up the National Guard, the Mexican National Guard, offering up changes to their asylum processes, I think, could have a tremendous impact in stemming the tide across our southern border.",

Prime members can get this done in under a half-an-hour. You place your order, your item comes. But one of the biggest issues for Amazon and for customers is safety. There are so many items that a drone can hit, right, a child's playhouse, a lamppost, a tree, even a human being, Neil. And that is why Amazon has packed their drone with so many lasers and sensors and artificial intelligence, so it can -- it can spot these items, not only the items and the moving objects in transit, like a chimney, for instance, but also items that it can hit on the descent down, like live wires. Those are really hard for technology to pick up. So, as Amazon tests all this, and they do have this certificate of approval from the FAA, it's only good for one year. So that's why we know that, in a matter of months, Amazon will start testing their drones, not the drone that you're looking at. We're using a Fox News drone here. But Amazon's own drones, obviously, much fancier, can get you your item. Well, it has to weigh five pounds or less, and, like I said, in 30 minutes or less, so there you have it. I don't know, toothpaste, toilet paper, phone chargers.",

I just hope, in remembering those brave men who stormed the beaches of Normandy, we start appreciating what a storm really is, what a battle really means, what sacrifice really is all about. It seems trite to call them brave, almost cliche now to call them the Greatest Generation. They are our fathers and grandfathers. They are my father. But, more, they are us, a precious few still with us, most, like my dad, gone from us, a link to our past and our potential, not only to our better selves, but our better angels. I suspect, 75 years ago, the men crowded in those boats didn't count who was Republican or who was Democrat in those boats, or who was rich or maybe not so rich, or who thought they were doing and what they were doing would be good for the economy or bad for the economy. The kind of things that seem to matter so much now didn't matter so much back then. The things that sharply divide us now, I'm betting not a single soldier in those boats even thought about back then, where the only thing more deafening than the enemy fire aimed at those boats was the eerie silence in those boats, and the awesome responsibility thrust on the ridiculously young, some not much more than teenagers, in those boats, men whose lives had yet to start. But for thousands of them in the hours to come, it would all end, the men who would never see their families, or even get a chance to start a family, who would never know the joys of victory, even as their sacrifice assured that victory. And they knew it going in, hoping, praying maybe, for them, it would all still work out, all etched in the faces of those who survive this day, well into their 90s now, quiet, dignified witnesses to the untold carnage back then, but who is long gone, but not forgotten, perhaps seeing in the sea of white crosses around them, they are not immune to time simply because they have enjoyed more time. Of the 16 million World War II American veterans, little more than 496,000 are alive today. And we're losing them fast, in fact, at the rate of 348 more each day every day. Soon, the Greatest Generation will be no more. But I refuse to believe what made them great will be no more, because we not only shared their stories. Many of us share their very DNA. You saw it in the rescue workers running into those Trade Towers on 9/11 as many more were running out, or the soldiers continuing to take on terrorists half-a-world away today, or the teenager trying to stop a school shooter who ended up dying himself, all generations since, but generations now. So don't tell me we don't have greatness within us. Look around, my friends. It is all around us. It is us. The Greatest Generation, they are us. We owe them more than platitudes this day. Perhaps the greatest honor, the greatest honor we can give them is to simply try and be a little more like them all days. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Again, it's all tentative, but it's all anyone's talking about. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. We are live at the White House, where we believe those talks are still going on.

He's the one who's going to decide that whatever agreement, if they do reach it, between U.S. and American and Mexican officials, it's up to him whether he's going to impose those tariffs come Monday. He also is saying that, because of this strategy, because of the strategy that he's essentially asking Mexico and pushing Mexico to do more on migrants and using tariffs to tie this all in, that Republicans in Congress who have been pushing back on it should be on board with the strategy."

That's why I supported you letting the president have every option available to have Mexico help us with stemming the tide of illegal immigration. Last month, more than 100,000 illegal crossings, since last October, nearly 700,000 or 800,000. That's almost the population of the city of Charlotte over the course of the past few months. So I think that it makes sense. The Guatemalan border is 600 miles' long, but only less than 200 of it needs to be secured. So offering up the National Guard, the Mexican National Guard, offering up changes to their asylum processes, I think, could have a tremendous impact in stemming the tide across our southern border."

      "utterance": "No, I don't think that's going on at all. What the president understands is the real numbers, that 80 percent of the people crossing our border are other than Mexican. They're coming through the Guatemalan gateway. And if we stem the tide there, which is a lot less geography, a lot easier to control, and if Mexico changes some of its immigration policies to strengthen its asylum claims, and to not provide basically a bus ticket or a transit pass to the southern border, then we could have an enormous impact on the tens of thousands of people crossing the border every month."

Now, you were not in that camp, but many of your colleagues are, we're told easily a dozen of them, maybe more. That still wouldn't be enough to override a likely veto if that were the case. But where do you think this is going?"

So I would just caution my colleagues in appearing to give nations a pass that should be held accountable for helping us with this problem. I don't believe that the president wants a long-term imposition of a tariff. What he wants is short-term relief on the crisis at our southern border."

    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they're trying to do everything they can to face off with a United States that's being more assertive, asserting fair trade, freer trade, and also countering aggression. We see what China is doing in the South China Sea. We see what Russia does every day. And I think that they're recognizing that going it alone probably won't work. But I doubt very seriously you're going to see a lot of cooperation between the two. What they're probably talking about is, we finally have an administration who's putting an end to some of the malign activities that they have been given a pass on for a couple of administrations.

They don't have the American people. But she's, I think, displaying and betraying the anger of the base and many in our caucus by saying, send him to prison.

And for the folks that didn't get a chance to see it, Neil, I can only describe it this way. It was absolutely gorgeous from start to finish, a chance for all of us to say thank you to the heroes of the past, 75 years ago, young and old facing absolute hell. Today, they were remembered, as leaders from around the globe paid their respects, namely, the U.S., the U.K. and France. They were joined, Neil, by the way, by many survivors, each with his own story of life and loss, honored today by President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron, and indeed the entire world, for standing in the gap to preserve peace and save the world from the Nazis."

And I think, right now, China is at the point where they hope to actually have a better relationship, so that they can leverage that in these trade negotiations with the United States.

China is going to regret this, because we already have Huawei things in our -- in our systems. I just found that out the other day at a briefing that I was in. And that's frightening, because I don't know how you can undo that. I don't know how you can correct something that I think is very dangerous in terms of them being able to collect intelligence against us to include in some of our most highly classified systems. Russia is going to deal with the same problem."

I think this is very serious. And they -- of course, they just take the attitude that, no, those are our islands, we can do what we want to with them. Well, yes, there are others who would disagree with that, particularly the Japanese. That said, you ask yourself, why are they doing this? What is their primary objective here militarily? And their short-range objective is to retake Taiwan. And I think that these islands would all work towards giving them the capability to rapidly engulf Taiwan and control what they consider to be a crown jewel, just like Hong Kong was at one time when it was under British control."

And this is a quintessential example that illustrates that this is also a national security threat. The loopholes and the abuses that are done throughout the system, in this case the visa, it's a serious problem, Neil."

      "utterance": "Well, so those are some sophisticated, very complex, multi-agency investigations. You're going to -- ICE, through the homeland security investigations, they bring a unique statutory ability on the immigration side. And they bring that to bear with other agencies like the FBI, who really have the primary lead for state-sponsored intellectual property theft like this. And we work together jointly. But they're tough, complicated, complex cases to prove."

And I say so-called because nothing has been concluded, but that the Mexicans are eager to secure a deal to ward off those tariffs that are coming next week. But part of it will allow more flexibility for us to deport more who get into this country and for them to nab more on their side in their country. If that is sort of like a vague blueprint of a potential deal, what do you think of that?"

And we will go, we will put some pressure, they will do some good things for a little bit, and then they go back to the sidelines. That has to stop. This is clearly a crisis. We need Mexico that are an integral part to be partners with us to stop this. On their southwest border, Neil -- and I think you have talked about it -- they have got 150 miles they have to secure. We have 2,000. They have pre-identified choke points that, if they just increase their interdiction there, they will absolutely make a significant difference here. We need their help. The president is right. From a law enforcement perspective, we need this pressure."

    {
      "speaker": "LAUREN SIMONETTI, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "I want it, and I want it now, Neil. And it's actually happening now. Amazon has FAA approval to start delivering your Amazon packages by drone. Prime members can get this done in under a half-an-hour. You place your order, your item comes. But one of the biggest issues for Amazon and for customers is safety. There are so many items that a drone can hit, right, a child's playhouse, a lamppost, a tree, even a human being, Neil. And that is why Amazon has packed their drone with so many lasers and sensors and artificial intelligence, so it can -- it can spot these items, not only the items and the moving objects in transit, like a chimney, for instance, but also items that it can hit on the descent down, like live wires. Those are really hard for technology to pick up. So, as Amazon tests all this, and they do have this certificate of approval from the FAA, it's only good for one year. So that's why we know that, in a matter of months, Amazon will start testing their drones, not the drone that you're looking at. We're using a Fox News drone here. But Amazon's own drones, obviously, much fancier, can get you your item. Well, it has to weigh five pounds or less, and, like I said, in 30 minutes or less, so there you have it. I don't know, toothpaste, toilet paper, phone chargers."

And it's their job to give good advice about when it's someone talking truth to power, in which case you might want to leave them in their job -- it's their job to talk truth to power -- and when, actually, there's a personality clash. It would make sense to have a change of personnel. But, on the whole, we do not fire our civil servants, even our senior ones."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That's true, Halloween, yes. What do you think of the possibility, though, that Britain could be spun off in its own little Twilight Zone, and then maybe the only one with whom it can trade initially would be the United States?"

      "speaker": "PIERCE",

We will still contribute to NATO 2 percent. We will still be a close ally, not just of the United States, but also of countries like France and Germany, but Japan. We will still be engaged in the commonwealth. So I'm not worried about the Twilight Zone point."

It is a little discombobulating, isn't it?"

But I think, in the real world, those institutions, those big institutions, the free trade system, the way financial services works, on the whole, it works in an open and transparent way that, on the whole, benefits most countries. Russia doesn't have that tradition."

I know there were some protests and all, but a lot of people seemed to gather for his events and all that stuff. So I wonder if it's overplayed, the controversies and all that. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIERCE",
      "utterance": "The president's an unusual politician. I don't think he'd mind me saying that. And Britain's a democracy. You have protests. That's all fine."

    },

      "speaker": "PIERCE",
      "utterance": "You have them in the U.S. But I think the heart of the story is really that the British people are delighted to welcome the president of the United States of America, an alliance that goes back at least to the Second World War, and actually before that. And the majority of people want to work very closely with America and were pleased to see the president."

Hope that continues, because she is very fun to watch there, and takes no guff from anyone. All right, a story on the Greatest Generation, but let's not forget that they wanted us to be great too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Seventy-five years. There is something about a nice round anniversary to put something not so nice in perspective, to rekindle what maybe some have forgotten. I just hope, in remembering those brave men who stormed the beaches of Normandy, we start appreciating what a storm really is, what a battle really means, what sacrifice really is all about. It seems trite to call them brave, almost cliche now to call them the Greatest Generation. They are our fathers and grandfathers. They are my father. But, more, they are us, a precious few still with us, most, like my dad, gone from us, a link to our past and our potential, not only to our better selves, but our better angels. I suspect, 75 years ago, the men crowded in those boats didn't count who was Republican or who was Democrat in those boats, or who was rich or maybe not so rich, or who thought they were doing and what they were doing would be good for the economy or bad for the economy. The kind of things that seem to matter so much now didn't matter so much back then. The things that sharply divide us now, I'm betting not a single soldier in those boats even thought about back then, where the only thing more deafening than the enemy fire aimed at those boats was the eerie silence in those boats, and the awesome responsibility thrust on the ridiculously young, some not much more than teenagers, in those boats, men whose lives had yet to start. But for thousands of them in the hours to come, it would all end, the men who would never see their families, or even get a chance to start a family, who would never know the joys of victory, even as their sacrifice assured that victory. And they knew it going in, hoping, praying maybe, for them, it would all still work out, all etched in the faces of those who survive this day, well into their 90s now, quiet, dignified witnesses to the untold carnage back then, but who is long gone, but not forgotten, perhaps seeing in the sea of white crosses around them, they are not immune to time simply because they have enjoyed more time. Of the 16 million World War II American veterans, little more than 496,000 are alive today. And we're losing them fast, in fact, at the rate of 348 more each day every day. Soon, the Greatest Generation will be no more. But I refuse to believe what made them great will be no more, because we not only shared their stories. Many of us share their very DNA. You saw it in the rescue workers running into those Trade Towers on 9/11 as many more were running out, or the soldiers continuing to take on terrorists half-a-world away today, or the teenager trying to stop a school shooter who ended up dying himself, all generations since, but generations now. So don't tell me we don't have greatness within us. Look around, my friends. It is all around us. It is us. The Greatest Generation, they are us. We owe them more than platitudes this day. Perhaps the greatest honor, the greatest honor we can give them is to simply try and be a little more like them all days. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
