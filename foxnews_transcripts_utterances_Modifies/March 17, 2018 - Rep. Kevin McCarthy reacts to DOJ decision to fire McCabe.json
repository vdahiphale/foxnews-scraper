      "sentences": "Breaking tonight. Andrew McCabe turns over notes he kept from President Trump to Robert Mueller just hours after McCabe is officially fired from the FBI. Hello and welcome to \"Justice\" live tonight from Los Angeles, I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us. Now, we're going to be talking about today's major developments in the Department of Justice throughout the hour with guests including GOP House Majority Leader, Ken McCarthy, Governor Mike Huckabee, Dan Bongino, Tomi Lahren and more.  But first, my Opening Statement.  So, just fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe claims victim status seeking to join that elusive hood of crooks who feign innocence when they are caught dead to right claiming his downfall is the result of a series of attacks designed to undermine his credibility and reputation.  Andy, I don't know how to break this to you, but the only reason you are even in the news is because you are a liar and when you lie under oath and to the FBI, you are a wrongdoer, you are a cheat and you are an offender. So, McCabe, are you a crook too? Consider this. General Michael Flynn who put his life on the line every day in the military lied to the FBI about something that wasn't even criminal. And, now, he's a convicted felon.  Martha Stewart lied to the FBI and she is a convicted felon who went to jail. So, you lie not only to the FBI, but to the Inspector General and under oath, and you are even given an opportunity to take it back, but you still lie. So, they are crooks, but you are not? You are in the news because the office of professional responsibility after the Inspector General's investigation says you made unauthorized disclosures to the news media and you lacked candor.  You lied about the Clinton Foundation investigation and leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times which you are not authorized to do. But we shouldn't be surprised. Your boss, Jim Comey also leaked information to get to the New York Times because he didn't have the guts to stand up and say what he wanted to say himself.   And you think you are being targeted? You are not that important. Nobody is looking to bring you down, but your wife gets $700,000.00 from the Clinton cash machine and you handled the Clinton e-mail investigation. A five-year-old could see the ethical conflict of interest. And we entrust you with the power of the greatest law enforcement agency in the nation, and you not only use to your own advantage, you use it to your political and financial advantage, and everyone knows, everyone knows that when you lie to the FBI, it results in automatic dismissal. Now, you claim that your firing is part of an effort to undermine the Special Counsel's Russia investigation. You know what? The only Russia investigation that should be going on should be the one looking into Hillary and that whole gang for the Russian -- sale of uranium to Russia, but it is going to get worse for you, Andy, when your sidekick, Peter Strzok and his girlfriend are called on the carpet for their criminality.   You lied about your relationship with Strzok who worked for you while the three of you tried to affect the presidential primary and take down a duly elected president by starting a Donald Trump-Russia inquiry when the only person who colluded with the Russians was your girlfriend, Hillary, your friend, Barack and the CFIUS committee of Clinton Foundation associates that approved the sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia with a payback to Hillary. Now, there were three pending Federal inquiries into your actions as well while you were in the FBI and you were removed from your post almost two months ago when the new FBI Director saw evidence regarding your activities. And the intrigue continues.  While you threaten Jim Comey and threatened that if you go down, everyone else will, Jim Comey writes a conciliatory tweet that, \"You stood tall over the last eight months and served with distinction for two decades.\" He's clearly hoping that you won't testify against him. This is a classic crime family takedown. Who is going to rat on whom?   If this were the movie \"The Godfather,\" Cardinal Comey is the (copper deTudi), Andrew McCabe is the enforcer. Lisa Page is both the consigliere and the (glomad) and Peter Strzok is the button man, and it looks like Strzok who signed the warrant application to the FISA court was a close friend of Judge Contreras who signed the warrant. It's so damning that the judge recommended a social setting where there couldn't be a surreptitious meet with a cover of a dinner party so the judge wouldn't be required to take himself off the case.  Even Bob Mueller knew enough to take Strzok off his investigation because Strzok was so dirty. Andy, you can complain all you want that you were unjustly fired, but the facts contradict that. You should have been fired a long time ago. You should lose your law license and you should have been taken out in cuffs.  And that's my open.  Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. And joining me now live in Justice is GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, thanks so much for being on \"Justice\" tonight. What do you say regarding the fact that McCabe is fired and he has lost his pension?",

      "sentences": "Well, you gave a great speech, but one thing you have got to look at, and I know a lot of Democrats are out there and trying to make this a political problem, but it's not. An independent, non-partisan Inspector General found the information of McCabe lying, thought it was severe enough even before its final report came forward to send it to the FBI, send it to the Ethics Department of the FBI, the OPR as you said, the Office of Professional Responsibility. They are non-partisan independent. They looked and they believe he should be fired, because every FBI agent I know, he or she believes in integrity.  There are so many people that they bring before the court that they uphold because they lie. And they did not want him to take down the own FBI integrity by lying and going forward.  But one of the most of interesting things I have found is post the firing what McCabe said, take his statement and if I was Comey, I would be worried because said in there when he leaked to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that it was on the authority of the director and they knew they were doing it. Well, that's a direct opposite of what Comey told Congress in May 2017. When he was asked the question and regarding a Trump or a Clinton investigation, did he ever authorize anybody or leak information? He said no, never.   So, we know that McCabe has lied by the independent inspector general and found it. And now, he's saying about Comey, Comey may have lied as well. So, I don't think this is the end of it, but that is why we need a second Special Counsel. And I give Chairman Gowdy and Goodlatte a lot of credit and all of those members. They sent out a letter to Jeff Sessions. He is looking at it. But we need the ability -- because the Inspector General does not have subpoena power outside of the direction. So, we need somebody to look at this and not from the inside because you can't trust what's happening right now.",

When we just now found out what was the communication and talking about that FISA court judge, that was the work of the committee member going out and finding that because much of that is redacted.  And for five months, they have been fighting to find this information. That is a frustration because we are separate but coequal. Congress is supposed to oversee and hold them accountable and if they are withholding that information, I believe a lot more information is going to come forward in the end when we get this all out in the open and I believe the Inspector General's report. I think it's going to come out in April. I am not sure when he will get done with that, but he has uncovered so much of this and that's independent, non-partisan of what he is finding.",

And you know, from all your work in the law, a FISA court is different than any other court, and the way they went before this FISA court knowing that HIllary Cllinton paid for this and the DNC, this dossier, using that, but really not telling the FISA court, just on a footnote of why they wanted to go forward and spy, and then when you look at Steele just a couple of days ago, in \"The New Yorker\" saying that he did know that Clinton and the DNC paid for it when the FBI had left that out saying they did not.

And one more point on this, Leslie, you know, although not you specifically, a lot of those liberal blue checkmark brigade on social media, they want Donald Trump fired tomorrow. They want him impeached, which is incredible because they have no evidence to impeach him on any high crime or misdemeanor, but yet, with tons of evidence about McCabe was guilty of malfeasance and misfeasance, all of a sudden, that we're all upset about the firing.

We just recently, a matter of days ago, began getting additional documents and discovered that he had deliberately withheld a whole category of documents that they are now going back through and identifying and they will give to oversight.

We are becoming protectionists.\" And now, Donald Trump actually mirrors it. It's just a different country. It's now China primarily. He's beginning to look at sanctions against dumping into the market predatory dumping that's hurting American companies and all of a sudden, the same groups are out there saying, \"Oh, it's all ending.\" They will tell you how great Reagan was, but they forget to tell you that many of the things that Reagan had to do during this administration are the same things Donald Trump is having to do.

They are used to seeing people remain in jobs for years and years and years even if they are utterly incompetent, ineffective and inefficient and people in Washington are dumbstruck that you would actually have somebody who would take seriously the role of chief executive and would get rid of people who don't do their jobs. Well, from the time we were in first grade, we didn't get to go to recess if we didn't finish our coloring. Donald Trump looks at people around him and if they didn't finish their coloring on time, he tells them, there's not only going to be a missed recess, but the famous words, for which he is notorious for, \"You're fired.\" And he is saying it to some people, some of whom need it.",

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight. Andrew McCabe turns over notes he kept from President Trump to Robert Mueller just hours after McCabe is officially fired from the FBI. Hello and welcome to \"Justice\" live tonight from Los Angeles, I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us. Now, we're going to be talking about today's major developments in the Department of Justice throughout the hour with guests including GOP House Majority Leader, Ken McCarthy, Governor Mike Huckabee, Dan Bongino, Tomi Lahren and more. But first, my Opening Statement. So, just fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe claims victim status seeking to join that elusive hood of crooks who feign innocence when they are caught dead to right claiming his downfall is the result of a series of attacks designed to undermine his credibility and reputation. Andy, I don't know how to break this to you, but the only reason you are even in the news is because you are a liar and when you lie under oath and to the FBI, you are a wrongdoer, you are a cheat and you are an offender. So, McCabe, are you a crook too? Consider this. General Michael Flynn who put his life on the line every day in the military lied to the FBI about something that wasn't even criminal. And, now, he's a convicted felon. Martha Stewart lied to the FBI and she is a convicted felon who went to jail. So, you lie not only to the FBI, but to the Inspector General and under oath, and you are even given an opportunity to take it back, but you still lie. So, they are crooks, but you are not? You are in the news because the office of professional responsibility after the Inspector General's investigation says you made unauthorized disclosures to the news media and you lacked candor. You lied about the Clinton Foundation investigation and leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times which you are not authorized to do. But we shouldn't be surprised. Your boss, Jim Comey also leaked information to get to the New York Times because he didn't have the guts to stand up and say what he wanted to say himself. And you think you are being targeted? You are not that important. Nobody is looking to bring you down, but your wife gets $700,000.00 from the Clinton cash machine and you handled the Clinton e-mail investigation. A five-year-old could see the ethical conflict of interest. And we entrust you with the power of the greatest law enforcement agency in the nation, and you not only use to your own advantage, you use it to your political and financial advantage, and everyone knows, everyone knows that when you lie to the FBI, it results in automatic dismissal. Now, you claim that your firing is part of an effort to undermine the Special Counsel's Russia investigation. You know what? The only Russia investigation that should be going on should be the one looking into Hillary and that whole gang for the Russian -- sale of uranium to Russia, but it is going to get worse for you, Andy, when your sidekick, Peter Strzok and his girlfriend are called on the carpet for their criminality. You lied about your relationship with Strzok who worked for you while the three of you tried to affect the presidential primary and take down a duly elected president by starting a Donald Trump-Russia inquiry when the only person who colluded with the Russians was your girlfriend, Hillary, your friend, Barack and the CFIUS committee of Clinton Foundation associates that approved the sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia with a payback to Hillary. Now, there were three pending Federal inquiries into your actions as well while you were in the FBI and you were removed from your post almost two months ago when the new FBI Director saw evidence regarding your activities. And the intrigue continues. While you threaten Jim Comey and threatened that if you go down, everyone else will, Jim Comey writes a conciliatory tweet that, \"You stood tall over the last eight months and served with distinction for two decades.\" He's clearly hoping that you won't testify against him. This is a classic crime family takedown. Who is going to rat on whom? If this were the movie \"The Godfather,\" Cardinal Comey is the (copper deTudi), Andrew McCabe is the enforcer. Lisa Page is both the consigliere and the (glomad) and Peter Strzok is the button man, and it looks like Strzok who signed the warrant application to the FISA court was a close friend of Judge Contreras who signed the warrant. It's so damning that the judge recommended a social setting where there couldn't be a surreptitious meet with a cover of a dinner party so the judge wouldn't be required to take himself off the case. Even Bob Mueller knew enough to take Strzok off his investigation because Strzok was so dirty. Andy, you can complain all you want that you were unjustly fired, but the facts contradict that. You should have been fired a long time ago. You should lose your law license and you should have been taken out in cuffs. And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. And joining me now live in Justice is GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, thanks so much for being on \"Justice\" tonight. What do you say regarding the fact that McCabe is fired and he has lost his pension?"

      "utterance": "Well, you gave a great speech, but one thing you have got to look at, and I know a lot of Democrats are out there and trying to make this a political problem, but it's not. An independent, non-partisan Inspector General found the information of McCabe lying, thought it was severe enough even before its final report came forward to send it to the FBI, send it to the Ethics Department of the FBI, the OPR as you said, the Office of Professional Responsibility. They are non-partisan independent. They looked and they believe he should be fired, because every FBI agent I know, he or she believes in integrity. There are so many people that they bring before the court that they uphold because they lie. And they did not want him to take down the own FBI integrity by lying and going forward. But one of the most of interesting things I have found is post the firing what McCabe said, take his statement and if I was Comey, I would be worried because said in there when he leaked to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that it was on the authority of the director and they knew they were doing it. Well, that's a direct opposite of what Comey told Congress in May 2017. When he was asked the question and regarding a Trump or a Clinton investigation, did he ever authorize anybody or leak information? He said no, never. So, we know that McCabe has lied by the independent inspector general and found it. And now, he's saying about Comey, Comey may have lied as well. So, I don't think this is the end of it, but that is why we need a second Special Counsel. And I give Chairman Gowdy and Goodlatte a lot of credit and all of those members. They sent out a letter to Jeff Sessions. He is looking at it. But we need the ability -- because the Inspector General does not have subpoena power outside of the direction. So, we need somebody to look at this and not from the inside because you can't trust what's happening right now."

But it appears to me, Congressman that Strzok and Page are next, especially with the claim of their relationship with the judge who signed the FISA warrant that was based on unverified information. Do you have any thoughts on that?"

Because think of this, there is more than 1.2 million pieces of paper that deal with this subject. There is only about 3,100 pieces that have been sent to the judiciary committee and a lot of that was redacted. When we just now found out what was the communication and talking about that FISA court judge, that was the work of the committee member going out and finding that because much of that is redacted. And for five months, they have been fighting to find this information. That is a frustration because we are separate but coequal. Congress is supposed to oversee and hold them accountable and if they are withholding that information, I believe a lot more information is going to come forward in the end when we get this all out in the open and I believe the Inspector General's report. I think it's going to come out in April. I am not sure when he will get done with that, but he has uncovered so much of this and that's independent, non-partisan of what he is finding."

And you know, from all your work in the law, a FISA court is different than any other court, and the way they went before this FISA court knowing that HIllary Cllinton paid for this and the DNC, this dossier, using that, but really not telling the FISA court, just on a footnote of why they wanted to go forward and spy, and then when you look at Steele just a couple of days ago, in \"The New Yorker\" saying that he did know that Clinton and the DNC paid for it when the FBI had left that out saying they did not.

The president's very vindictive-like tweet which I think is beneath the Office of presidency and of course, the president's attorney then saying, \"Hey, we've got to get rid of this. Fire Mueller. Get rid of the investigation. I am speaking on behalf of the president. Oops, no, I'm not.\" And you know, as a Judge, attorneys do speak on behalf of their clients."

They have been under investigation for a crime, Leslie, you can't produce a scintilla of evidence even happened. And we're angry at them for some tweets that now finally, he takes some kind of a victory lap because he's getting justice? I think it's a little absurd. And one more point on this, Leslie, you know, although not you specifically, a lot of those liberal blue checkmark brigade on social media, they want Donald Trump fired tomorrow. They want him impeached, which is incredible because they have no evidence to impeach him on any high crime or misdemeanor, but yet, with tons of evidence about McCabe was guilty of malfeasance and misfeasance, all of a sudden, that we're all upset about the firing.

If nobody listened to our stuff, you and I would get fired. We'd be out of business because we weren't producing. Andy McCabe was the number two for three of the most of the most enormous debacles in FBI history Screwed up the Flynn case. They screwed up the FISA court case. And they screwed up the Hillary case. I mean, Leslie, listen, I get it. You know, a lot of liberals believe a big government, but if you are going to -- I don't, but if you are going to believe in big government, you also have to believe in an accountable big government. They don't live in a separate world, you know. They live in the same world of consequences. Every American works in the private sector does. He screwed up and he lost his job for it.

But if Martha Stewart gets indicted for lying to the FBI, and General Michael Flynn is a felon for lying to the FBI about something that is not even criminal. McCabe has got to be indicted too."

These things are -- these are criminal charges, releasing sensitive transcribed, unmasked information to reporters. There is a lot of this going around. And one more thing, that Flynn interview, remember, those agents in that interview were pretty convinced Flynn was being truthful. What are those 302's say? Those summaries of the interview?

      "utterance": "Judge, it's about time. You know, under the last administration, whether it was Benghazi or Fast and the Furious, the IRS targeting of conservatives, nobody was held accountable. Everyone got to retire or even stay on the job. This is the first time the American people are seeing at least some responsibility for somebody who clearly misled, didn't do his job, then changed his story when the administrations changed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, you make a very good point. I really didn't think of it that way. I am over here saying it's not enough. If you lied, if Flynn lies to the FBI, he's a felon. Martha Stewart lies to the FBI, she goes to jail. This guy lies to the FBI, now everybody is bent out of shape, he didn't get his pension, really? You know, there needs to be an indictment as far as I am concerned, but you make a good point. You know, that nothing has been done like this. But I'm convinced that Strzok and Page are next and the whole thing is going to come tumbling down. But let's talk about it. You are on oversight reform and earlier, I had on Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and he talked about the fact that it's so difficult that right now, they only have 3,000 of the 1.9 million or 1.5 million -- whatever the number was -- documents that they have subpoenaed. First of all, they don't have them and how do you possibly get through them? How do you do this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "It's an amazing process. You know, you word search, you tell them what you want. They identify the number and then, they slowly go through them deciding what to redact. And it's almost like, you know, trying to ask for the documents from the Manhattan Project. They do it with human beings. They do it slowly. This is a problem that congressional oversight has under both Republicans and Democrats. They won't give you the raw documents. And then we can talk about what needs to be redacted afterwards. I'll give you an example, Eric Holder of course, was held in contempt seven years ago for withholding documents. He said there were 200. We just recently, a matter of days ago, began getting additional documents and discovered that he had deliberately withheld a whole category of documents that they are now going back through and identifying and they will give to oversight. So, Brian Terry dies in 2011. We are still trying to get justice for this border patrolman's family, and you know, to bring up the president's trip to California. You know, he was out there looking at these fences and wall designs that are going to save lives, people like Brian Terry shouldn't die in the desert because they are out in the open, and they are targets for the bad guys."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, one of the things that you know, that is frustrating about all of this, is that so much time and so the eyes are being taken off of all of these successes of this administration, and all of the benefits, I mean, you know, the regulations that have been reduced. You know, the improvement in the economy, the unemployment at this all-time low. And yet, you know, we've got people who are criticizing this president, and make a fantasy about Russian collusion. I mean, what do you say? I mean, you are leaving congress. You've announced you are not going to run again. I'd love to know why, we'll get to that in a minute, but what do you think of our -- you know, your fellow colleagues who are like, \"I know there's collusion. I know there is. I haven't found it yet.\" And the sky is falling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, if you spend this long looking for something and you haven't gotten the first whiff of it, obviously you have to question why you are still looking. But you know, I'll put it in perspective, I am -- as you say, I am leaving Congress after 18 years, but I also am an old Reaganite. You know, if you go back through history, what you'll discover is when Reagan was putting tariffs on anti-dumping by foreign countries, there was this terrible, you know, \"Oh, my goodness, the sky is falling. We are becoming protectionists.\" And now, Donald Trump actually mirrors it. It's just a different country. It's now China primarily. He's beginning to look at sanctions against dumping into the market predatory dumping that's hurting American companies and all of a sudden, the same groups are out there saying, \"Oh, it's all ending.\" They will tell you how great Reagan was, but they forget to tell you that many of the things that Reagan had to do during this administration are the same things Donald Trump is having to do. Roll back regulations, stop the endless growth of government, make America safe for our people by reinforcing the military and yes, unshackle American creativity by putting business out front as heroes rather than villains."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

JOE SCARBOROUGH, CO-HOST, \"MORNING JOE,\" MSNBC: Here is a guy that has served admirably, and also, this whole narrative by Republicans that McCabe, an FBI somehow was anti-Trump is ridiculous. What he is accused of leaking was detrimental to Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton campaign, just like Comey's letter helped elect Donald Trump. So, do you really fire a guy two days before his retirement because the president of the United States is applying pressure over Twitter to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And that's just one of the most outrageous things I heard this week. Joining me now, former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor, Mike Huckabee. Good evening, governor. You know, I've got to tell you, that \"Morning Joe\" was always good for my outrageous segment. He says -- you know, he says, \"Andrew McCabe is an outstanding citizen. He doesn't deserve to be fired.\" What say you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, why wouldn't he deserve to be fired? If he lied to the FBI, and he is part of the leadership at the FBI, of course, he's got to be fired. And the fact that it was coming around his retirement had nothing to do with anything other than, we shouldn't dis taxpayers beyond the hook for $1.8 million in retirement benefits for someone who, if he did what the Inspector General says he did, and what the Office of Professional Responsibility has indicated he did, it's not just a firing he ought to be worried about, he ought to be worried about what happened to Martha Stewart, what happened to Mike Flynn, and if I were Mike Flynn's lawyer, I'd go right now to court and say, \"Let my people go.\" I mean, why not for heaven's sakes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and the amazing thing is that, you know, Strzok -- not Strzok I should say, McCabe lied about something having to do with an investigation, a criminal investigation whereas Mike Flynn, his lie and people from the FBI, many of them in that room think he didn't lie was not about a crime. That the crime was not a part of the lie. But let's go on. Now, Jennifer Palmieri, you remember her? She compares the Trump White House to \"The Godfather.\" I think we have some sound on this. JENNIFER PALMIERI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AND DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE HILLARY CLINTON 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: You remember the scene from \"The Godfather.\" We so often have to go back to \"The Godfather\" for this administration for point of reference. But when they got rid of the five heads of the other crime families and ones who -- and I feel like the purging that you've seen of staff over the last few days and week is about Mueller and is about anxiety.\""

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know what's amazing about this? in my opening, Governor, I talked about a crime family and that one being in the FBI. Not the regular men and women in the FBI, but that seventh floor in the FBI building. What do you this of this crime family comparison?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what Jennifer should have said is, leave the gun, take the cannoli. I mean, she totally missed the whole point. The reason that there has been various people leaving government is because Donald Trump is a business guy. He is used to putting people around him who are competent and if people around him don't get the job done, he lets them go. People in government aren't used to this. They are used to seeing people remain in jobs for years and years and years even if they are utterly incompetent, ineffective and inefficient and people in Washington are dumbstruck that you would actually have somebody who would take seriously the role of chief executive and would get rid of people who don't do their jobs. Well, from the time we were in first grade, we didn't get to go to recess if we didn't finish our coloring. Donald Trump looks at people around him and if they didn't finish their coloring on time, he tells them, there's not only going to be a missed recess, but the famous words, for which he is notorious for, \"You're fired.\" And he is saying it to some people, some of whom need it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "Well, what's interesting is that most federal employees if they are terminated have a right to appeal to the Merit Service Protection Board, but the FBI doesn't have the right to do that, so unless he can show that there is some egregious violation of his constitutional rights, which I think is insurmountable given the fact that the career employees at the Office of Professional Responsibility at the FBI recommended his termination, I think he's out of luck. One more point is that, he doesn't lose his pension all together. He simply can't take it right away, so it's also an exaggeration to say that, \"Oh, my god, he is being stripped of everything.\""

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, I just want to start this conversation, Judge Contreras. He is the one who took General Flynn's plea. He recused himself a week later. That means, folks, he took himself off the case voluntarily. And now, he is coming up in Strzok and McCabe's -- Strzok and his girlfriend, Page's conversation that, you know, we should meet with him surreptitiously so nobody knows in a dinner party setting. Where are your antennas going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "So, let's look at the timeline, Judge. This Judge Contreras is a judge on the FISA court. Now, we don't know if he is the judge who issued one of the subpoenas in this case for the wiretapping of Carter Page. But in July 2016, these two, Page and Strzok are having conversations between themselves that were pieced together very recently talking about ways they can have a social meeting with the judge and they are talking about ways to cover it up, and cover up the purpose of it. They talk about the fact that he is one of the FISA judges, the FISA judges and they talk about the fact that the judge is close to Strzok. Surely, he knows Strzok is in charge of foreign counter-intelligence at the FBI. So, it stinks of a conspiracy to me and they are even talking about inviting other people for cover to make sure it doesn't look out of the ordinary and to get close to the judge, but not so close to the judge that he is forced to recuse himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And they are suggesting that -- the recommendation of a dinner party, so that it doesn't look obvious that they are talking to each other. So, I mean, this really smells to high heaven because you've got one judge who is on the Flynn case who takes himself off because he did something. He got caught in something. You don't just recuse yourself a week later."

    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "It's not clear that he recused himself, Judge. That's also interesting. On December 1st, he took the plea and then on December 7th, the court announced that he has been recused. That's not the same as recusing yourself."

    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",

They seem to have a willing group of people who would show up at a cocktail party or a dinner party and get close to this judge knowing that he is on the FISA court. For what purpose? It's extremely fishy, and of course, this comes around the same people talking about an insurance policy. They are texting how they hate the president. And this is before the election. So, this is a deep game these people have been playing."
