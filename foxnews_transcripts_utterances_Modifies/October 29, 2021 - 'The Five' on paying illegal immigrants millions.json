This guy has already shattered the all-time American record for illegal entries and then he blamed Trump for that. Now there was a reason we all remember why we had to separate families. Because Donald Trump was following the letter of the law. You cannot hold adults and minors in the same facility legally. And you can't hold minors for more than 21 days. Plus, you had to separate them to see if they were actually parents or if these were kids just getting traffic. And it did have a very strong deterrent effect. Do you remember when there was a guy who came to the country, I think it was 11 times illegally and then murdered an American woman in a sanctuary city? Kate Steinle.

So, you don't want to get drag down that hole. This is about draining the power of America which is -- which is because this is so far left. There's a reason behind this. If illegals get a half a million per illegal, we are done. Because that means they can keep doing this and keep doing this and this is how you drain a country. You are basically opening up the drain -- you're opening as turning on the faucet and everything goes out. So, the only solution is for us, Americans to sue the government. We have to start suing the government over the perceived mistreatment of a Democratic White House. Or let's talk about the Afghanistan debacle. Surely there could be lawsuits over that. Let's talk about the response to the riots. Right? We can sue the Democrat cities. How about inflation? How about the separation that you brought up?

Because that made parents who were already upset now feeling like someone was coming potentially after their first amendment rights. That's the way they, many of them, interpreted it. It's been a backlash for McAuliffe ever since then. Because what parents have said is like, not only do you have all these things that I disagree with, but I'm supposed to sit down and shut up?

And Virginia now is not as blue as New Jersey where also Phil Murphy is in a tighter race than he would like. New Jersey will stay blue. But if this becomes a wave of some kind with these education voters when their expectation is that we have jobs in the economy. Voters, so you have COVID voters, and that becomes the number one issue. There is going to be, have to be a big reversal in terms of the messaging that's coming out about it. And Republicans, frankly, you know, Youngkin has been smart. He campaigns alone. He has not nationalized this race at all. He has fundraisers with high-profile Republicans, but when you go to a rally, you just see Glenn Youngkin. And the Democrats are going to have to pay attention to that because, obviously, we've nationalized it.

We start out west where we have the big bomb cyclone and finally they get a break. It's going to be dry in Witch Hazel, Oregon, Boone, Idaho. We'll see temperatures in the low 50s. So, some spooky spots here across the country for Halloween. Santa ana winds will set up for the West. That means nice breezy conditions all the way into Skull Valley, Arizona. So, that's probably the best trick- or-treating in the whole country. Some snow possible in parts of the Rockies. So, they -- that's the only place we see snow on Halloween this year. It's very quiet in Pumpkin Center in the central plains after it's been very wicked there much of the week. We've got Bigfoot, Texas hot. So, anybody looking for the revealing costume situation, that's where we're going to see things get a little steamy for Halloween. And lots of goblins getting all the goodies in Candy Town, Indiana where it'll be 60 degrees. We put up Satans Kingdom this wet weather here in the northeast just continues. And there could be some flooding rain, so very soggy for the pumpkins. Kill Devil Hills all the way down the eastern seaboard to Screamer, Georgia. You guys, we're ending up October with perhaps the busiest October for tornadoes that we've seen in history. So, it's been a wild week of weather and of course getting in on the Halloween fun looks a little better as we head into the weekend.",

This guy has already shattered the all-time American record for illegal entries and then he blamed Trump for that. Now there was a reason we all remember why we had to separate families. Because Donald Trump was following the letter of the law. You cannot hold adults and minors in the same facility legally. And you can't hold minors for more than 21 days. Plus, you had to separate them to see if they were actually parents or if these were kids just getting traffic. And it did have a very strong deterrent effect. Do you remember when there was a guy who came to the country, I think it was 11 times illegally and then murdered an American woman in a sanctuary city? Kate Steinle.

And there is still 1,000 kids that we have not reunited them with their families. And that's something that spark outrage on both sides of the aisle. No one wants that situation. And I believe there are 940 plaintiffs in total for the suits. And the ACLU that's part of the lawsuit has made it clear that it's only a minority of the 940 that would even get any kind of settlement.

So, you don't want to get drag down that hole. This is about draining the power of America which is -- which is because this is so far left. There's a reason behind this. If illegals get a half a million per illegal, we are done. Because that means they can keep doing this and keep doing this and this is how you drain a country. You are basically opening up the drain -- you're opening as turning on the faucet and everything goes out. So, the only solution is for us, Americans to sue the government. We have to start suing the government over the perceived mistreatment of a Democratic White House. Or let's talk about the Afghanistan debacle. Surely there could be lawsuits over that. Let's talk about the response to the riots. Right? We can sue the Democrat cities. How about inflation? How about the separation that you brought up?

And it's because Joe Biden said on the campaign trail that we can absorb two million new people a year. We're almost to that number now. They believe in this. But on the issue of the separation and paying families who were separated, the first thing I would say is it's a result -- a reflection of how the left feels about the American citizen. Right?

The other thing is, there are tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors who are voluntarily separated from their parents in El Salvador, in Guatemala, and they were sent alone on this journey and they already separated. And so, this is just, you know, it's a way to, as Greg said, drain the system but it's also a reflection of the distain that the left has for the American taxpayer and how they think that you should be paying for rule breakers not just inside the United States but coming into the country as well."

And Ro Khanna who is a congressman from California the whip of the progressive caucus, was telling Neil Cavuto, 10 days it will be done. Both bills. There is a lot in there that progressives should be happy about. I think the attitude should be versus nothing, you're getting a whole lot of something. And everyone will get on board. Nancy Pelosi doesn't mess up. It just -- it doesn't happen. She knows where people's boundary lines are.

The first was by the time I land I want one of these first votes. But like you said, Speaker Pelosi doesn't mess up in the sense that she's always very aware of what her whip count is, what her vote count. And so, she's not putting something on the floor to watch it burst into flames. So, we'll see how she does in the next few days. But it puts the spotlight on how much sway the squad does or doesn't have. They've lost a lot of what they wanted in this bill and I think they are finding maybe for the first time it's a lot easier to go campaign on social media and to do TikToks than it is to get hundreds of members of Congress to agree to anything.

They are going to edict everybody the government now. Everything is free. You've got to take that win and rock with it. They also slipped in amnesty, green cards for Silicon Valley. It's a lot. Plus, they jiggered with the bottom-line numbers. They basically took four trillion and cooked it down to under two trillion by just fooling around with the sunset clauses to fool the moderates. I'm not fooled by it. Everybody knows the games they are playing here. But Biden is an old man, he has been in the Senate forever. He knows how long he can wait to get this thing under the wire.

They had no idea for the longest time how much contempt that the teachers unions and the teachers and, I guess the whole educational system has for them. And that their intent is to brainwash the kids. This is the -- this is the positive aspect of COVID. That's where the parents learned all of this, at home. They saw how left-winging teachers were, how they hate the kids, how they hate them. So, this isn't just about Virginia. This is an education problem writ large.

Because that made parents who were already upset now feeling like someone was coming potentially after their first amendment rights. That's the way they, many of them, interpreted it. It's been a backlash for McAuliffe ever since then. Because what parents have said is like, not only do you have all these things that I disagree with, but I'm supposed to sit down and shut up?

But the education question is so fascinating because now McAuliffe is down 15 points with parents who have kids ages kindergarten to 12th grade. That's a very big group. And Virginia now is not as blue as New Jersey where also Phil Murphy is in a tighter race than he would like. New Jersey will stay blue. But if this becomes a wave of some kind with these education voters when their expectation is that we have jobs in the economy. Voters, so you have COVID voters, and that becomes the number one issue. There is going to be, have to be a big reversal in terms of the messaging that's coming out about it. And Republicans, frankly, you know, Youngkin has been smart. He campaigns alone. He has not nationalized this race at all. He has fundraisers with high-profile Republicans, but when you go to a rally, you just see Glenn Youngkin. And the Democrats are going to have to pay attention to that because, obviously, we've nationalized it.

We start out west where we have the big bomb cyclone and finally they get a break. It's going to be dry in Witch Hazel, Oregon, Boone, Idaho. We'll see temperatures in the low 50s. So, some spooky spots here across the country for Halloween. Santa ana winds will set up for the West. That means nice breezy conditions all the way into Skull Valley, Arizona. So, that's probably the best trick- or-treating in the whole country. Some snow possible in parts of the Rockies. So, they -- that's the only place we see snow on Halloween this year. It's very quiet in Pumpkin Center in the central plains after it's been very wicked there much of the week. We've got Bigfoot, Texas hot. So, anybody looking for the revealing costume situation, that's where we're going to see things get a little steamy for Halloween. And lots of goblins getting all the goodies in Candy Town, Indiana where it'll be 60 degrees. We put up Satans Kingdom this wet weather here in the northeast just continues. And there could be some flooding rain, so very soggy for the pumpkins. Kill Devil Hills all the way down the eastern seaboard to Screamer, Georgia. You guys, we're ending up October with perhaps the busiest October for tornadoes that we've seen in history. So, it's been a wild week of weather and of course getting in on the Halloween fun looks a little better as we head into the weekend."
