And then, today, the president walked into the Cabinet Room. He did have this planned in advance, though it was hastily planned. I mean, they weren't planning this for days or anything. After Nancy Pelosi said what she said, the president let Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer come over to the White House, sit down in the Cabinet Room, get comfortable.

Today's meeting, Neil, was supposed to be about finding a way where you could pay for $2 trillion worth of infrastructure development, because the last time that they met on this a couple of weeks ago, it was the one time out of four that things seemed to go well, but clearly they went off the rails today.   Also, some breaking news just in. A judge in New York City has blocked attempts by the president and the president's children, led by Eric Trump, to block Deutsche Bank from releasing financial records of the Trump Organization and individuals who work for the Trump Organization, including the president, including Eric Trump, Donald Trump, and Ivanka Trump, as well as other people associated with the organization.  So it may be the Democrats could gain access to those documents. I'm sure that the Trump Organization will immediately appeal that, in the way they did the decision earlier this week regarding their accounting firm Mazars USA. So we will see.

But if Pelosi does get strong-armed into starting impeachment proceedings, it makes him look like the victim yet again.

And it's the third out of four times that things have gone badly. Remember, first of all, there was the Oval Office meeting before Christmas that the president allowed the cameras to stay at. Then there was the January 9 meeting in the Situation Room, where the president got up and walked out when Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn't give him any money for the wall. And then, today, the president walked into the Cabinet Room. He did have this planned in advance, though it was hastily planned. I mean, they weren't planning this for days or anything. After Nancy Pelosi said what she said, the president let Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer come over to the White House, sit down in the Cabinet Room, get comfortable. And then the president walked in from the Oval Office and let them have it with both barrels. Listen here."

But that was seen as more of a kind of a hurry up and get USMCA done, and then we will tackle -- tackle infrastructure. Today's meeting, Neil, was supposed to be about finding a way where you could pay for $2 trillion worth of infrastructure development, because the last time that they met on this a couple of weeks ago, it was the one time out of four that things seemed to go well, but clearly they went off the rails today. Also, some breaking news just in. A judge in New York City has blocked attempts by the president and the president's children, led by Eric Trump, to block Deutsche Bank from releasing financial records of the Trump Organization and individuals who work for the Trump Organization, including the president, including Eric Trump, Donald Trump, and Ivanka Trump, as well as other people associated with the organization. So it may be the Democrats could gain access to those documents. I'm sure that the Trump Organization will immediately appeal that, in the way they did the decision earlier this week regarding their accounting firm Mazars USA. So we will see. But at least the lower courts think the Democrats should be able to see the information. So that's two losses in lower courts in a row for the president -- Neil."

He's tired of the investigations. They're -- they're hindering everything that he wants to do. And now they're attacking his family, his family organization, their business.

And for her to allege cover-up, it really kind of threw gas on the fire here, especially when you consider you had 19 -- 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 1.5 million documents, 2,800 subpoenas, the whole thing. I mean, when you start looking at it, you say this has got to be the worst cover-up in history, if it was a cover-up. So, she's trying to lay the groundwork for something bigger."

I had a lot of classified briefings. I have read Mueller report. I don't think she knows anything more than the phrase cover-up and is trying to incite and mollify, quite frankly, her base and those in her -- in her caucus who want an impeachment hearing."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What I get from this is, it seems that both sides have weighed the calculus of not working with the other. The unfortunate thing about that is that it also means that you're not going to make progress on infrastructure, as if that was expected anyway. But it also means that, by summertime, when we're up against the debt ceiling, we could be staring at a government shutdown, the progress of talks that even Mitch McConnell was heralding on dealing with a two-year budget or a better way to handle our government finances. That's off. I mean, this is scorched earth, isn't it?"

But I'm hopeful that, even though there was some pretty heated rhetoric today, I'm hopeful that -- certainly that the budget issues can be resolved before September. It's not going to be resolved in the normal course of things, which is the budget process. But just to get C.R.s, debt ceiling issues, like you say, I think -- I think we're going to get those done in this body before September, in spite of the rhetoric. But you're right. I believe this has impeded everything from infrastructure to border security to you name it, health care reform issues that we have. And we have got a lot of issues that we aren't able to get to even within the Judiciary Committee, because we're so focused on this stuff."

In the meantime, it's pretty clear that nothing is going to get done right now in Washington, D.C. Maybe that's just par for the course, given election year. But is it even more par for the course now? Democratic strategist Shavar Jeffries is joining us. We have also got Republican strategist Joseph Pinion III, and, last but not least, The Washington Examiner's Tiana Lowe. Tiana, end it with you, begin with you then.

It's this strange game of impeachment chicken, where Trump knows that the Mueller report didn't come up with anything that the country wants him impeached for, if we look at the opinion polling. But if Pelosi does get strong-armed into starting impeachment proceedings, it makes him look like the victim yet again. Trump doesn't want to be running against Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi going into 2020. He wants to be running against Rashida Tlaib and the most extreme wing of the Democratic Party."

You have another 200 who may have a broader view or view that there should be more process, more information, that we should get the full, unredacted Mueller report, hear from Mueller at an open public hearing. So she's been careful throughout this process, but, at the same time, she's wanted to call into account a president who has, frankly, run roughshod in a whole variety of different ways, instructing witnesses not to cooperate. He was clear. He said, I fired Comey because I didn't want the Russia investigation."

You have Congressman -- former Congressman Beto O'Rourke last night trying to breathe life into his campaign with new talks of impeachment and doubling down on that. There is that vocal section of the Democratic Caucus, which is getting louder by the second. But I do think that, again, the American people have said overwhelmingly they do not want to go to impeachment. And it would behoove the Democrats, I think, not to go down that path, looking at Bill Clinton, who was the last person who went through that process. Actually, what ended up happening? Approval ratings go up to 73 percent coming out the back end of that impeachment."

I think what we're doing now is, we're beginning to harden that line a little bit to say, you harm an American, you kill an American, we're going to hold you accountable. And what you're beginning to see is that Iran, I think, overreacted initially. We put our forces there, which are fairly normal. Obviously, the B-52s are a bit of a step up from the normal group you have there with a carrier strike group, as well as the fighters that we have in the region. But I think we're beginning to have -- realize that the Iranians no longer going to be able to have free rein in the region. I mean, when you look, they have been influential between Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and we're essentially saying, you cannot continue to cause trouble as the number one state sponsor of terror."

I think what you're going to see is, look, we have a variety of war plans that are on the shelf, that call for various amounts of forces to be introduced in the region, to handle different types of crises that may arrive. The fact that they came up with this number of 100,000 or 120,000 troops to be, that was just O-plan, or one operational plan, that was pulled off the shelf."

People in Kentucky respect the fact that this president, our president -- and we're proud to call him our president -- is a guy that loves America. He loves America. He loves working-class Americans. He wants to put America first, not at the expense of everyone else, but certainly not with us being second fiddle to anybody. And that resonates very well here. I'm grateful to have his support. And I'm grateful for his friendship, frankly."

But it does show that, even among Republicans, when 40 percent would prefer you not get in office again, you have had a lot of fights with many in your own party over pensions, et cetera, even outside your party, with teachers unions and all the rest. So you have done a lot of things that have invited wrath, even among Republicans. Does that worry you come November?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVIN",
      "utterance": "It doesn't. And I will tell you why. Any time you have -- there were four people in this primary. Four years ago at this time, I won the closest statewide election in the history of America. I won by less than four-ten-thousands of 1 percent, also a four- way primary. I had less than 33 percent of the vote that time, and managed to win by over 9 percent, winning 106 out of 120 counties in the general election. And while I'm only the fourth Republican in 100 years or so here in Kentucky, and there has never in the history of Kentucky been a Republican to win a consecutive term, nonetheless, I like our odds. This is going to boil down to job,s the pro-life vs. pro-abortion issue, Donald Trump and his administration vs. a candidate on the other side who was a proud supporter of Hillary and still bemoans the fact that she's not our president. So clear, clear choice for the people of Kentucky coming up in November."

The math just doesn't favor it surviving at the way rate it's going. You took that on, and took a lot of political heat for that. But, obviously, the ads are being made as we speak, if they haven't been made already, that you're going after teachers and firemen and police and what have you by taking away their pensions. How do you answer that?"

    {
      "speaker": "BEVIN",
      "utterance": "The good thing is this. I'm running against a guy -- and I hate to say this -- he's a liar, as is his father before him. And that seems a provocative thing to say that, but it's a word that has real meaning and definition. These things are not true. The irony is his father, who was the governor before me, never fully funded any of those pensions, ever, not one time in eight years. I am the only governor in the lifetime of anyone living in Kentucky that has fully funded these very pensions. Not only have I not taken anything. I have put billions of dollars into these. I have raised the issue. It has scared certain people. But in the meantime, I'm the only governor in Kentucky history to fully fund these pensions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "Not even. I mean, here's the reality. If we continue -- what I have said -- and you touched on it with the first of those several things you threw out -- is changes to future employees, people not currently in the system. The only way to fulfill the promise made to those currently working and those already retired is to no longer make the same promises to future employees, because to do so is to guarantee that the future employees and those past and current will not get what it was that they were promised. And so why lie to people? We have been lying for a long time in this state to people. The KEA has been lying. Former governors, including Governor Beshear, lied to people and underfunded, took their money, did other things with it. And I'm the guy coming along with the hard truths. And, sometimes, the hard truth is more painful than the easy lie. But this is where we are. And I will fund these pensions. And we will save this system, because you're right. Ourselves, New Jersey, Illinois, and a whole slew of others have got to deal with this. This is a big problem in America. It's a big problem at the federal level. This is a $4 trillion to $5 trillion underfunded liability, at a minimum, in the United States."

Because I think that we are engaged here in this very odd impeachment game of chicken, where nobody is doing -- I think we have to act accordingly. OK? The president has got to respect Congress. It's very, very important here. Congress has -- is seeking documents, and the president should respect Congress' authority. At the same hand, though, it's Congress' responsibility to act responsibly. I believe, for the most part, it's been doing that. We can't forget why Republicans lost the House in 2018.

      "utterance": "I don't think -- I don't think anything's going to get done. You know it. They're at loggerheads about all this. And one thing you could say and I could say, I don't care how thin-skinned you are. You call someone an SOB on camera, and then you expect to sit down with that -- with that person?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, again, this -- there's been a lot of railing against the financial community too and the president's ties to the financial community and making them happy. And now they want bank records and all of this, but some of the same candidates who are running all depend on that money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "All of them. All of them. They're all -- except for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. And, weirdly, the last time Bernie Sanders was running, there were two crazy financial advisers that threw him a few bucks."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Right. That's right. But everybody else is going for the Wall Street money because it is good. It gives you seed money to do rallies."

    },

      "utterance": "Now, here's the thing. They're not giving as much, from what I understand. They -- I know for a fact there are hedge fund guys that like Cory Booker on school choice -- he's one of the Democratic candidates that -- will not give to him this time because he's moved so far to the left. The one guy that will get a lot of this money across the board universally, if he wins, and even before, is Joe Biden. He's the one guy that has not attacked corporate America in the way these other guys are."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, he just's saying, we can still get stuff done. I don't think it's going to be that easy."
    },

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Yes, how much stuff gets done in Albany? Does he understand how dysfunctional Albany is, even with Democrats running..."

      "utterance": "Well, he's working in Washington."
