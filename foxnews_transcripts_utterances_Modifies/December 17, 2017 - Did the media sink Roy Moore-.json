Bur there are really bad cases where people must be moved aside and others that amount to quote, a bit of flirting. After a Huff Post report said some women at Fox were upset, 21st Century Fox said in a statement that Murdoch's were nonsense was not about sexual harassment itself but whether that issue was an obstacle in its bid to buy the rest of Sky News under Murdoch, the company said. Bur it has compensated numerous women who were mistreated, fired its biggest star, Bill O'Reilly, and trained virtually all of its employees, quote, by his actions, Rupert has made it abundantly clear that he understands there were problems at Fox News, the statement said. A question of misconduct was also spread into the restaurant business. ABC has fired celebrity chef Mario Batali, co-host of the day time show, The Chew after a website Eater.com quoted several women who is saying he had groped or sexually harassed them in other ways. Batali is also taking a leave from his company, apologize to those he has hurt saying quote, I take full responsibility and deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused. The sports world is feeling the impact as well. ESPN has suspended two on-air analyst, including former star quarterback Donovan McNabb over a lawsuit by a wardrobe stylist alleging numerous graphic instances of sexual harassment and assault. And the suit prompts the NFL network to suspend three former football players who have been working as on-air analysts.  The federal bench is not immune when the Washington Post reporting yesterday that nine more women, for a total of 15 have accused a high- profile appeals court judge Alex Kozinski of inappropriate conduct including unwanted kissing and touching.

One phrase that is universally recognized as something that means you can't do it anymore. Now, I think the word stop is fine. I think the word no is fine. I think Hillary Clinton's book where she said back up you creep was a perfectly good idea. But if those were too subtle, what Allen Alda suggested is something like that's not OK.

Virtually all the pundits thought Roy Moore would probably eke out a win in the Alabama Senate race and yet, most seem to be relieved -- rather relieved to be wrong when Democrat Doug Jones scored his upset victory. Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Libby Casey, on-air reporter for the Washington Post, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at the Federalist and a Fox News contributor, and Ruth Marcus, The Post deputy editorial page editor. Libby, has there been a perception that the media in this country -- if not out opposed to Roy Moore, at least were ringing the alarm bells about him."

      "utterance": "It were to come out a recent survey that said 52 percent of those polls don't trust the media. And Roy Moore was certainly playing into that, talking about fake news, picking up on these hashtags that the president himself has, usually. He was pitting himself against not just the elite of Washington but also the media elite. But it have to say, having talked to reporters in the Washington Post newsroom who broke the initial stories of the allegations, they were just doing their job and they were reporting, and they worry even to face by all the attention that he done to them. So it really was -- it was not reciprocated I'm going to say, by the reporters who were doing the actual reporting. Roy Moore may have been lobbying -- you know, fight at them but they just kind of kept doing their job, Howie."

I think it speaks both to the strength of journalism, but also the weakness of journalism. Meaning, if this story had come out five, 10, 15 years ago, that man would have left the race immediately, that he didn't and that he almost won speaks to the credibility problems that general media establishment has. But on the other hand, the strength of the story if held under scrutiny, unlike some of these other, you know, people who were trotted out by attorneys and what not. The Post story did hold up under scrutiny. So it's -- that's a god mark for them. But the danger is that it was even disclose, means that people aren't trusting or having confidence in the media."

Whether it's a Republican or a Democrat, your job as a reporter -- (Inaudible), as a reporter is to dig into it, and she says she was skeptical when she first heard these stories from people, and so she dug a little more, dug a little more and called an editor and said I think we have a story here.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave it a caveat and said the women who have came out in the press conference. But that was putting a fine point on it, that the president himself has not made. And so, journalists are going to ask questions. They are going to say, all right, press secretary, what's really going on here, is he changing his story. So he brings some of this on himself.

Bur there are really bad cases where people must be moved aside and others that amount to quote, a bit of flirting. After a Huff Post report said some women at Fox were upset, 21st Century Fox said in a statement that Murdoch's were nonsense was not about sexual harassment itself but whether that issue was an obstacle in its bid to buy the rest of Sky News under Murdoch, the company said. Bur it has compensated numerous women who were mistreated, fired its biggest star, Bill O'Reilly, and trained virtually all of its employees, quote, by his actions, Rupert has made it abundantly clear that he understands there were problems at Fox News, the statement said. A question of misconduct was also spread into the restaurant business. ABC has fired celebrity chef Mario Batali, co-host of the day time show, The Chew after a website Eater.com quoted several women who is saying he had groped or sexually harassed them in other ways. Batali is also taking a leave from his company, apologize to those he has hurt saying quote, I take full responsibility and deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused. The sports world is feeling the impact as well. ESPN has suspended two on-air analyst, including former star quarterback Donovan McNabb over a lawsuit by a wardrobe stylist alleging numerous graphic instances of sexual harassment and assault. And the suit prompts the NFL network to suspend three former football players who have been working as on-air analysts. The federal bench is not immune when the Washington Post reporting yesterday that nine more women, for a total of 15 have accused a high- profile appeals court judge Alex Kozinski of inappropriate conduct including unwanted kissing and touching. And the New York Times and L.A. Times have included several women who accused music mogul Russell Simmons of rape. Simmons who has steeped down from his company insists he's innocent.

My second point is that what this cable news host are doing and pundits when we get up here and we fight like that. We are further turning America off. They don't want to see Joe Scarborough and Mike Huckabee have a fight about their respective loved ones.

It does seem like April Ryan goes beyond just being a reporter frequently. She is a commentator, an activist on the left.

It took a long time for to us figure out what the case was and if there were references to anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text messages. I think for journalistic transparency, it was right for the t was right for the media to try to get their hands on those and give them to viewers and to readers. To me, you just ran through some of those examples of what was sent back and forth and some of it was just sort of sniping and people are going to have their political opinion. Obviously they didn't love Mr. Trump, but to me, the most important one or the most potentially problematic message was about that insurance policy against a Trump presidency. To me that raises a red flag.

There are number of Republicans who feel very strongly that Bob Mueller should be able to proceed as he has been with the full confidence of the government and certainly not the president of the United States of America slandering them non-stop, even at graduations. We know that Christopher Wray and Rob Rosenstein have both said that they have full confidence in this investigation and how Bob Mueller is running it. I completely agree with Guy that the text that matters is about the insurance policy and the idea that these characters were sitting around in Andy McCabe's office talking about what would be done yet we don't know if anything happened but..."

The \"Variety\" reports that Smiley had sexual relationships with a number of subordinates who were worried that their job status was tied to these relationships and express concern about retaliation. But Smiley is strongly disputing the findings."

He's saying he had a consensual relationship at least in one case and PBS won't give him the name of the accusers. Without PBS writing the details, how are we supposed to judge whether there is a big problem here?"

We need to differentiate, Howie, this drip drip drip which is now a flood. The only way we can avoid drowning in it is to differentiate -- find out the facts, differentiate between something that destroys a woman's career and something that just makes her want to go take a shower alone. There's a difference between these things and we need to find it out and I think what Tavis Smiley -- I know nothing about his case. I do know that when he says we need to start the conversation, that's the point. We're never going to ban sex in the workplace, although I have a feeling there'll be a lot less mistletoe at holiday parties this year which might be a good thing, but we need to determine the boundaries. We need to have a way to say to each other what's right, what works, what's OK and what's is not OK."

The network is reviewing his case. And in that case, the \"New Yorker\" is saying that he engaged in improper sexual misconduct, but not saying exactly what it is. Now Ryan Lizza may be best known for reporting on that raunchy off the record or he supposedly -- he says it was on the record, excuse me -- conversation with Anthony Scaramucci which cost him his job at the White House. Let's take a brief look at that."

      "utterance": "Well, this is what a lot of people are now talking about because there is some concern that there is backlash. There is some concern that everything gets lumped together and it shouldn't be. My friend, Allen Alda, he's a great actor of course, who has been a great supporter of women's rights for many decades, said to me the other night what we should do is have a safe word. One phrase that is universally recognized as something that means you can't do it anymore. Now, I think the word stop is fine. I think the word no is fine. I think Hillary Clinton's book where she said back up you creep was a perfectly good idea. But if those were too subtle, what Allen Alda suggested is something like that's not OK. Make that a universally accepted quick phrase that even bystanders can use if they see something going on. There has to be lines drawn. Women should not have to bear the onus of this. We should not have to police it. But something has to be done."

Obviously we've heard many, many, many allegations about the movie \"Mogul.\" And she says, you know, he asked her for sex, asked to watch her take a shower, accept a massage and all that and had bullied her and even said at one point I could kill you. I will kill you. But in this piece, she says also that he pushed her into doing a nude scene with another actress, Ashley Judd. She had a nervous breakdown. But really the question here is she says she was too much of a coward to come forward before this, against what she calls this monster. Your -- briefly."

      "speaker": "SHERR",
      "utterance": "Howie, I've got two reactions to that. One is when I read that really gut wrenching piece by Salma Hayek, I remembered when I was the sexual harassment ombudsman person at ABC News back in the 80's, young women would come to me trembling. I felt their trembling when I read that piece. This is a horrifying thing for women to go through. And back then, these women were too frightened to even bump it up to the next level let alone publish it in the \"New York Times.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

I don't know that you -- you can't do that and still have the United States of America. I think the current administration and their like-minded allies are waging a guerrilla war on the first amendment. Not quite as over but by diluting the job they do in order to establish what the truth is.

Here's what this company is keeping, Fox News, Fox Business, the Fox Broadcast Network, Fox's local television stations and Fox Sports. In short, a tightly focused news and sports company. And here's what Disney is buying for $52 billion, the 2ist Centry Fox Movie studio as well as National Geographic, the FX Channel, 22 regional sports channels which could boost Disney owned ESPN, and Fox has taken the Hulu website and Britain's Sky News. Now Rupert Murdoch has always been about buying assets, but faced with prospect of competing as not just the rest of Hollywood, but such emerging digital giants as Netflix and Amazon.

He begun with Australian newspaper. He owns the \"Wall Street Journal\" and \"New York Post.\" He's always been a news junky and that in an increasingly fractured media environment was more important to him than being a player in Hollywood.
