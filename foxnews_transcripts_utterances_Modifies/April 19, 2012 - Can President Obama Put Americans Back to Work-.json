Now you are seeing them say in effect it hasn't succeeded. They're not acknowledging that openly of course, but they're tacitly acknowledging it by the policies. It hasn't succeeded, and we have to put forward a plan, a bit-by-bit plan adding up to $350 billion to do essentially the same thing we try to do the first time that didn't work. Virtually nobody believes that this will have any significant economic impact in the near term. Some people think it will help encourage businesses to move payments that they might make later forward. It allows them to recalculate how they are going to count their withdrawal -- their deductions on spending for equipment, things of that nature. But in terms of how it's going to affect business spending, business behavior, it's not going to happen now. The real debate, of course, is about the extension of the Bush tax cuts. And as you said, Peter Orszag made an argument yesterday in The New York Times that President Obama himself made a year ago when he said basically it's a bad idea to raise taxes in a recession and doing so would suck demand out of the economy. The two used almost exactly the same phrasing to make the same argument: Orszag arguing in favor of extending the tax cuts for everyone; Obama, at that time, saying that he wouldn't raise taxes in a recession.",

I don't understand. Here is a man who had a golden touch in 2008 and it looks as if he's lost it. He tries it all over again and it won't work. He now is the president. And as you just said, if he said this is a referendum on the American economy, the Democrats are going to lose.   I remember Charles De Gaulle I think it was 1968 held a referendum on his presidency. It wasn't an election, he just held a referendum. Well he lost, he went home. I never said this before, but perhaps we could learn from the French a few things. Look, he understands if it is a referendum -- Obama understands if it is a referendum, he loses. And that's why he wants the narrative to be a choice. And the choice is the only one he has. It's not a choice on whose plan is better, because he loses on this plan. It's been tried, spent on the stimulus and the economy is stuck. It's a referendum on class war. It's we're for the poor, the middle class, and the Republicans favor Wall Street, special interest, and the rich.   That's why despite the protests of moderate Democrats who want an extension, like Peter Orszag, of the entire tax cut the Bush administration had initiated, he wants to split it between the middle class and the top two percent, even though it will really hurt the small business.  That's all he has. That's his narrative. It's his only shot. That's why he insists on it.",

Any transportation initiatives can be funded through the Recovery Act\" -- that's the first stimulus package -- \"that still contains unused funds. We must make hard choices to significantly reduce the deficit.\" He is in a tough race in Colorado, obviously, but he is also a Democrat who the White House supported in the primary.

No one wants to hear it and be near it, and certainly no one in cycle wants to touch it. So, yes, $50 billion isn't going anywhere.  I want to mention one thing about Boehner. What I think is really interesting is that in a lot of ways the president is legitimizing Boehner. He obviously is running for speaker and wants to be speaker, is confident that he's going to get either close to being speaker or going to be speaker. And I find it very interesting that the administration is giving some legitimacy to him.

There are plenty of Republican ideas. It's just easier for White House not to talk about them. What I don't understand why they don't use some of the ideas, pick up on some of them other than Social Security, and try to attack them. I mean, go against them one way or the other.   It's clear that they want a villain, this is what they are trying to do with John Boehner. They are trying to create a villain so they have someone to run against. And the theory, the oldest political trick in the book -- we might be bad, you may not like us, but have you seen these guys? That's the argument. That's exactly what Harry Reid is trying to do to Sharron Angle in Nevada with some success, I think.

There have to be things that Democrats in competitive districts can say we're doing this, we're doing this, we're doing this to help the economy. I think the problem they face is that a lot of it involves spending and it involves government intervention or government sort of -- an aggressive paternalism from Washington that is precisely what's being rejected in this upcoming election."

Here the latest poll from Washington, The Washington Post and ABC, which political party do you trust to do a better job handling the economy? There you see 43 percent for Republicans, Democrats at 39 percent. What about all of this, the politics as we head to the midterms. We're back with the panel. Charles?"

      "utterance": "Well, any time the president of the United States puts himself at the same level as member of the House eight times, he loses, no matter what the content of the argument is. I don't understand. Here is a man who had a golden touch in 2008 and it looks as if he's lost it. He tries it all over again and it won't work. He now is the president. And as you just said, if he said this is a referendum on the American economy, the Democrats are going to lose. I remember Charles De Gaulle I think it was 1968 held a referendum on his presidency. It wasn't an election, he just held a referendum. Well he lost, he went home. I never said this before, but perhaps we could learn from the French a few things. Look, he understands if it is a referendum -- Obama understands if it is a referendum, he loses. And that's why he wants the narrative to be a choice. And the choice is the only one he has. It's not a choice on whose plan is better, because he loses on this plan. It's been tried, spent on the stimulus and the economy is stuck. It's a referendum on class war. It's we're for the poor, the middle class, and the Republicans favor Wall Street, special interest, and the rich. That's why despite the protests of moderate Democrats who want an extension, like Peter Orszag, of the entire tax cut the Bush administration had initiated, he wants to split it between the middle class and the top two percent, even though it will really hurt the small business. That's all he has. That's his narrative. It's his only shot. That's why he insists on it."

      "utterance": "On the infrastructure spending, Erin, two hours before the president's speech, Charles mentioned this, Senator Michael Bennett from Colorado put out a statement about his lack of support for the president's proposal. And this is what he said -- \"I will not support additional spending in a second stimulus package. Any transportation initiatives can be funded through the Recovery Act\" -- that's the first stimulus package -- \"that still contains unused funds. We must make hard choices to significantly reduce the deficit.\" He is in a tough race in Colorado, obviously, but he is also a Democrat who the White House supported in the primary. And he has a statement before the president even gets to the podium in Ohio."

      "utterance": "And yesterday, we had Steny Hoyer, the majority leader in the House and Chris Van Hollen, the head of the DCCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, saying we're not taking this up before November 2. \"Stimulus\" is a bad word around Washington right now, and frankly across the country. No one wants to hear it and be near it, and certainly no one in cycle wants to touch it. So, yes, $50 billion isn't going anywhere. I want to mention one thing about Boehner. What I think is really interesting is that in a lot of ways the president is legitimizing Boehner. He obviously is running for speaker and wants to be speaker, is confident that he's going to get either close to being speaker or going to be speaker. And I find it very interesting that the administration is giving some legitimacy to him. And it makes me wonder if the administration doesn't perhaps want the House to flip so that come 2012 they'll have some fingers to point in the other direction."

We heard Congressman Boehner today saying there should be a freeze on spending back to 2008 levels and that all the Bush tax cuts should be extended. He did get those two specific things out today. But Democrats charge the Republicans haven't really laid out how they're going to govern differently than they did after they were in control of Congress."

      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "It's actually not true. You've had House Republicans in a leadership soliciting ideas from the country adopting them, putting them out of their own specific spending cuts. You have Paul Ryan's roadmap, of course. You have John Thune who last month put out a budget reform proposal that would bring down the level of spending, require cuts in spending of GDP, 10 percent of GDP every year. There are plenty of Republican ideas. It's just easier for White House not to talk about them. What I don't understand why they don't use some of the ideas, pick up on some of them other than Social Security, and try to attack them. I mean, go against them one way or the other. It's clear that they want a villain, this is what they are trying to do with John Boehner. They are trying to create a villain so they have someone to run against. And the theory, the oldest political trick in the book -- we might be bad, you may not like us, but have you seen these guys? That's the argument. That's exactly what Harry Reid is trying to do to Sharron Angle in Nevada with some success, I think. The Democrats are trying to do this nationally with John Boehner but they are not seizing on issues. And until they seize on issues, I don't think they will have much success."
