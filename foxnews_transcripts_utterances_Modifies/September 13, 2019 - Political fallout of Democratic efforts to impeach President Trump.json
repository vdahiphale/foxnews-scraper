Democrats kind of working out the rhetoric. Meantime the president weighing in this morning. \"How do you impeach a president who has created perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country, all-time best unemployment numbers, especially with blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt military and choice for vets,\" continues on two other tweets along these lines. Let's bring in our panel and start there, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Josh Kraushaar is the political editor for \"National Journal.\"  At the end of this week, Susan, where are we on this, and is this the beginning of what is going to be a muddled investigation as Democrats get their ducks in a row?   SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think \"muddled\" is a great word here because Speaker Pelosi is trying to edge them away from the impeachment cliff. She got very frustrated with the press when we kept asking about it the other day. She said I'm done talking about this. She wants to talk about the economy, healthcare, things that are really important, wage inequality, things that -- agenda that's important to Democrats. But there is another faction of Democrats that's really pushing for impeachment. Jerry Nadler on the Judiciary Committee, he is calling it an impeachment. He had an impeachment proceedings vote outlining how they were going to move forward with it on Thursday. It's like they are outlining two separate paths here. And Pelosi is going to have to figure out where this is going. They don't have that figured out yet.",

JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": This is a House Democratic caucus that's badly divided. And you have anyone who is in a swing district saying I don't want to even hear the word \"impeachment.\" But even those who support an impeachment, some of those in more competitive districts, they wants to use the word \"inquiry.\" This isn't full on impeachment. We just want to get a little bit of information. And then you have the Nadlers and the hard liberals who basically are already drafting impeachment, the letter. So this is an issue that Pelosi, as Susan was saying, badly wants to avoid. She wants to focus on bread and butter economic issues, but she knows there is a base out there and among her committee chairs that want to pursue that aggressively.",

They are not listening to the American people. And there was a DCCC, committee focus groups, showed, the \"Washington Post\" reported that Americans see them as obsessed with impeachment investigations at the expense of their agenda.

And a lot of Democrats privately are worried about it.  I will say what his strongest moment was, which is that he challenged Warren and Sanders on healthcare, and I think there also are Democrats worried that the notion of taking away private health insurance could be a huge general election liability, and Biden, frankly, is the only frontrunner that's willing to say he is going to protect Obamacare and going to protect those benefits.",

Democrats kind of working out the rhetoric. Meantime the president weighing in this morning. \"How do you impeach a president who has created perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country, all-time best unemployment numbers, especially with blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt military and choice for vets,\" continues on two other tweets along these lines. Let's bring in our panel and start there, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Josh Kraushaar is the political editor for \"National Journal.\" At the end of this week, Susan, where are we on this, and is this the beginning of what is going to be a muddled investigation as Democrats get their ducks in a row? SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think \"muddled\" is a great word here because Speaker Pelosi is trying to edge them away from the impeachment cliff. She got very frustrated with the press when we kept asking about it the other day. She said I'm done talking about this. She wants to talk about the economy, healthcare, things that are really important, wage inequality, things that -- agenda that's important to Democrats. But there is another faction of Democrats that's really pushing for impeachment. Jerry Nadler on the Judiciary Committee, he is calling it an impeachment. He had an impeachment proceedings vote outlining how they were going to move forward with it on Thursday. It's like they are outlining two separate paths here. And Pelosi is going to have to figure out where this is going. They don't have that figured out yet."

JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": This is a House Democratic caucus that's badly divided. And you have anyone who is in a swing district saying I don't want to even hear the word \"impeachment.\" But even those who support an impeachment, some of those in more competitive districts, they wants to use the word \"inquiry.\" This isn't full on impeachment. We just want to get a little bit of information. And then you have the Nadlers and the hard liberals who basically are already drafting impeachment, the letter. So this is an issue that Pelosi, as Susan was saying, badly wants to avoid. She wants to focus on bread and butter economic issues, but she knows there is a base out there and among her committee chairs that want to pursue that aggressively."

After the Mueller report cleared Donald Trump of collusion with Russia, 58 percent said turn the page on the investigations of Trump, 80 percent said Congressional representatives should be working more on infrastructure, healthcare, immigration, than investigations of Donald Trump. They are not listening to the American people. And there was a DCCC, committee focus groups, showed, the \"Washington Post\" reported that Americans see them as obsessed with impeachment investigations at the expense of their agenda. That's going to hurt those Republican -- those seats they flipped in 2018 in Trump districts because those people want to focus on the kitchen table issues."

That's a legitimate line for them to try to go after him. And now they are saying it's rude or low class or whatever, Biden, the way he defined it. But he is an older candidate and he has had these stumbles, and there are some questions. He is going to apparently release his health information fairly soon, and that's going to probably help contribute to his success here if it's a positive one."

And a lot of Democrats privately are worried about it. I will say what his strongest moment was, which is that he challenged Warren and Sanders on healthcare, and I think there also are Democrats worried that the notion of taking away private health insurance could be a huge general election liability, and Biden, frankly, is the only frontrunner that's willing to say he is going to protect Obamacare and going to protect those benefits."

The Air Force said \"We reviewed the vast majority of the 659 overnight stays of Air Force crews in the vicinity of the Glasgow Prestwick Airport between 2015 and 2019. Approximately six percent of those crews stayed at Trump Turnberry.\" That's roughly 40 stays total. \"The Washington Post,\" \"The stays result from two separate agreements that both predate Trump's presidency. Before Trump ran for president the airport agreed to send visiting crews to Trump's course. And while President Barack Obama was still in office the Air Force agreed to send refueling aircraft to the airport.\" \"Politico\" wrote it differently. \"The Air Force has significantly wrapped up its overnight stops in Scotland under Trump after a signed contract with the Prestwick Airport situated 20 miles from Turnberry in the waning months of the Obama administration.\" Back with the panel.

First of all, all the statistics he cited, this predates Trump. There are very few people staying. But also what people don't understand, the president of the United States does not choose the hotel the air crews stay out. You and I traveled on DOD aircraft during the Bush administration all the time. The flight crews choose the airports. And they have per diems. The per diem in Scotland is $166. The Marriott is $161. The Turnberry sometimes offers a government rate of $130, which means the crews have another $30 bucks to choose on airport. They choose their airports, not Donald Trump. So it's an absurd story."
