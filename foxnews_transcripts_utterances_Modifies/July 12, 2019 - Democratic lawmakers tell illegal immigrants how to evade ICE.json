      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to a Special Edition of “Tucker Carlson Tonight” this Friday. The thing about climate change is, it is serious stuff. Very serious. It's not like the frivolous concerns that fill your days, like paying your bills or keeping your marriage together or putting your kids through school or fighting cancer. Climate change is bigger than that, way bigger. It's about saving the Earth. It's about taking out what we're going to call an existential threat to humanity. It's a big deal, man.  Nobody understands the gravity of climate change with quite the soul- searing intensity of freshman Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When Ocasio-Cortez talks about climate change and the Green New Deal as she promises will save us from climate change, she often looks like she's going to start to cry or start to yell or both. And why wouldn't she? It's scary as hell. Time is running out.",

      "sentences": "Now you can disagree with the details of the Green New Deal she is proposing. Banning cars and airplanes for example, shutting down the entire American energy sector, rebuilding every dwelling in the United States. You can disagree with that. But what you can't question is Ocasio-Cortez's sincerity. When she talks about climate change, clearly, she really means it or does she? This is a man called Saikat Chakrabarti. He is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Chief of Staff over in the Congress. He personally led the writing of the Green New Deal. \"The Washington Post\" just profiled Chakrabarti.  In the interview, Chakrabarti made a stunning admission, all that stuff about the world ending 12 years to save the planet, it was all a lie. Chakrabarti is not worried about humanity's demise. The Green New Deal has nothing to do with that. Here's what he told the paper, quote, \"The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn't originally a climate thing at all. Do you guys think it was a climate thing? Because we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy-thing?\" End quote. That's about as direct as it could be.   The Green New Deal is not designed to save the world. It's not about the environment at all. It's about power. Chakrabarti and Ocasio-Cortez want control of the American economy. They went looking for an issue that would justify a hostile takeover of the economy. Climate change seems scary. So they went with that. It's remarkable they're admitting this, but we shouldn't be surprised, it is happening. This kind of thing happens all the time. Manufacturing crises is the last preferred way to exert control over the country. A decades ago, for example, only wackos in bed sheets were called racists. Then, during the last election, Donald Trump was denounced as a racist. Now Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are being written off as racists. What's going on here? It's not like there's more racism in the country. In fact, there's much less than there used to be. What changed is that the left realized they could gain power by creating boogeymen, by scaring you, stupefy the masses with fear mongering. By the time they've recovered, you're the one in charge. That's their program.   Robert Hockett advised Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Green New Deal. He is also a Law and Finance Professor at Cornell University, and he joins us tonight Professor, thanks for coming on.",

And they're kind of -- and the study is finding that clouds are a much more important control knob, if you will, of the climate. Now, it's just one study. The key here is a climate-skeptics jump on one study, but we say there are hundreds of factors that influence the climate: tilt of the Earth's axis, water vapor, methane volcanoes, and all kinds of ocean cycles. The idea that carbon dioxide is a control knob is not valid. And I actually point out there's over 500 peer-reviewed studies within the last year debunking the idea that CO2 is a control knob. This latest study on clouds is very important.",

On Wednesday night, in Marion County, Florida, four armed home invaders broke into the home of a 61-year-old man. One invader was wearing a mask from a horror film. In Eric Swalwell's world that homeowner would have been helpless while four criminals robbed him and possibly murdered him. But thankfully that man lived in America instead and he was able to defend himself. Using an AR-15, he killed two of the intruders. The other two were arrested. The homeowner was shot, but he is alive tonight, thanks to his AR-15. Ryan Cleckner is a former Army Ranger sniper and a contributor at \"The Federalist.\" He joins us tonight.

Nobody even noticed when she said it. Democrats instead continued working on what they're calling the Diverse Asset Managers Act. If passed, this law would require every single firm engaged in the $70 trillion asset management business to implement affirmative action based on sex and skin color. Companies would be required to file reports with the government describing the race of their employees because according to Democrats, your race is the single most important thing about you.

If there's one reason to vote Republican, it is to push back against insanity like this. And yet the Republicans in Congress aren't.

Ann Wagner of Missouri is the Republican Ranking Member on that committee. She said that she is quote, \"honored\" to be working on what she calls a very important subcommittee. She might be rewarded for that groveling. Another committee member has proposed requiring financial companies to interview people of specific skin colors when jobs come open.

Before the Protestant Reformation, you had to go through the Catholic Church in its priesthood to get into heaven. But the reformers understood that churches and governments are institutions created by human beings and therefore is subject to the corruption of human beings. And they came up with this brilliant and revolutionary idea of the priesthood of all believers. The idea of being that each of us faces our Maker one-on-one, without the intermediary of a church or a priesthood. When you think about that for a moment, that not only makes everybody equal, but it included black slaves. And that's why, from the moment of America's birth, there was a new dawn of freedom. We wrote into the declaration -- Thomas Jefferson wrote it into the Declaration of Independence, and within 25 years, there were hundreds of thousands of freed slaves in the north. And, you know, I'm thinking of this ignorant attack by Colin Kaepernick and Nike on the Betsy Ross flag, which just really goes with the creation of America. The creation of America was probably the greatest gift given to black people in 3,000 years because slavery was considered a normal institution for all those years. Unfortunately, the people who hate America on the left, and this embraces so much at the Democratic Party these days have conducted at 50-year or 60-year attack on Christianity in this country. They've driven prayer and religion out of the schools. You can't teach a public school child that the pilgrims were Christians fleeing persecution. So Americans no longer know where their freedoms come from, and that's why when the Democratic Party now is, you know, in a full scale march to eliminate a lot of the institutions that were there from the beginning, like the Electoral College, they want to do away with the Senate, and so forth. That's because they don't understand where our freedoms come from or what their nature is.",

Because if they come from government, you know, people like Maxine Waters, they're going to be taken away. So the framework of our freedom is dependent on the Christian nature of this country, as is the fact that we're a secular Republic. Why are we a secular Republic? Because all of these different Protestant sects understood that there would be a threat because they were fleeing established churches, in England.

It's not like the frivolous concerns that fill your days, like paying your bills or keeping your marriage together or putting your kids through school or fighting cancer. Climate change is bigger than that, way bigger. It's about saving the Earth. It's about taking out what we're going to call an existential threat to humanity. It's a big deal, man. Nobody understands the gravity of climate change with quite the soul- searing intensity of freshman Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When Ocasio-Cortez talks about climate change and the Green New Deal as she promises will save us from climate change, she often looks like she's going to start to cry or start to yell or both. And why wouldn't she? It's scary as hell. Time is running out."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Now you can disagree with the details of the Green New Deal she is proposing. Banning cars and airplanes for example, shutting down the entire American energy sector, rebuilding every dwelling in the United States. You can disagree with that. But what you can't question is Ocasio-Cortez's sincerity. When she talks about climate change, clearly, she really means it or does she? This is a man called Saikat Chakrabarti. He is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Chief of Staff over in the Congress. He personally led the writing of the Green New Deal. \"The Washington Post\" just profiled Chakrabarti. In the interview, Chakrabarti made a stunning admission, all that stuff about the world ending 12 years to save the planet, it was all a lie. Chakrabarti is not worried about humanity's demise. The Green New Deal has nothing to do with that. Here's what he told the paper, quote, \"The interesting thing about the Green New Deal is it wasn't originally a climate thing at all. Do you guys think it was a climate thing? Because we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy-thing?\" End quote. That's about as direct as it could be. The Green New Deal is not designed to save the world. It's not about the environment at all. It's about power. Chakrabarti and Ocasio-Cortez want control of the American economy. They went looking for an issue that would justify a hostile takeover of the economy. Climate change seems scary. So they went with that. It's remarkable they're admitting this, but we shouldn't be surprised, it is happening. This kind of thing happens all the time. Manufacturing crises is the last preferred way to exert control over the country. A decades ago, for example, only wackos in bed sheets were called racists. Then, during the last election, Donald Trump was denounced as a racist. Now Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are being written off as racists. What's going on here? It's not like there's more racism in the country. In fact, there's much less than there used to be. What changed is that the left realized they could gain power by creating boogeymen, by scaring you, stupefy the masses with fear mongering. By the time they've recovered, you're the one in charge. That's their program. Robert Hockett advised Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the Green New Deal.

So if you're going to be state of the art, you are by definition becoming green.

If you go back to the medieval warm period, we're probably the same temperature, we may have cooled. If you go back to the Roman warming period about zero A.D., we're probably cool. If you go to the geologic history of the Earth, we're in a 10 percent coldest period of Earth's history. In other words, 90 percent of the Earth's history was quoted in today and didn't support ice on either pole. So yes, we have warm since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850. That's indisputable.

This is really a big rainmaker. Now, we do see these winds beginning to pick up, as well as some of this initial rain. Winds up to 50 miles an hour. Right now, we're seeing the early stages of some of this heavy rain, and all of that wind, all of that rain is going to be pushing up the storm surge. We're looking at spots getting from three to six feet of storm surge. That is going to put places right along the coast underwater. So that's a major concern, as well as just the rainfall totals in general. Big area here from Louisiana up in to Mississippi as this makes landfall early tomorrow morning. It is going to bring all that moisture. These are flood watches and warnings across this entire region. The Mississippi is already running up to near record heights, not quite there yet, but with all this rain, we may end up seeing it. This is where we're looking as far as rainfall goes. It's going to make a difference. There's still time, Tucker, for this to shift to a little bit off to the west and a little bit off to the east. But definitely we're going to be seeing rainfall rates getting up to about 20 inches here in the next 24 hours. It's going to be a big rainmaker. It's going to be slow moving.

They're not being held in I.C.E. facilities at the border. Many of them have criminal convictions. At this point, it's a simple matter of enforcing America's laws. Bill Clinton did it. Barack Obama did it. But that was before. So these Democrats have made their decision. American laws do not matter. Nobody should be deported ever."

Initially, there were no caravans, and there was not going to be any problem, no crisis to the border. And then it was okay, there's a lot of people at the border, but we just have to let people go through their process. And if they don't get to stay after that, we promise we'll be okay with them being sent home. And now we know that that was a lie all along, too. They keep telling lies about this. And they're honestly running out of room at this point. And that's what -- we're facing nullification.

On Wednesday night, in Marion County, Florida, four armed home invaders broke into the home of a 61-year-old man. One invader was wearing a mask from a horror film. In Eric Swalwell's world that homeowner would have been helpless while four criminals robbed him and possibly murdered him. But thankfully that man lived in America instead and he was able to defend himself. Using an AR-15, he killed two of the intruders. The other two were arrested. The homeowner was shot, but he is alive tonight, thanks to his AR-15. Ryan Cleckner is a former Army Ranger sniper and a contributor at \"The Federalist.\" He joins us tonight.

I don't know if you remember, but Joe Biden once said that all you need is a double-barrel shotgun and fire two blast out the door and that's all you need to do. Well, I may not be very good at math, but my friend is and he said that two barrels and two shotgun shells with two blasts outside of a window leaves you with zero chance to protect yourself.

It's the modern musket. The musket at the time when we had on the Second Amendment was written that was a military grade firearm, it's what was common, it is what was used. It's what people knew how to use and have in their homes. That's what the AR-15 is today and trying to take it away, it flies in the face of the statistics that actually keep us safer.

Nobody even noticed when she said it. Democrats instead continued working on what they're calling the Diverse Asset Managers Act. If passed, this law would require every single firm engaged in the $70 trillion asset management business to implement affirmative action based on sex and skin color. Companies would be required to file reports with the government describing the race of their employees because according to Democrats, your race is the single most important thing about you.

If there's one reason to vote Republican, it is to push back against insanity like this. And yet the Republicans in Congress aren't. In fact, several Republicans have taken turns extolling how important this committee is and how critical it is to foster diversity and finance as opposed to fostering competence or fairness or something that actually matters. Ann Wagner of Missouri is the Republican Ranking Member on that committee. She said that she is quote, \"honored\" to be working on what she calls a very important subcommittee. She might be rewarded for that groveling. Another committee member has proposed requiring financial companies to interview people of specific skin colors when jobs come open.

      "utterance": "Well, every freedom that we hold dear as Americans, every principle -- equality, unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; inclusion, tolerance, freedom of speech -- every one of these originated as a Christian idea and a Protestant Christian idea at that, and that's because 98 percent of the people who created this country were Protestant Christians. Before the Protestant Reformation, you had to go through the Catholic Church in its priesthood to get into heaven. But the reformers understood that churches and governments are institutions created by human beings and therefore is subject to the corruption of human beings. And they came up with this brilliant and revolutionary idea of the priesthood of all believers. The idea of being that each of us faces our Maker one-on-one, without the intermediary of a church or a priesthood. When you think about that for a moment, that not only makes everybody equal, but it included black slaves. And that's why, from the moment of America's birth, there was a new dawn of freedom. We wrote into the declaration -- Thomas Jefferson wrote it into the Declaration of Independence, and within 25 years, there were hundreds of thousands of freed slaves in the north. And, you know, I'm thinking of this ignorant attack by Colin Kaepernick and Nike on the Betsy Ross flag, which just really goes with the creation of America. The creation of America was probably the greatest gift given to black people in 3,000 years because slavery was considered a normal institution for all those years. Unfortunately, the people who hate America on the left, and this embraces so much at the Democratic Party these days have conducted at 50-year or 60-year attack on Christianity in this country. They've driven prayer and religion out of the schools. You can't teach a public school child that the pilgrims were Christians fleeing persecution. So Americans no longer know where their freedoms come from, and that's why when the Democratic Party now is, you know, in a full scale march to eliminate a lot of the institutions that were there from the beginning, like the Electoral College, they want to do away with the Senate, and so forth. That's because they don't understand where our freedoms come from or what their nature is."

Because if they come from government, you know, people like Maxine Waters, they're going to be taken away. So the framework of our freedom is dependent on the Christian nature of this country, as is the fact that we're a secular Republic. Why are we a secular Republic? Because all of these different Protestant sects understood that there would be a threat because they were fleeing established churches, in England. They don't want any particular religion to be dominant or any particular interpretation of religion. It's a radical idea that makes America the unique country in the world that it is. And when I see these attacks --"

      "utterance": "Want to feel old? It turns out \"The Lion King\" came out 25 years ago, so long ago that Disney is remaking it. The new version comes out next week. It's practically guaranteed to make a billion dollars or whatever, but not everybody is excited about it. A few weeks ago, you'll remember some critics called \"Toy Story 4\" -- hard to pronounce movie -- they called it racist and anti-gay for how it portrayed children's toys. Now, hoping to make an even crazier point, a \"Washington Post\" piece says \"The Lion King\" remake is fascist, sexist and racist, even though it contains no human beings at all. Joe Concha thinks and writes about the American media for \"The Hill\" newspaper and he joins us tonight. So Joe, is this -- do you think this is a sophisticated parody that we've been taken in by?"

      "utterance": "No, I think that people that write this stuff, Tucker, they're being serious. You know, this was in \"The Washington Post,\" this review that you talked about where this is being compared to a film that's about white supremacy, that it's about fascism. It's a story about a son and a baby lion. That's what it is about. And the slogan for \"The Washington Post\" is democracy dies in darkness. In this case, it's democracy dies in derangement, as in derangement syndrome around this President, because then of course, it's brought back to Trump as well in this review. And look, I love numbers, because they're great to make an argument on, they tend to behave. The first version that you talked about in 1994 and yes, I do feel old, 35 percent of the actors in the film doing the voiceovers -- 35 percent were doing the voiceover, so sort of black actors that were in the film, okay. In this version 80 percent of the actors -- eight in 10 are the cast members. Beyonce is the main cast member. I believe she was a very active supporter of the previous President. Would she really have signed on to a film that promotes fascism and white supremacy? Yes, I'm not thinking that's going to be the case."

      "utterance": "They're the problem. Yes, certainly. And I'm glad I didn't go to that particular college to do my media studies in this case. Can you imagine how many kids are being indoctrinated to be the next media reporters and columnist in the world? But look, we've lost our ability to have escapism, Tucker, at this point, right? I mean, you watch the Women's World Cup, and right after they win, you would think you'd hear \"USA.\" No, you hear \"Equal pay,\" and \"F Trump.\" You watch the Super Bowl, or at least you watch the NFL and it's all about kneeling. You watch the Oscars, the Emmys, the Golden Globes, all the same thing. They all become political, and they're all anti-conservative, all in one direction. We've lost our ability just to get away from it sometimes even with a Disney movie."
