So far the Chinese have never halted the North Koreans. This has to be sort of this final test, right. They are undeterred, the North Koreans are undeterred, Kim is by President Trump. He just is. It's really on the Chinese.

But I thought that his speech that he gave this week was, it sort of laid out the Trump doctrine. He started with hard power, he started the speech by saying, look, we are investing, we have the greatest military unearth and it's about to be even stronger. We're going to invest more money. And then he goes on to sort of call out people. And I do think that that kind of blunt talk that makes a lot of people around here very uncomfortable has gone a long way towards making it very clear. And another thing that I think is important is people talk about how transactional he is. He's a businessman. Yes, I think that's probably a healthy thing here. This America first thing is a very healthy thing where everybody knows where he stands, where America stands.
