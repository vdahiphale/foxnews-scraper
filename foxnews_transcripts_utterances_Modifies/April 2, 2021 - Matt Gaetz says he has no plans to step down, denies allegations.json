The attacker is dead, and security, once again, is increased at the U.S. Capitol. Another deadly security incident at the Capitol building less than three months after the January 6th riot.  This time, a man drove a car into a barricade hitting two officers, killing one of them. Authorities say the driver emerged from the car with a large knife and was shot and killed by Capitol Police. It's believed he acted alone, but the investigation continues at this hour.  Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has been following this all day up on Capitol Hill and has the latest tonight.

Georgians and all Americans should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every part of your life, sports included.\"  It was just four years ago that the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of North Carolina after that state passed a law regulating the use of public bathrooms by a transgender individual.

But this does raise questions. Should Constitution Avenue even be open to traffic? It was closed for more than two months after the riot.

Now, that assertion drew a blistering response from Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp. In his statement said, \"Today, Major League Baseball cave to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies. Georgians and all Americans should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every part of your life, sports included.\" It was just four years ago that the NBA moved its All-Star Game out of North Carolina after that state passed a law regulating the use of public bathrooms by a transgender individual.

Stacey Abrams who ran and lost against Kemp, tweeted, \"Disappointed, MLB will move the All-Star Game, but proud of their stance on voting rights. I urge events and productions to come and speak out or stay and fight.\" That sentiment echoed by the new Democratic senator here, Jon Ossoff, who said he categorically opposes any events moving out of the state or any boycotts. He said that business -- the growth of business here in Georgia is what is driving this political progress. So, it's a move really as it stands now, here in Georgia, doesn't seem to please either Democrat or Republican.

Officer Gibson and Officer Chestnut, and our -- and their names really stay with us because at the time it was so shocking, we really thought the Capitol complex was inviolable. And thinking about my first reaction today when I heard the news of this Capitol Hill police officer losing his life, in this very different altercation, just as the perimeter has changed and eased very recently, my first reaction was what kind of threats will they face next week and the week after that? They are a target. And so, this man seems to have had terrible mental problems. It is not seem to be an episode of political violence, but it still means that this is a place that people who seek to cause harm or get themselves in a shootout with police in a suicidal mission, or anything dangerous are gravitating towards. And it really brings an urgency to this issue after January 6th, when over 100 -- more than 100 Capitol Police officers were injured and are still recovering.

And they have said that it is racist to support voting integrity. That is ridiculous and it is preposterous that they would say that. It's also ridiculous that Major League Baseball would believe that or regurgitate that. And baseball is in no position to be doing this. They have trouble keeping fans like me, they losing fans like me. They have no attraction to younger crowds, they already supported the violent riots last summer, which turned off a lot of fans, and now they're telling the entire Republican Party that they would like them to stop being fans.

The law made a modest change, replacing a vague phrase, normal business hours, presumed to be 9:00-5:00 to a more specific 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. time period. Some rural county election offices worked only part-time during the week, not a full eight-hour day, so the shift to be more specific makes it clear they must be open every weekday at least eight hours. But that's the minimum.\" It goes on to give counties, Byron, of the option to stay open longer earlier and later than 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the early voting but it's 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Election Day."

And not just Republicans, Stacey Abrams who was basically the heroine of the voting rights movement among Democrats in Georgia, said, please, please, do not boycott our state. Senator Ossoff, newly elected in that January 5th runoff, Democrat, said he disagrees with what Biden is doing on here. Senator Warnock, the other senator elected on January 5th is a little bit -- less decisive about that, but there are top figures in Georgia saying this does not warrant some sort of boycott.

Gaetz, who is not married -- was not married at the time, but is currently engaged, has strongly denied the allegations. And, in fact, he has even suggested that he reached out to the FBI because this could all be part of a possible extortion plot. Unnamed sources have told the Miami Herald newspaper that Gaetz was a part of a group of young male lawmakers who at the time created a game to score their female sexual conquests, which allegedly granted points for various targets such as interns, staffers, and other female colleagues at the statehouse in Tallahassee.

      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "Spending on record is going to boost American innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like battery technology, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy, the competition with China in particular."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "In that competition, China is well ahead. A report from research firm BloombergNEF on lithium- ion battery supply chains says China controls 80 percent of the world's raw material refining, more than three quarts of global cell capacity, and 60 percent of the planet's component manufacturing. That means realizing President Biden's transportation future of electric cars would depend on China unless the U.S. develops its own capacity. Part of his $2 trillion infrastructure plan features $174 billion for the electric car network, including battery supply chains and charging stations."

      "utterance": "It will be important to watch where that money is spent and how it is spent. Will it be driven by political considerations, or will it be driven by where the best research into batteries is going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDSON",
      "utterance": "But there is opposition, especially from union workers. Many whose current jobs would disappear in a battery dominated transportation system. Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is in the middle of that fight. She tells FOX News, quote, \"I have spent too long with labor being pitted against environmentalists. My last session of Congress was sheer hell. I'm talking to the labor unions every day, and I'm talking to the environmentalists. There are very honest conversations going on between the two sides.\" Another challenge -- timing, as building infrastructure in the U.S. can often be more expensive and take longer than in other developed countries."

    {
      "speaker": "EDSON",
      "utterance": "Now, there is bipartisan support for bolstering American manufacturing, especially after the global pandemic highlighted how much of the medical supply chain is based overseas. The question for Congress is how to bring that back. Bret?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDSON",
      "utterance": "That's right. The State Department announced today, Bret, that the U.S. would begin indirect discussions with Iran next week in Vienna. The countries still in the Iran nuclear deal would act as intermediaries as part of all of this and try to resurrect that 2015 agreement, also known as the JCPOA. In a statement, the State Department says they will discuss, quote, \"The nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, and that the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order to return to compliance as well.\" Diplomats close to the discussion say the two sides have already exchanged discussions and ideas. Back to you."

      "utterance": "A little skepticism about how that will all come out, but we will follow it. Rich, thank you. Some other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. At least 51 people are dead in Taiwan after a train barreled into an unmanned truck that had rolled onto the track. Dozens more are injured in the island's deadliest rail disaster. The government says the truck's emergency break was not properly engaged and the vehicle slid about 65 feet down a hillside on to that track. President Biden says he cares about and wants to visit Ukraine. The president talking with his Ukrainian counterpart today on the phone for the first time since taking office. President Biden affirmed U.S. support of Ukraine as Russia continues military movements near their shared border. The Ukrainian leader said he appreciates U.S. support. American rap artist and singer Akon visits Uganda in search of investment opportunities that would extend his business footprint in Africa. One of his efforts, a futuristic planned city. Akon's wife has revealed plans to invest $12 million in the country's entertainment industry. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. Up next, the panel joins us for the lightning round. We'll talk about the White House, too."

But, that's what we have so far as his book gets ready to come out. We've got the Friday Lightning Round, back to our panel, Mollie, A.B., and Byron. Byron, it's pretty amazing the evolution of that story, and now he's coming out and doing interviews. BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Now he tells us. He was very, very quiet for months, all through the election, the transition, the beginning of his father's presidency. Now he tells us. Having a book to sell will do it every time. But I think the people who are looking really, really bad here are the people who run Twitter and Facebook who suppressed this story when it came out in the \"New York Post\" in October of last year. Many major media organizations that tried to ignore it or, or write it all off to Russian disinformation, which you just heard John Ratcliffe, the former intelligence chief, say it was not. And one thing that Hunter Biden really didn't seem to suggest was that it wasn't his. Perhaps it was a laptop that was stolen, perhaps it was hacked. But it certainly could have been his. Now he tells us."

      "speaker": "A.B. STODDARD, REAL CLEAR POLITICS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we're going to have to wait until the end of the investigation to find out what's going on, because if you read the clips from the interview, he says three times it might have been stolen from me, but it might have been hacked, and it might be Russian disinformation, but, sure, it might have been stolen from me. He doesn't know if he had a computer that was stolen from him, that's missing? He's not credible. He's a very troubled guy. His father believes whatever he tells him. There was Russian disinformation in this campaign intended to hurt candidate Biden, but we're going to have to wait until the DOJ and the FBI tell us what happened to this laptop, because he doesn't seem to know if he has lost a computer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And he is very detailed about his past as far as drug -- substance abuse, which is very serious, Mollie, but not as detailed about what happened to the computer or his finances. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, I think we all know it's Hunter Biden's laptop. We have always known it's Hunter Biden's laptop, and that's why big tech and big media suppressed that story. The greatest amount of disinformation in the 2020 campaign came from our own media which suppressed this very important story, which wasn't about -- yes, it's very salacious that Hunter Biden has had a history of problems with drugs and whatnot. But the bigger issue was that it dealt with corruption of the Biden family business, and that story was willfully suppressed by his fans, by Biden's fans in the media and in tech, and that's why it's such an important story. We don't really need to know how it ends because we also know that our Justice Department basically has two standards, one for people who they are friends with, and one who they are not, so I wouldn't expect anything to come of it."
