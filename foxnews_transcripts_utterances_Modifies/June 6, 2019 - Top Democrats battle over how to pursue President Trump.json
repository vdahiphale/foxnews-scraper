The lucky survivors of the 73,000-plus Americans who liberated Europe, and in some cases, spent their last day on those beaches. As always, we must remind ourselves that the lives we lead are based on the lives of others. If you're living a prosperous, peaceful life in America, they built that. That includes our freedom to pursue happiness and especially the God-given right to be stupid and self-obsessed. We owe that to them, too.  The leisure time and carefree existence that enable us to be shallow, that was only possible by boys who never saw what we have experienced, boys who never dated, never married, because they never even had a first kiss or found a girlfriend. They were never liked on Facebook or shamed on Twitter. Their life experiences ended so yours could begin. So what have you done with it? Have you savored that gift or wasted it? In the lives since theirs, we see people addressing the faults of those from the past. We are the enlightened generation, shedding the sins of those who came before us. We, the young, superior, and open-minded scoff at the old, frail, and infirm, do they know about our wretched past? And if they do, why haven't they done anything about it?  It turns out they already did a lot. They faced real aggressions so others could complain about micro-aggressions. That's not a good look, especially when you see it from the beach in Normandy 75 years ago, a place that was nobody's idea of a safe space.   I really enjoyed that there was one moment today featuring a 93-year-old veteran flirting with the first lady. Did you see it? I just can't get tired of this.",

The only thing that's really worked so far, one judge said that some of these migrants can stay in Mexico, while they are processed. Another judge said yes, the national emergency does allow the President to move money for the border wall, fine. That will probably get blown out by another judge. And then this terror threat, this is the only thing that's actually gotten Mexico to get up to do something. The delegation scrambled over to the White House to try to negotiate something.

Most of them have criminal records.

It's interesting that Kirsten Gillibrand's big beef is that the poor aren't having enough abortions. That's the beef. Okay. The Hyde Amendment to your point is necessary to prevent war. The Hyde Amendment allows pro- lifers to reconcile their beliefs with reality. It's legal. I'm a pro-lifer. I get it. But I can't be part of it. Right? I can't be part of it. Call that abortion pacifism? But you bill me, you make me part of it, and then you make me very angry. Because that -- you have -- look, you have abortion, you won, all right.

I want to see him in prison.\" Pelosi's comments reportedly happening during a closed door meeting with top Democrats on Tuesday night. You know what this sounds like to me? She's just throwing the left a bone to make them seem like, \"Yes, I'm really -- I want to get Trump really badly.\"",

The lucky survivors of the 73,000-plus Americans who liberated Europe, and in some cases, spent their last day on those beaches. As always, we must remind ourselves that the lives we lead are based on the lives of others. If you're living a prosperous, peaceful life in America, they built that. That includes our freedom to pursue happiness and especially the God-given right to be stupid and self-obsessed. We owe that to them, too. The leisure time and carefree existence that enable us to be shallow, that was only possible by boys who never saw what we have experienced, boys who never dated, never married, because they never even had a first kiss or found a girlfriend. They were never liked on Facebook or shamed on Twitter. Their life experiences ended so yours could begin. So what have you done with it? Have you savored that gift or wasted it? In the lives since theirs, we see people addressing the faults of those from the past. We are the enlightened generation, shedding the sins of those who came before us. We, the young, superior, and open-minded scoff at the old, frail, and infirm, do they know about our wretched past? And if they do, why haven't they done anything about it? It turns out they already did a lot. They faced real aggressions so others could complain about micro-aggressions. That's not a good look, especially when you see it from the beach in Normandy 75 years ago, a place that was nobody's idea of a safe space. I really enjoyed that there was one moment today featuring a 93-year-old veteran flirting with the first lady. Did you see it? I just can't get tired of this."

And it's important for him to hear because you want to know that people are grateful for your sacrifice.

You know, he can say Trump created the crisis. You know, that's not true. You can say oh, you know, we just give them more beds. That's just a band-aid. That's -- that's not addressing the actual issue. A real reporter went up to a Democrat on Capitol Hill and said are you OK with a million migrants coming to the country unchecked? Is that OK with you? I mean, that would actually spur some movement. But they won't do that because they are on the side of Democrats. The only thing that's really worked so far, one judge said that some of these migrants can stay in Mexico, while they are processed. Another judge said yes, the national emergency does allow the President to move money for the border wall, fine. That will probably get blown out by another judge. And then this terror threat, this is the only thing that's actually gotten Mexico to get up to do something. The delegation scrambled over to the White House to try to negotiate something.

You had voting this week on a DACA Amnesty Bill that has tons of loopholes for criminal aliens who have violent criminal records, and people like AOC who want to get rid of ICE, when really their sole job in terms of illegal immigration is to go into the country, into the Interior and have deportation orders out. Most of them have criminal records. And so, when it comes to solving this problem, the White House keeps talking about Democrats and not getting on board with any kind of legislation, but the fact is that Lindsey Graham has introduced an 11-paged bill that actually solves this current problem. It doesn't mix in a bunk of other issues like DACA or anything else. It is specifically focused to the issue of raising the asylum bar, making sure asylum claims from such Americans are done in Mexico, and also allowing families to be detained for 100 days rather than 20, so that border patrol can process them thoroughly.

It's like you're the parent, you're the mean bad daddy. So the result is inaction. And then, later, crisis, and 34,000 arrests, you got child smuggling, human trafficking, that's a crisis. But the Democrats will only see a crisis if it benefits them. So, remember, when we saw that child in a cage that was a crisis until we found out that picture was taken under Obama.

What have you here are families and in specific high numbers of children seeking asylum. So, it seems to me it was a key campaign promise. And he had two years of Republican congress. He didn't solve it. He has exacerbated worse than this problem. Finally, what we have in terms of a deal now, and I think they're getting close to something is coordinating a regional approach that would require Central Americans, not the Mexicans, but the Central Americans who are seeking asylum to land in the first country that they touch. And that they would make the asylum claim there. Now, the ACLU and others are saying hey, have you got to stick with the law.

They will be separated. OK. And then, that's how you are able to pass every appropriations bill for the last 25, 30 years. So anybody who is running for President who is actually in Congress now that has actually had a chance to vote on appropriations bill has voted on it. That doesn't mean they have to like it. But it really is the only way you have been able to do it. That's why it was so surprising six weeks ago or so when the Biden team said through a written statement, remember, this wasn't an off-the-cuff gaffe.

So Joe Biden, clearly in the Democratic polling shows they want a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, which means you have to be in the mainstream of America when it comes to controversial issues, including abortion. So he clearly went back on the Hyde Amendment, so he no longer supports it, because he wants to support the far left of the base that supports abortion up to the day of birth, which is far more extreme than protecting life. And the majority of women in this country think that there should be restrictions on abortion up to -- after the first and second trimester. And so they're looking at the numbers and trying to balance out. We have a primary, how are we going to satisfy the left while also trying to win a general election when Republicans have been fighting on this issue, and President Trump isn't afraid of it in a way that a lot of other people have been for decades. And for Elizabeth Warren to lie, and say that if you keep the Hyde Amendment, poor women can't get abortions? Well, Planned Parenthood gets $500,000.00 or $500 million every single year from taxpayers for other services for women's health.

      "utterance": "It's not a healthcare issue. Never was. Okay. That's rhetoric, and it's robotic rhetoric that's being used by all the candidates. Biden is a coward from falling for it. This is not making abortion impossible for the poor. It just means you can't take my money to pay for the abortion. That doesn't make it impossible. It's interesting that Kirsten Gillibrand's big beef is that the poor aren't having enough abortions. That's the beef. Okay. The Hyde Amendment to your point is necessary to prevent war. The Hyde Amendment allows pro- lifers to reconcile their beliefs with reality. It's legal. I'm a pro-lifer. I get it. But I can't be part of it. Right? I can't be part of it. Call that abortion pacifism? But you bill me, you make me part of it, and then you make me very angry. Because that -- you have -- look, you have abortion, you won, all right. But if you expect me to pay, you will lose. Because half the country will not do this. And this will lead to a bigger division than you will ever see. In times of slavery, you could oppose slavery by buying products that weren't made by slaves, or by moving to states where there wasn't slavery, that put off war for a while. So you've got to empathize with a pro-lifer on this, who feels the same way that they don't want to be part of ending the life of an unborn child. Asking me to pay for that would be asking me to pay for your elective choice, your right to own a slave. Right? Because that's what I feel that it is an immoral thing. The fact that Bernie Sanders says there's no middle ground, that there's -- what he is saying is he is removing the dialogue between thought and violence. What he is saying that if you would disagree with the idea of me paying for your abortion? That's immoral? That's not an eligible opinion. What do you have left? But you have violence. You have to have the Hyde Amendment here so the people who are against abortion can at least still be against abortion. You've got to let them have it."
