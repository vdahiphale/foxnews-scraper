      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Could we be approaching a resolution in Ukraine? Or will Putin double down and Zelenskyy dig in as the Russian military surrounds Kyiv. In about two hours. Russia says it'll stop its bombardment and five Ukrainian cities including the capital. But as we have seen in the past, some of those ceasefires have been tenuous at best. Now, it's notable that the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has moved off his demand that Ukraine gain NATO membership and that could be a major concession from what he was saying just a few days to go. But the Biden administration proceeded today as if none of these potentially positive developments were even happening. Instead, they dispatch their intel officials to Capitol Hill to paint a picture of what could be a bloody month ahead, presumably with billions of dollars on the line. So, what's really going on here? Tulsi Gabbard has a theory, and she's going to join us in moments. But first, let's check in with Fox's Benjamin Hall who's standing by in the Ukrainian capital. Benjamin, what is the situation there tonight?",

On the one hand, you have humanitarian supplies which are unable to get into these besieged cities. On the other you have people who are unable to leave them. In the city of Mariupol, 200,000 people have been trying to escape for about a week now. Bodies lie on the street. They have very little food, water heating, hospitals are running out of supplies, very low on painkillers, very low on antibiotics. The death toll there is unknown, and yet Putin's bombs they keep dropping. There was one successful evacuation today from the northern city of Sumy 3500 people taken out on buses but as you said the others all failed. According to the Red Cross, the routes into Mariupol had been mined and other corridors were being shelled. Russia has now announced that other ceasefire for tomorrow at 9 again, and the civilians they will try again. Meanwhile, although Russian forces do continue to make some gains, particularly around Kyiv, they also continue to suffer major losses. This convoy was destroyed outside Sumy, that being said, despite these Russian setbacks, the sheer size scale of the Russian army means they just keep coming. President Zelenskyy today, again, called for more help.",

A two points here, the first thing I thought is why isn't this making headlines everywhere? Why isn't everybody talking about this? Even ABC News themselves, didn't write a great piece and publish this across all their platforms had to dig to find it. But secondly, and really most importantly, is, why isn't the Biden-Harris administration, charging forward to take advantage of and support President Zelenskyy in this opening that that he has created in trying to bring about an end to this conflict, bringing about an end to this suffering that we're seeing every single day.",

Why is that because it's good for the military industrial complex, it makes these politicians look tough. And really, it allows them to have this proxy war with Russia, something that Hillary Clinton laid out, just recently, really what their aims are this this war machine, this power elite in Washington is, they want to turn Ukraine into another Afghanistan, turned into this killing fields where this long-term insurgency is supported.

The question that we should all be asking them is OK, tell us how Russia somehow has the power to take away our freedom of speech here in America. Tell us how Russia has the power to take away the freedom and rights of parents who want to - make sure their kids are getting a quality education. Tell us how Russia has the power somehow to take away our rights to bear arms, the rights that are enshrined in our Bill of Rights. The answer to these is, they don't, they don't have that power.

Now there was a pretty stunning poll released yesterday that speaks not only to the current conflict, but also to Americans views of their own country. The Quinnipiac survey asked Americans what they would do if they face the same situations as Ukrainians are facing right now. Would they stay in fight? Or would they run? Majorities of Republicans and independents said, not surprisingly, they would fight. But 52 percent of Democrats only said, that they would well said, they would leave the country. And by 48 percent to 45 percent margin, 18 to 34 year olds said they'd also flee.

And so, they're not connected to, they haven't been taught about the beauty of America and have a real love and passion for it. And so, I think in some ways, these poll numbers reflect exactly what we're seeing. We did a poll actually, for RealClearOpinion research in last July, asking about patriotism. And the Generation Z, the millennials, 49 percent of all Americans said that they were very patriotic, but only 28 percent of the youngest generation, those millennials said that they were very patriotic.

When most of Europe is still buying oil from Russia, and when China is there to pick up the slack. Our oil sanctions, they're not nothing but they're basically symbolic. Finally, the venal destructive role our press is playing here cannot be overstated. They don't believe that Americans paying higher gas and food prices is a real sacrifice for them. They believe America has too much. And it's time to reset the American mind altogether. Global thinking only, please. Now, despite all their alleged concern about Ukraine, the media remain committed to what we know is just a highly partisan and divisive agenda that weakens our country and ends up helping our enemies. For example, they could support more drilling here at home, so would be more energy independent, but they're not going to. They could dial back some of their anti-American propaganda that China is always citing back at us. But they won't. They could acknowledge that the 74 million people who voted for Donald Trump are loyal Americans, they're not traitors or fascists, but they're not going to do that. They can hold the Biden administration accountable occasionally for its mistakes, even if that means the GOP might, on occasion benefit. Not going to happen. They could tell the truth about China, including how it influences U.S. politics. Oh, don't hold your breath. All of these developments would make America stronger, and thereby put us in a better position to help Ukraine and defend democracy. But no one really expects the media to abandon its radical hard Left agenda. Instead, they're going to continue their civil war against America Firsters and their culture war against everyone who believes in traditional morality, and of course, their propaganda war against the whole idea of the United States. Because like Biden, and like the Democrats, they care more about those causes than they do about Ukraine. In fact, just like Biden himself, the only thing that they're willing to sacrifice here is America. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Victor, your take on how this is proceeding. We now learned today that Zelenskyy may be edging closer to some type of position that could lead to, we hope the ceasing of this invasion and then needless violence, but doesn't seem what - like what the press corps or certainly the establishment in Washington almost wants at this point.",

We're not denying that. That's not the point that we're discussing. It's part of the question that really should be asked, which is it's not about whether or not it reduces risk of hospitalization. The question about is whether it's the right decision for the patient in front of you. So the considerations for that include the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of these children, in fact, most of the children based on CDC data, have already had COVID-19.

Or will Putin double down and Zelenskyy dig in as the Russian military surrounds Kyiv. In about two hours. Russia says it'll stop its bombardment and five Ukrainian cities including the capital. But as we have seen in the past, some of those ceasefires have been tenuous at best. Now, it's notable that the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has moved off his demand that Ukraine gain NATO membership and that could be a major concession from what he was saying just a few days to go. But the Biden administration proceeded today as if none of these potentially positive developments were even happening. Instead, they dispatch their intel officials to Capitol Hill to paint a picture of what could be a bloody month ahead, presumably with billions of dollars on the line. So, what's really going on here? Tulsi Gabbard has a theory, and she's going to join us in moments. But first, let's check in with Fox's Benjamin Hall who's standing by in the Ukrainian capital. Benjamin, what is the situation there tonight?"

On the one hand, you have humanitarian supplies which are unable to get into these besieged cities. On the other you have people who are unable to leave them. In the city of Mariupol, 200,000 people have been trying to escape for about a week now. Bodies lie on the street. They have very little food, water heating, hospitals are running out of supplies, very low on painkillers, very low on antibiotics. The death toll there is unknown, and yet Putin's bombs they keep dropping. There was one successful evacuation today from the northern city of Sumy 3500 people taken out on buses but as you said the others all failed. According to the Red Cross, the routes into Mariupol had been mined and other corridors were being shelled. Russia has now announced that other ceasefire for tomorrow at 9 again, and the civilians they will try again. Meanwhile, although Russian forces do continue to make some gains, particularly around Kyiv, they also continue to suffer major losses. This convoy was destroyed outside Sumy, that being said, despite these Russian setbacks, the sheer size scale of the Russian army means they just keep coming. President Zelenskyy today, again, called for more help."

A two points here, the first thing I thought is why isn't this making headlines everywhere? Why isn't everybody talking about this? Even ABC News themselves, didn't write a great piece and publish this across all their platforms had to dig to find it. But secondly, and really most importantly, is, why isn't the Biden-Harris administration, charging forward to take advantage of and support President Zelenskyy in this opening that that he has created in trying to bring about an end to this conflict, bringing about an end to this suffering that we're seeing every single day."

Why is that because it's good for the military industrial complex, it makes these politicians look tough. And really, it allows them to have this proxy war with Russia, something that Hillary Clinton laid out, just recently, really what their aims are this this war machine, this power elite in Washington is, they want to turn Ukraine into another Afghanistan, turned into this killing fields where this long-term insurgency is supported. And they bleed out and cripple - kill as many Russians as possible for who knows, who knows how long and they're really showing their real aim in the fact that they're not taking action right now to end this conflict."

The question that we should all be asking them is OK, tell us how Russia somehow has the power to take away our freedom of speech here in America. Tell us how Russia has the power to take away the freedom and rights of parents who want to - make sure their kids are getting a quality education. Tell us how Russia has the power somehow to take away our rights to bear arms, the rights that are enshrined in our Bill of Rights. The answer to these is, they don't, they don't have that power.

Now there was a pretty stunning poll released yesterday that speaks not only to the current conflict, but also to Americans views of their own country. The Quinnipiac survey asked Americans what they would do if they face the same situations as Ukrainians are facing right now. Would they stay in fight? Or would they run? Majorities of Republicans and independents said, not surprisingly, they would fight. But 52 percent of Democrats only said, that they would well said, they would leave the country. And by 48 percent to 45 percent margin, 18 to 34 year olds said they'd also flee.

And I think the problem is, particularly when you look at the younger generation, they've been taught that America is a racist country, we have a shameful past. And so, they're not connected to, they haven't been taught about the beauty of America and have a real love and passion for it. And so, I think in some ways, these poll numbers reflect exactly what we're seeing. We did a poll actually, for RealClearOpinion research in last July, asking about patriotism. And the Generation Z, the millennials, 49 percent of all Americans said that they were very patriotic, but only 28 percent of the youngest generation, those millennials said that they were very patriotic. So, there's this disconnect from this younger generations that's been basically taught that America is a shameful place to live. And I think that's reflected in these poll numbers."

And it's Reuters Ipsos finding that 74 percent of Americans said that the U.S. and its allies, and NATO should impose a no-fly zone in Ukraine, Tom, how irresponsible, is it? Or is it irresponsible for these polling outfits to ask these provocative questions, without any context, what it would involve? And perhaps what it might trigger?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, look, polling is an art as much as it's a science. And it depends on how you ask the questions, how you phrase the questions, and whether you provide what those trade-offs are going to be. 75 percent of people may think a no-fly zone is a great idea until you ask them if you say the result of that, or the consequence of that might be triggering an all-out war with a nuclear powered Russia, and then you'd see those numbers drop dramatically. So, I think that is one of those questions that it is irresponsible, I think, to publish something like that without providing the context. And it's one of those questions that quite frankly, is better to be ignored in the current environment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's an anxiety gap created by the war. Look, I don't know what to make as much of that finding as 71 percent of the poll did support the ban on Russian oil. And so, I think there's big support for an economic boycott, but there is anxiety and Democrats have more anxiety, but remember, Republicans here may want to step it up and fight more. So, look, I think the American public is looking for leadership on this. They can't analyze all these issues and individual poll questions. The question is, what do our leaders thinks should be done and how should it be done and what the public wants is they want Putin push back. They want Ukraine saved and they don't want to get into a war. And we may or may not be able to accomplish all those things at once."

So, what would have made us stronger and freer, and by extension, make Europe stronger and freer. The Democrats wholeheartedly rejected. And that's all on Putin. Oh, he's just the beneficiary of our own self-loathing, self-destructive, terrible, awful rotten leadership. Biden swore to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States, not to uphold and protect international norms, global equity, climate change, and a border area and in a non-NATO country. Yet the people controlling Biden, they know full well that there Go Green Global agenda requires the resetting of the American mind away from the old normal to a new, more compliant kind of normal. So, every move they make is designed to prepare you, America, to get used to living with a little less, less travel, less privacy, less income, less freedom.

When most of Europe is still buying oil from Russia, and when China is there to pick up the slack. Our oil sanctions, they're not nothing but they're basically symbolic. Finally, the venal destructive role our press is playing here cannot be overstated. They don't believe that Americans paying higher gas and food prices is a real sacrifice for them. They believe America has too much. And it's time to reset the American mind altogether. Global thinking only, please. Now, despite all their alleged concern about Ukraine, the media remain committed to what we know is just a highly partisan and divisive agenda that weakens our country and ends up helping our enemies. For example, they could support more drilling here at home, so would be more energy independent, but they're not going to. They could dial back some of their anti-American propaganda that China is always citing back at us. But they won't. They could acknowledge that the 74 million people who voted for Donald Trump are loyal Americans, they're not traitors or fascists, but they're not going to do that. They can hold the Biden administration accountable occasionally for its mistakes, even if that means the GOP might, on occasion benefit. Not going to happen. They could tell the truth about China, including how it influences U.S. politics. Oh, don't hold your breath. All of these developments would make America stronger, and thereby put us in a better position to help Ukraine and defend democracy. But no one really expects the media to abandon its radical hard Left agenda. Instead, they're going to continue their civil war against America Firsters and their culture war against everyone who believes in traditional morality, and of course, their propaganda war against the whole idea of the United States. Because like Biden, and like the Democrats, they care more about those causes than they do about Ukraine. In fact, just like Biden himself, the only thing that they're willing to sacrifice here is America. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Victor, your take on how this is proceeding. We now learned today that Zelenskyy may be edging closer to some type of position that could lead to, we hope the ceasing of this invasion and then needless violence, but doesn't seem what - like what the press corps or certainly the establishment in Washington almost wants at this point."

And he should, if he can get a good deal, and it's a tribute to his courage and his people, but Laura, we talked about this administration, the middle class, you and I have talked about this hypocrisy of our bi-coastal elite, therefore, they put their kids in prep school, they're against charter schools, they make fun of walls, they have Nancy Pelosi or Mark Zuckerberg have these big walls. But when you're in a war, or you're in a pandemic, it's kind of the scab gets torn off. And I think we got the wrong paradigm. These people are very cruel, and they don't care. So, when Biden says there's, it's not his fault, or Pete Buttigieg talks about electric charging stations, he's telling the guy down the 99 freeway, who's driving 12 hours a day, in a diesel truck, you should learn coding, you're going to lose $200 a day, that's no big deal.

Now go speculate in the Wall Street, the market go, flip houses, but we're sorry that your 1 percent interest, if you can get that in your passbook has just cost you about 7.5 percent of your life savings in one year.

We have this idea that borders are obsolete, but they're really telling people along the border, we don't care how your schools are impacted, your crime.

Mora was out on bail after being arrested five days earlier for drunk driving and assaulting an officer. But here's the worst part. He was in the U.S. illegally. So why wasn't he apprehended by ICE and deported? Because California's sanctuary laws, they barred local authorities from handing him over or even communicating with ICE agents after the arrest.

And I have been screaming this from the rooftop. I have spoken in front of Congress. And this is just the latest tragedy. And the infuriating part about this, and you alluded to it with the sanctuary state law, is ICE did what they were supposed to do when this person was in custody five days prior. They served a detainer saying we know where this guy is. We want him. We want to take custody of him. But solely because of our sanctuary state laws, the jail was unable to not only hold the person but communicate with ICE in any way about his release.

The media has been hysterical about our announcement, and the argument that you hear is that, well, the vaccines and the COVID vaccines in children reduce the risk of hospitalization. We're not denying that. That's not the point that we're discussing. It's part of the question that really should be asked, which is it's not about whether or not it reduces risk of hospitalization. The question about is whether it's the right decision for the patient in front of you. So the considerations for that include the fact that, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of these children, in fact, most of the children based on CDC data, have already had COVID-19. Do any data indicate that children who have had COVID-19 who are healthy have any clinical benefit from COVID-19 vaccination? There's no data that shows that."

It includes 1,291 different adverse events following vaccination. Dr. Ladapo, we reached out to Pfizer to confirm the issue with these documents. We haven't heard back. Either way, it seems like the medical establishment has been downplaying the negative side effects from COVID vaccines, everything from kidney issues, brainstem embolisms, thrombosis, cardiac events, we know myocarditis, neonatal death. There are all sorts of negative side effects in this report, and yet nobody wants to talk about them. Why is that?"

So it's like, whatever is good we'll talk about, whatever is not so good we'll ignore. And we're not going to do that in Florida. The data are the data. Show me the data that show the benefits outweigh the risks in healthy children, and we will happily revise our policy. But those data don't exist because it is a big question mark for healthy children. That's the truth. Those are the facts.
