But first, a crucial update on Hurricane Michael, which came ashore as the strongest storm to hit the gulf coast of the United States since Hurricane Camille in 1969, 155-mile-an-hour maximum sustained winds upon landfall. Now it's moving inland and headed for Georgia. The National Hurricane Center now with a live update from their meteorologist.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back to the National Hurricane Center. This is Ken Graham. And our operation area looking at the official clock here at the hurricane center, it's 5 o'clock eastern, 4 o'clock central. Let's get the latest information on Hurricane Michael. You can see well inland now, the center of it is already approaching pretty close to the Georgia border. So with time, I mean, you're going to start seeing some of these, you know, the heavier rain and some of these wind entering Georgia as well. What's interesting about it you can still see the eye of the storm well inland with time, and that just signifying how powerful this system was when it made landfall, and Michael continues to show some of those powerful winds.  So, just because you're not on the coast doesn't mean you couldn't get some of this wind damage with time. We do expect even further movement of the eye. So you could see some of these trees down and power outages into Georgia. And really looking at that forecast, and this is the brand-new one right here, you can still see some of the tropical storm force winds extending well away from the center, so that becomes a problem. By the time you start into central Georgia eventually here this evening becoming a tropical storm. But in the meantime, still some pretty hefty winds. Still could be some issues associated with fallen trees and some power outages. Notice with time, still a tropical storm moving back into the Atlantic, so as a result we have a tropical storm warning for portions of Georgia, South Carolina into North Carolina. So this system keeps on going with time.  So let's look at some of that -- the impact associated with this. One of them is going to be -- you start looking at this storm surge and really let's make this a little bit bigger so everybody can see it. I mean, the storm surge is still going to be there and you also have the rain, so both of those combining still makes some -- some dangerous with the water, so let's look at that a little closer, so still looking at some rainfall that could occur. Now, luckily were moving pretty quickly here with the movement, and as a result we're not going to have a lingering system that can produce some of this flooding rain. But at the same time, some of those rain bands could produce 4 to 6 inches in some places. Let's look at the storm surge because it is brand new. This is the latest one that we have. And notice the numbers are down. The reason is because some of that water is going to try to drain. But let's really look at that a little closer. So the wind was powerful. We had a powerful storm move in and that forces the water inland, and once you start putting it in to some of these inland areas, some of these rivers and tributaries, all of a sudden it force in but it takes gravity, it takes time for it to flow back out, so it's going to be slow movement back out.  And the other factor here is you still have these winds rotating around Michael. So you could see some onshore flow continuing with time. And as a result, it takes time to really drain some of these places. So we really need to be careful. You know, there's debris on the ground. You have power lines down. You have a lot of damage out there. Plus, you still have some places with a lot of water. So that's something that we need to continue to watch with time. If we go into the future, we start looking at that forecast. You know, we really need to start keeping an eye on some of these -- this damage down in here, keep off the roadways, especially at night time. I think it becomes an issue. And I think when we start going into the future, you could see, you could see areas that with the rotation around even the storm, some of those tides could be elevated even on the east coast and the Atlantic. So that's the update on Hurricane Michael right here from the National Hurricane Center.",

We have no reports yet out of Tyndall, but it took a direct hit. Just east of there and by only a few miles is Mexico Beach, and look at this video that we've gotten in by social media from Mexico Beach. There is widespread damage there, though the center of the storm did not hit it. You can see there's debris floating, there's roofs off houses, the kind of damage that you would expect to the east of a major hurricane like this one.  Again, the meteorologists got it exactly right. It was projected to hit somewhere between Pensacola and Apalachicola, and it did. There were late fears that it would go directly over Panama City Beach, which would have been catastrophic and could very well have leveled thousands and thousands of buildings with forward speed of 14 to 16 miles an hour and 155-mile-an- hour winds. This thing hit one of the least populated areas in all of Florida. The next video we want to show you came from a town called Springfield, it's right outside of Panama City, and a local guy went out to assess the damage. Look.",

We're still getting some decent bursts of wind, but certainly not tropical storm strength by any means, much less hurricane strength, much like multiple hours throughout today where it was absolute ferocious here. All of this flooding came from storm surge from the Apalachicola River, which you could see up there on your left. That spilled into the streets. As well as Gulf of Mexico water that was being shoved upstream, pushing the river further north of Apalachicola, which could reveal in the next day, maybe even tonight, or the day after, a lot of flooding because all of that water has to go somewhere, and it couldn't for hours escape to the Gulf of Mexico. But the water here is finally receding. This is Water Street below us, as in asphalt, drivable street and, obviously, it's very appropriately named. Power outages throughout the panhandle and big bend, 200,000 households at this time have no electricity. The first search and rescue teams over in Panama City have now been deployed. We can presume that Franklin County where we are, is already doing that or about to do that themselves. Now that the rain has stopped, that's what really the sheriff's department, the police departments, as well as the state emergency operations center, all of the deployed teams down here really needed. So now they can go out, assess the damage, and hopefully find minimal fatalities if they find any. But with a storm like this, it certainly seems likely, Shep.",

I think the point needs to be driven home to people, why do you trust -- especially on healthcare, why do you trust bureaucrats to do a better job for yourself than you can do? Why?

There's a lot of socialist ideas that they're kicking around which are very dangerous. And if the Democrats get a hold of any level of government, especially the economy, they are going to slow down this boom so big wage growth is going to slow down. Investments are going to slow down. Entrepreneurships are going to slow down. It's going to be very dangerous. It's a very good message going into the midterms.",

Apalachicola was just east of where the hurricane, Cat 4, 155-mile-an-hour Hurricane Michael made landfall around 2 p.m. And so we were on the dirtier side of the storm. More rain, more wind, more storm surge. And take a look. Good news is the rain has stopped, the winds have significantly died down, and the water is receding. However, much of this town all on low-lying areas. In fact, most of the county, Franklin County, low-lying. So low-lying everybody was ordered to evacuate mandatorily. Of course, not everybody did. That's always the case. But the water is finally receding here. Everybody remains under a stay-in- shelter order, meaning if you didn't evacuate, you stayed in your house, don't leave your house until we tell you you can. Sunrise to sunset. That is the curfew that remains in effect, absolutely mandatory. And that will trigger in just a couple of hours. That's the Apalachicola River over there to your left. It flows from screen left to screen right all the way towards that bridge. Beyond the bridge is the Gulf of Mexico, and that's the natural outflow of the river. Well, all morning and afternoon long, the river was being blown and pushed back upstream because of the super-high hurricane winds. The last recorded-mile-per-hour I saw from Apalachicola was 87 miles an hour, but I'm certain gusts were stronger than that, because there were periods of hellacious impact weather that we were standing in and being hit by. So it was pushing all that water upstream beyond Apalachicola. So in the next hours, days, we will have seen and it will reveal how much flooding all of that created here and not only here but far east of us and beyond. The storm surge here was supposed to be 9 to 13 feet. It was 9 feet officially as the highest reading that we got for Apalachicola. But east of here, definitely other parts of the coastline which, fortunately, is very sparsely populated. So fewer people impacted. There's a lot of forest land, state and national. But a lot of the storm surge remains to be revealed. Search and rescue teams have now been deployed by helicopter and boat, by the Bay County Sheriff's Office. That's Panama City, which took a heavy hit, as well. We're expecting Franklin County, where we are, to also deploy the search teams now that the weather is decent enough. Get your high-profile vehicles, ATVs and shallow-draft boats, you can really get around. We don't know yet whether there are any fatalities here, but with a storm and hurricane of this magnitude, it would most likely be a sure thing at this point. But a lot of work to be done to see what the damage is over the next day or two -- Jesse.",

We've already been getting incredible images and video out of so many places showing the damage there. But it often takes till that water is gone until you can get into all of the locations and really get a good sense of the damage. It will certainly be extreme because of this storm. It's one of the strongest that we've ever had come on shore, really anywhere in the U.S., not just here in the Panhandle. Moving pretty quickly, that's kind of the good news of this storm, however, because it came onshore so strong at 155 miles an hour. It takes a long time for that energy to go away. And now it's just crossing in towards southwestern Georgia. Right there is the center of the storm right now. Came on at 155. But we still have officially from the National Hurricane Center 125-mile-an-hour storm all the way in towards Georgia. Here's how this plays out historically. Strongest by wind, making landfall in the U.S. It's the fourth strongest that we've ever seen. As far as pressure goes, the central pressure of the storm, 919 millibars, that puts it as the third most intense storm that we've ever had make landfall anywhere in the U.S. I will tell you this also. Hard to believe this did come very quickly. Just had a couple of days for it to grow. Water temperatures out here in the Gulf are around two to four degrees above average for this time of year, and that just gave it the fuel. Hard to predict that that was going to happen, though. Still seeing the winds here. I will tell you, a lot of the wind measurements here got blown out. So it's very difficult to get that verification right there. But they did test 155 miles an hour when that came onshore -- Jesse.",

So with time, I mean, you're going to start seeing some of these, you know, the heavier rain and some of these wind entering Georgia as well. What's interesting about it you can still see the eye of the storm well inland with time, and that just signifying how powerful this system was when it made landfall, and Michael continues to show some of those powerful winds. So, just because you're not on the coast doesn't mean you couldn't get some of this wind damage with time. We do expect even further movement of the eye. So you could see some of these trees down and power outages into Georgia. And really looking at that forecast, and this is the brand-new one right here, you can still see some of the tropical storm force winds extending well away from the center, so that becomes a problem. By the time you start into central Georgia eventually here this evening becoming a tropical storm. But in the meantime, still some pretty hefty winds. Still could be some issues associated with fallen trees and some power outages. Notice with time, still a tropical storm moving back into the Atlantic, so as a result we have a tropical storm warning for portions of Georgia, South Carolina into North Carolina. So this system keeps on going with time. So let's look at some of that -- the impact associated with this. One of them is going to be -- you start looking at this storm surge and really let's make this a little bit bigger so everybody can see it. I mean, the storm surge is still going to be there and you also have the rain, so both of those combining still makes some -- some dangerous with the water, so let's look at that a little closer, so still looking at some rainfall that could occur. Now, luckily were moving pretty quickly here with the movement, and as a result we're not going to have a lingering system that can produce some of this flooding rain. But at the same time, some of those rain bands could produce 4 to 6 inches in some places. Let's look at the storm surge because it is brand new. This is the latest one that we have. And notice the numbers are down. The reason is because some of that water is going to try to drain. But let's really look at that a little closer. So the wind was powerful. We had a powerful storm move in and that forces the water inland, and once you start putting it in to some of these inland areas, some of these rivers and tributaries, all of a sudden it force in but it takes gravity, it takes time for it to flow back out, so it's going to be slow movement back out. And the other factor here is you still have these winds rotating around Michael. So you could see some onshore flow continuing with time. And as a result, it takes time to really drain some of these places. So we really need to be careful. You know, there's debris on the ground. You have power lines down. You have a lot of damage out there. Plus, you still have some places with a lot of water. So that's something that we need to continue to watch with time. If we go into the future, we start looking at that forecast. You know, we really need to start keeping an eye on some of these -- this damage down in here, keep off the roadways, especially at night time. I think it becomes an issue. And I think when we start going into the future, you could see, you could see areas that with the rotation around even the storm, some of those tides could be elevated even on the east coast and the Atlantic. So that's the update on Hurricane Michael right here from the National Hurricane Center."

We have no reports yet out of Tyndall, but it took a direct hit. Just east of there and by only a few miles is Mexico Beach, and look at this video that we've gotten in by social media from Mexico Beach. There is widespread damage there, though the center of the storm did not hit it. You can see there's debris floating, there's roofs off houses, the kind of damage that you would expect to the east of a major hurricane like this one. Again, the meteorologists got it exactly right. It was projected to hit somewhere between Pensacola and Apalachicola, and it did. There were late fears that it would go directly over Panama City Beach, which would have been catastrophic and could very well have leveled thousands and thousands of buildings with forward speed of 14 to 16 miles an hour and 155-mile-an- hour winds. This thing hit one of the least populated areas in all of Florida. The next video we want to show you came from a town called Springfield, it's right outside of Panama City, and a local guy went out to assess the damage. Look."

This is the kind of damage here, not catastrophic damage, largely because the building boom here put up buildings like this one back there, huge steel, concrete, hurricane proof, allegedly, and based on the category 1 or maybe category 2 conditions that we had here, withstanding a hurricane of that magnitude.

We're still getting some decent bursts of wind, but certainly not tropical storm strength by any means, much less hurricane strength, much like multiple hours throughout today where it was absolute ferocious here. All of this flooding came from storm surge from the Apalachicola River, which you could see up there on your left. That spilled into the streets. As well as Gulf of Mexico water that was being shoved upstream, pushing the river further north of Apalachicola, which could reveal in the next day, maybe even tonight, or the day after, a lot of flooding because all of that water has to go somewhere, and it couldn't for hours escape to the Gulf of Mexico. But the water here is finally receding. This is Water Street below us, as in asphalt, drivable street and, obviously, it's very appropriately named. Power outages throughout the panhandle and big bend, 200,000 households at this time have no electricity. The first search and rescue teams over in Panama City have now been deployed. We can presume that Franklin County where we are, is already doing that or about to do that themselves. Now that the rain has stopped, that's what really the sheriff's department, the police departments, as well as the state emergency operations center, all of the deployed teams down here really needed. So now they can go out, assess the damage, and hopefully find minimal fatalities if they find any. But with a storm like this, it certainly seems likely, Shep."

We can feel it hitting the car and it's definitely knocking us around a little bit.

There's no water is blocking I-10, but there are some trees that have fallen down and, obviously, the public works departments for these cities that we're passing will, obviously, once the storm does pass, will then begin to clean the road here.

They have some audacity calling themselves pro- choice. I know they're limited to abortion, but it's insane. I think the point needs to be driven home to people, why do you trust -- especially on healthcare, why do you trust bureaucrats to do a better job for yourself than you can do? Why?

      "utterance": "Hey, Jesse. Apalachicola was just east of where the hurricane, Cat 4, 155-mile-an-hour Hurricane Michael made landfall around 2 p.m. And so we were on the dirtier side of the storm. More rain, more wind, more storm surge. And take a look. Good news is the rain has stopped, the winds have significantly died down, and the water is receding. However, much of this town all on low-lying areas. In fact, most of the county, Franklin County, low-lying. So low-lying everybody was ordered to evacuate mandatorily. Of course, not everybody did. That's always the case. But the water is finally receding here. Everybody remains under a stay-in- shelter order, meaning if you didn't evacuate, you stayed in your house, don't leave your house until we tell you you can. Sunrise to sunset. That is the curfew that remains in effect, absolutely mandatory. And that will trigger in just a couple of hours. That's the Apalachicola River over there to your left. It flows from screen left to screen right all the way towards that bridge. Beyond the bridge is the Gulf of Mexico, and that's the natural outflow of the river. Well, all morning and afternoon long, the river was being blown and pushed back upstream because of the super-high hurricane winds. The last recorded-mile-per-hour I saw from Apalachicola was 87 miles an hour, but I'm certain gusts were stronger than that, because there were periods of hellacious impact weather that we were standing in and being hit by. So it was pushing all that water upstream beyond Apalachicola. So in the next hours, days, we will have seen and it will reveal how much flooding all of that created here and not only here but far east of us and beyond. The storm surge here was supposed to be 9 to 13 feet. It was 9 feet officially as the highest reading that we got for Apalachicola. But east of here, definitely other parts of the coastline which, fortunately, is very sparsely populated. So fewer people impacted. There's a lot of forest land, state and national. But a lot of the storm surge remains to be revealed. Search and rescue teams have now been deployed by helicopter and boat, by the Bay County Sheriff's Office. That's Panama City, which took a heavy hit, as well. We're expecting Franklin County, where we are, to also deploy the search teams now that the weather is decent enough. Get your high-profile vehicles, ATVs and shallow-draft boats, you can really get around. We don't know yet whether there are any fatalities here, but with a storm and hurricane of this magnitude, it would most likely be a sure thing at this point. But a lot of work to be done to see what the damage is over the next day or two -- Jesse."

      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Hey, Jesse. It's really interesting. One thing that Phil just said, and that is when the water goes, then it will reveal what happened. We've already been getting incredible images and video out of so many places showing the damage there. But it often takes till that water is gone until you can get into all of the locations and really get a good sense of the damage. It will certainly be extreme because of this storm. It's one of the strongest that we've ever had come on shore, really anywhere in the U.S., not just here in the Panhandle. Moving pretty quickly, that's kind of the good news of this storm, however, because it came onshore so strong at 155 miles an hour. It takes a long time for that energy to go away. And now it's just crossing in towards southwestern Georgia. Right there is the center of the storm right now. Came on at 155. But we still have officially from the National Hurricane Center 125-mile-an-hour storm all the way in towards Georgia. Here's how this plays out historically. Strongest by wind, making landfall in the U.S. It's the fourth strongest that we've ever seen. As far as pressure goes, the central pressure of the storm, 919 millibars, that puts it as the third most intense storm that we've ever had make landfall anywhere in the U.S. I will tell you this also. Hard to believe this did come very quickly. Just had a couple of days for it to grow. Water temperatures out here in the Gulf are around two to four degrees above average for this time of year, and that just gave it the fuel. Hard to predict that that was going to happen, though. Still seeing the winds here. I will tell you, a lot of the wind measurements here got blown out. So it's very difficult to get that verification right there. But they did test 155 miles an hour when that came onshore -- Jesse."

But Quam wanted more time, so he took the microphone out of Mahlberg's hand to give the question another try, and when he was finished, boom, he dropped the mic in front of her. This video has become a hit on YouTube, people laughing at the outright silliness that goes on in American political debate."
