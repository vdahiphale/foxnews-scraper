We are \"The Fox News Specialists.\" Hurry up and wait surgery for Senator John McCain, throwing a major curveball at senate Republicans efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare, Senator McCain procedure to remove -- delaying majority leader Mitch McConnell's timeline for a vote. But, President Trump isn't taking his foot off the pedal, the White House making clear this afternoon that he's charging ahead with efforts to get senate Republicans on board. Listen."

The president is going to be engaged, he's going to get this done. And then, you know, it's been said before, there's no one better than Mitch McConnell when it comes to knowing how and when to make a bill successful in the senate.

And he's a former New York State senator, he's a former New York State deputy secretary for public safety, and he's the current president of the Redlands Strategies, but he specializes in surfing, Michael Balboni is here. Now, as we know, Senator McCain is recovering from surgery in Arizona. At the end of last week, he gave a very blunt warning about what he sees ahead for congress."

      "utterance": "May not have time within the time they said that they're going to be there, but the reason they don't have a plan, as Senator McCain pointed out, is because the Democrats are slow walking, obstructing, and resisting. That's why they don't have a plan. I understand his passion and everybody is frustrated. But it all gets back to the Democrats intentionally, intentionally, wanting to slow walk and obstruct everything that they try to do."

Just take a look at this, guys. Producers, can you roll that poll? There's a pull out that shows that health care is overwhelmingly the number one issue on Americans' minds. Look at that. Health care, number one above unemployment and jobs, above terrorism, immigration, and climate change, Michael, Americans want this thing fixed."

      "speaker": "MICHAEL BALBONI, FORMER NEW YORK STATE SENATOR",

They need to get stuff going now, particularly tax cuts, so they can see the benefits the next time when they're running midterms. So we're all focused on the short-term, but they're focused on the next year, when they run midterms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "And Dagen, some of the things that they're talking about is attaching some of these agenda items to bills that the other side can't vote no for. In other words, funding the government, funding veterans affairs, and they're attaching some of these major initiatives to these bills. These are legislative -- I don't know, gymnastics that they're performing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "Well, and I've heard last week, Senator Scott said on Your World with Neil Cavuto that, oh, well, we're going to keep the tax increases in the health care plan, the ones I was mentioning for ObamaCare, investment income. We know how important it is to make credit -- not credit, but capital available to individuals for businesses to be started. But he said we'll deal with that in the tax reform bill. No, you won't, because -- where are you going to get $172 billion in revenue when they're already struggling to raise revenue. If you think -- if they think they can kick this can down the road even a few weeks, they're out of their minds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I completely agree with that. I think that it's been -- going back to your point about the midterm elections, right now we have the Republicans embarrassing themselves. It's what they've done with health care. It's an embarrassment. You can't put it any other way for them to run on this. If they tell you that, vote for us, because we're going to solve this and they don't and then they can't. And Eric, I agree with you, voting yes on this bill would be a mistake, because right now, this bill is a disaster. This would make it even worse. But how would anybody trust their products for the future?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "I think Rand Paul, such a hard time for so long about him digging in his heels on this. But what he saw that I couldn't see is that his colleagues aren't conservatives. They're not Republicans. That they were going to stand up for all this Medicaid funding, this gigantic growth in Medicaid, the largest insurer in the world now. It's bigger than the national health system in Britain. He knew early on they would end up doing that."

      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Just because I hate to say it, but I'm starting to agree with Rand Paul. And the mess -- I know, I hate to say it. The mess that they have now is nothing like the train wreck if they eek this out and send it back to the house because the freedom caucus has already said were not going to approve."
    },

      "speaker": "BOLLING",

      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

Are you OK with holding your nose and agreeing to this massive investment tax? And he said, yeah, I can do that. And I'm thinking, Herman, what goes on? You get to D.C. and all of a sudden all your principles and values go out the window?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Twenty nine others aren't going to do that. I'm just telling you. I've talked to some of them, 29 others of the 30 freedom caucus they're not going to do that. So that's going to be another train wreck."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "These moderate Republicans in the senate, they've got everything that they wanted. They've gotten $172 billion for greater -- for Medicaid, for example. They're getting 40 times the amount of money for opioid and heroin abuse treatment that Obama promised. And that's not enough. And they're still not going to vote for it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALBONI",
      "utterance": "But Congressman Brat did have a good point. He said that the problem with the current bill structure it doesn't go to the underlying regulations. That you have to do is you have to address those regulations or you maintain the core of ObamaCare. And that is what's driving a lot of the insurers out of the markets. And that's really a huge problem not just for hospitals, for long-term care as well. What we're having."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "So Michael, so the insurers will stay, let's say they do push this thing through. The insurers will stay and health care costs and premiums are still going to go up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALBONI",
      "utterance": "So Eric, you're absolutely right. We have done nothing in this debate to address health care costs. We're only shifting who's paying and how they're paying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Wasn't that the initial problem with ObamaCare. They promised to bend the cost curve down and they didn't. The $2,500 per family that was going to go down, it actually went up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "And the bad part is the taxpayer is picking up all of these subsidies that they want to leave in there, and that's where it's going to be a train wreck when it comes back to the house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "And the taxpayer is going to have to pay for insurance companies, to give my money to insurance companies. I don't know if you guys heard, but they're doing just fine on their own."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "It's gone beyond just a debate between, oh, it's health care right, health care privilege. It seems that most people, even if they call themselves conservatives, think that it's a right. And they also apparently think that insurance companies have a right to my money. I feel like -- I look at this happening and it's just bizarre land to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "ObamaCare was wildly unpopular once it became -- from one from bill to law and people realize exactly what was in it. And the problem is Republicans who feel to me like they're doing the exact same thing. Let's pivot a little bit to some of the other things that went on Capitol Hill today. Watch outside the White House, I love this. This is a moment for Donald Trump. He was walking around on the White House grounds -- this is made in America, part of his America first agenda, honoring American corporations and products made in America. There he is, donning his steps. Now Herman, I think this is a real pro-Trump moment right here. This one of the things he ran on, America-first, bring jobs back to America. Buy American products."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And I think it's a great move to try and help set the narrative. And if the media -- some of them aren't going to focus on this, we know that, but a lot of them are going to focus on it. And here's the other beauty of this particular move, a lot of people aren't aware of all of the products that are already made in America that are going to benefit from the rollback of all the regulations that this administration has already done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Dagen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "I think that this is a classic moment, but it does speak to what Herman has done with his whole career is focusing on, really, business owners in this country, rolling back their taxes and rolling back the regulations. Congress alone more than a dozen times used the congressional review act in the first six months this year to rollback major, major regulations. Things are happening. But you focus on that tax reform, and there are reports today out that the White House is on top of it. They're putting together a plan in a way that they haven't worked on health care, that's going to be critical because they need to do something for small business owners. And that means, tax notes, the same rate those big corporation gets."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Big initiative, dropping taxes for everyone, American and corporation -- American and corporation as well. Good policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And President Trump has done a good job on rolling back regulations. That's been something I really, really like to see. But you do see how he gets attacked no matter what, right? Because you have seen some of the questions -- well, Ivanka, not all of her stuff is made in America, and that's the other thing. So they kind do look at these stories and say, how can we make this look bad for him. But I think this is good, it keeps the narrative, like you were saying, on what he likes to talk about, and on what he succeeds, and inspiring people when he talk about, which is this America first, jobs in America type of thing. That's how he got elected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALBONI",
      "utterance": "Well we saw in -- the fact that the American businesses pay the more taxes. We're such a disadvantage. We don't talk enough about that. So he can do a lot to try to bring down that tax rate and give us that kind of advantage. And yet, we never really focus on that. But did you see how comfortable Donald Trump was in that press conference?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I thought you were going to say in that hat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Can we let our audience know that Mr. Herman Cain -- take that camera right there. That's the man who -- you are really recognize the first time you stood up to President Obama and talked about his taxes and ObamaCare, isn't that right? And you said, do more of the things that Trump is proposing now and do less of the things that he did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "Exactly. President Obama did all of the wrong things, in all honesty. And I've told people, and I mean this, everything that this president has done so far with his administration is what Herman Cain would have been doing if he had been president. How much stronger can you say, I agree with what's he's doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "All right. We'll leave it right there. Straight ahead, Democrats are praying for the Trump, Jr., Russia controversy to turn up waves of voters against President Trump, but new polling shows they'll have to pray a lot harder, coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "As Democrats bang the collusion drama over Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer, it may not be having the impact on voters that they expected. According to a new Washington Post-ABC News polls, roughly 4 in 10 Americans think the Trump campaign weren't put the Russians to try to influence the campaign. However, that number has barely changed since the last poll that taken back in April, long before the Trump Jr.- Russia revelations. Today, President Trump sounded off again about the controversy, tweeting, quote, most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don Jr. attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics. I don't know about that last part, especially because the same poll that we just talked about also said that people responded by a two to one margin that they did think the meeting was inappropriate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Inappropriate, yes, but not illegal. And again, so -- you keep hearing more and more constitutional scholars over the weekend saying, look, maybe he should, maybe he shouldn't have done it. That's not the issue, but whether or not was legal. They cannot find one single person -- who said it was illegal. And again, I think they're hanging -- the people who think something bad happened are hanging their hat on exchanging something of value. And they're saying that this information, this opposition research is something of value, but I think the technicality of the law says that, you know, it has to be a physical thing, a monetary value, not just information. Information is valuable no matter what, but there's no way to monetize that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right. Dagen, were you surprised to see that it didn't change anyone's mind. I wasn't really surprise to see that it didn't change anyone's mind. People seem pretty strong and steadfast whatever their opinion of this is by this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDOWELL",
      "utterance": "I think that people have stopped listening to the rhetoric about it. It's part of what's happening. And I do think that if the Democrats keep hammering this, and hammering this, and thinking somehow they're going to win the midterm elections, based on chatter about the Trump administration and the campaign and Russia that they're delusional if they think that that's going to work because people increasingly are becoming deaf to it. They care about their livelihood. They care about their families, not Russia."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "That is true. I can use it in Georgia. Here's the principle here about this nothing burger. The Democrats are demonstrated over and over and over, if they throw enough mud on the wall, often or not enough, long enough to see what sticks, they're hoping they're going to try some of the people. But like Dagen says, and like Kat said, I don't think it's."
    },

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I don't think it's a nothing burger just to be clear. I think it's a, I don't know burger. I think I'm going to wait and see. The fact that there's been so much changing of the story from day-to-day always makes me listen a little more closely. But I completely agree with Dagen, and I completely agree with you as well, about how -- if you do say every single thing is a smoking gun, people are going to stop listening."

So maybe Donald Jr. -- nobody said that and said to him, you know what, don't even talk about this issue, don't go there. Maybe they just really didn't know what was up on this thing. It doesn't excuse, possibly, a prosecutor looking at this. But right now, again, it's that expectation that's something is wrong here."
