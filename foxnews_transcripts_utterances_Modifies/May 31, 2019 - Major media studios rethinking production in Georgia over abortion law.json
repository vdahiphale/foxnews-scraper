It was just after 4:00 p.m. Eastern as the workday was wrapping up and the shooter entered the building and began firing indiscriminately on multiple floors. We were told that the news conference just a short time ago of a harrowing moment when for police officers entered the municipal building and engaged with the suspect for what was described as a prolonged period of time a fierce gun battle.  And then at the end of the gun battle when they had taken down the suspect, and this almost brought the Police Chief to tears during that news conference, the same officers, the suspect had tried to kill then tried to save the life of the suspect before taking them out of the building when they shortly expired.   We learned more about the weapon that was used in the shooting, Laura. It was described at the news conference as a .45 caliber handgun with extended magazines. They are working with the ATF and the FBI to process the crime scene, to notify the victims' families and then to also track down some weapons purchases associated with the suspect. We don't know from the news conference whether these were legal purchases or not, so it's still developing. But really a sorrowful news conference. Perhaps one of the most sorrowful news conferences I have ever witnessed - seen the Police Chief almost in tears describing how his men took down the suspect and then tried to say that suspect - the same person who had been trying to murder them as.",

And now I'm convinced that they will not listen to allegations of crimes by Democrats. I mean, I guess, we should have known that when we saw how they reacted to Hillary destroying the - getting rid of 30,000 e-mails, destroying servers, destroying the phones and dealing with classified information in a Cavalier totally negligent, and I would say criminal manner. They just brushed that off as if it was nothing.  And now they're doing the same thing with this. I mean, these are very, very serious crimes if they're true. If there is a falsified FISA affidavit, which now it's certain, it was falsified. Question is was it knowing or negligent, almost like we got with Hillary, right, knowing or negligent.

And I think this the first time we have seen the American president -- and by the way, the Democrats in Congress are forcing him into this position because they refuse to do the common sense things, which are fund the border patrol and build the wall and allow us to contain things. So the president has said, look, if you're not going to help me, then I can use my authority to put so much pressure on Mexico.

We were told that the news conference just a short time ago of a harrowing moment when for police officers entered the municipal building and engaged with the suspect for what was described as a prolonged period of time a fierce gun battle. And then at the end of the gun battle when they had taken down the suspect, and this almost brought the Police Chief to tears during that news conference, the same officers, the suspect had tried to kill then tried to save the life of the suspect before taking them out of the building when they shortly expired. We learned more about the weapon that was used in the shooting, Laura. It was described at the news conference as a .45 caliber handgun with extended magazines. They are working with the ATF and the FBI to process the crime scene, to notify the victims' families and then to also track down some weapons purchases associated with the suspect. We don't know from the news conference whether these were legal purchases or not, so it's still developing. But really a sorrowful news conference.

Now joining me now to break all this down and a whole lot more Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney for President Trump. Rudy thanks for spending some time with us tonight. If the left cannot agree now that investigating the origins of this probe, that was so extensive, cost so much money and occupied so much time and man-hours over the last couple of years, then what's really the point anymore of arguing these points with them at all?"

I would say a year - a little over a year ago when I got involved representing the President, I still had something left of the idea that, when it really comes down to it - if it's really serious, even the left-wing press is going to take very serious allegations of crimes that would be very harmful to our country seriously. And now I'm convinced that they will not listen to allegations of crimes by Democrats. I mean, I guess, we should have known that when we saw how they reacted to Hillary destroying the - getting rid of 30,000 e-mails, destroying servers, destroying the phones and dealing with classified information in a Cavalier totally negligent, and I would say criminal manner. They just brushed that off as if it was nothing. And now they're doing the same thing with this. I mean, these are very, very serious crimes if they're true. If there is a falsified FISA affidavit, which now it's certain, it was falsified. Question is was it knowing or negligent, almost like we got with Hillary, right, knowing or negligent. Then we have serious consequences, if Comey was knowingly signing that verified affidavit, knowing that Steele was not reliable, knowing that there were things he could have verified, but he didn't, then he's guilty of making a false statement under oath."

Rudy not to speak of knowing who paid for the dossier, just the fact that the opposition candidate to the President paid for it, at least calls the motivations into question, if not the credibility of the underlying salacious allegation.

People forget that months and months of Strzok and Page text were deleted and removed by the Mueller organization - astounding actually and the press doesn't mention that either. But even with the ones that we have, it's quite clear that Peter Strzok had a plan to stop Donald Trump from being President and an insurance policy to remove him should he get elected. The plan was the whole Strzok dossier, the affidavit, the FISA, setting up Papadopoulos. I mean, that's pretty darn clear now. The question is how much of that did Comey know--"

There's been no finding in all these months of any kind of Russian anything with the Trump campaign and it turns out to be disproven by two big long investigations.

You had them during Trump and a whole bunch of other factors. But nevertheless I think they're going to do that. If you vote for him, if you support him, you're a bad person. If you support candidate X, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris or whatever it is, then you're a good person. I really think that's what they're going to partly sell. But the other issue that you polled, which was fascinating, is the most important issues question, and this is wild. OK. Ready, most important issues facing the country? Immigration 37 percent; health care, big issue; 36%, right behind, terrorism; 25, environment; climate change, 18; guns, 16 percent, even with the news tonight; taxes 13 percent; women's rights 12 percent, I don't think that Georgia case is going to matter as much as Hollywood thinks.

But the big, change 58 percent now support his declaration of a national emergency. When he first declared it, a majority of voters opposed it.

Guess what, there is no reservation available until after June, and you get a four-hour time limit. Do you know what happens after four hours to you and your family? Storm Troopers come and remove you from the Star Wars area. So let me get this straight. You have to abide by the arbitrary rules of Disney in the Star Wars park, but they will not abide by the duly elected legislature in Georgia who is giving them 30 percent of their own budget.

But now the president, we haven't proven him innocent yet. Just think about that paragraph and Mueller said. And now you have the Democrats who are saying, all right, maybe we can't impeach him, but we all know he is a criminal. How do they know that? I think you have to start out where the fascist left is, free speech means you are not allowed to speak. They whole model of the way they deal with things, if you say anything wrong, you are either homophobic, Islamophobic, something. And so their normal behavior is to just make stuff up. There is no evidence that the president has been guilty of anything, and you had two years, Mueller had 15 leftwing Democratic lawyers, all of them, by the way, very good prosecutors. He had I think $30 million. He locked up at least two people in solitary confinement for lengths of time that, frankly, are un-American, and he couldn't find anything. At that point the Democrats ought to go and talk about policy and recognize that this is really a dry hole. They're not going to get anything good out of this."

Because we're going to get to this later, or we talked about this, the issue with the polls, President Trump's polls are going up in key metrics, key ways. I just get the sense that people are on to this whole game now. They're on to the fact that the Democrats aren't interested in debate. They are interested in demonizing. That's what they do."

They did everything they could to destroy Trump. He is still president. He's improving in his poll numbers. The economy is growing. And on most major issues, the country is much closer to Trump than it is to radical Democrats. So I think it's a very different environment than Democrats thought they'd be in. And I predict you're going to see a Republican Senate passing positive legislation, and Pelosi is over here with a divided House Democrat Party part of which wants to spend all day, every day attacking Donald Trump, and part of which, frankly, out of survival, wants to pass something. And I wouldn't be at all surprised to see Kevin McCarthy begin to form an alliance with 30 or 40 Democrats whose own reelection is at stake if they stay negative."

And so many of them pledged to work with Trump, and then push comes to shove, they're not working with Trump. So I think that's an excellent point. And Newt, part of this new substantive issue that Trump is tackling is the border, which you and I have been talking about it for years. And the situation is untenable. It's beyond crisis. At almost every measure it's beyond crisis. What about the decision to slap the five percent tariffs on Mexico effective June 10th unless Mexico does more to stem this massive tide of humanity coming up from mostly the Northern Triangle countries?"

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "One of the thing that is going to be part of Trump's legacy that historians are going to write about is that he just has common sense, and he follows projects through like just exactly like the kind of businessman that he was. So none of these people would be on the American border if they weren't coming through Mexico. We don't stop people who come by boat or by airplane. And so without Mexican compliance, all of these people would still be down in Central America. And I think this the first time we have seen the American president -- and by the way, the Democrats in Congress are forcing him into this position because they refuse to do the common sense things, which are fund the border patrol and build the wall and allow us to contain things. So the president has said, look, if you're not going to help me, then I can use my authority to put so much pressure on Mexico. And candidly, if he then moves to cut off sending money to Mexico, which he could do, you would then see an enormous crisis in the Mexican economy."

He's apparently fine with China winning on every front, or at least it seems that way. But a lot of these farmers are being hurt by the soybean tariffs. China can't -- China is not buying them. It's hurting them. How many pain is really being inflicted on the American consumer? And how long can this administration hold out? I completely agree with what they are doing on tariffs, but I am hearing from all these Wall Street people who do a lot of work in China, for instance, this is really hurting us. Yes, because you are doing all these deals with communist China. Maybe we should stop doing deals with them."

    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "There are a number of billionaires who love China because that's how they got to be billionaires. I would simply hope that the president will presently say let's take as much of the Chinese tariff money as we need to and we will divert it to the American farmers so we use the Chinese tariff payments in order to take care of the farmers who the Chinese are trying to rip off. And I think if he did that, and did it on a large enough scale, that they would become a non-issue. The truth is in the long run China cannot win a trade war with the United States. It's simply not possible. There are too many other countries we can go to to buy things. The Chinese are going to build a whole series of competitors in Asia in places like Thailand and Vietnam and the Philippines, and they are just going to look market share, and at the same time we're going to find out that we don't need them."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "But if the president is right and the number of billions of dollars he is talking about, he could afford to double the income of every soybean in the United States just taking money out of the Chinese tariff and send a little note saying you might want to send a note to Xi Jinping thanking him for the amount of money he is now sending you."

Of course, you're always going to be elevated for saying stuff the in-crowd likes. And last but not least, in our worst category from the week, Hillary Clinton.
