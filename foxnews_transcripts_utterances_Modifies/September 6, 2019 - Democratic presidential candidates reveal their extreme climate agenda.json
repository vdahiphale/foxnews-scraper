It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" The gun control debate set to take over Washington, President Trump and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin meeting this week to bridge the party's divide. But it looks like both sides are ready to dig in for a protractive fight. Trump reportedly saying he's willing to get something done with Democrats, but he's also insisting that he'll defend second amendment rights.  This all comes as the Justice Department has sent a gun legislation proposal, a package of ideas to the White House for consideration. The details of the plan unclear for the moment. For Democrats, well, 2020 candidates are taking a much different approach when it comes to gun control.",

I just want that something to be constitutional, and actually stem the tide of mass shootings, and that's pretty much it. But there's a sweet spot there, where you cannot infringe on people second amendment rights, and stop these mass killings. What we're hearing from the left are two things. One, the assault weapons ban. Now, there's no such thing as an assault weapon. That's a fake phrase. All it is, is a regular rifle with stylize military features. But it still acts as a regular semiautomatic, you aim, you squeeze, and one round goes through. I don't understand, even if you did ban that, which you can't, how that would stop people from mass shootings? It doesn't. The other thing is the buyback and the mandatory confiscation. The mandatory confiscation is illegal. That would cause a mass insurrection in this country, and the buyback, if it's voluntary, I don't have a problem with it. If people want to sell their guns to the feds, that's fine with me. It seems like a waste of money, but if they want to do that, that's fine.  What I believe is what we need to do is -- and Dave Chappelle talked about this on his special the other day. If your son goes on a mass shooting, and then you get out there and the cameras the next day and you say, I had no idea. Johnny was such a great kid. I have no idea. But the kid is going to school looking like a vampire, he's locking his door every night on crazy websites, you don't even go in to explore his bedroom. You go and there's an arsenal. And how do you not know? And then the school, secondarily, if this kid is disruptive, if he's violent and you're just slapping him on the wrist, if the counselors aren't getting involved, and you're not sharing information with the other state agencies, then you guys are at fault. So you have to stem this thing at the core, and then not just throw away the constitution in order to achieve a political agenda.",

And so, he's kind of recognizing the procedure that's in place. I -- every single one of those deaths was absolutely tragic. But the issue that I have with all of these proposals coming from the left is the fact that they are all ineffective and reactionary. And they are treating the symptom, not the problem. We have an epidemic of people, and especially young people that are killing themselves and killing others because of mental health issues and to garner social media accolades. And this kind of off-kilter national conversation and totally skewed proposal for confiscation and registries that just fosters and feeds it. And in terms of the buyback and what is essentially is the confiscation, for that to actually work, which in no way would it, and even de Blasio admits, well, the vast majority would be taken back. But all it takes is one person to have it not work for, and then that creates -- has the potential for creating deaths.  But the issue is, when you get into the specifics, they are so many loopholes. There are 20 million in estimated, semiautomatic large capacity rifles in the country and half a million are produced each year, and only a portion of those guns are serialized. So how do you regulate or account for the rest of it? How do you handle the person-to-person universal background checks? Would we then include family members like Sandy Hook?   There are so many questions that this entire thing begs, that for me all it does is skirt the real issue which is the mental health and sickness of this society. It's the symptoms only, and it's because our government is too lazy to address, and the legislators are too lazy to address identifying those bad actors before it happens, and instead they're infringing on our constitutional rights.",

But what Senator Graham wants to do is to simply give a grant to the state that wants to put these laws in place. They've only been around, the first one was implemented in the state of Connecticut, still had the Sandy Hook shooting after it in 1999.  So there's not a lot of research on how they're implemented, and if people's rights, not only to own a gun, but privacy rights are honored in them. Nevertheless, that's one way to give law enforcement and even family members the ability to get a gun. There's 17 states with them now in D.C. Get a gun out of a hand of somebody who is a threat to them.  But to Emily's point, the mental -- they like to basically point the finger, the left does at the NRA. The NRA represents a small slice of the 55 million-plus gun owners in this country. Law-abiding citizens. Let's point the finger at the mental health lobby, because, again, mental health spending has gone up in this country, what, 60 percent in the last decade, has that helped? It's a right. It's a guaranteed right under Obamacare. Has that helped? Mental health counselling. And if you look at the number -- there was a secret service report that came out in July of this year, 27 attacks, 91 deaths, 107 injuries on mass attacks, 67 percent, more than two-thirds of those suspects displayed signs of mental illness or emotional disturbance, and 93 percent of the incidents of people showed a history of troubling communication.

But it looks like both sides are ready to dig in for a protractive fight. Trump reportedly saying he's willing to get something done with Democrats, but he's also insisting that he'll defend second amendment rights. This all comes as the Justice Department has sent a gun legislation proposal, a package of ideas to the White House for consideration. The details of the plan unclear for the moment.

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, a lot of people want to do something, right? But they don't know what that is. I mean, I want to do something. I just want that something to be constitutional, and actually stem the tide of mass shootings, and that's pretty much it. But there's a sweet spot there, where you cannot infringe on people second amendment rights, and stop these mass killings. What we're hearing from the left are two things. One, the assault weapons ban. Now, there's no such thing as an assault weapon. That's a fake phrase. All it is, is a regular rifle with stylize military features. But it still acts as a regular semiautomatic, you aim, you squeeze, and one round goes through. I don't understand, even if you did ban that, which you can't, how that would stop people from mass shootings? It doesn't. The other thing is the buyback and the mandatory confiscation. The mandatory confiscation is illegal. That would cause a mass insurrection in this country, and the buyback, if it's voluntary, I don't have a problem with it. If people want to sell their guns to the feds, that's fine with me. It seems like a waste of money, but if they want to do that, that's fine. What I believe is what we need to do is -- and Dave Chappelle talked about this on his special the other day. If your son goes on a mass shooting, and then you get out there and the cameras the next day and you say, I had no idea. Johnny was such a great kid. I have no idea. But the kid is going to school looking like a vampire, he's locking his door every night on crazy websites, you don't even go in to explore his bedroom. You go and there's an arsenal. And how do you not know? And then the school, secondarily, if this kid is disruptive, if he's violent and you're just slapping him on the wrist, if the counselors aren't getting involved, and you're not sharing information with the other state agencies, then you guys are at fault. So you have to stem this thing at the core, and then not just throw away the constitution in order to achieve a political agenda."

But in the month of August, 38 Americans slain in mass shootings, Dayton, El Paso, West Texas. There's a sense that something needs to be done, but Senator McConnell, the senate majority leader says I'm not doing anything until I hear from President Trump, and President Trump, so far, not doing anything. What would you do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think for Senator McConnell that was -- that's strategic in nature that he's trying to get something accomplished. And so, he's kind of recognizing the procedure that's in place. I -- every single one of those deaths was absolutely tragic. But the issue that I have with all of these proposals coming from the left is the fact that they are all ineffective and reactionary. And they are treating the symptom, not the problem. We have an epidemic of people, and especially young people that are killing themselves and killing others because of mental health issues and to garner social media accolades. And this kind of off-kilter national conversation and totally skewed proposal for confiscation and registries that just fosters and feeds it. And in terms of the buyback and what is essentially is the confiscation, for that to actually work, which in no way would it, and even de Blasio admits, well, the vast majority would be taken back. But all it takes is one person to have it not work for, and then that creates -- has the potential for creating deaths. But the issue is, when you get into the specifics, they are so many loopholes. There are 20 million in estimated, semiautomatic large capacity rifles in the country and half a million are produced each year, and only a portion of those guns are serialized. So how do you regulate or account for the rest of it? How do you handle the person-to-person universal background checks? Would we then include family members like Sandy Hook? There are so many questions that this entire thing begs, that for me all it does is skirt the real issue which is the mental health and sickness of this society. It's the symptoms only, and it's because our government is too lazy to address, and the legislators are too lazy to address identifying those bad actors before it happens, and instead they're infringing on our constitutional rights."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

And I've got to tell you, I'm very skeptical about this, because I think there are lots of people with mental health issues who are not mass shooters, and certainly other countries have people with mental health issues and they don't have the kind of mass slaying that we see in this country. But that is coming in large part now as President Trump and others saying, oh, it's a mental health issue. How do you react?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAGEN MCDOWELL, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think one thing that could move forward are -- at least the Senator Lindsey Graham proposal, which I think he's teamed up with Blumenthal on -- in terms of red flag laws in this country, and there's a lot of concern about due process with them. But what Senator Graham wants to do is to simply give a grant to the state that wants to put these laws in place. They've only been around, the first one was implemented in the state of Connecticut, still had the Sandy Hook shooting after it in 1999. So there's not a lot of research on how they're implemented, and if people's rights, not only to own a gun, but privacy rights are honored in them. Nevertheless, that's one way to give law enforcement and even family members the ability to get a gun. There's 17 states with them now in D.C. Get a gun out of a hand of somebody who is a threat to them. But to Emily's point, the mental -- they like to basically point the finger, the left does at the NRA. The NRA represents a small slice of the 55 million-plus gun owners in this country. Law-abiding citizens. Let's point the finger at the mental health lobby, because, again, mental health spending has gone up in this country, what, 60 percent in the last decade, has that helped? It's a right. It's a guaranteed right under Obamacare. Has that helped? Mental health counselling. And if you look at the number -- there was a secret service report that came out in July of this year, 27 attacks, 91 deaths, 107 injuries on mass attacks, 67 percent, more than two-thirds of those suspects displayed signs of mental illness or emotional disturbance, and 93 percent of the incidents of people showed a history of troubling communication. And you know what? We haven't done anything about it because the left is afraid of the mental health lobby."

In terms of the actual X's and O's in terms of the politics of it, here's what Trump is looking at, 29 separate proposals. Here's what he's willing to do, death penalty immediately for a fast track for the mass shooter, release the records of troubled teens and bring them into the adult age so they will not going to pass a background check like what happened in Dayton."

What they are trying to do, what I'm encouraged by is the president is talking to Manchin and Murphy, Senator Murphy of Connecticut, what I'm encouraged by to me is talking to the president who's talking to Lindsey Graham. I hope that they will not go into their separate corners like they usually do and just start yelling at each other. They get a few things passed that they think they're addressing this. The other think I like this do, see a table like this, maybe a little bigger with psychological experts and forensic experts to look at the last 25 shootings. Sadly, you only have to go back three years, and say what happened? What are the commonalities? Have the politicians in the back row. What are the commonalities? This is our report. But unlike Simpson Bowles, I want something done out of this report. And then when it's done, get experts, not politicians, to decide how to keep the kids safe in school, the shoppers safe at Walmart, and others allowed to go to a bar without being shot at, or go to a movie without being executed."

    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Right. It doesn't sit well at all, certainly with the public, and definitely not with the victim's families. It goes back -- it goes back to the time, basically, in the shipping industry when they couldn't obtain insurance, except now the insurance company use it as a regular practice, they deploy immediately after catastrophes like this to essentially save their own hide and protect their interests, because they're the one (INAUDIBLE) the defenses and also, potentially, the payouts. But, obviously, optically, it's really terrible, and it's only been a few days. The owners of the death boat catastrophe, they used it. And, obviously, we've heard on the news, the Titanic and whatnot. But, yes, it's a very archaic lob. But I think what it does, if it's successful, is that it means that instead of filling state courts suits, the victims' families, it directs everything to federal court, and it limits the owners liability to hear what they're arguing, which is zero. And that's really difficult for these victims' families to hear that the cost of these lives is just zero. But it's not a fail-safe. So the owners would have to prove that their company is not to blame, and the victims' families are essentially proving the owners knew or should have known, which is a negligence standard for them to -- for them to prevail and for the petition not to work."

No negligence."

      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "So, that state law in California and essentially what prosecutors charge those two defendants with is that the negligence standard was such a hype -- it was so reckless, a reckless disregard for human life that it was criminal. So they were charging him with criminal negligence versus here what we're talking about just for this moment is civil negligence. And as you've said, one was acquitted, and the other -- it's a hard bar to cross."

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "The fact that the boat is worthless means that there will be no money to pay out if this holds up. But did they go ahead and brief the crew and give that speech of this -- what do you do in case of a fire. The night watchman is one other element of it. They also say in talking to the crew members, one reporter said at about 2:35, one crew member went to the bottom, they clean up in the area, and made sure the stove was cold. Somewhere between 2:35 and 3:15, there was a fire. And the guy went -- one of the crew member went down, they couldn't get past the second level, so all these people were basically being suffocated or burned alive on top. So that's how quick it happen. So as they put this together, if they find out all these things are there, it's hard for me to believe that these families wouldn't have a case."

These guys were tested for drugs and alcohol. It looks like they were sober. But in my opinion, they were cowards. From what we know, they didn't spend as much time as they should have staying with the ship and doing all they could to save one life. Not only was there poor planning from this, but there was poor execution after the fire went down.

The pets are consistent. They're always happy to see you. Always amazed when you come home. I can't believe you're there. We miss that.

About 100 people from Fox are going to participate, the company's matching all contributions from anyone to fight breast cancer and they're also paying for the runner's entrance fees.
