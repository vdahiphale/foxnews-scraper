This, in a new NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll released just hours before the president walked up to that podium and gave his State of the Union. Look at these numbers. They reveal most Americans are not nearly as optimistic as the president is. Why are Americans so sour on the direction that the country is headed in and is the president taking us down the wrong path?  Let's talk about it. Senator Rand Paul joins me.

Think of the post office. So we should minimize what government does. We should maximize the marketplace. That means having a significant tax cut.

This would be an enormous private stimulus. And it also would bring some tax revenue in that we could put into the highway fund, which is short. In essence, this is a great bipartisan bill.

We're doing well. He said we're stopping the advance of ISIL. I can't find any military voice who can confirm that.
