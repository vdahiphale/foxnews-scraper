Let's ask New York Republican congressman and member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Tom Reed.  Can they get it done because the Senate, your brethren in the Senate, fouled up Obamacare repeal and replace, so what about these tax cuts?  REP. TOM REED, R-N.Y., HOUSE WAYS & MEANS COMMITTEE: I absolutely do believe we're going to get to the finish line here by the end of the year and have this on the president's desk so people can enjoy a big tax cut and tax relief starting in 2018 immediately.",

That's mom-and-pop shops back home that we give that relief to.
