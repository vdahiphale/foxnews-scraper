      "sentences": "So, good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" Something has shifted in America. As Peggy Noonan writes today. Months of fear, sickness and economic earthquake simply just don't leave things where they started. Candidates running for office in this environment must meet the people where they are and give them hope for a brighter tomorrow. They must acknowledge the shift and lead the way forward from that spot. It is a deep calling and it is one that the country is waiting for. So, right now, according to the polls, Joe Biden is already anywhere from 6 to 11 points ahead in key battleground states, which is while - all while he is running essentially an almost invisible campaign at this point.  While once candidate Trump and now President Trump has found himself in tough spots, he has always bounced back from them. Today, The Wall Street Journal sends up a very sharp warning signal with this prescription. The one issue in which voters give him an edge over Mr. Biden is the economy. An agenda to revive the economy after the pandemic and restore the gains for workers of his first three years would appeal to millions.  Perhaps Mr. Trump lacks the self-awareness and discipline to make the case. He may be so thrown off by his falling polls that he simply can't do it. If that's true, he should understand that he's headed for a defeat that will reward all of those who schemed against him in 2016, writes the editorial board there.  So, how does the White House answer these questions? Kellyanne Conway joins us in a moment tonight. Also, this evening, Victor Davis Hanson on the big picture, meaning the battle over the Emancipation Memorial and Washington, D.C. Also, tonight, a Minneapolis neighborhood gets a firsthand preview of life without police. As a growing homeless encampment digs in for the long haul in a neighborhood that vowed, they would not call on the police to help them. And would it be better to play John Lennon's Imagine as the national anthem when teams get back to the field this summer? That's an idea that's on the table. We're going to talk about that tonight as well. But first, we go to our top story this evening and the importance of this moment for President Trump.  Joining me now is Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President. Kellyanne, thank you very much for being here.",

We have an economic crisis that the President is handling. And also, we have some social unrest, people calling for racial justice and the like. And so, this President is on top of all three in the following way. And Joe Biden is completely absent from the conversation, which is why his poll numbers are high. People are putting onto Joe Biden exactly what they want him to be, what they expect to be. They're going to be sorely disappointed once they see him and they hear him time and again, there will be debates, there will be conventions. There will be opportunities for people to question Joe Biden about what exactly he would do on all these crises rather than just attack Donald Trump. You can't say, raise my hand, I'm not Donald Trump. Joe Biden had 40 years to make some significant changes that would have put us in a better position to deal with all of this. And Donald Trump has done a better job in less than four years.   But let me focus on the crises. Just yesterday and today, President Trump and Vice President Pence were dealing with the economic. The job production. Just today, the President signed an EO and had a really strong event here at the White House talking about re-skilling. We want to make sure that this is an economy that works for all Americans. So, you don't have to have a postgraduate degree or a college degree to get a job. If you have a skill set and a high school degree or a community college, you can go to work and support yourself. He has said time and again as President that he honors all types of jobs, all types of work. Secondly, yesterday he was in Wisconsin overseeing a major Navy contract of billions of dollars. And the development, the first frigate in a while and maybe nine to be developed. That's the manufacturing basically he's brought back, and the Vice President today did the task, the Coronavirus Task Force. He did a full briefing.",

But it doesn't change what we're seeing in the polls, which is a disconnect. And this is something that people are talking about a lot in the country.   And in many cases, I've had people say to me, why doesn't the President do, you know, an Oval Office address where we can sort of see his heart on these issues when it comes to racial injustice, when it comes to the fear that people have that the Coronavirus is coming back, that it is emerging in places that people hoped it would not emerge at this point. They want a connection with the President that in many ways they feel they're not getting. And we're seeing it in a lot of this polling that we're seeing. So, regardless of the fact that you can list things that you feel make the case, the connection with what people are seeing and understanding appears to be slipping.",

And let's be fair, these polls are precisely where I think they would be right now in that when you look at The New York Times, state race polls, they're both within a few points of each other and they're both under 50 percent by and large. Now, if you look at a state like Wisconsin, which Donald Trump won as the first Republican to win it since 1984, last time Hillary all but ignored it. The methodology The New York Times used this time was fundamentally different. The Republican versus Democratic self-identification was one- point different last time. Now, it was plus seven Democratic.  That's important, Martha, because if you're a Democrat, you're going to be over 85, 90 percent for Joe Biden. Same thing with Republicans. So, if your sample is seven points shy of what it was last time, that's going to affect the polls. But Joe Biden is not above 50 percent for a very significant reason. He hasn't made a compelling case.",

He's the most transparent, available president. And I think when people look at the property (ph) and hear his vision for the future, he should go out. I think he should hold peace talks at Camp David. Why not? Domestic peace talks. I'm all for the President addressing this, but he has again and again, he addressed George Floyd's murder for the first time down at NASA, it got very little coverage.

I think Biden should be at 70 percent because you can make him whatever you wanted to be. He showed up in Philly yesterday, which basically is his home area. It's where his campaign is nationally headquartered. And you would have thought it was a Trump appearance because there were more Trump signs than there were Biden signs.

Abolish Electoral College is a cultural revolution. And people, a minority, I think are not happy with the idea of freedom and liberty of the individual and protection of private property under the Constitution, they seem more of a French revolutionary idea of enforced equality of result. And that's what the stakes are.  They've hijacked the killing of George Floyd and they've created a national crisis. And this election is going to be decided by that proverbial swing voter. And they're going to do one of two things, either they're going to say, I'm tired of this. There's a red line. You're not going to touch Mount Rushmore. You're not going to touch the Washington moment. I'm not going to change the national anthem et cetera, et cetera. And they're going to look for Donald Trump to be that emblem of their resistance, their pushback, or they're going to think he can't do it and they're going to go into a collective fetal position and say make it all go away. And maybe Biden, at least they won't be mad at Biden and the law go away. I don't think that will happen if Biden were to be elected. But that puts a great onus on Donald Trump to be very quiet and calm and carry a club rather than to be loud and carry a twig. And he's got a lot of constraints because under our federal system, as you just heard, the local law enforcement, the state law enforcement, the attorney generals of the states, they're the ones responsible. And they're either contextualizing the violence, appeasing it, or, in fact, in some cases supporting it because they see it has political dividends for their agendas in November. So, Trump can't force them to enforce a law unless he calls in federal troops. But he's got a military, 12 retired admirals and generals that have come out and really said some things that we've never heard about from generals, retired or not, about the Commander- in-Chief. We've had former joint chiefs. We've had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs himself.   So, it's made it problematic. And I think Bill Barr is on the right track to show that he's trying to restore the sense of our American customs and traditions. He's going to get a federal task force. He's got to get indictments. He's got to tell the states there are federal jurisdictions within your states. If you're going to lock down all of California, maybe you shouldn't lock down Yosemite. It's an open-air national park. It's under federal jurisdiction. Maybe I can do something there. Maybe he's going to say to certain local officials. You violated the federal civil rights of people within your jurisdiction. And that's a federal offense and that's a racketeering. And so he's got to show the nation that despite these constraints and this weaponization of this crisis, that he's going to be very calm and quiet, but he's going to carry a huge club and restore the country and the customs and traditions.",

He's not going to allow any federal statute within his jurisdiction to topple. And he's going to go after the people. People want to see people punished. They know that if they go on to a federal monument and deface it, they're going to go to jail. They're going to be charged with a felony. They know if they decide tomorrow to go into Detroit or Baltimore and take over six city blocks, their career is ruined. And they don't like the exemption given to people for political reasons. And Donald Trump's got to restore that faith and the ability of the U.S. government to keep the order and peace, even if it means in a very dangerous situation, contravening local and state authorities that have given up their oath of office de facto.",

What Francis Scott Key wrote was also part of a promise of America and the rest of those verses, which I have read, which many Americans need to now read reflect a time and circumstance but also a chance for freedom. When you look at what they want to replace it with, it's simply a song that sounds good and feels good rather than a song that reflects who we are as a country and what we battle for. The battle for freedom is and always fought at every time about every issue. We fought to free ourselves from the British. We had a Declaration of Independence and a promise of a nation of free people. And we, as one people evolved to where we were today, we overcame colonial slavery, we overcame segregation.

      "utterance": "So, good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" Something has shifted in America. As Peggy Noonan writes today. Months of fear, sickness and economic earthquake simply just don't leave things where they started. Candidates running for office in this environment must meet the people where they are and give them hope for a brighter tomorrow. They must acknowledge the shift and lead the way forward from that spot. It is a deep calling and it is one that the country is waiting for. So, right now, according to the polls, Joe Biden is already anywhere from 6 to 11 points ahead in key battleground states, which is while - all while he is running essentially an almost invisible campaign at this point. While once candidate Trump and now President Trump has found himself in tough spots, he has always bounced back from them. Today, The Wall Street Journal sends up a very sharp warning signal with this prescription. The one issue in which voters give him an edge over Mr. Biden is the economy. An agenda to revive the economy after the pandemic and restore the gains for workers of his first three years would appeal to millions. Perhaps Mr. Trump lacks the self-awareness and discipline to make the case. He may be so thrown off by his falling polls that he simply can't do it. If that's true, he should understand that he's headed for a defeat that will reward all of those who schemed against him in 2016, writes the editorial board there. So, how does the White House answer these questions? Kellyanne Conway joins us in a moment tonight. Also, this evening, Victor Davis Hanson on the big picture, meaning the battle over the Emancipation Memorial and Washington, D.C. Also, tonight, a Minneapolis neighborhood gets a firsthand preview of life without police. As a growing homeless encampment digs in for the long haul in a neighborhood that vowed, they would not call on the police to help them. And would it be better to play John Lennon's Imagine as the national anthem when teams get back to the field this summer? That's an idea that's on the table. We're going to talk about that tonight as well. But first, we go to our top story this evening and the importance of this moment for President Trump. Joining me now is Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President. Kellyanne, thank you very much for being here."

      "utterance": "Thank you. So, you hear those editorials, a lot of that sentiment out there today that says that the President sort of needs to shift, needs to understand that the moment has changed. And to meet people where they are in the country right now. What do you say to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "What I would say is that the three things are happening right now. We had a global pandemic that still is with us, Coronavirus cases. We have an economic crisis that the President is handling. And also, we have some social unrest, people calling for racial justice and the like. And so, this President is on top of all three in the following way. And Joe Biden is completely absent from the conversation, which is why his poll numbers are high. People are putting onto Joe Biden exactly what they want him to be, what they expect to be. They're going to be sorely disappointed once they see him and they hear him time and again, there will be debates, there will be conventions. There will be opportunities for people to question Joe Biden about what exactly he would do on all these crises rather than just attack Donald Trump. You can't say, raise my hand, I'm not Donald Trump. Joe Biden had 40 years to make some significant changes that would have put us in a better position to deal with all of this. And Donald Trump has done a better job in less than four years. But let me focus on the crises. Just yesterday and today, President Trump and Vice President Pence were dealing with the economic. The job production. Just today, the President signed an EO and had a really strong event here at the White House talking about re-skilling. We want to make sure that this is an economy that works for all Americans. So, you don't have to have a postgraduate degree or a college degree to get a job. If you have a skill set and a high school degree or a community college, you can go to work and support yourself. He has said time and again as President that he honors all types of jobs, all types of work. Secondly, yesterday he was in Wisconsin overseeing a major Navy contract of billions of dollars. And the development, the first frigate in a while and maybe nine to be developed. That's the manufacturing basically he's brought back, and the Vice President today did the task, the Coronavirus Task Force. He did a full briefing."

But it doesn't change what we're seeing in the polls, which is a disconnect. And this is something that people are talking about a lot in the country. And in many cases, I've had people say to me, why doesn't the President do, you know, an Oval Office address where we can sort of see his heart on these issues when it comes to racial injustice, when it comes to the fear that people have that the Coronavirus is coming back, that it is emerging in places that people hoped it would not emerge at this point. They want a connection with the President that in many ways they feel they're not getting. And we're seeing it in a lot of this polling that we're seeing. So, regardless of the fact that you can list things that you feel make the case, the connection with what people are seeing and understanding appears to be slipping."

      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, the polls are about a horse race numbers. And let's be fair, these polls are precisely where I think they would be right now in that when you look at The New York Times, state race polls, they're both within a few points of each other and they're both under 50 percent by and large. Now, if you look at a state like Wisconsin, which Donald Trump won as the first Republican to win it since 1984, last time Hillary all but ignored it. The methodology The New York Times used this time was fundamentally different. The Republican versus Democratic self-identification was one- point different last time. Now, it was plus seven Democratic. That's important, Martha, because if you're a Democrat, you're going to be over 85, 90 percent for Joe Biden. Same thing with Republicans. So, if your sample is seven points shy of what it was last time, that's going to affect the polls. But Joe Biden is not above 50 percent for a very significant reason. He hasn't made a compelling case."

He's the most transparent, available president. And I think when people look at the property (ph) and hear his vision for the future, he should go out. I think he should hold peace talks at Camp David. Why not? Domestic peace talks. I'm all for the President addressing this, but he has again and again, he addressed George Floyd's murder for the first time down at NASA, it got very little coverage. People just always wanted to be the word and the semicolon where they think it should be, where you have to look at what we're trying to do to bring the country together. Listen, we are founded on liberty and justice for all. But the words that precede that are important too, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

But that's why we made the Coronavirus Task Force available today for about an hour and a half press briefing. So, we're out there. I think Joe Biden, you've never seen a golf and exposure between two presidential nominees. We get about a total of less than an hour, a week of Joe Biden and we get Donald Trump all day long. I think Biden should be at 70 percent because you can make him whatever you wanted to be. He showed up in Philly yesterday, which basically is his home area. It's where his campaign is nationally headquartered. And you would have thought it was a Trump appearance because there were more Trump signs than there were Biden signs. The enthusiasm is for Trump and people don't want to invite more destruction and change in a system that has so much of it now."

It says Mr. Trump refuses to acknowledge what every poll now says is true. His approval rating has fallen below 40 percent, 40 percent or below, I should say. That is George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter territory, they're the last two presidents to be denied a second term.

So, his electoral take is a good eight, nine, 10 points higher than the approval rating. I wrote a piece 18 years ago called The Unbearable Lightness of Approval Ratings. And Donald Trump was a successful billionaire businessman. So, I wasn't talking about him. I was talking about how the more juicy, meaty measures are. Who do you trust to rebuild the economy? Who do you trust on health care? Who do you trust to get? We now have 200 miles of wall, 200 judges. We're rebuilding the military, making sure our veterans are taken care of.

As we look at the scroll of names, there are few common characteristics. Some are white. Others black. Some older. Others younger. Among them, two lawyers, Colin Ford Maddis, 32, and Urooj Rahman (ph), 31, accused of tossing Molotov cocktails at NYPD squad cars. Steven Carillo faces charges in the murder of a sheriff's deputy and a Federal Protective Service officer.

Well, take a very close look at the right-hand side of your screen. Specifically, agents zeroed in on the tattoos on her fingers. From there, they matched the pictures to her own social media posts. Obviously, the FBI and law enforcement's job has made a lot harder, Martha, by the commonality and acceptability of wearing masks by those protesting and also those with more sinister intentions.

      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there's a movement in the 244th year of our nation to redefine it, recalibrate it, reboot it, new national anthem, new national icons. Abolish Electoral College is a cultural revolution. And people, a minority, I think are not happy with the idea of freedom and liberty of the individual and protection of private property under the Constitution, they seem more of a French revolutionary idea of enforced equality of result. And that's what the stakes are. They've hijacked the killing of George Floyd and they've created a national crisis. And this election is going to be decided by that proverbial swing voter. And they're going to do one of two things, either they're going to say, I'm tired of this. There's a red line. You're not going to touch Mount Rushmore. You're not going to touch the Washington moment. I'm not going to change the national anthem et cetera, et cetera. And they're going to look for Donald Trump to be that emblem of their resistance, their pushback, or they're going to think he can't do it and they're going to go into a collective fetal position and say make it all go away. And maybe Biden, at least they won't be mad at Biden and the law go away. I don't think that will happen if Biden were to be elected. But that puts a great onus on Donald Trump to be very quiet and calm and carry a club rather than to be loud and carry a twig. And he's got a lot of constraints because under our federal system, as you just heard, the local law enforcement, the state law enforcement, the attorney generals of the states, they're the ones responsible. And they're either contextualizing the violence, appeasing it, or, in fact, in some cases supporting it because they see it has political dividends for their agendas in November. So, Trump can't force them to enforce a law unless he calls in federal troops. But he's got a military, 12 retired admirals and generals that have come out and really said some things that we've never heard about from generals, retired or not, about the Commander- in-Chief. We've had former joint chiefs. We've had the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs himself. So, it's made it problematic. And I think Bill Barr is on the right track to show that he's trying to restore the sense of our American customs and traditions. He's going to get a federal task force. He's got to get indictments. He's got to tell the states there are federal jurisdictions within your states. If you're going to lock down all of California, maybe you shouldn't lock down Yosemite. It's an open-air national park. It's under federal jurisdiction. Maybe I can do something there. Maybe he's going to say to certain local officials. You violated the federal civil rights of people within your jurisdiction. And that's a federal offense and that's a racketeering. And so he's got to show the nation that despite these constraints and this weaponization of this crisis, that he's going to be very calm and quiet, but he's going to carry a huge club and restore the country and the customs and traditions."

But now I think he's understanding that he can encourage the people that help is on the way, that he's not going to change anything. He's not going to allow any federal statute within his jurisdiction to topple. And he's going to go after the people. People want to see people punished. They know that if they go on to a federal monument and deface it, they're going to go to jail. They're going to be charged with a felony. They know if they decide tomorrow to go into Detroit or Baltimore and take over six city blocks, their career is ruined. And they don't like the exemption given to people for political reasons. And Donald Trump's got to restore that faith and the ability of the U.S. government to keep the order and peace, even if it means in a very dangerous situation, contravening local and state authorities that have given up their oath of office de facto."

And I hope their lives were not lost in vain on the union's side because we've honored them all these years. And suddenly to equate - Abraham Lincoln with Robert E. Lee is a crime. And same thing with Washington and Jefferson. I'm not trying to disparage Lee, but I'm just thinking that this mob frenzy that says that any white male of the past is morally inferior to us and the President is absurd. And we all, according to our station, Martha, have to speak out against it, because that's the only thing that will stop a cultural revolution. Once people understand that, we're going - We, the people are going to fight back. The bullies will dissipate and then we'll have a return to sanity. But right now, we're in the throes of madness and we need brave people to stand up and take the consequences. And I think they will. I hope so."

On the other side of your screen is a scene after which a New York police officer had to turn himself in for the chokehold that was employed there. These two scenes are just some of the heartbreaking images nationwide that show the deepening divide. My next guest work towards a solution to bridge this gap with their new initiative, police to peace, rebranding themselves as, \"peace officers.\" Tighe O'Meara, police chief of Ashland, Oregon, and Jim Bueermann is the police chief of Redlands, California and a retired president of the police foundation. Ty, Jim, thank you very much to you both for being here tonight. You know, I just wonder, when you look at that situation of the woman yelling in the face of the police officers, who happen to be black officers in that situation, she's telling them that they don't understand, you know, the issues that she's fighting for. Tighe, what goes through your mind?"

And what goes through my mind is that there is a disconnect between American law enforcement and the communities we serve, especially communities of color. And the police to peace movement can be one of the things that addresses that divide. It's a declaration of intent that my police department, for example, in Ashland, Oregon, we want to be good community partners. We want to foster mutual understanding, we want to embrace national best practices and even invent a new national best practice, as I'm proud to say we've done with our sex assault reporting program. So, about 10 months ago, I was encouraged to deploy the peace officer decals because I do see that as one piece, not the whole puzzle, but one piece of the puzzle to help bridge that gap between the divide between American law enforcement and American community."

So, peace officer is sort of a label that's put on the side of a lot of these police vehicles in the programs that you both work in to just sort of send that literal message to begin to change the way that people look at police. Jim, you know, I wonder what you think about the fact that they have had such difficulty on Capitol Hill, passing anything that would get close to police reform on the federal level. Do you think that's even necessary? Or do you think programs like yours and change at the local level is may be a bit more hands-on and effectual?"

      "speaker": "BUEERMANN",
      "utterance": "Sure, and I do think we need some federal involvement in policing on this level. There's a concept called the national coherence about policing that I think is incredibly important because we see that there are 50 different styles of policing at the state -- when you thing about state legislatures who are primarily responsible for setting legislation around policing but then there is 18,000 police departments, so you have almost 18,000 different ways of doing things. In this day and age, where we all have smartphones, social media, the internet, means that visual images, video of police community interaction go viral almost in real time, means that something that happens on the east coast has implications for police department and communities on the west coast. So, I think it is now time for us to be talking about not only redefining what we mean about policing or at least aspects of it, this idea of peace officers."

      "utterance": "I think it's working. I think that our declaration of our intention it sends the right message. I think that more than anything it's intended to build legitimacy of the police in the eyes of the community, and there are of course some people that are never going to listen to any attempt that I or any other chief makes to build legitimacy. And I think there are other people that are open to it. And so, I do think it's a positive program. Again, I think it's a good declaration. We want to be more than reactive. We want to be more than just enforcers of the law. The word police still appear on our police cars. And the way that I often phrase it is policing is what we do and peace officer is how we try to do it."

One neighborhood is getting a preview of what that might look like as a tent city grows in the heart of their town and they are starting to have some problematic issues with drug dealers and prostitution in some cases. We'll take you there next."

      "utterance": "In one Minneapolis neighborhood just blocks away from where George Floyd was killed, the residents are experimenting with the new informal policy not to call the police on people who break the law. But their commitment was almost immediately challenged when a homeless encampment of about 300 people decided to move into the local park where their children often play. So, this comes as the Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to change the city charter and to allow the dismantling of their police department. Here with a look at what is happening on the ground there as Kyle Hooten, a reporter for the Daily Caller and work with Alpha News contributor, on getting some of this footage. Kyle, good to have you here tonight. What's your take away from what you saw there?"

      "speaker": "KYLE HOOTEN, ALPHA NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at just the official police report of what's happening in Powderhorn Park the situation would appear rather peaceful. However, that appears to be because the community has vowed not to call the police. Yesterday, I spoke with several members of the community who told me that they're relying on so-called community mediators and members of the American Indian movement and to fill the role of police in their neighborhood as enlarge homeless encampments is established in the park side of the community."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I read that there were instances of suspected prostitution going on, that people had concerns about residents near the area and also concerns that drug dealers were driving into the area to do transactions there near this residential neighborhood. Are those -- are those accounts true from what you can tell?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOOTEN",
      "utterance": "Well, it appeared to me that around the periphery of the park there's group of individuals that weren't residents of the camp, they weren't members of the community and they weren't volunteers. These individuals drove some very nice SUVs and it did appear though that they were selling drugs to the residence of the camp, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, the other thing that seems to be happening is that people in the area who are trying not to call the police, there is one horrific story of a man who says that two boys tried to steal his car and he gave them the house keys by mistake, and you know, they ran off and he said, he felt terrible that he called the police because then he was worried that he had put their lives in danger. And I think to a lot of people who listen to that, they just can't understand, you know, that story at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOOTEN",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, when I was walking around the Powderhorn Park area I saw a woman, a community member, a resident of the neighborhood not in the encampment, she was out (Inaudible) and she had a moment to speak, and in that conversation I heard her tell me that she would feel guilty if she called the police because she feels that the individuals in the park as a result of systematic racism are in danger if they interact with the cops. And that is why instead of having Minneapolis law enforcement patrolling the area, I was seeing vans marked with fame of other people that were sort of masquerading as law enforcement officers because the community genuinely believes that calling the police would put those campers in danger."

      "speaker": "HOOTEN",
      "utterance": "So, what happened there is as soon as I got on the ground I got out of my vehicle, I started walking towards of this encampment. I was approached by a group of three individuals who told me that they were volunteers. That the organization is coordinating the effort there at Powderhorn Park. They told me that I was not allowed to film and I was not allowed to take any photographs. Of course, I proceed to do so anyway, but then I was approached in several other times both on and off camera by people who told me that it was not acceptable to document what was going on. I did ask an individual why that was and she said it's because she's afraid that the world will misunderstand what's happening in Powderhorn Park."

Well, as long as people are OK with it in their neighborhood, you know, they're going to continue to live there and move I think closer to a situation where there is no police force in that part of Minneapolis and we'll see what the impact is on the neighborhood and on the neighborhoods surrounding as time goes by. Thanks. Thanks, Kyle. Good to have you back. Kyle Hooten. So, with lots of things that were never questioned now being questioned every day, is the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" the next casualty? That is next."

      "utterance": "This rendition of the national anthem is going viral. A Portland State University student singing for a virtual graduation got an assist from a passerby who was also an opera singer and it makes for a beautiful, unifying rendition of that song. And it comes with a growing chorus now suggesting that the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" should be replaced. A week ago, we saw a statue of the song's author, Francis Scott Key, torn down in San Francisco with protesters noting that Key was a slave owner. Now a semi pro soccer team the Tulsa athletics say that they will no longer play the anthem before matches, opting for this land is your land instead. Others suggest America the beautiful or even John Lennon's \"Imagine\" should be the national anthem to which Rich Lowry wrote today, when \"Imagine\" is the national anthem is when I moved to Canada. Joining me now is Jack Brewer former Minnesota Vikings football player now CEO of the Brewer Group, and David Webb, SiriusXM patriotic host, Fox Nation host and Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. Jack, let me start with you, if I may. We all have watched and listened and had chills when the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" starts to play at, you know, big moments in sports and big moments in history. Why -- you know, and we understand that when you dig into some of the words of the later verses that we -- I had never heard, you know, until you really look at them, do you think that it should still be replaced?"

Some of my greatest memories are playing for the National Football League before those big games and hearing that national anthem, and I did have chills going down my back. But I still don't think that takes away or makes us not take this moment to discuss the real root of the national anthem. I mean, to say no refuge and say our Harlem or slave, I mean, those are some deep words. And so, I think, you know, it's about the person who wrote the national anthem. Do I think we need to go out and make all these changes? No, I think these things need to be voted upon. I don't agree with going out and tearing things down and using violence. I think this is a time for our nation to come to God, to pray together."

Written at a time when we were fighting against the British empire, when we were fighting for freedom, at a time in our country when there are other struggles for freedom. Freedom from slavery, when the fact is that we as a country were beginning to grow into our, if you will, our teenage years. All of this is part of our history. What Francis Scott Key wrote was also part of a promise of America and the rest of those verses, which I have read, which many Americans need to now read reflect a time and circumstance but also a chance for freedom. When you look at what they want to replace it with, it's simply a song that sounds good and feels good rather than a song that reflects who we are as a country and what we battle for. The battle for freedom is and always fought at every time about every issue. We fought to free ourselves from the British. We had a Declaration of Independence and a promise of a nation of free people. And we, as one people evolved to where we were today, we overcame colonial slavery, we overcame segregation. Look at women's rights, look at all the things we've done to evolve and understand that for those out there that are more in the neo-Marxist view of things, one thing you want to do is you want to erase history. If you erase history you can rewrite history for the next generation and in America I prefer --"

And it just opens that, you know, it opens all of these questions. And I just wonder if the common acceptance of what the song means, the \"Star-Spangled Banner,\" you know, has taken on its own meaning for our own time and can transcend. Last thought."

      "speaker": "BREWER",

We're not going to God, were going to man-made rules and going to feelings and I think this is a reflection of our leaders, our leaders across America who are actually seeking out to appease versus seeking out to lead. These are issues that can be discussed and people can have these conversations but we can't push out perspectives and we cannot make people feel like they can't discuss race, that they can't discuss the history of our nation. And so, I think it's very important that we take these times right now to wrap around our bibles as Christians, as a Christian nation and start to get back to God."
