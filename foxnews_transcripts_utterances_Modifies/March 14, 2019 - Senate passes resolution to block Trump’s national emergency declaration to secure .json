But the history, as you pointed out, is daunting, no presidential win since '76, no statewide wins in any race since 1994. That's a quarter century. That's a lot of time.   But people look to O'Rourke's performance where we got within 2.6 points in the last election. They look to the changing demographics in the state of Texas, and then the enthusiasm the Democrats had in 2018. I mean, I was just looking at the numbers. I had forgotten this. But O'Rourke actually had significantly more votes than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. They add all that up, and they think there's some potential there. But I'm fairly skeptical for a variety of reasons. As you also pointed out, O'Rourke spent on the order of, what was it, I think $79 million, and he -- and he got 6 percent more than Paul Sadler got. Sadler got 42 percent in the 2012 race against Cruz. So that means, all right, if you want to spend $70 million and get an extra six points and lose by two-and-a-half, go right ahead and do that.

You had it at the lieutenant governor's race, the attorney general's race, and then with Cruz, unpopular Republicans, they won, but they won by single digits, and sometimes low single digits. Trump, I think, there's a strong argument, falls into that category, a relatively unpopular Republican. Then you have got a homegrown Beto O'Rourke as a potential challenger. That, I think, would be cause for concern. But I would also point out, Neil, that times have changed with respect to campaign financing.

That's caused some problems too. I want to bring you over to the cancellation board, but, as I do, give you a tweet that is perhaps emblematic of the feeling of a lot of passengers today. Take a look at this one. Fellow writes: \"We are scheduled to fly in 24 hours, both legs on a 737 MAX. The flight is not showing canceled. Am I flying?\"  The answer to that is, at this point, we don't know. See, what the airlines are doing, they're not canceling all the 737 MAX flights. What they're saying is, we could cancel another flight, move the plane over there, and then your flight could be going. So it's a little bit of a catch as catch can. Look at the boards. The yellow and the red, that means canceled or delayed. And there's a lot of it up there. So I take you to perhaps the other thing that we don't know, and that is the information about that black box. The Ethiopian Air crash black box is now in France to be analyzed. And as the president says, we don't know yet, may take us a while. As you say, it could be weeks or months.

It's kind of similar to what we see in tropical season, where a storm go through rapid intensification. That's what happened with the center of the storm yesterday. That was a storm. Now it's just crossing the Iowa border there headed in towards parts of Wisconsin. That's the center of it. I will say the storm is weakening a little bit. That said, take a look at these wind gusts right now. Winds are gusting at 62 miles in North Platte, Nebraska, 61 miles in Louisville, Kentucky. That's because we have a line of storms that is moving through there. But the wind is still incredibly strong, blizzard warnings in effect here across the Dakotas, Minnesota, towards the Panhandle of Nebraska. Then you see this green, and that's where we have been seeing incredibly heavy rain with it. And that's been causing the flooding conditions. This is what happens over time over tonight. You see the front with this moving off towards the east, a little bit cooler air moving in behind it. But the center of the storm goes up in across parts of Canada. And we're going to see less impacts of this storm by the time we get to tomorrow. So we do have to get through today with severe weather. In fact, we have tornado watches here all across parts of the Ohio Valley, stretched down across parts of the Deep South. No tornado warnings at this moment. To the northern side of this, we had damaged earlier today in Paducah, Kentucky. Down to the southern side of this, this was a tornado warning here just to the southeast of Jackson. So be watchful. I think we will likely see a new tornado watch box pop up here across areas to the south of that throughout the evening. Still, these two spots where we're looking at that threat for severe weather, we could be seeing a chance for a large conditions are ripe, Neil, for a large, long-lasting tornado, especially where you see this hatch area. And that's what we certainly need to watch, a lot of population zones with that as well. Here's your temps today. You see this real warmer springlike air towards the East. That will begin to move off with this front tomorrow. Cooler temperatures come in behind this storm. But we still have to get through about another 12 hours, and finally this really amazing storm across parts of Central Plains will be out of here.",

And I won't go into detail, but it basically is just the terms on which the U.K. will leave the European Union, which takes care of certain issues. Like, the biggest problem is Ireland, because there'll be a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is within the United Kingdom, so there has to be a border. So, there are all those kind of issues. They have got to resolve all those issues. And there's a lot of problems there. The particular challenge they have is that the -- this is all supposed to happen by the 29th of March. Under the legislation that was passed by Parliament two years ago, 29th of March is the day U.K. is due to leave. Now, as it happens, as of today, they have had another round of votes in Parliament.

Now, half of that cash came from outside the state. That's one thing. But half of that cash also was in small denominations. So it started with very, very small offerings from people who were psyched by the guy. So does that mean anything? To Axios reporter Caitlin Owens, who has been examining that.

And so, as we have seen another candidates in the past and get a lot of grassroots fund-raising going pretty early on, Bernie Sanders was one of them in 2016, Barack Obama was another one before him. And so while a lot of candidates are embracing now the small-dollar donation fund-raising model, I mean, Beto has already been there, done that."

I think that just kind of his ability to spin a narrative was -- helped him a lot. But then, as the race started getting tighter, like it was kind of a self- reinforcing narrative, where -- to Democrats, it was, wow, we're getting close in Texas. We could take down Cruz. That's a big deal. We should focus on this race."

      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "I think that sounds about right. A lot of large donors kind of wait around to see who's drawing attention, especially when a field is this big. You don't want to waste money throwing it in too early. And so, again, I think these small-dollar donations, they can be really important, especially if they're sustained throughout the race. But I think it marks who is leading the pack at the moment, who the American people are excited about."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "I think that, right now, it's a lot about name recognition, right? I mean, it's March of 2019. We're very early in the 2020 presidential race cycle. And so that's why I think we're seeing people, Joe Biden, who's not even in the race yet officially -- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Beto, these people who have had a lot of media buzz over their career -- just last election cycle in the case of Beto. I mean, I think that's why this could change a lie going forward as people become more familiar with other candidates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, to your point, I just want to emphasize in here, if we knew in retrospect that some of the early money and energy, for example, that we noticed with Barack Obama would signal that he was going to be a bigger threat than Hillary Clinton thought or, for that matter, going way back to before you were born and Jimmy Carter in 1976 was getting a lot of very early interest in the state of Iowa, 10, 15 bucks at a time.

Since 2004, when then President George W. Bush beat John Kerry by 22 points, though, the past few presidential elections have seen tighter Texas races, with Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton by about nine points, still impressive, but a reminder that this state, which used to be a swamper for the GOP, might be changing?

He didn't, but he came close. What do you see happening?"

But the history, as you pointed out, is daunting, no presidential win since '76, no statewide wins in any race since 1994. That's a quarter century. That's a lot of time. But people look to O'Rourke's performance where we got within 2.6 points in the last election. They look to the changing demographics in the state of Texas, and then the enthusiasm the Democrats had in 2018. I mean, I was just looking at the numbers. I had forgotten this. But O'Rourke actually had significantly more votes than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. They add all that up, and they think there's some potential there. But I'm fairly skeptical for a variety of reasons. As you also pointed out, O'Rourke spent on the order of, what was it, I think $79 million, and he -- and he got 6 percent more than Paul Sadler got. Sadler got 42 percent in the 2012 race against Cruz. So that means, all right, if you want to spend $70 million and get an extra six points and lose by two-and-a-half, go right ahead and do that. And so I think that's why Republicans are still kind of waiting to be -- waiting to see whether Texas is really in play."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, should they worry that it is and spend some time there? Maybe Democrats would be just as happy if they have to reallocate their resources that spend more time there than they otherwise would."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAW",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a good point. Yes, I think -- I think the Republicans are going to have to shore up Texas. I don't think -- Trump is not particularly popular here, by Republican standards. And that was a common theme for all the Republicans in 2018 in Texas that had trouble, right? You had it at the lieutenant governor's race, the attorney general's race, and then with Cruz, unpopular Republicans, they won, but they won by single digits, and sometimes low single digits. Trump, I think, there's a strong argument, falls into that category, a relatively unpopular Republican. Then you have got a homegrown Beto O'Rourke as a potential challenger. That, I think, would be cause for concern. But I would also point out, Neil, that times have changed with respect to campaign financing. You were mentioning, when you and I were kind of watching this stuff in the '80s and '90s, there was a -- people were taking public funds. There was like an $80 million cap in total spending. Spending in Texas was..."

There are no reports of injuries. But remember that the Israelis have this Dome, as they like to call it, that can stop rockets midflight. An Israeli TV station reporting that the rockets were apparently Iranian-made. We haven't heard any of that confirmed by the Iranians themselves.

That's caused some problems too. I want to bring you over to the cancellation board, but, as I do, give you a tweet that is perhaps emblematic of the feeling of a lot of passengers today. Take a look at this one."

See, what the airlines are doing, they're not canceling all the 737 MAX flights. What they're saying is, we could cancel another flight, move the plane over there, and then your flight could be going. So it's a little bit of a catch as catch can. Look at the boards. The yellow and the red, that means canceled or delayed. And there's a lot of it up there. So I take you to perhaps the other thing that we don't know, and that is the information about that black box. The Ethiopian Air crash black box is now in France to be analyzed. And as the president says, we don't know yet, may take us a while. As you say, it could be weeks or months. That wouldn't be great, but passengers, I think, feeling good about the fact that they feel any aircraft that could be a problem is now on the ground and they feel safe. Take a listen."

It's kind of similar to what we see in tropical season, where a storm go through rapid intensification. That's what happened with the center of the storm yesterday. That was a storm. Now it's just crossing the Iowa border there headed in towards parts of Wisconsin. That's the center of it. I will say the storm is weakening a little bit. That said, take a look at these wind gusts right now. Winds are gusting at 62 miles in North Platte, Nebraska, 61 miles in Louisville, Kentucky. That's because we have a line of storms that is moving through there. But the wind is still incredibly strong, blizzard warnings in effect here across the Dakotas, Minnesota, towards the Panhandle of Nebraska. Then you see this green, and that's where we have been seeing incredibly heavy rain with it. And that's been causing the flooding conditions. This is what happens over time over tonight. You see the front with this moving off towards the east, a little bit cooler air moving in behind it. But the center of the storm goes up in across parts of Canada. And we're going to see less impacts of this storm by the time we get to tomorrow. So we do have to get through today with severe weather. In fact, we have tornado watches here all across parts of the Ohio Valley, stretched down across parts of the Deep South. No tornado warnings at this moment. To the northern side of this, we had damaged earlier today in Paducah, Kentucky. Down to the southern side of this, this was a tornado warning here just to the southeast of Jackson. So be watchful. I think we will likely see a new tornado watch box pop up here across areas to the south of that throughout the evening. Still, these two spots where we're looking at that threat for severe weather, we could be seeing a chance for a large conditions are ripe, Neil, for a large, long-lasting tornado, especially where you see this hatch area. And that's what we certainly need to watch, a lot of population zones with that as well. Here's your temps today. You see this real warmer springlike air towards the East. That will begin to move off with this front tomorrow. Cooler temperatures come in behind this storm. But we still have to get through about another 12 hours, and finally this really amazing storm across parts of Central Plains will be out of here."

And Theresa May's deal, which is actually not a bad deal -- it's probably the best deal that you're going to be able to get in negotiating with the Europeans. And let's remember what this deal is. And I won't go into detail, but it basically is just the terms on which the U.K. will leave the European Union, which takes care of certain issues. Like, the biggest problem is Ireland, because there'll be a border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is within the United Kingdom, so there has to be a border. So, there are all those kind of issues. They have got to resolve all those issues. And there's a lot of problems there. The particular challenge they have is that the -- this is all supposed to happen by the 29th of March. Under the legislation that was passed by Parliament two years ago, 29th of March is the day U.K. is due to leave. Now, as it happens, as of today, they have had another round of votes in Parliament. It's fun watching all these votes. And it's like, you know, the ayes to the right 312, the no's to the left 340. It's kind of like -- it's like poetry, poetry to the parliamentary process."

So the government is now going to go to the E.U. and say, we want a little bit more time. We want a bit more time to see if we can get another deal through Parliament. But still the likeliest thing though, Neil -- and you say, if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again -- they're going to probably go and try and put Theresa May's deal, which has already been rejected by a huge majority twice."

But for every headline that a progressive in the House of representative gets, there's someone like a Steny Hoyer or a more moderate member of Congress who is dying to avoid that impeachment question, because they're coming from a district or a state that voted for President Trump. So, Nancy Pelosi is playing her card here where she knows, as a member of leadership, she needs to put a stake out there to try and avoid some of those more vulnerable members getting the question about impeachment, because it certainly will alienate the voters that those Democrats need to show up for Senate races and for the presidential in 2020."

She's been trying to talk this down for a while, because it may play well to the base, to the sort of crazier fringes of the Democratic Party. But what the Republicans have is that not only do Republicans oppose this, but a majority of independents oppose it as well. So as long as Republicans keep playing it -- she can keep saying, we're not serious about this, we're not going to do this. But Republicans just have to point to the fringe members of her caucus and say, well, actually, this is a thing. And Republicans can play that off of not just their own voters, but also independents.

And he's promising a veto. It would be the first of his presidency. Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott, he sided with the president on this, on what the implications are now. Senator, good to have you."

I have talked to border agents. They need more people. They need better technology. And they have got to have barriers. They have got to have barriers to have operational control. It's for their safety and for the safety of every American."

I want to get on to other issues. I'm very focused on how you get drug prices down. There's a lot of other things we ought to be doing up here. I'm a business guy. I was a governor.

And he should get things done. He ran on getting -- on -- for border security. Americans believe in border security. So I hope he does exactly would he said he was going to do and get our border security as he can. And I know it's not going to get done in a year. We're going to have to continue to do this until our border is secure."

But he has already budgeted better than $8 billion to address a wall expansion in this latest budget that the Democrats have all but said is dead on arrival. So where's this going?"

They say they care about things, but they just won't do it. And there's other issues that -- to deal with, rather than just dealing with the border all the time. Think about what's happening to people who are taking insulin in our country, that these prices have skyrocketed. So I know we're going to keep fighting over border security. I wish the Democrats would come to the table and say, you know what? We agree. We have got to secure our borders. And let's go on to other important issues."

We're following all of this very closely. And here to help us is Andy Lockwood, Lockwood College Prep, author of \"How to Pay Wholesale for College.\" In fact, he knew the guy who was sort of like an organizer on all of this stuff, Rick Singer, who apparently had a wire on him for the better part of some months here, taping all of these calls with all of these people who were involved in this.

So I took everything he said with a grain of salt about the Steve Jobs thing and all that. But he told me that he represented very wealthy people who -- to get their kids into the side door of schools by brokering huge donations to their endowments. And I thought, OK, that's scummy, but I know that goes on. That's not so bad. At some point, he went to the dark side and crossed the line and started getting into like bribing coaches and having proctors take tests."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOCKWOOD",
      "utterance": "Right. I'm scratching my head over that one, too. So you're talking about schools like University of San Diego, which is a fine school, but it admits 50 percent of its applicants. So it's pretty easy to get in. You don't -- it's not a prestigious school. To me, this is all about the prestige, chasing the prestige. Why would someone who's the CEO of a billion-dollar company care where his kids goes to school? Is that really going to give them a leg up? Or does he just want the rear window sticker that he can plaster on his car and show off at the country club?"

Maybe -- a lot of times, parents hire me because they want someone to kind of coach and guide their kids, and so they don't have to deal with it or they don't have the expertise. There is accountability and time management. It could be that stuff. But then, yes, I don't understand why getting into a school that admits 50 percent is such a prize."

So is this a sign the Russia probe itself will be over in the near future? I didn't know, but I know Catherine Herridge knows. She follows this relentlessly. What does this mean, Catherine?"

On the other hand, those close to Weissmann say he wouldn't leave if there was major legal work still on the table for the special counsel. Also today, Roger Stone got a trial date of November 5 and a mid-September status hearing. As he left court, Stone shunned reporter questions. The gag order wasn't my modified, which had been expected. He is still free to fund-raise for his defense and proclaim his innocence. But he cannot discuss the special counsel case, which includes charges he lied to Congress about his communications about the hacked Democratic e- mails. For now, Judge Amy Berman Jackson set aside the issues surrounding Stone's book, \"The Myth of Russia Collusion,\" and whether it violated the gag order. Outside the court, a former Trump aide subpoenaed by the special counsel questioned whether the same judge could be neutral after handing former campaign chairman Paul Manafort another three years in jail and criticizing his defense team from the bench."

I don't get -- I don't get how -- especially after yesterday, with what said at the -- at the Manafort sentencing. It seemed to me that she can't be non-biased if they get to a sentencing."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, whatever comes out of -- yes, you're right. Whatever comes out of the report, I notice that the Senate doesn't want a public release of Bob Mueller's report. The House does. So where are we on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Look, the statute known as CFR-600 is pretty clear on that. It states that the Mueller report is confidential to the attorney general. And William Barr testified his interpretation of the statute, that he expects to provide summaries of Mueller's finding, not the raw intelligence, to Congress, and then as much as possible to the public. So, really, it's driven or governed by the statute at this point, Neil."
