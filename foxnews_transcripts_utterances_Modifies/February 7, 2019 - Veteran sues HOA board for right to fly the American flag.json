You've heard some of this, but we're going to really, really pull the threads out of this. Now check it out. Eliminating cars, airplanes, flatulent cows and for good measure, tearing down all of our buildings. Yes, those are just some of the modest proposals included inside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's green new raw deal. We're going to explain what it means for you and why 2020 Dems are embarrassingly lining up behind it.  Plus Adam Schiff, takes aim at Devin Nunes over what he claims was an incomplete Russia inquiry. Well, Congressman Nunes is here to react and a few more tidbits in there. And the court yes is in session, will I wear that doily around my neck. You're going to have to wait to see that.  And now in tonight's case of \"The Arbiter\", the case of a veteran being denied the right to fly the American flag, I kid you not, two lawyers take up the case and the Judge namely (May) will have a ruling. But, first, the rise of the PC Puritans: Part II, that's the focus of tonight's angle.  Another day, another liberal icon caught up in the sensitivity trap.",

Well, look, now corporations are also worried.  This week Adidas hold back an all-white -- almost all-white sneaker, because its release was deemed racist, for it's coinciding with Black History Month. Jeffry Jason who's a shoe maven tweeted. \"Adidas you're really \"celebrating black culture\" with an \"Uncaged\" all WHITE \"Ultraboost?!\" Well, but if tennis a racist, what about -- and now the fashion house Gucci is also apologizing. Well, what's the controversy? Look at it. This bizarre sweater mask situation that covers half of the wearer's mouth. The company recalled the design from its online and physical stores after one fashionista tweeted out, \"Balaclava knit top by Gucci. Happy Black History Month y'all.\" Look, demeaning portrayals of anyone on the basis of race or ethnicity is deplorable and should be called out as such.   Yet, we as Americans, we also have to be careful not to rush in to condemn people or frankly businesses because of uncorroborated allegations or decades-old conduct or just disagreement about fashion. Bowing to the every demand of the politically correct puritans puts us on a dangerous path, slippery slope, whatever you want to call it.  The concern is that without some safe space to make mistakes in the past, good people won't want to be involved in public life at all. They're going to be fearful that something they said or did years ago will now be considered unforgivable and irredeemable and -- to Joy Behar. The easiest thing for me to do would be relish this moment and grind her into the dirt for the double standard. She has been incredibly uncharitable to me, personally, over the years. I've go on the show and so forth. But I'm not going to take that bait. I prefer to try to stick to the principle of fairness.  I don't think she's a racist. I disagree with her, but I don't think she's a racist. And a goofy photo from 1972 isn't going to make me change my mind. But we all need to take a breath and evaluate patterns of behavior rather than rushing to judgment, real discriminatory conduct or intent.  And for goodness sake, when we have reached a point where white tennis shoes are considered racist, maybe it's time to reconsider the shifting standards of the PC puritans, and that's the angle. Joining me now with reaction Dinesh D'souza, Conservative Filmmaker, Niger Innis, National Spokesperson for the Congress of Racial Equality and Ladawn Jones, Democratic Strategist. Niger let's start with you. Are we already over the tipping point here of what is and what is not racist with the tennis shoe and their other fashion houses that are dealing with other issues? What about that?",

And conflating that with the historic racism that Black Americans have had to deal with over the centuries, actually minimizes and actually belittles the real history and what has happened to African-Americans.   I think we all need to take a deep breath. I mean, are we going to go into Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson who were in -- involved in a relationship and Ted Danson actually went out in full blackface and Whoopi Goldberg was not only not offended, she enjoyed it thoroughly, and laughed about it.

So we've been told for a whole generation now that the parties switched sides. So the Democrats might have been racist a 100 years ago, but the racism is now metamorphosed into the Republican Party. The racist democrats became Republican. Now I've been maintaining in my movies, in my books and this is not so.

A certain kind of leaving the baby to die even when it's viable outside the womb.  Now, let's remember, this is this was exactly the position of Margaret Sanger a 100 years ago. So in other words a 100 years ago in the Democratic Party and in the progressive movement, you had on the one hand a condoning of racism of the Ku Klux Klan of Black Vaudeville, of blackface. And on the other hand this kind of idea that \"human weeds\", to use the phrase Margaret Sanger used, should be disposed.

It is now race and identity politics obsessed, bet it race, bet it gender, be it sexual orientation, be had whatever little category they want to put human beings and free individuals in. That is today's Democratic Party. And it's also a Democratic Party that is cavalier on the history of racism.

And even historically, if AOC thinks because historically my people were here, that means everybody gets to come, she would be shocked to learn what the Incas, the Aztecs, and the Mayans did to each other. There have been wars, there have been divisions of geography, and there have been boundaries put throughout history. And if she read her history she would know that. And I'll add one more thing. The reason that immigrants, and I'm an immigrant, the reason that immigrants come to this country is because this country does have some standards and a higher quality of living and some principles that it lives by. And frankly, if we were to take down those borders and let everybody in and have any standards whatsoever, it actually would be a place that those folks wouldn't want to come to anymore. So the American ideal requires some borders and some limitations, and I think she knows that. And I think Democrats in her party know that. Her position is totally untenable and, frankly, absurd.",

Well, look, now corporations are also worried. This week Adidas hold back an all-white -- almost all-white sneaker, because its release was deemed racist, for it's coinciding with Black History Month. Jeffry Jason who's a shoe maven tweeted. \"Adidas you're really \"celebrating black culture\" with an \"Uncaged\" all WHITE \"Ultraboost?!\" Well, but if tennis a racist, what about -- and now the fashion house Gucci is also apologizing. Well, what's the controversy? Look at it. This bizarre sweater mask situation that covers half of the wearer's mouth. The company recalled the design from its online and physical stores after one fashionista tweeted out, \"Balaclava knit top by Gucci. Happy Black History Month y'all.\" Look, demeaning portrayals of anyone on the basis of race or ethnicity is deplorable and should be called out as such. Yet, we as Americans, we also have to be careful not to rush in to condemn people or frankly businesses because of uncorroborated allegations or decades-old conduct or just disagreement about fashion. Bowing to the every demand of the politically correct puritans puts us on a dangerous path, slippery slope, whatever you want to call it. The concern is that without some safe space to make mistakes in the past, good people won't want to be involved in public life at all. They're going to be fearful that something they said or did years ago will now be considered unforgivable and irredeemable and -- to Joy Behar. The easiest thing for me to do would be relish this moment and grind her into the dirt for the double standard. She has been incredibly uncharitable to me, personally, over the years. I've go on the show and so forth. But I'm not going to take that bait. I prefer to try to stick to the principle of fairness. I don't think she's a racist. I disagree with her, but I don't think she's a racist. And a goofy photo from 1972 isn't going to make me change my mind. But we all need to take a breath and evaluate patterns of behavior rather than rushing to judgment, real discriminatory conduct or intent. And for goodness sake, when we have reached a point where white tennis shoes are considered racist, maybe it's time to reconsider the shifting standards of the PC puritans, and that's the angle. Joining me now with reaction Dinesh D'souza, Conservative Filmmaker, Niger Innis, National Spokesperson for the Congress of Racial Equality and Ladawn Jones, Democratic Strategist. Niger let's start with you. Are we already over the tipping point here of what is and what is not racist with the tennis shoe and their other fashion houses that are dealing with other issues? What about that?"

And conflating that with the historic racism that Black Americans have had to deal with over the centuries, actually minimizes and actually belittles the real history and what has happened to African-Americans. I think we all need to take a deep breath. I mean, are we going to go into Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson who were in -- involved in a relationship and Ted Danson actually went out in full blackface and Whoopi Goldberg was not only not offended, she enjoyed it thoroughly, and laughed about it.

Gucci and Adidas a very progressive corporations, Joy Behar is on the Left, Ralph Northam is a Democrat, Mark Herring is a Democrat. So we've been told for a whole generation now that the parties switched sides. So the Democrats might have been racist a 100 years ago, but the racism is now metamorphosed into the Republican Party. The racist democrats became Republican. Now I've been maintaining in my movies, in my books and this is not so. That the racist strain remained in the Democratic Party, the Racist Dixiecrats never became Republicans. And so the stuff in Virginia is a stunning vindication of that. Interestingly --"

The reason this whole thing came to light was because of Northam's shocking defense of a certain kind of infanticide. Right? A certain kind of leaving the baby to die even when it's viable outside the womb. Now, let's remember, this is this was exactly the position of Margaret Sanger a 100 years ago. So in other words a 100 years ago in the Democratic Party and in the progressive movement, you had on the one hand a condoning of racism of the Ku Klux Klan of Black Vaudeville, of blackface. And on the other hand this kind of idea that \"human weeds\", to use the phrase Margaret Sanger used, should be disposed.

It is now race and identity politics obsessed, bet it race, bet it gender, be it sexual orientation, be had whatever little category they want to put human beings and free individuals in. That is today's Democratic Party. And it's also a Democratic Party that is cavalier on the history of racism. When a Joe Biden can go before a black audience and say because of the policies of the Republican Party they -- literally he says, \"They want to put you back in chains\" that shows a contempt that Vice President Joe Biden -- I guess Vice presidential candidate at the time, Joe Biden had for the history of Black Americans in our country, and that's the problem with this.

They don't have to feel the need to be able to prove that it was or was not. They said if this is how people feel it is not important enough for us to have the shoe to put it out. And all white Americans, whether you be Republican or Democrat when you see these issues of race come up -- and I'm not saying you have to follow every rabbit trail.

And even historically, if AOC thinks because historically my people were here, that means everybody gets to come, she would be shocked to learn what the Incas, the Aztecs, and the Mayans did to each other. There have been wars, there have been divisions of geography, and there have been boundaries put throughout history. And if she read her history she would know that. And I'll add one more thing. The reason that immigrants, and I'm an immigrant, the reason that immigrants come to this country is because this country does have some standards and a higher quality of living and some principles that it lives by. And frankly, if we were to take down those borders and let everybody in and have any standards whatsoever, it actually would be a place that those folks wouldn't want to come to anymore.

So if the ranking member at the time was meeting privately with Glenn Simpson, who is the main figure in our investigation. He was the one that was being paid by the Democrats to collude with the Russians. So what they were talking about, I don't know. But can you imagine that I was meeting off the side with some of our witnesses, can you imagine what they would have --"

They were talking about your meeting at the White House or conversation with the president, but this is a central figure in the investigation. It's like Jeff Sessions meeting Kislyak at an RNC cocktail -- hey, ambassador, and that was a key meeting, wasn't it? So it depends on whose ox was gored. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us."

All right, guys, here are the rules of the Court of Ingraham. Each attorney has 30 seconds to lay out the case, whichever side you take, followed by a rebuttal. If the judge needs more info, each of you will have an additional 30 to explain. And at the end I will make my ruling. First docket case tonight, a man and his flag. \"The Sun News\" reports that an Air Force bet is suing the HOA board for denying him the right to fly an American flag on a freestanding pole. the board is saying the flag would, quote, \"quickly dominate the appearance of the neighborhood,\" but that smaller flags are OK, and that it's trying to avoid a \"who has the largest flagpole or best flagpole\" contest. Scott, you've got 30 seconds."

It says if it's portable, if it's reasonable, and I'm sorry, if it's portable, reasonable, and removable, then that's a carve out and he can have his flagpole in his yard. That makes sense. He's a veteran. What beautification or negative beautification could there be for the association if the flag dominated the association?"

And when you purchase property subject to a homeowners' covenant or agreement, then you are agreeing for the property values of everyone in that community that you will abide by those regulations."

And if the court viewed that he did have a right to sue or he did have standing, he would not have the capacity to consent when he was an embryo because he would be a minor and his parents would have the legal capacity to consent on his behalf. Also, it turns the entire concept of law upside down."

But for his parents -- he didn't have a right to choose to come into this world, but for his parents, either they were negligent or they breached the social contract or sexual contract with each other. But the bottom line is he didn't buy into an emancipation statute. He didn't have a choice in coming here. And so as a result his parents have committed a contract with him to provide clothing, food, and all the essentials. Now, the local statutes and state statutes about emancipation are certainly in place, but he didn't buy into him and they don't apply to him."
