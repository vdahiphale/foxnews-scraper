Twitter and Facebook have some serious explaining to do after censoring and blocking people from sharing an explosive New York Post report about Hunter Biden's alleged e-mails and his foreign business dealings.  Twitter going as far as suspending the Trump campaign's account and the personal account for White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.  Twitter's CEO admitting the company screwed up. But that's not going to cut it. President Trump sounding off on this major controversy earlier.",

I am ticked off about COVID because we're not having Halloween and I finally found my Halloween costume which is Hunter Biden. Very easy, shirtless, sunglasses, it's just a little crack pipe hanging out of your lip.   I find this funny that we are now calling this like unverified mudslinging as if that matters after the dossier, the Russian collusion scam, the Kavanaugh rape claims. It's interesting, like this guy if he had been helpful, the guy that ran the video store had been helpful to Biden he would be called a whistleblower. Right? But because this is helpful to Trump, he's a nutcase. Right? This is such a weird story. The fact is the media could have done something about this. They could have made some phone calls. Right? Instead of the -- instead of the story now exploding and being about the suppression of a story, it could have been about verifying these e-mails. Let's find out if this is true. I mean, let's face it, they didn't really scrutinize the origins of the tax returns, I don't think Jack at Twitter was worried about that when that story came out but we'll let this happen but it's weird. Biden's camp, their reaction to this is so muted. They haven't demanded a retraction, they haven't said, they haven't tried to disprove this, instead he calls a lid. He retreated under his bed again waiting for his Ovaltine.  What is this telling you? It's telling you that this is probably true and it's really easy if you are a journalist, start making phone calls. Call the guy, call the Ukrainian business guy, there are people that can verify e-mails. Why isn't that the story? Too late. Now you guys look like you're running for cover.",

And first of all, yes, they are bound by regulations as well as their own terms and conditions and there are multiple government agencies that are investigating them actually. But I, you know, the goal of diversion however has been totally achieved.  We are talking about big tech and the continued pattern of muting conservative voices rather than those e-mails. But in the notion of against disinformation and misinformation as you've said, I think it's important to remember that four days before this president was inaugurated, then- outgoing Vice President Biden was in Ukraine for the sixth time in seven years. And after Russia invaded Crime Ukraine became a top priority for the Obama administration. And it was basically outsourced for the vice president to handle. And his then foreign policy and defense policy adviser said it was our top priority, always number one or one of the top three and Biden, quote, \"was front and center.\" So, the notion or the concept that these e-mails definitely don't raise at least a question of unethical conflict of interest is utterly false.

He says we had a communications problem. We have a P.R. problem. Like, believe me, when an executive, a congressman, your boss, whoever says there's a communications problem, 99 percent of the time you actually have a fact problem. And I'm not saying that these issues are not complex. I think that they are. Because I was wondering, you know, let's say that something came to the daily briefing and it was about Don Jr. and it was under this fishy kind of, what, this guy and the e-mails, I wouldn't run it. Now but if it did run, if I were Don Jr's. people, what I'd say, that's unfair. That story is not true, don't spread around. But who is going to be the arbiter of truth?  And that gets back to what Mark Zuckerberg told me a year ago, he doesn't think social media companies should be the arbiter of truth. And would have it been better to allow the story out there and for journalists to do what they do which is try to track it down and then the marketplace of ideas on social media, blasted away. Now on the other side think about what the left has tried to do to social media company since 2016. They believe that the social media companies made Donald Trump's election possible because they didn't do enough to fight back against Russian interference. So, Silicon Valley is going to have its day in court, and by that it means the court of public opinion and they're in the Senate. I will mention one other thing. I think what Twitter did was preposterous, just so over-the- top, they do not have a clear policy so they did something they went way overboard. I mean, blocking the Trump campaign's Twitter account?",

Had they done it before? There was an accusation that antifa was starting the wildfires in Oregon, they suppressed that story until they could the fact check. The fact-check comes back, no, that's not true.  That actually seems like, well, that could work.

Remember, when the Kavanagh stuff come up, after this process, like at this point, like over the next few days, or the counter process, that's when something came up. I have no indication. I don't believe they're going to do anything like that. But just look, don't sleep on it, that might happen. The other thing is that a lot of their outrageousness was already out there. It just became white noise. And I just wanted to point out two examples, for example. So, in the Bork hearings, remember Ted Kennedy speech in which he said that Bork would lead to back-alley abortion, segregated lunch tables, and midnight police raids. In this case, because I guess maybe people are just desensitized to this stuff, Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey argued that Justice Barrett -- that women who have miscarriages could be subject to investigation to ensure they hadn't had an abortion. This is the speech that he gives on the floor. It's egregious. It's inflammatory. But Richard Blumenthal also says that in vitro fertilization could be criminalized under Judge Barrett, even though she says there's nothing in her record, history, or public statements to suggest that's even remotely possible. So, I think we are well past Bork. And I agree with them -- I don't agree with them that it's a sham. When Dick Durbin says, how do we get this all back on track?

We have to intellectually acknowledge that if she would have comment on a hypo, and then was confirmed, and before her a case came with one of those issues, half the country would clam her for a certain result, and she'd have to recuse herself, obviously. And the notion that you know, that a judge is neutral and objective, that's what is before them is a closed universe. That's how they remain neutral and objective. And that's why all of these senators attempts to find the chimps in our armor and these decisions, why they kept failing. So, they kept -- they refused to parse out merit issues for procedural and ministerial and whether the plaintiff met the burden. So, when Senator Coons was talking, which I could barely tolerate listening to, and he said that she would be a Justice Barrett would be a judicial activist, and originalist is the opposite, and Senator Klobuchar proved that point when she brought up Justice Thomas's opinion or it was a concurring opinion in the defamation case with Bill Cosby. And it was basically she thought it was restricting freedom of the press or whatever. But his point was, look, the Constitution doesn't make up a public -- an actual malice standard, so why should we. They are about deconstructing judicial tests and creations not constructing them.

Twitter and Facebook have some serious explaining to do after censoring and blocking people from sharing an explosive New York Post report about Hunter Biden's alleged e-mails and his foreign business dealings. Twitter going as far as suspending the Trump campaign's account and the personal account for White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Twitter's CEO admitting the company screwed up.

You don't have a kid who gets thrown out of the military, he doesn't have a job for a long time.

I am ticked off about COVID because we're not having Halloween and I finally found my Halloween costume which is Hunter Biden. Very easy, shirtless, sunglasses, it's just a little crack pipe hanging out of your lip. I find this funny that we are now calling this like unverified mudslinging as if that matters after the dossier, the Russian collusion scam, the Kavanaugh rape claims. It's interesting, like this guy if he had been helpful, the guy that ran the video store had been helpful to Biden he would be called a whistleblower. Right? But because this is helpful to Trump, he's a nutcase. Right? This is such a weird story. The fact is the media could have done something about this. They could have made some phone calls. Right? Instead of the -- instead of the story now exploding and being about the suppression of a story, it could have been about verifying these e-mails. Let's find out if this is true. I mean, let's face it, they didn't really scrutinize the origins of the tax returns, I don't think Jack at Twitter was worried about that when that story came out but we'll let this happen but it's weird. Biden's camp, their reaction to this is so muted. They haven't demanded a retraction, they haven't said, they haven't tried to disprove this, instead he calls a lid. He retreated under his bed again waiting for his Ovaltine. What is this telling you? It's telling you that this is probably true and it's really easy if you are a journalist, start making phone calls. Call the guy, call the Ukrainian business guy, there are people that can verify e-mails. Why isn't that the story? Too late. Now you guys look like you're running for cover."

And now the FCC is saying we're going to look at rule 230 that allows them the tax world that they live in to be just publishers, that they can just put it out there and not edit it and not tweak it and now that's jeopardized and so is a lot of money."

And first of all, yes, they are bound by regulations as well as their own terms and conditions and there are multiple government agencies that are investigating them actually. But I, you know, the goal of diversion however has been totally achieved. We are talking about big tech and the continued pattern of muting conservative voices rather than those e-mails. But in the notion of against disinformation and misinformation as you've said, I think it's important to remember that four days before this president was inaugurated, then- outgoing Vice President Biden was in Ukraine for the sixth time in seven years. And after Russia invaded Crime Ukraine became a top priority for the Obama administration. And it was basically outsourced for the vice president to handle. And his then foreign policy and defense policy adviser said it was our top priority, always number one or one of the top three and Biden, quote, \"was front and center.\" So, the notion or the concept that these e-mails definitely don't raise at least a question of unethical conflict of interest is utterly false.

      "utterance": "I felt like last night when Jack Dorsey of Twitter put out his statement trying to explain away things and say they didn't have good communications that he was writing Twitter's death sentence. He says we had a communications problem. We have a P.R. problem. Like, believe me, when an executive, a congressman, your boss, whoever says there's a communications problem, 99 percent of the time you actually have a fact problem. And I'm not saying that these issues are not complex. I think that they are. Because I was wondering, you know, let's say that something came to the daily briefing and it was about Don Jr. and it was under this fishy kind of, what, this guy and the e-mails, I wouldn't run it. Now but if it did run, if I were Don Jr's. people, what I'd say, that's unfair. That story is not true, don't spread around. But who is going to be the arbiter of truth? And that gets back to what Mark Zuckerberg told me a year ago, he doesn't think social media companies should be the arbiter of truth. And would have it been better to allow the story out there and for journalists to do what they do which is try to track it down and then the marketplace of ideas on social media, blasted away. Now on the other side think about what the left has tried to do to social media company since 2016. They believe that the social media companies made Donald Trump's election possible because they didn't do enough to fight back against Russian interference. So, Silicon Valley is going to have its day in court, and by that it means the court of public opinion and they're in the Senate. I will mention one other thing. I think what Twitter did was preposterous, just so over-the- top, they do not have a clear policy so they did something they went way overboard. I mean, blocking the Trump campaign's Twitter account?"

They say well, when you see something like this, we're going to get a third party to check, it's going to take a while to check it. In the meantime, we're going to suppress it. I ask for an example. Had they done it before? There was an accusation that antifa was starting the wildfires in Oregon, they suppressed that story until they could the fact check. The fact-check comes back, no, that's not true. That actually seems like, well, that could work. But in a situation like this where you have e-mails that you can't get and a situation where this guy from -- but the story already went around the world 600 times, it's really impossible to see how they could do this to scale and it could happen to any of us."

I would say I have a suggestion for him that he should, during his town hall, have a screen with Biden's town hall going and do a little mystery science theater and comment on things, get people to cut some tape that he can immediately respond to. But he's going to be prepared. It's going to be -- it's going to be a crazy night. But again, it goes back to the sentiment (Ph).

And actually, Republicans are over performing Democrats in Michigan when it comes to mail-in vote. That just means that Democrats are just cannibalizing their election day voting. I don't see all of these mail-in votes as a sign of enthusiasm for Democrats. I see it as a sign of fear for going into the polls and potentially catching coronavirus and that's on them. Fauci said it was totally fine. This week, we are going to look back on this week and see that this is the week that change the dynamic in the campaign. Trump recovered from the virus, went back out and started doing rallies again, Barrett is sailing through, and big tech is interfering and suppressing the vote. The Republican base is very energized. Gallup says the majority of the American people think Trump is going to win, they say that they are better off than they were four years ago. And he's doing rallies. The last rally he had half of the people weren't even Republicans. They were a combination of independents, Democrats and new voters. Things are looking very good for the Trump campaign.

I will say, though, that the messaging from his campaign, it's to be expected, frankly, right. I think if voters feel it's going to be a blowout, then they might stay at home. So, it behooves them to encourage voters to get out there and break a certain tie. But I think it's accurate. And most importantly -- so we know that the final state polls out of 2016 were obviously inaccurate, but especially in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania had Clinton ahead, Trump won all three. And to your point about how Wisconsin and Michigan early voting is actually shows the Republicans ahead, right now, Public Policy shows polls show Biden ahead. Clearly, the Trump voters are being undercounted and given that in those states, especially white over the age of 30, non-college educated voters, those registrations have risen by 10 percent and the Democratic margin have decreased by 10 percent to just six points.

There's like over a million or something out there. And that -- remember, President Trump won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania by very slim margins. If you add a million voters to the rolls and those key battleground states, then you're going to have a lot more question because a newly registered voter is 99 percent likely to vote that year."

Remember, when the Kavanagh stuff come up, after this process, like at this point, like over the next few days, or the counter process, that's when something came up. I have no indication. I don't believe they're going to do anything like that. But just look, don't sleep on it, that might happen. The other thing is that a lot of their outrageousness was already out there. It just became white noise. And I just wanted to point out two examples, for example. So, in the Bork hearings, remember Ted Kennedy speech in which he said that Bork would lead to back-alley abortion, segregated lunch tables, and midnight police raids. In this case, because I guess maybe people are just desensitized to this stuff, Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey argued that Justice Barrett -- that women who have miscarriages could be subject to investigation to ensure they hadn't had an abortion. This is the speech that he gives on the floor. It's egregious. It's inflammatory. But Richard Blumenthal also says that in vitro fertilization could be criminalized under Judge Barrett, even though she says there's nothing in her record, history, or public statements to suggest that's even remotely possible. So, I think we are well past Bork. And I agree with them -- I don't agree with them that it's a sham. When Dick Durbin says, how do we get this all back on track? I mean, two -- you got to have two to tango here."

We have to intellectually acknowledge that if she would have comment on a hypo, and then was confirmed, and before her a case came with one of those issues, half the country would clam her for a certain result, and she'd have to recuse herself, obviously. And the notion that you know, that a judge is neutral and objective, that's what is before them is a closed universe. That's how they remain neutral and objective. And that's why all of these senators attempts to find the chimps in our armor and these decisions, why they kept failing. So, they kept -- they refused to parse out merit issues for procedural and ministerial and whether the plaintiff met the burden. So, when Senator Coons was talking, which I could barely tolerate listening to, and he said that she would be a Justice Barrett would be a judicial activist, and originalist is the opposite, and Senator Klobuchar proved that point when she brought up Justice Thomas's opinion or it was a concurring opinion in the defamation case with Bill Cosby. And it was basically she thought it was restricting freedom of the press or whatever. But his point was, look, the Constitution doesn't make up a public -- an actual malice standard, so why should we. They are about deconstructing judicial tests and creations not constructing them. And final quick point t fastest, most nimble way for social change or protecting and safeguarding minority rights is through legislation. So, all of this misguided responsibility these guys keep placing on a judge's shoulders to do it, it's so misplaced. And all of these expert testimonies, crystal good, it will -- lives will depend on it. No, it doesn't. But it's good she was saying it in front of the lawmakers because that's who needs to hear it."

But it this is a reminder that how much you can give up if you're not thinking about things. And I mean -- I mean, like volunteering and wearing a mask is an important thing. But there's a lot of things that we're just kind of like giving up and going OK, that's cool. You know, maybe we'll get maybe we'll do Christmas. But then we get around Christmas and then no, you're not going to do that. You know, my brother in law passed away last Thursday and three older sisters. Nope, there's going to be no funeral. I'm not going to complain about it because there are thousands of people who missed out on funerals of their loved ones. And it's like -- but you just kind of go OK, pick up the urn. That's what you do. It's great. I mean, we have to start thinking about what, as a country, are we willing to give up."

I understand cases arising for two reasons. One, we use it last month 700,000 a month. We just now are over a million a month in testing. Also, people are going back to work. They're going about their lives. You're going to games, you're going to schools, you're going to see the cases go up, but the deaths have remained below 1,000 daily deaths since August, and that's a good thing with the vaccine around the corner."

I mean, some of them exist, but it's the -- you know, the price point might not be what you would want and the availability. I would tell you, I am pretty even keeled person. I have a lot of anxiety about the economy, a lot. I'm actually frightened, because Congress is now going to go campaign, the President's team has basically said there's nothing more we can do here on a COVID relief bill. They might try to do one in the lame duck. That means December. But you have people, eight million more people now under the poverty line. You have people that are on food stamps now that through no fault of their own, they lost their jobs, and their pride is hurt. And I don't see anybody doing anything to get businesses back. And these business owners, his restaurants have tried so hard to do it outside. It's going to get cold, and people aren't going to be outside with the rain. And I actually, I'm scared for the first time in a long time. I'm worried about the economy and I really wish that Congress and the President could get together and get it done."

I think, in fact, we have to be concerned, especially if Thanksgiving means you're getting together with elderly parents or grandparents. You don't want to put people at risk unnecessarily. And what I see is that the numbers in Europe are now rising to the point they're talking about the second wave and numbers are rising in this country in terms of infection, even going to the ballgame, you know, Nick Saban? I mean, you know, you see they're canceling games now. So, I just -- I think we should not cast it as oh, someone's forcing you to do something rather than someone's looking out for you."

Take a look at this vulture as it guides paragliders through the mountains of southern Spain. As you see, the vulture is leading them on the best airstream for a smooth flight through the mountains. You should know the bird has been trained to do this. British paraglider instructor Scott Mason calls it para-hawking. The bird is rewarded with meat. Para-hawking now a tourist attraction in Asia, parts of Europe. The whole thing reminds me, Jesse, of a movie Avatar in which the heroes rode birds into Combat. I did this at an amusement park with the grandkids before the virus."
