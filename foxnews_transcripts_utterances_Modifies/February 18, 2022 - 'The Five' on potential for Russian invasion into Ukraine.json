      "sentences": "Well, Jesse, I think first of all, I need to level set with the conversation I've just been listening too. What we are listening right now is not something that just changed in the last 24 hours. If you go back to notes that I've been sending out for the last two weeks, this is something we've been watching in terms of you have commercial satellite imagery, you have the buildup of forces, the type of forces, the number of forces, things that we have been told in advance to look for in terms of some of the disinformation that is already starting to appear, the false flag operations in the Donbas region. All of that is ticking up. This is something that through a web of intelligence sources, as well as the com -- the surveillance imagery that you can see with your own eyes. This is something that has been accept -- it has been expected. They have been watching it very closely, and they feel that they are now in the final hours and days in which there is still a small possibility to try to get Putin to accept the off-ramp of diplomacy. But as you heard from President Biden, and it is extremely significant, what he just said in terms of from his point of view, Putin has already made a decision. That coincides with what I am hearing here at the pentagon, from western intelligence sources, from western allies, this is a very different situation than I've heard the comparisons to the Iraq war, WMD, how do we know. We are seeing it with our own eyes. If you can't look at the kind of Iskander missile battalions that are now in Belarus, 30,000 Russian troops there. The kind -- half of his air force has now been deployed toward Ukraine. I am told just moments ago from a senior defense official that 40 percent of his 190,000 troops who are on the border with Ukraine are now in attack positions, that is something we have been waiting for. They were in those barracks. They are now moving into assault positions. They could move in a matter of hours or days. And this is something that needs to be watched closely. This is not some backwater, this is Europe, this is one of the largest military actions being threatened to redraw the map of Europe since World War II. It's going to be bloody. We've heard estimates that 50,000 civilians will be killed, one to five million refugees will be sent on the road. The level of destruction and the bloodiness of this invasion, if it moves forward, and again, they are doing what they can to try and get Lavrov and Blinken to meet and to say that if there is an invasion before that meeting on Wednesday, that then those sanctions and everything else goes into place, and we're in a whole different world at that point. But right now, every American should be watching this and knowing that this is deadly serious. This is not some wag the dog situation, to even mention the Durham probe in the same sentence as what we just -- what we know, and what we can see with our own eyes in terms of the military buildup and knowing what Vladimir Putin is capable of. I served in Moscow from 1996 to '99. I watched as Vladimir Putin rose. I remember the apartment blocks that were blown up by his KGB, his FSB as a pretext to go into Chechnya. Go look at those images of Chechnya and how carpet bombed, Chechnya was, when the Russian military moves in. This is not a precision small, pinpointed strike. This will be the full weight of the Russian military going into Ukraine if someone doesn't stop it in the coming days.",

      "utterance": "Well, Jesse, I think first of all, I need to level set with the conversation I've just been listening too. What we are listening right now is not something that just changed in the last 24 hours. If you go back to notes that I've been sending out for the last two weeks, this is something we've been watching in terms of you have commercial satellite imagery, you have the buildup of forces, the type of forces, the number of forces, things that we have been told in advance to look for in terms of some of the disinformation that is already starting to appear, the false flag operations in the Donbas region. All of that is ticking up. This is something that through a web of intelligence sources, as well as the com -- the surveillance imagery that you can see with your own eyes. This is something that has been accept -- it has been expected. They have been watching it very closely, and they feel that they are now in the final hours and days in which there is still a small possibility to try to get Putin to accept the off-ramp of diplomacy. But as you heard from President Biden, and it is extremely significant, what he just said in terms of from his point of view, Putin has already made a decision. That coincides with what I am hearing here at the pentagon, from western intelligence sources, from western allies, this is a very different situation than I've heard the comparisons to the Iraq war, WMD, how do we know. We are seeing it with our own eyes. If you can't look at the kind of Iskander missile battalions that are now in Belarus, 30,000 Russian troops there. The kind -- half of his air force has now been deployed toward Ukraine. I am told just moments ago from a senior defense official that 40 percent of his 190,000 troops who are on the border with Ukraine are now in attack positions, that is something we have been waiting for. They were in those barracks. They are now moving into assault positions. They could move in a matter of hours or days. And this is something that needs to be watched closely. This is not some backwater, this is Europe, this is one of the largest military actions being threatened to redraw the map of Europe since World War II. It's going to be bloody. We've heard estimates that 50,000 civilians will be killed, one to five million refugees will be sent on the road. The level of destruction and the bloodiness of this invasion, if it moves forward, and again, they are doing what they can to try and get Lavrov and Blinken to meet and to say that if there is an invasion before that meeting on Wednesday, that then those sanctions and everything else goes into place, and we're in a whole different world at that point. But right now, every American should be watching this and knowing that this is deadly serious. This is not some wag the dog situation, to even mention the Durham probe in the same sentence as what we just -- what we know, and what we can see with our own eyes in terms of the military buildup and knowing what Vladimir Putin is capable of. I served in Moscow from 1996 to '99. I watched as Vladimir Putin rose. I remember the apartment blocks that were blown up by his KGB, his FSB as a pretext to go into Chechnya. Go look at those images of Chechnya and how carpet bombed, Chechnya was, when the Russian military moves in. This is not a precision small, pinpointed strike. This will be the full weight of the Russian military going into Ukraine if someone doesn't stop it in the coming days."

I don't think they would. So, I go back to why are we the ones running point on this, and why are people so excited at this prospect? You know, look, what happen in Afghanistan? I'm not just talking about the botched withdrawal, and you know, to the point you made earlier, the bad intelligence on the withdraw and how quickly that country would collapse. Why are we now trusting the exact same intelligence apparatus to give us information here when the president can't say it plainly? So, yes, I do, I share a lot of distrust, we have been lied to repeatedly by the Department of Defense about Afghanistan for decades.

And it's a sad thing to see because she just wanted everybody to come together and show respect for each other and she thought this could've been handled much differently. And she was pleading for the prime minister to just kind of do what leaders do commit and bring everybody together and stop dividing everybody. And ultimately, the mandates are the most divisive thing. We've seen it here in this country and now up there, they are divisive and you've got to get rid of them. He should've had a maple syrup summit. He should've have brought everybody together. How easy would it have been for him to say, you know what, guys, we're going to pause the mandate for 14 days, let's get together, you guys leave, open the bridge, let's sit down have a little dinner, it may be some waffles, and then we'll straighten everything out. At least it would have gotten people off the edge a little bit. But he didn't do that. He went full mow on them. And now look at what we have.

Listen, I think a lot of people in the beginning of the pandemic were kind of excited about staying home, the remote thing, they got a little -- set up an office in their house. It was neat, it was fun, it was different. And now, people are getting sick of their spouses and their spouses are getting sick of them. Guys want to get back to the office, they want some action. The women want to get back to the office, they want action too, or they want to stay home and get the husband back to the office so they can have some peace. We just got bored, it got a little tedious and we're ready to go. And even Democrats are ready to go. But here's the problem. Most of Democrats don't want to move on, but the rest of the country does. So, the government has to realize there have to govern for everybody. They can't just govern their own party.

And it has activated a group of voters who before had nothing in common and many of them were apolitical. They're the ultimate swing voters in the upcoming midterm, and that's parents.

And her mom Brittany (INAUDIBLE) says Amelia was glued to the screen while the father got ready for work. So, even though he was running late, he danced with her. But the clip was a memory for me. So I couldn't help her pull up this picture of my daughter, who -- this is my daughter Kiki, who's now a lawyer. She doesn't look like that anymore. And she used to sing and dance to Beauty and the Beast with me. And so, my very own daughter was a -- it's a huge memory for me down memory lane. And that's all I have to say."

So, she convinced her sister Amber to mail a snowman over 800 miles from Kentucky to surprise her students. They named the snowman Lucky for making it to Florida without melting. The school -- the snowman lives in the school's cafeteria freezer. And when he melts, Robin will use the water to plant a garden at her school to show her students how everything come full circle."
