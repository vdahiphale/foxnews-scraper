This was the scene Sunday afternoon when the driver of a red SUV plowed into a parade in Wisconsin, killing five people, injuring 48 others, the SUV striking people marching in the parade, as well as those gathered on the sidelines. Police have identified the suspect is 39-year-old Darrell Brooks. He has been released on -- he had been released rather on bail just prior to the incident. Police say he was involved in a domestic dispute prior to the crash. Welcome everyone.

Walk us through now the process of the charges, evaluating it all. And considering the backdrop here, this man just released on bail November 11, for just $1,000, a very similar situation.

There has to be two investigations that occur here, one documenting exactly what happened, finding out if there's any previous thoughts, search warrants on his computer and phones to see if he had known about the parade, had thought about it, or this was just, after he engaged in what was alleged to be another domestic assault, decided to maybe engage law enforcement in a highly dangerous situation where law enforcement would respond with deadly force, and a suicide by cop situation. It's clear that there was a direct attack on the folks in the parade route. It was unnecessary. And we shouldn't be talking about him being involved in another domestic situation. The original situation where his domestic relation was run over, and tire marks were found on her leg, he should have been held in custody. If he was released, it should have been all kinds of terms, with probation checking in, GPS location on him. And he shouldn't have been allowed to reoffend again. So, the investigation has to document what happened that day and put all the evidence together to hold him accountable for yesterday's attack. At the same time, we have to look at how the system failed the community and allowed this individual to be behind the wheel of a vehicle that he could mow down people in the community who were trying to enjoy a holiday celebration.",

It's just one of these things that shocks the nation to believe that our system won't protect us from the sort of repeat offenders over and over again. And I hear what you're saying with respect to separating these two cases. What would be the difference? I mean, you talked about him checking his searches and whether it was intentional or not. If it was spur of the moment, it's such a heinous crime, what would be the difference anyway with respect to the charges, and ultimately maybe him never having to -- the public never having to deal with him again?",

At the same time, we need to figure out how he slipped through the cracks going on here. All of the history we have seen so far is combative, resisting arrest. Those are all things that should be telling a judge, telling a prosecutor that this is somebody that doesn't belong to be on the streets of Wisconsin, and needs to be held in custody until they can comport to the rules of civil society. And the signs were there. And, unfortunately, we have had a groundswell to try and get rid of people held in bail, and we want to get rid of and not prosecute violent crimes. Domestic violence is a violent crime. Domestic violence is a violent crime by individuals who are probably going to take it to the next level if they have to engage law enforcement.

When does the sympathy goes for the people who've been involved with domestic disputes, whether with him or others who have been multiple offenders? This isn't one offense. It's just shocking. It really is mind-boggling that we don't have a wakeup call in this country to push back and keep the nation safe. This is -- just one final thing.

That's why the prices of poultry and beef and pork are up. It's because there's a bottleneck and a lack of competition with those processors.

The administration is arguing that turkeys are only going to cost American families about $1 more this year than they did before, the overall Thanksgiving meal, the basic items that you would expect to get for that, it's going to be about a 5 percent increase in costs, that's the number that they're providing, than it was last year.

Witnesses say there were as many as 80 people wearing masks and carrying crowbars and hammers. Three people were arrested, including a suspect with a gun. Two employees were assaulted. One was pepper-sprayed. The looting here coming a day after thieves hit a dozen stores in San Francisco, including Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Bloomingdale's, stealing a million dollars' worth of clothing, jewelry, handbags and other goods the thieves know will sell quickly online. Police were on site within minutes. They managed to stop at least one of the getaway cars and arrest eight people. They also seized several firearms. Investigators are sifting through surveillance video and say they are confident more arrests will be made. Organized retail crime in San Francisco has only gotten worse, despite the viral videos and recent closures of CVS and Walgreens stores, where shoplifters clear out shelves every single day. Critics say nothing will change without vigorous prosecutions and the repeal of a state law that classifies theft of under $950 as a misdemeanor. There were two other major looting incidents just last night, and all of this very deliberate in terms of the timing, Charles, because all of these stolen goods will be marked down and sold online just in time for Black Friday.

But we are seeing some good news today. So, TSA tweeting earlier today, saying that 93 percent of their work force has been vaccinated -- has been COVID-compliant with this vaccine mandate. As for those that aren't compliant, TSA telling FOX Business that unvaccinated employees will be educated on the vaccine, and for the time being will still be paid and able to work. So, despite today being the deadline, unvaccinated workers are still on the job. Now, it's important because TSA expects to screen around 20 million travelers this Thanksgiving week.

Walk us through now the process of the charges, evaluating it all. And considering the backdrop here, this man just released on bail November 11, for just $1,000, a very similar situation.

There has to be two investigations that occur here, one documenting exactly what happened, finding out if there's any previous thoughts, search warrants on his computer and phones to see if he had known about the parade, had thought about it, or this was just, after he engaged in what was alleged to be another domestic assault, decided to maybe engage law enforcement in a highly dangerous situation where law enforcement would respond with deadly force, and a suicide by cop situation. It's clear that there was a direct attack on the folks in the parade route. It was unnecessary. And we shouldn't be talking about him being involved in another domestic situation. The original situation where his domestic relation was run over, and tire marks were found on her leg, he should have been held in custody. If he was released, it should have been all kinds of terms, with probation checking in, GPS location on him. And he shouldn't have been allowed to reoffend again. So, the investigation has to document what happened that day and put all the evidence together to hold him accountable for yesterday's attack.

It's just one of these things that shocks the nation to believe that our system won't protect us from the sort of repeat offenders over and over again. And I hear what you're saying with respect to separating these two cases. What would be the difference? I mean, you talked about him checking his searches and whether it was intentional or not. If it was spur of the moment, it's such a heinous crime, what would be the difference anyway with respect to the charges, and ultimately maybe him never having to -- the public never having to deal with him again?"

And even that, we might have that here. But we want to find out, if we can, what was going on in the background behind. At the same time, we need to figure out how he slipped through the cracks going on here. All of the history we have seen so far is combative, resisting arrest. Those are all things that should be telling a judge, telling a prosecutor that this is somebody that doesn't belong to be on the streets of Wisconsin, and needs to be held in custody until they can comport to the rules of civil society. And the signs were there. And, unfortunately, we have had a groundswell to try and get rid of people held in bail, and we want to get rid of and not prosecute violent crimes. Domestic violence is a violent crime. Domestic violence is a violent crime by individuals who are probably going to take it to the next level if they have to engage law enforcement. So the victim was in danger the minute this person got out on bail, and, as such, the entire community was in danger."

When does the sympathy goes for the people who've been involved with domestic disputes, whether with him or others who have been multiple offenders? This isn't one offense. It's just shocking. It really is mind-boggling that we don't have a wakeup call in this country to push back and keep the nation safe. This is -- just one final thing.

That's why the prices of poultry and beef and pork are up. It's because there's a bottleneck and a lack of competition with those processors.

I think that this administration has made some really bad gambits in terms of finger-pointing, from the Afghanistan withdrawal, to the vaccination, fumbling some of that and these mandates. And I think -- listen, obviously, the White House is looking at these poll numbers. I mean, if you look at Gallup's right now, we are in tremendous economic anxiety in this country. It's going to be pretty dangerous that they tried to say this is all on business. Should they take any accountability at all, you think, tomorrow? Should we expect that?"

And so -- but when you talk about inflation, and what we can expect tomorrow, the recent messaging that we have heard from this White House has essentially been that inflation isn't as bad as Americans perceive it to be. The administration is arguing that turkeys are only going to cost American families about $1 more this year than they did before, the overall Thanksgiving meal, the basic items that you would expect to get for that, it's going to be about a 5 percent increase in costs, that's the number that they're providing, than it was last year. So even though the feeling of inflation, expensiveness of goods might feel like more than that, they're trying to tell American, look, it's not really as bad as you perceive it to be. And I would expect to hear more talk like that from the president tomorrow."

And we know -- you and I both know Jerome Powell has wanted to be -- quote, unquote -- \"accommodative.\" That means keep the market going and keep money flowing. But inflation has been a beast. And so far, he has been able to hide behind the second mandate of employment. But many people believe it's -- we're at a crisis now, he needs to take -- start to step up."

We are still missing several million individuals from the labor force.

So I think there's a piece of relief there for the markets. I think also the fact that one thing President Biden does have his finger on the pulse on is, the market really needs continuity right now. There is still a lot of uncertainty, whether it's the new COVID outbreaks, whether it's getting a handle on the supply chain, whether it's understanding this unemployment mystery. And having change at the helm of the Fed now just wasn't right -- the right time at all. So I think this is the right decision. And I think the market is breathing a sigh of relief."

Last week, the chief economist at the Labor Department shot across the bow -- took a shot across about the Federal Reserve, saying, we want you to keep pumping, do not hit the brakes, that we don't care necessarily about inflation, because we care about unemployment, which is kind of odd, because if they would just pull back on the free money, they would get people to go to work and inflation would come down. Needless to say, this administration is pretty clear when it comes to printing money. They want to see Jay Powell continue to press the pedal, continue to keep money out there, continue to keep free money out there. And do you think, even though he will have some sort of freedom, he won't have the pressure of worrying about being renominated again, that he will feel beholden to the administration, to the president to keep doing that as much as possible?"

We saw under the Trump administration there was a lot of pressure put on Jay Powell at points, and he didn't yield. I don't think he's going to this administration. Not only that. I do think the fact is that President Biden is trying to put other levers, whether it's looking at oil reserves, whether it's looking to address lack of full employment through his social welfare measures.

We're nowhere near capacity. Be that as it may, what kind of an impact would it have on gasoline prices a month from now? We know, maybe short term, it would have an impact. But would it be just mostly for public relations consumption? I mean, this would not change the course of where crude oil is and certainly where gasoline is over the next two months or so."

And I do think the administration is trying to keep gas prices away from that mark. I think one of the most interesting things about the global discussions to try to control oil prices, the U.S. is reaching out to Japan and to China and to India to try and have a coordinated approach, so that if OPEC continues to pursue a pathway where there may be upward pressure on all prices in this inflationary time, this would be a counter."

Now, the most brazen of these attacks happened at this Nordstrom here behind me, happened Saturday night. Dozens of robbers in masks could be seen flooding into the street after ransacking this store, carrying thousands of dollars in merchandise to a line of cars just waiting there at the curb, their escape routes well-planned. Witnesses say there were as many as 80 people wearing masks and carrying crowbars and hammers. Three people were arrested, including a suspect with a gun. Two employees were assaulted. One was pepper-sprayed. The looting here coming a day after thieves hit a dozen stores in San Francisco, including Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Bloomingdale's, stealing a million dollars' worth of clothing, jewelry, handbags and other goods the thieves know will sell quickly online. Police were on site within minutes. They managed to stop at least one of the getaway cars and arrest eight people. They also seized several firearms. Investigators are sifting through surveillance video and say they are confident more arrests will be made. Organized retail crime in San Francisco has only gotten worse, despite the viral videos and recent closures of CVS and Walgreens stores, where shoplifters clear out shelves every single day. Critics say nothing will change without vigorous prosecutions and the repeal of a state law that classifies theft of under $950 as a misdemeanor. There were two other major looting incidents just last night, and all of this very deliberate in terms of the timing, Charles, because all of these stolen goods will be marked down and sold online just in time for Black Friday. So, on top of the COVID closures and the supply chain issues, this is just a one-two-three punch for retailers -- back to you."

They're becoming a little more violent, and they're becoming more dangerous, carrying the guns and the crowbars. And so they're ready to do business if they have to live with anybody that tries to stop them. But you can blame your politicians, especially Governor Newsom in that state. He steps up to the microphone today and he starts telling everybody about the steps he's taken to combat this. But it's a day late, dollar short for him, because he allowed it to go on so long that they are so emboldened that they know, until things change within the DA's office and there's proper prosecution for this, it's going to continue."

And it feels like those are getting actually worse, more lax. And we started the show with someone who had a rap sheet from here to out of this window who got -- who paid a $1,000 bail on something that he shouldn't have even been offered bail at all. So, how do we get politicians to say, let's rewrite the rules? Let's keep the bad people in prison for a long, long time. Let's discourage these sort of organized things, to your point, several handguns there and using physical intimidation.

And the housing -- existing home sales are actually up 0.8 percent, for a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.34 million units. And part of that growth is attributed to investors entering the market. But it's become very difficult for first-time homebuyers to compete with these investors because these investors are paying cash."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "And the reason these investors are actually entering the market is because rental prices are skyrocketing."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "And so there's plenty of evidence as well that first-time homebuyers are actually purchasing less. They -- the numbers just came out, and 29 percent of the first-time homebuyers this year, and then the year prior to that, it was 32 percent first-time homebuyers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "And, historically, that number is about 40 percent. So -- but we're seeing the real estate market around the country continuing to remain strong. And I don't see that changing anytime soon, Charles."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "People, though -- and I read through the report. Obviously, the sales are up. Prices are through the roof almost every single report. I can't remember the last report where the price actually went down, because those large deep-pocketed folks you are talking about, those professional investors, a lot of big Wall Street firms, they're paying well over asking price, knowing they can get it back as a rental property. But, still, a lot of people I know want to own a home. And one thing that's different about this housing rally than before, right before the Great Recession, is the credit scores are so high. I mean, it really is tough, if you don't have pristine credit and a lot of money to put down, isn't it, to get involved and own a house right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "Well, it is. But the market is very different than it was years ago. For instance, we have a 2.4-month supply right now. And a healthy market is between five to six months. So, first-time homebuyers have a difficult time because there isn't enough supply in the market. So that's why prices are rising. And then investors are coming in and they're paying cash. And mortgage rates are still relatively low, historically speaking, but it's become more difficult to get a mortgage. But first-time homebuyers are having a challenging time."

    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "Now, the luxury market is completely different, because that's actually risen by over 31 percent. So it's really -- it really changes depending on the price category, because homes under $250,000 actually fell, whereas everything above that really increased this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "And we're set to really -- I mean, we're -- the numbers are just absolutely insane, Charles, as you mentioned, so -- and I really, truly believe that people are using real estate to hedge against inflation. COVID has really created just an awareness of the importance of life. People want to be around family."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "We have seen a major exodus out of these major cities. I think, when COVID first hit, people were wondering, do I want to live in a 30-story building and not know who just touched those elevator buttons? Also, though, the advent of working from home, it's pushing this whole thing away from cities, right? Are you seeing prices go up, like, even further deeper into the suburbs than maybe you have seen before?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. People want more land. They want a home office. They actually want space for their children. They want homeschooling areas. And so you're beginning to see a migration really where people want a better quality of life. They don't want to be in condos as much as single-family homes, which is why, when people ask me about the real estate market, it's really completely different when you're dealing with single-family homes, as opposed to condos."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },

      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "They're two completely different animals. And the single-family home market is also having challenging times because of the supply chain issues. That's something that we haven't discussed yet. Homebuilders are very bullish. They want to go into the market, but they still have a difficult time getting these supplies."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPINS",
      "utterance": "But I think, overall, the builders are going to continue to remain bullish, and buyers will just have to wait a longer time for those homes to be delivered."

This comes as today is the deadline for TSA workers to get vaccinated. FOX Business correspondent Madison Alworth is live at Newark Airport with how all of this may impact your Thanksgiving travel -- Madison."

      "speaker": "MADISON ALWORTH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Charles. Like you mentioned, we are seeing busier lines, the busiest TSA lines that we have seen since the start of the pandemic, all of this happening as we enter into that busy Thanksgiving travel week, coinciding today with the vaccine deadline for those TSA employees. That's tens of thousands of workers that need to be vaccinated across the U.S. Leading up to this deadline, there were concerns that it might result in delayed lines and poorer service. But we are seeing some good news today. So, TSA tweeting earlier today, saying that 93 percent of their work force has been vaccinated -- has been COVID-compliant with this vaccine mandate. As for those that aren't compliant, TSA telling FOX Business that unvaccinated employees will be educated on the vaccine, and for the time being will still be paid and able to work. So, despite today being the deadline, unvaccinated workers are still on the job. Now, it's important because TSA expects to screen around 20 million travelers this Thanksgiving week. Because of that, they are recommending that people arrive at least two hours before their flight. Travelers have experienced delays and aren't taking any risks."

      "utterance": "Madison, thank you very much. Once you navigate this hectic travel to your Thanksgiving destination, what do you need to know to gather safely, as a lot of states are now seeing upticks in COVID cases? I'm going to bring in Dr. Marty Makary, Johns Hopkins University medical professor, also FOX News medical contributor. Dr. Makary, we're seeing cases spike up here, in fact, the CDC saying that seven-day average now 92,000. That's up 18 percent. It was only 70,000 about a week or so ago. So, people are concerned. What safety measures should they take?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. MARTY MAKARY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Charles, you're right. It's getting cold. People are going indoors. And there's still a group of people in the United States with no immunity whatsoever. We need to recognize, first of all, that the risk is heavily concentrated in the people who are still getting hospitalized. That is adults with a risk factor like obesity, something we don't talk much about, that have no immunity, no natural or vaccinated immunity. And -- but, for everybody else, I would not be afraid. I would not hold back. People need to make human connection after almost two years of losing that human connection. And, remember, the risk of a breakthrough hospitalization is low. If we use the CDC number, it's one in 26,000. And that one out of 26,000 has an average age of 73. And an average age of dying of a breakthrough infection is 80."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right, of course, and people are eager to get together. I got to tell you, every time I have something at the house, more and more people show up. I had my nephew's birthday over the weekend, but a lot of people showing up in Europe over the weekend over these vaccine -- some of these mandates over there. I mean, some of these protests got violent. Austria has actually implemented a full lockdown. Germany said they're worried they're going to run out ICU beds. It's like what we were thinking about or seeing about last year. And Germany and the rest of Europe got very high marks with respect to how they were handling all this. So how did they get back to this situation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, their population immunity levels are lower on both -- on both ways in which you drive population immunity. Their 'vaccination rates have been lower, and their natural immunity rates have been lower. And so Europe is dealing with a hard time right now. Now, they have lower rates of comorbidity in general. So that's in their favor, but the case numbers are going high as it gets cold there. Also, they're looking at Sweden. Turns out that Sweden's got a lower death per population rate than many countries in the world. And, right now, they're recognizing that, hey, this indiscriminate lockdown everybody strategy is not the right strategy. The data have come in now. And that's why you're seeing tens of thousands of people protest today in Brussels in Belgium."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, of course, Sweden was the one that was doing it wrong, and, to your point, maybe not so in the after -- in the -- afterwards. We will see. Meanwhile, it's always great talking to you, Doc. We will see you again real soon. Meanwhile, that does it for us here, but you will see me tomorrow 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. Also, make sure you catch me on \"Making Money\" weekdays 2:00 p.m. Eastern on the FOX Business Network. It's a big week for the stock market. But, right now, \"The Five\" starts. See you tomorrow."
