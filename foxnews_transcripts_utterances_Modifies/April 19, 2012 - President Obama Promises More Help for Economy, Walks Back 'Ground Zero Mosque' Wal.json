This is of course after some bad numbers last week, specifically the Commerce Department downgrading -- or revising -- the GDP, the gross domestic product, for the second quarter from 2.4 percent, revising it down to 1.6 percent. Pretty anemic grown, still growing, but pretty small. And that is raising some questions about what is next and what is the White House going to do. Let's bring in our panel, Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.  OK, Fred, there was a lot of talk by the president today about the Senate bill, the small business bill, they're calling it. We heard from Doug Holtz Eakin about the size of it.

When you lose Olympia Snowe, you're gone. And so all they have to do is remove the lending facility and the tax breaks will get through right away. That may not make Harry Reid happy or President Obama, but look, it's not going to do much in the short run. There is a perfect example out there in world of what has worked so much better than what the president has done. And that example is called Germany. And we know what Germany did. What Germany did was reduce their unemployment benefits for one thing. They cut spending and cut their deficit and they loosened up on the labor market, on hiring and firing and so on, which is very strict in Europe.   And what happened? In the second quarter, 9 percent growth, unemployment is down to I think 7.6 percent. Compare that to the Obama administration that did the opposite of all of those things. And what do we get here -- 9.5 percent unemployment, 1.6 percent of growth. And the ultimate embarrassment may be, and I think this will happen, you know the so-called Summer of Recovery will probably wind up with net loss of jobs in June, July, and August, a net loss of jobs in the Obama administration so-called Summer of Recovery.",

I mean I can imagine some kind of package of a payroll tax holiday and something else to entice Republicans on board.

      "sentences": "Look, it may be a place- holder, but it's classic Obama. First of all, it's about targeting tax cuts. What he's saying is -- this is how liberals operate. You raise the rates across the board and then the government will deign to return some of the money on a targeted tax cut. Meaning: If you do exactly as they say, which means, for example, if they favor, say, high-tech investment and they'll give you a cut on capital gains and you have a business in which you don't need that, but you need to spend on marketing, the government thinks it know how to redirect your capital in a superior way.  So that's number one, it's a classic liberal way to operate, whereas Republicans want lower rates across the board and eliminate the targeting of the tax cuts as you had in the '86 tax bill, the Reagan- Bradley bill.   But secondly, what you've got is the way that Obama dealt with this, he said Republicans have to consider whether they want to act in the national interest or pursue political interest in November. This is how he treats every issue. He never will credit the sincerity or the logic of an opposition argument. In this case, I think the bill is small, insignificant and will hurt the economy, but he won't even recognize that. It's only he stands in favor of the national interest and Republicans are always acting out of a partisan basis. It's an appalling way to make arguments, but he does it on every single issue.",

At the beginning remember, at the dinner held, I think, a week ago Friday, to a Muslim audience he had said he supports the mosque. It was understood as a support of the mosque. Later, a day later, after there was a lot of reaction against that, he said he wasn't speaking about the wisdom, only about the defending rights.   Now it looks as if -- what we heard today in this statement -- it looks as if politically he decided he's been placed in camp of supporters of the mosque one way or another, despite his alleged ambivalence or agnosticism on the issue or whether it's wise or not. So he might as well jump in whole hog and he gave the impression of again supporting it. This is a guy who has been generous in giving advice of wisdom, everybody from the Cambridge police to the Honduran supreme court, so it's is odd that on this issue he husbands his idea about the wisdom and the mosque.

He's going to, you know, tell Congress to pass them when they come back. I would just say that this speech today and the Gibbs briefing had the feel of a placeholder; he doesn't have a whole lot of time to come up with something kind of big and bold that could pass and that's going to be pretty hard, and that will actually have an effect in the short term. I mean I can imagine some kind of package of a payroll tax holiday and something else to entice Republicans on board. But right now, this has the look and feel of a lot of other speeches he has given which is a small, narrowly targeted bill being held up by Republicans in the Senate, and he is out there asking them to drop their opposition."

      "speaker": "First of all, it's about targeting tax cuts. What he's saying is -- this is how liberals operate. You raise the rates across the board and then the government will deign to return some of the money on a targeted tax cut. Meaning",
      "utterance": "If you do exactly as they say, which means, for example, if they favor, say, high-tech investment and they'll give you a cut on capital gains and you have a business in which you don't need that, but you need to spend on marketing, the government thinks it know how to redirect your capital in a superior way. So that's number one, it's a classic liberal way to operate, whereas Republicans want lower rates across the board and eliminate the targeting of the tax cuts as you had in the '86 tax bill, the Reagan- Bradley bill. But secondly, what you've got is the way that Obama dealt with this, he said Republicans have to consider whether they want to act in the national interest or pursue political interest in November. This is how he treats every issue. He never will credit the sincerity or the logic of an opposition argument. In this case, I think the bill is small, insignificant and will hurt the economy, but he won't even recognize that. It's only he stands in favor of the national interest and Republicans are always acting out of a partisan basis. It's an appalling way to make arguments, but he does it on every single issue."

But for the next two years, I think we need to keep those tax cuts in place. The economy has not recovered sufficiently enough and we're going to keep them in place. I think you would see a boom in the stock market for one thing, the economy would improve. Obama would become more popular. It would have many, many benefits for the economy and for President Obama himself and maybe even for Democrats running for office. But he is too ideologically rigid that he can't go there."

Not coming out definitively for the wisdom of that site, about talking about the Constitution and the rights there. Meantime, the spiritual leader of that development, Imam Feisal Rauf, continued his State Department goodwill tour of the Middle East. In an interview with an Abu Dhabi newspaper, he blamed the whole controversy on politics, saying there is no doubt that election season has had a major impact on nature of the discourse and said the critics are only a tiny, vociferous minority. We're back with the panel. Charles, what about the president's statement and this whole deal?"
    },

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "The last statement that we heard from Rauf is false. We would have had exactly the same tempest argument or anger had it happened in mid-June or January. It's not election related. It's a dodge. On the president, I think he is walking back his walk-back. At the beginning remember, at the dinner held, I think, a week ago Friday, to a Muslim audience he had said he supports the mosque. It was understood as a support of the mosque. Later, a day later, after there was a lot of reaction against that, he said he wasn't speaking about the wisdom, only about the defending rights. Now it looks as if -- what we heard today in this statement -- it looks as if politically he decided he's been placed in camp of supporters of the mosque one way or another, despite his alleged ambivalence or agnosticism on the issue or whether it's wise or not. So he might as well jump in whole hog and he gave the impression of again supporting it. This is a guy who has been generous in giving advice of wisdom, everybody from the Cambridge police to the Honduran supreme court, so it's is odd that on this issue he husbands his idea about the wisdom and the mosque. He might have been asked about that. It's a pity he wasn't."

    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Right, but critics of the project do have a responsibility to say where in Manhattan it would be OK, because there is a mosque four blocks from Ground Zero, currently. Would they like that one moved? If it's just the location, and it's not the fact that a mosque is being built, where would it be OK? I mean does it have to be on Staten Island? Does it have to be on the Upper West Side? Where would it be OK? Because there have been other anti-mosque demonstrations elsewhere around the country that are very far from Ground Zero. So I think it's important for the people against this to be extremely clear about exactly what they're against."

First of all, if you are going to wade into this controversy, like Charles said, you might as well embrace it and go for it all the way. I think for him to say the day after the Iftar dinner that oh no, I wasn't really talking about the wisdom of doing this, I think, kind of made him look weak. And I think that they thought better -- the White House thought better of that, and that's why he wants to say no, I was clear on this."

In fact, the founders of the mosque have explicitly said they chose it because of the proximity. They wanted it to be a statement about the attack on the World Trade Center."
