Hundreds of thousands more green cards, all backed by Big Tech like Facebook and Microsoft. Silicon Valley doesn't want to hire American, they want to hire foreign nationals on the cheap.

A smoking gun e-mail released shows Biden ordered the planes out of Afghanistan to be filled to excess with refugees, not caring if they weren't vetted. Just fill them up and bring them over so the planes look packed for the cameras. There is even another hostage crisis besides Afghanistan. Haitian bandits took 16 U.S. citizens hostage. Joe Biden hasn't even mentioned it. Just a few miles off our shores and they sit there languishing. The media covered up two hostage crises. It's got to be hard to be that corrupt. These countries take Americans hostage and we give their people amnesty. Now, an Afghan evacuee was just charged with raping a woman in Montana.

But you know, it's a disappointment in one way, but it also gives me a little reassurance that, you know, I've talked about the money issue for a long time, and you know, I had this wild theory about money. If you put too much of it, it will lose value and this will hurt the middle class, and of course, everybody laughed at that. But it's something that people will wake up on after a time, as long as they think they're getting a benefit. You know, the big thing that bothers me about all this corruption right now, I think everybody is starting to recognize it and that's good news. But the corruption -- the corruption is worse than it was when I first went to Congress in the 70s. So it is definitely, you know, a lot worse. But what really bothers me why I think this is so dangerous, there is no shame, no shame whatsoever. It used to be and I met two people in Congress over those 30 years, who actually said, \"You know, I made a mistake. I wished I hadn't done that.\" But no, right now, when you -- can you think of a President who ever made a mistake and lives were at stake and people died and people lost their jobs, and people went bankrupt, and all these kind of thing. People had stupid policies that paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to invite people into our country and become legal citizens. And you know, they don't lose shame on that. They don't -- they don't pay - - they're not shameful about it. They don't believe there's anything wrong. So, it's the set of standards of right and wrong, good and bad and evil and what you should be if you're a public servant, representing the people, that's where the problem is. So yes, all the things that you talked about, they are absolutely true and they are scary. But the big picture is this understanding about what morality is all about.

They cover up all the corruption because they are in on the corruption. And speaking of corruption, I want to talk to you about this new thing. You just mentioned it, Joe Biden is considering paying -- paying illegal immigrants who were briefly separated at the border $450,000.00. To round, a million dollars per family. And this is more than American families get when their sons or husbands are killed in action overseas defending our country.

But that -- this is an indication of how governments spend money that they don't have and then what they rely on his corrupt counterfeit machine that they have over to the Federal Reserve, and then they print at will, and then they wonder why we have a problem. You know, Facebook the other day -- this one blows my mind -- Facebook was having, you know, a little bit of PR problems and their stock was going down a billion here and a billion there.

Kelsey, this is just disturbing, and I'm not like a square guy or anything like this. But even for me, this is way too much.",

Independent Women's Voice thought it was important enough that parents see these images for themselves. And so we produced an ad, tried to play it during the 11:00 p.m. hour when adults are watching TV here in Virginia, but those TV stations deemed this ad too explicit for adults to watch. And yet, we have these images available freely and accessibly to public school students, teenagers, and even children.

The Hungarian-born billionaire threw millions into liberal networks and causes and boosted national politicians like Clinton, Kerry, Obama. But he found a way for his money to make an even bigger impact, plow it into local politics. Soros money went towards the defund the police movement, which was a big factor in the crime wave. For example, Austin, Texas defunded the police and murder exploded 74 percent in September. The streets are so bad that voters are desperate to get that money back to the police department. And there's a proposition in Austin to get the money back, but Soros donated a half a million to fight the proposition Keep Austin PD Defunded. Why would Soros want the crime to continue? More on that later. Soros is buying local prosecutors all over the country. PACs tied to Soros helped Travis County, Texas DA Jose Garza get elected and Garza helped a dangerous felon get out on low bond and days later, the perp allegedly murdered two people, ba-boom. He helped get Texas DA Kim Ogg elected. Afterwards, she dismissed 800 cases filed against violent Black Lives Matter protesters. Soros funded Philly Da Larry Krasner known on the streets, Uncle Larry, because if you're calling for a crime Uncle Larry is just going to let you walk. Soros's PACs have given a lot to St. Louis attorney Kimberly Gardner. Gardner is the crooked prosecutor who slapped the McCloskeys with felony charges just for protecting their home from that dangerous mob. He spent $2 million beefing up Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney Kim Foxx's campaign, the woman who dropped charges against Jussie Smollett after he allegedly staged a fake hate crime framing Trump supporters. Money in the millions makes all the difference in local races, automatic blowout. Soros knows that and spends lavishly to empty jails. Soros has invested nearly a quarter billion into racial justice organizations. His Open Society Foundation funds groups who've push critical race theory big time. And if you get in the way of the Soros agenda, his network will hunt you down. Senator Kyrsten Sinema was followed into the bathroom by operatives working for Living United for Change in Arizona, backed by Soros to the tune of millions. In April, Soros pledged $20 million to jumpstart Biden's progressive agenda. He wants Joe to go full radical, AOC style. Soros was one of the biggest donors in the 2020 election and gave over $28 million to Democrats just in the first three months of this year. And this is very interesting. Soros's PACs have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Coie for legal and compliance services. Does that name sound familiar? It should. That was the firm that paid for the dirty dossier. Hillary's lawyer Michael Sussman, who was just indicted by Durham for lying and laundering the Russia hoax was a partner at Perkins Coie. Hillary, the D.N.C., and Soros were all using the same law firm. Soros, you know, gave Hillary at least $9 million to beat Trump in 2016. So, a former partner at the firm, Mark Elias, was Hillary's top election lawyer. Elias was the one who pushed to get the election laws loosened before the 2020 elections. He is tied into Soros's PACs and money big time. This crooked lawyer who was the one who claimed the Russians hacked the D.N.C. server, but never let the F.B.I. see it. Another Soros tied group, the Democracy Integrity Project pushed the Russian collusion hoax the F.B.I. The group even hired the discredited dossier author, Christopher Steele, to help them. So behind every hoax, dirty prosecutor, and crooked lawyer, behind every crime wave, loose election law and critical race theory, you might find money originating from George Soros. So what drives them? Well, we can only speculate. White guilt perhaps? Anarchy? Ideology? Hatred? The crime wave and the permanent pandemic makes city real estate prices a bargain. Chaos invites more social spending. Democrats' crony capitalism is definitely an opportunity. And wild fluctuations in America create market volatility that can be taken advantage of. Whatever motivates Mr. Soros is a mystery. But one thing is clear, he is having a dangerous effect on America. Time for some deep pockets on the right to step up and beat him at his own game. Go local, go big, and go hard. We reached out to Soros for comment and the response we got was pretty nasty. Our next guest is the author of the new book, \"Our Broken Election: How the Left Changed the Way You Vote,\" John Fund. John, your thoughts on Soros and his influence? JOHN FUND, AUTHOR, \"OUR BROKEN ELECTION\": It's everywhere. But we shouldn't just look at Soros because he is 91 years old. He's going to be passing on, but he has a whole bunch of protegees out there who are going to take his place. I suspect one of them is going to be Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. Mark Zuckerberg was just found to have contributed $10 million to a rogue prosecutor candidate in the Portland, Oregon area. We all know how well that's worked out, right? There are others. There's these groups of Soros inspired millionaires who get together, Arabella Advisors, the Tides Foundation, Barack Obama used to be on their board. So, it's not just Soros. It's the ecosystem that he is building. Now, the good news is, if we know that Soros money is involved and if we can tackle the arguments, a lot of his candidates do lose. Now, he has won Chicago. He has won Philadelphia. He's won Los Angeles. But there's a recall effort to get rid of the Soros DA in San Francisco, Chesa Boudin. And that's been backed by 50 prosecutors who have left Boudin's office. Now, I'm from San Francisco. Let me tell you what Soros has done. They have gotten rid of felony charges for any shoplifter who steals less than 950 bucks. So basically, you're off the hook. If it's less than 950 bucks. Twenty two Walgreens drugstores have closed in San Francisco. Senior citizens can't get their prescriptions filled. Many of them don't want to do it by Internet. They can't get basic groceries. They can't get a lot of things. This not only leads to high crime rates, it isolates our seniors in places where they're basically alone.",

All right, so judge what do you think is going on here? JUDGE JOE BROWN, HOST, \"THE JUDGE JOE BROWN SHOW\": We've gotten our country emasculated and it's a big problem. When you take masculinity out of the equation, you destroy the control factor. See, when you input masculinity into a young boy and he becomes a man, he has been acculturated and socialized to be about public peace, dignity, and order. He's a man of peace until he needs to be brave and courageous. He is about making where he lives a better, safer, more secure place filled with economic prosperity, sense of purpose, morality, and ethics. He follows the law because the law is of value to him and it helps him do his thing as a man in terms of fulfilling his obligations to home and family. We don't have that. We've turned a lot of places in this country into a matriarchy, which is not a good thing. And the problem with that is, we have had 50 years' worth of propaganda wherein emotionalism, throwing what you feel like, forget all of the rules is supposed to be paramount, not what you ought to do but what you want to do. That doesn't work. And see when Mama who has the boy and he's a nice little cute kid in elementary school, she doesn't get it that when he hits puberty and he quickly shoots up and he is a few inches taller than her and he doesn't understand discipline, authority, manners, courtesies. He's out of hand. We are the apex predators, so when you don't acculturate and socialize right, we kill each other. And that leads to the violence in the hallway and into the -- in the hood. Now you have a lot of things that have contributed to this immediate uptick, which I understand is about 30 to 32 percent increase in homicides over the last 18 months according to some F.B.I. statistics, if I'm not recalling that wrong. You've got your rival, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC grinning at all of the street unrest for the last two and a half, three years they were trying to get rid of President Trump. But kids see this and they say, oh, everybody is out of control. Why not me? And you see this mess down on the border where people get rewarded for breaking the clear law. Wowee. Let's go do it.",

The Democrats and the media are afraid to say this guy has got no clothes on, because if they call him out, his entire presidency collapses. So everybody sits around pretending that this is normal, like they don't see anything, pretending they don't see how nuts this is. Biden and the Democrats don't see how awkward this is, they take this silence as a license to steal. Because they're not being called out for anything, they can get away with everything. That's what they think. And they are. Hunter Biden's paintings are valued at a half a million dollars. That's more than a signed Picasso's worth. Hunter and Joe shares secret bank account and Hunter's associates do Joe's taxes. Is anybody paying attention here? Our Attorney General's family is getting rich off critical race theory in schools.

That's another reason why they are pushing free college, free pre-K, and free daycare in Biden's welfare bill. Guess what else they slipped into the Biden welfare bill? Hundreds of thousands more green cards, all backed by Big Tech like Facebook and Microsoft. Silicon Valley doesn't want to hire American, they want to hire foreign nationals on the cheap. The government is supposed to be working for us, but no, they are working for Big Tech instead.

A smoking gun e-mail released shows Biden ordered the planes out of Afghanistan to be filled to excess with refugees, not caring if they weren't vetted. Just fill them up and bring them over so the planes look packed for the cameras. There is even another hostage crisis besides Afghanistan. Haitian bandits took 16 U.S. citizens hostage. Joe Biden hasn't even mentioned it. Just a few miles off our shores and they sit there languishing. The media covered up two hostage crises. It's got to be hard to be that corrupt. These countries take Americans hostage and we give their people amnesty. Now, an Afghan evacuee was just charged with raping a woman in Montana. Biden flew back an Afghan rapist, but stranded Americans. The #MeToo media didn't get around to covering that, did they? But Hillary's flack, Huma Abedin says a senator once made a pass at her.

Has he been charged? He called his brother right after, and then his brother called his broker, and sold a bunch of stock also. His brother hasn't been charged. Insider trading must be legal for politicians But they want the I.R.S. to look at your bank account if it has over 600 bucks in it. Washington is corrupt to the bone.

Out of the first 276 days of his presidency, he spent 108 of them either vacationing or working from his Delaware homes or from Camp David. More than Trump, Obama, Bush -- all of them. The politicians keep raiding the Treasury, the Fed keeps buying the debt. The dollar gets destroyed, pushing oil prices higher and the fuel costs are passed down to the consumer whose wages are eaten up by inflation and open borders, wages wasted on empty shelves since everything is made in China, a communist country that just sprung a killer virus on us, but we can't criticize because they're in bed with our wicked media and tech giants who will cancel you for coming too close to the truth. Blatant corruption is staring us right in the face. Are your eyes open yet? Here with reaction, former Texas Congressman and presidential nominee, Ron Paul.

You know, you think, well, it is good if you're thinking straight and some of these times, people think, how do you sit down and make these predictions? No, it's sort of spontaneous thinking about just having a natural reaction to the stupidity of what the government's doing and it shouldn't be that hard to figure out. But you know, it's a disappointment in one way, but it also gives me a little reassurance that, you know, I've talked about the money issue for a long time, and you know, I had this wild theory about money. If you put too much of it, it will lose value and this will hurt the middle class, and of course, everybody laughed at that. But it's something that people will wake up on after a time, as long as they think they're getting a benefit. You know, the big thing that bothers me about all this corruption right now, I think everybody is starting to recognize it and that's good news. But the corruption -- the corruption is worse than it was when I first went to Congress in the 70s. So it is definitely, you know, a lot worse. But what really bothers me why I think this is so dangerous, there is no shame, no shame whatsoever. It used to be and I met two people in Congress over those 30 years, who actually said, \"You know, I made a mistake. I wished I hadn't done that.\" But no, right now, when you -- can you think of a President who ever made a mistake and lives were at stake and people died and people lost their jobs, and people went bankrupt, and all these kind of thing. People had stupid policies that paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to invite people into our country and become legal citizens. And you know, they don't lose shame on that. They don't -- they don't pay - - they're not shameful about it. They don't believe there's anything wrong. So, it's the set of standards of right and wrong, good and bad and evil and what you should be if you're a public servant, representing the people, that's where the problem is. So yes, all the things that you talked about, they are absolutely true and they are scary. But the big picture is this understanding about what morality is all about. Our founders talked about -- our founders talked about this and they knew this system wouldn't work if you don't have the people being halfway decent."

They used to sometimes go after both parties and stick mics in their face. Remember that old school journalism? They don't do that anymore. They cover up all the corruption because they are in on the corruption. And speaking of corruption, I want to talk to you about this new thing. You just mentioned it, Joe Biden is considering paying -- paying illegal immigrants who were briefly separated at the border $450,000.00. To round, a million dollars per family. And this is more than American families get when their sons or husbands are killed in action overseas defending our country. And now the ACLU has signed up thousands of these illegals just to claim these reparations. Those people broke the law and came here illegally, and now this total payout is looking to maybe clock in at over a billion dollars, your thoughts on that?"

They tell you, it's not going to cost anything. It's just going to happen. And that, to me, is the most bizarre thing. And in a way, the immediate cost goes to somebody else. It is to the middle class people who are the victims and they are thinking, as long as they vote a certain way, they're going to get checks in the mail. But that -- this is an indication of how governments spend money that they don't have and then what they rely on his corrupt counterfeit machine that they have over to the Federal Reserve, and then they print at will, and then they wonder why we have a problem. You know, Facebook the other day -- this one blows my mind -- Facebook was having, you know, a little bit of PR problems and their stock was going down a billion here and a billion there. But they said well, it doesn't look good for our stocks. So the in one day, they put in $50 billion to buy up their own stock to prop up the system. And you were talking about, you know, misleading the people. They will admit there's a lot of misleading going on in the marketplace."

Independent Women's Voice thought it was important enough that parents see these images for themselves. And so we produced an ad, tried to play it during the 11:00 p.m. hour when adults are watching TV here in Virginia, but those TV stations deemed this ad too explicit for adults to watch. And yet, we have these images available freely and accessibly to public school students, teenagers, and even children. It is unacceptable and it is absolutely insulting that we have the Biden administration labeling parents speaking out about this as domestic terrorists and a former President doubting our sincerity when we, as parents, try to have a voice and fight for our children."

The Trump administration placed those tariffs in the interest of National Security. The G20 also endorsed a global minimum tax on corporations. In Washington, top Democrats reportedly want a House Senate compromise written to cover President Biden's $1.75 trillion social and environment bill.

      "utterance": "He has resources that could make politicians that doesn't like just disappear from the ballot if he uses them. The Hungarian-born billionaire threw millions into liberal networks and causes and boosted national politicians like Clinton, Kerry, Obama. But he found a way for his money to make an even bigger impact, plow it into local politics. Soros money went towards the defund the police movement, which was a big factor in the crime wave. For example, Austin, Texas defunded the police and murder exploded 74 percent in September. The streets are so bad that voters are desperate to get that money back to the police department. And there's a proposition in Austin to get the money back, but Soros donated a half a million to fight the proposition Keep Austin PD Defunded. Why would Soros want the crime to continue? More on that later. Soros is buying local prosecutors all over the country. PACs tied to Soros helped Travis County, Texas DA Jose Garza get elected and Garza helped a dangerous felon get out on low bond and days later, the perp allegedly murdered two people, ba-boom. He helped get Texas DA Kim Ogg elected. Afterwards, she dismissed 800 cases filed against violent Black Lives Matter protesters. Soros funded Philly Da Larry Krasner known on the streets, Uncle Larry, because if you're calling for a crime Uncle Larry is just going to let you walk. Soros's PACs have given a lot to St. Louis attorney Kimberly Gardner. Gardner is the crooked prosecutor who slapped the McCloskeys with felony charges just for protecting their home from that dangerous mob. He spent $2 million beefing up Cook County, Illinois State's Attorney Kim Foxx's campaign, the woman who dropped charges against Jussie Smollett after he allegedly staged a fake hate crime framing Trump supporters. Money in the millions makes all the difference in local races, automatic blowout. Soros knows that and spends lavishly to empty jails. Soros has invested nearly a quarter billion into racial justice organizations. His Open Society Foundation funds groups who've push critical race theory big time. And if you get in the way of the Soros agenda, his network will hunt you down. Senator Kyrsten Sinema was followed into the bathroom by operatives working for Living United for Change in Arizona, backed by Soros to the tune of millions. In April, Soros pledged $20 million to jumpstart Biden's progressive agenda. He wants Joe to go full radical, AOC style. Soros was one of the biggest donors in the 2020 election and gave over $28 million to Democrats just in the first three months of this year. And this is very interesting. Soros's PACs have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Perkins Coie for legal and compliance services. Does that name sound familiar? It should. That was the firm that paid for the dirty dossier. Hillary's lawyer Michael Sussman, who was just indicted by Durham for lying and laundering the Russia hoax was a partner at Perkins Coie. Hillary, the D.N.C., and Soros were all using the same law firm. Soros, you know, gave Hillary at least $9 million to beat Trump in 2016. So, a former partner at the firm, Mark Elias, was Hillary's top election lawyer. Elias was the one who pushed to get the election laws loosened before the 2020 elections. He is tied into Soros's PACs and money big time. This crooked lawyer who was the one who claimed the Russians hacked the D.N.C. server, but never let the F.B.I. see it. Another Soros tied group, the Democracy Integrity Project pushed the Russian collusion hoax the F.B.I. The group even hired the discredited dossier author, Christopher Steele, to help them. So behind every hoax, dirty prosecutor, and crooked lawyer, behind every crime wave, loose election law and critical race theory, you might find money originating from George Soros. So what drives them? Well, we can only speculate. White guilt perhaps? Anarchy? Ideology? Hatred? The crime wave and the permanent pandemic makes city real estate prices a bargain. Chaos invites more social spending. Democrats' crony capitalism is definitely an opportunity. And wild fluctuations in America create market volatility that can be taken advantage of. Whatever motivates Mr. Soros is a mystery. But one thing is clear, he is having a dangerous effect on America. Time for some deep pockets on the right to step up and beat him at his own game. Go local, go big, and go hard. We reached out to Soros for comment and the response we got was pretty nasty. Our next guest is the author of the new book, \"Our Broken Election: How the Left Changed the Way You Vote,\" John Fund. John, your thoughts on Soros and his influence? JOHN FUND, AUTHOR, \"OUR BROKEN ELECTION\": It's everywhere. But we shouldn't just look at Soros because he is 91 years old. He's going to be passing on, but he has a whole bunch of protegees out there who are going to take his place. I suspect one of them is going to be Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. Mark Zuckerberg was just found to have contributed $10 million to a rogue prosecutor candidate in the Portland, Oregon area. We all know how well that's worked out, right? There are others. There's these groups of Soros inspired millionaires who get together, Arabella Advisors, the Tides Foundation, Barack Obama used to be on their board. So, it's not just Soros. It's the ecosystem that he is building. Now, the good news is, if we know that Soros money is involved and if we can tackle the arguments, a lot of his candidates do lose. Now, he has won Chicago. He has won Philadelphia. He's won Los Angeles. But there's a recall effort to get rid of the Soros DA in San Francisco, Chesa Boudin. And that's been backed by 50 prosecutors who have left Boudin's office. Now, I'm from San Francisco. Let me tell you what Soros has done. They have gotten rid of felony charges for any shoplifter who steals less than 950 bucks. So basically, you're off the hook. If it's less than 950 bucks. Twenty two Walgreens drugstores have closed in San Francisco. Senior citizens can't get their prescriptions filled. Many of them don't want to do it by Internet. They can't get basic groceries. They can't get a lot of things. This not only leads to high crime rates, it isolates our seniors in places where they're basically alone."

Some say it's pent up anger after the pandemic, but there is another reason we believe. Joining me now as host of \"The Judge Joe Brown Show,\" Judge Brown. All right, so judge what do you think is going on here? JUDGE JOE BROWN, HOST, \"THE JUDGE JOE BROWN SHOW\": We've gotten our country emasculated and it's a big problem. When you take masculinity out of the equation, you destroy the control factor. See, when you input masculinity into a young boy and he becomes a man, he has been acculturated and socialized to be about public peace, dignity, and order. He's a man of peace until he needs to be brave and courageous. He is about making where he lives a better, safer, more secure place filled with economic prosperity, sense of purpose, morality, and ethics. He follows the law because the law is of value to him and it helps him do his thing as a man in terms of fulfilling his obligations to home and family. We don't have that. We've turned a lot of places in this country into a matriarchy, which is not a good thing. And the problem with that is, we have had 50 years' worth of propaganda wherein emotionalism, throwing what you feel like, forget all of the rules is supposed to be paramount, not what you ought to do but what you want to do. That doesn't work. And see when Mama who has the boy and he's a nice little cute kid in elementary school, she doesn't get it that when he hits puberty and he quickly shoots up and he is a few inches taller than her and he doesn't understand discipline, authority, manners, courtesies. He's out of hand. We are the apex predators, so when you don't acculturate and socialize right, we kill each other. And that leads to the violence in the hallway and into the -- in the hood. Now you have a lot of things that have contributed to this immediate uptick, which I understand is about 30 to 32 percent increase in homicides over the last 18 months according to some F.B.I. statistics, if I'm not recalling that wrong. You've got your rival, CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC grinning at all of the street unrest for the last two and a half, three years they were trying to get rid of President Trump. But kids see this and they say, oh, everybody is out of control. Why not me? And you see this mess down on the border where people get rewarded for breaking the clear law. Wowee. Let's go do it."

And now, they're just kind of flying off the handle because they can't control their emotions because they haven't been taught to do and now we're seeing that play out in the school system. We're seeing it play out on the streets and it is really destroying the country. We have to run, Judge, but I want to have you back because we've got to pay some bills, but very, very provocative analysis."
