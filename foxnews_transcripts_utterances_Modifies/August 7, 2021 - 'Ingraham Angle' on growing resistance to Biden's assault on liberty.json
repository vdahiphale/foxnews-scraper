A well-known Canadian immunologist was part of the group that did some of the early research on the mRNA COVID vaccine. Now, Tuesday night, he revealed they missed something significant. He's back tonight with more on that.  But first, a time for action. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".   Now, in case you didn't notice, Democrats love shutdowns and COVID mandates as much as they love, I don't know, high taxes and climate regs. Now, in fact, I think it's safe to say that many liberals were never happier than when Americans were forced by their government, out of the workforce, out of school, away from church, and even away from friends and family. Now, not only was there all that interrupted time to finally catch all see six seasons of Downton Abbey, all that time for YouTube yoga and planting herb gardens, it presented them a golden opportunity. The viral emergency could offer a stealth way to change America forever. A fearful public, they wagered, would also be a complacent public. Now, interestingly, anti-lockdown demonstrations have drawn massive numbers abroad, in France, in Greece, Australia, and the UK. But here, even when the COVID dictates made zero sense, like limiting restaurant capacity or masks on student athletes playing outside, there was shockingly scant public protest here. Now, this was much to the dismay of Dr. Scott Atlas.",

This is no time to be silent or afraid. Think about what Biden has done just this week. He's defied the Supreme Court's clear directive by extending a moratorium on evictions rent free after all for everybody. It's totally unconstitutional, unlawful to take income from landlords coast-to-coast. Don't have congressional approval, he's doing it anyway.  And just today, Biden signed an executive order to significantly raise the fuel efficiency standards on U.S. automobiles. He says there's no turning back to phase out gas-powered cars. His goal is that by 2030, half of all cars sold in the U.S. will be electric. Who made him king? He's clearly abusing his authority under the decades old Clean Air Act to satisfy the greeniacs.  And I guess we're just all supposed to sit back and applaud as our chief executive with a stroke of a pen aims to eliminate an entire American industry. Think of the job losses here, not just within the auto industry, but all the other industries that support it. And if you think that this won't cause us to lose a significant percentage of manufacturing to foreign sources, you going to have to be smoking something. China already makes most of the EV batteries, electric vehicle batteries for the world. And Biden's move, intervening in the free market, it's only going to make matters worse.   And it's not only Democrats, by the way, that need to hear from you, the people. The Old Republican Guard needs to hear from you as well. I'm talking Mitch McConnell, Roy Blunt, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Senator Cassidy and others. They all supported Biden's 2700 page so-called phony infrastructure bill that's paving the way for a tandem consideration of the $3.5 trillion behemoth budget bill.  Hello, inflation; hello, higher taxes, endless regulation, new entitlements, and goodbye fiscal responsibility. It's a total abdication. I am sickened by what the Republicans have done.  Now speaking of abdication, what's happening at the southern border is - that's worthy of impeachment. There have been more encounters there just this year than the populations of eight U.S. states, and governors and non- border states are being kept in the dark.",

The Democrats sent their activists to Washington, conservatives, sometimes are content to watch theirs on TV. Can't be the case anymore.   Now, the GOP should be investing huge amounts of money in Virginia, in New Jersey, and conservative activists need to engage.  Glenn Youngkin would be a terrific governor in the Old Dominion. And Lord knows, New Jersey needs new leadership. With the Newsom recall, oh my goodness, this is amazing, the GOP has an opportunity to at least make a case why conservatives, sensible political leaders, are urgently needed there. So a tea party 2.0 movement could appeal to frustrated African-Americans as well who don't want to be demonized for their personal medical decisions and could also appeal to Hispanic business owners. They didn't work hard for their American dream only to have lockdowns turn into a nightmare.  And suburban women, they might not have voted for Trump last time, but now do they want their kids indoctrinated, to this poisonous ideology at school? And what about urban professionals who are sick of paying high taxes to live in high crime neighborhoods? And to evangelical voters who don't want to be told that their faith is not essential by Washington bureaucrats or godless governors? It's time for an American call to action. I don't care what you call it, what you name it, what you brand it, but the principles are all found in our Constitution. This movement is where freedom matters, where work matters, where personal responsibility matters, where school matters, where safety matters, and where truth matters. And that's the angle.  Here now, one of the few journalists who's been holding the GOP's feet to the fire over the infrastructure scam, and is likewise calling for something resembling a new age Tea Party is Phil Klein, editor at National Review.  Phil, I was at some of those early Tea Party rallies. I spoke at a number of them. They were demonized, they were ridiculed. But those people in  2009-2010 made a real difference.

Who was this man? Did he have any criminal background? Was he an American citizen? Now, all those questions remained obscured, not worthy of examination until one Minnesota attorney and blogger started digging.  Now Scott Johnson of the popular \"Powerline\" blog joins me now. Scott, tell us what you learned, and why others seemed disinterested in this shocking and grisly story? SCOTT JOHNSON, \"POWERLINE\" BLOG: Laura, it's really a heartbreaking and enraging story, as you suggest, and I have been working on it for the past week. Saborit just mad an initial appearance on the murder charge this past Friday. And in the course of that hearing in the initial appearance, he said he wanted to be deported to his country. That got my attention. The fact that this beheading happen in broad daylight in the leafy Twin Cities suburb of Shakopee, Minnesota, on a residential street got my attention. And unbelievably, at the time he beheaded his girlfriend, America Thayer, a legal immigrant citizen of the United States who changed her name to America when she became a citizen, he was on his way to court on an underlying arson crime, three felonies, incredibly violent, that also involved the use of the machete that he used to behead America Thayer on his way to court this past -- a week ago Wednesday. So both things taken together are just unbelievable. Have we ever had a public beheading in broad daylight? I don't think so.",

In fact, I would argue that -- and it is certainly untrue that this flipping of the messaging to scare people into thinking that the unvaccinated are somehow driving the emergence of novel variants. This goes against every scientific principle that we understand. The reality is the nature of the vaccines that we are using right now and the way we are rolling them out are going to be applying the selective pressure to this virus to promote the emergence new variant. Again, this is based on sound principles. We have to look no further than chemotherapy for cancers and the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The principles are this -- if you have a biological entity that is prone to mutation, and the SARS coronavirus two, like all coronaviruses, is prone to mutation, so if you have a biological entity like that and you apply a narrowly focused selective pressure that is nonlethal, and you do this over a long period of time, this is the recipe for driving the emergence of novel variant. And that's exactly what we're doing. Our vaccines are focused on a single protein of the virus, so the virus only has to alter one protein. And the vaccines don't come close to conferring sterilizing immunity. People who are vaccinated still get infected. It only seems to be particularly good at blunting the disease. And so what that tells you, therefore, is that these vaccines in the vast majority of people are applying a nonlethal pressure, narrowly focused on one protein, and of course a vaccine rollout is occurring over a long period of time. That is the recipe for driving novel variants.",

And the funny thing is that why is she talking about defunding the police in her city, her constituency? Because if you look at 2021, there has not been one single black person shot unarmed by police. There was one in 2020, and the last time somebody was shot unarmed by police who were black was in 2015 in her own city. She is lying to the public, and she needs to come correct. And it really bothers me how she is putting out a fake agenda.",

He's back tonight with more on that. But first, a time for action. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Now, in case you didn't notice, Democrats love shutdowns and COVID mandates as much as they love, I don't know, high taxes and climate regs. Now, in fact, I think it's safe to say that many liberals were never happier than when Americans were forced by their government, out of the workforce, out of school, away from church, and even away from friends and family. Now, not only was there all that interrupted time to finally catch all see six seasons of Downton Abbey, all that time for YouTube yoga and planting herb gardens, it presented them a golden opportunity. The viral emergency could offer a stealth way to change America forever. A fearful public, they wagered, would also be a complacent public. Now, interestingly, anti-lockdown demonstrations have drawn massive numbers abroad, in France, in Greece, Australia, and the UK. But here, even when the COVID dictates made zero sense, like limiting restaurant capacity or masks on student athletes playing outside, there was shockingly scant public protest here.

This is no time to be silent or afraid. Think about what Biden has done just this week. He's defied the Supreme Court's clear directive by extending a moratorium on evictions rent free after all for everybody. It's totally unconstitutional, unlawful to take income from landlords coast-to-coast. Don't have congressional approval, he's doing it anyway. And just today, Biden signed an executive order to significantly raise the fuel efficiency standards on U.S. automobiles. He says there's no turning back to phase out gas-powered cars. His goal is that by 2030, half of all cars sold in the U.S. will be electric. Who made him king? He's clearly abusing his authority under the decades old Clean Air Act to satisfy the greeniacs. And I guess we're just all supposed to sit back and applaud as our chief executive with a stroke of a pen aims to eliminate an entire American industry. Think of the job losses here, not just within the auto industry, but all the other industries that support it. And if you think that this won't cause us to lose a significant percentage of manufacturing to foreign sources, you going to have to be smoking something. China already makes most of the EV batteries, electric vehicle batteries for the world. And Biden's move, intervening in the free market, it's only going to make matters worse. And it's not only Democrats, by the way, that need to hear from you, the people. The Old Republican Guard needs to hear from you as well. I'm talking Mitch McConnell, Roy Blunt, Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Senator Cassidy and others. They all supported Biden's 2700 page so-called phony infrastructure bill that's paving the way for a tandem consideration of the $3.5 trillion behemoth budget bill. Hello, inflation; hello, higher taxes, endless regulation, new entitlements, and goodbye fiscal responsibility. It's a total abdication. I am sickened by what the Republicans have done. Now speaking of abdication, what's happening at the southern border is - that's worthy of impeachment. There have been more encounters there just this year than the populations of eight U.S. states, and governors and non- border states are being kept in the dark."

The Democrats sent their activists to Washington, conservatives, sometimes are content to watch theirs on TV. Can't be the case anymore. Now, the GOP should be investing huge amounts of money in Virginia, in New Jersey, and conservative activists need to engage. Glenn Youngkin would be a terrific governor in the Old Dominion. And Lord knows, New Jersey needs new leadership. With the Newsom recall, oh my goodness, this is amazing, the GOP has an opportunity to at least make a case why conservatives, sensible political leaders, are urgently needed there. So a tea party 2.0 movement could appeal to frustrated African-Americans as well who don't want to be demonized for their personal medical decisions and could also appeal to Hispanic business owners. They didn't work hard for their American dream only to have lockdowns turn into a nightmare. And suburban women, they might not have voted for Trump last time, but now do they want their kids indoctrinated, to this poisonous ideology at school? And what about urban professionals who are sick of paying high taxes to live in high crime neighborhoods? And to evangelical voters who don't want to be told that their faith is not essential by Washington bureaucrats or godless governors? It's time for an American call to action. I don't care what you call it, what you name it, what you brand it, but the principles are all found in our Constitution. This movement is where freedom matters, where work matters, where personal responsibility matters, where school matters, where safety matters, and where truth matters. And that's the angle. Here now, one of the few journalists who's been holding the GOP's feet to the fire over the infrastructure scam, and is likewise calling for something resembling a new age Tea Party is Phil Klein, editor at National Review. Phil, I was at some of those early Tea Party rallies. I spoke at a number of them. They were demonized, they were ridiculed. But those people in 2009-2010 made a real difference.

However, we need a movement in this country that stands up across the board against all of this unlawful government seizing of power from the people. And we had it in 2009 into 2010, made a massive difference in retaking Congress. What are the chances that that kind of movement can be organized again?"

And they actually felt pressure to try to cut spending and to try to return to constitutional principles. And now you have Republicans getting completely rolled by Biden. And keep in mind that, I mean, the scam keeps getting worse for weeks and months. The Republicans supporting this have said the bill would be fully paid for."

That wasn't specifically the order of the Supreme Court was talking about just a few weeks ago. The Court made perfectly clear that this is unconstitutional. The only reason that they didn't strike down the order is because it was expiring. Now, Tribe and I are not particularly fond of each other. But it often seems like when the Democrats want to lead foot, the law, the light is always green at the corner of Tribe and Constitution Avenue. I mean, you can have disagreements as we have in the past, we can even have positions that have evolved. But this is really beyond the pale. I mean, there is no constitutional authority. And then the president came out and said the quiet part out loud, and said, \"Well, most of the experts I've talked to said that this is unconstitutional. But I talked to some experts and they said, well, go for it.\" But then he added, \"But the fact is that before the courts can shut us down, we can get a lot of money out of the door.\" Well, he's ignoring the fact that that would be an unconstitutional expenditure of money.

Ohio offered million-dollar lottery tickets, and now the President is offering 100 bucks if you take the shot, and that's not having a huge amount of success. So they're moving to the final stage, which is coerce consent. And the President said, he doesn't want to order a federal mandate.

One week ago, a man named Alexis Saborit of Shakopee, Minnesota, was arrested after beheading a woman in broad daylight. This heinous crime would sure be national news. What was the motive? Who was this man? Did he have any criminal background? Was he an American citizen? Now, all those questions remained obscured, not worthy of examination until one Minnesota attorney and blogger started digging. Now Scott Johnson of the popular \"Powerline\" blog joins me now. Scott, tell us what you learned, and why others seemed disinterested in this shocking and grisly story? SCOTT JOHNSON, \"POWERLINE\" BLOG: Laura, it's really a heartbreaking and enraging story, as you suggest, and I have been working on it for the past week. Saborit just mad an initial appearance on the murder charge this past Friday. And in the course of that hearing in the initial appearance, he said he wanted to be deported to his country. That got my attention. The fact that this beheading happen in broad daylight in the leafy Twin Cities suburb of Shakopee, Minnesota, on a residential street got my attention. And unbelievably, at the time he beheaded his girlfriend, America Thayer, a legal immigrant citizen of the United States who changed her name to America when she became a citizen, he was on his way to court on an underlying arson crime, three felonies, incredibly violent, that also involved the use of the machete that he used to behead America Thayer on his way to court this past -- a week ago Wednesday. So both things taken together are just unbelievable. Have we ever had a public beheading in broad daylight? I don't think so."

Joining us now is Dr. Byram Bridle, associate professor of viral immunology at the University of Guelph who has been researching the COVID vaccine. Doctor, thank you for joining us in part two of this interview with you. Is it accurate to now call this a pandemic of the unvaccinated? Or do you think those who are vaccinated could also be contributing to the emergence of these new variants?"

      "speaker": "DR. BYRAM BRIDLE, UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "Laura, thanks for having me back. Absolutely it is untrue to be calling this a pandemic of the unvaccinated. In fact, I would argue that -- and it is certainly untrue that this flipping of the messaging to scare people into thinking that the unvaccinated are somehow driving the emergence of novel variants. This goes against every scientific principle that we understand. The reality is the nature of the vaccines that we are using right now and the way we are rolling them out are going to be applying the selective pressure to this virus to promote the emergence new variant. Again, this is based on sound principles. We have to look no further than chemotherapy for cancers and the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The principles are this -- if you have a biological entity that is prone to mutation, and the SARS coronavirus two, like all coronaviruses, is prone to mutation, so if you have a biological entity like that and you apply a narrowly focused selective pressure that is nonlethal, and you do this over a long period of time, this is the recipe for driving the emergence of novel variant. And that's exactly what we're doing. Our vaccines are focused on a single protein of the virus, so the virus only has to alter one protein. And the vaccines don't come close to conferring sterilizing immunity. People who are vaccinated still get infected. It only seems to be particularly good at blunting the disease. And so what that tells you, therefore, is that these vaccines in the vast majority of people are applying a nonlethal pressure, narrowly focused on one protein, and of course a vaccine rollout is occurring over a long period of time. That is the recipe for driving novel variants."

And so your theory that it is exact opposite of what they are saying, because they're trying to demonize and intimidate those who have chosen not to be vaccinated for whatever reason.

      "speaker": "BRIDLE",

If anything, the unvaccinated are likely acquiring probably in pretty substantial numbers naturally acquiring immunity, which I would argue from an immunological perspective is going to be much more protective than the vaccine-induced immunity against novel variants."

    {
      "speaker": "BRIDLE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is shocking to me as an immunologist, because basically, yes, you are correct. Essentially our immune systems actually work. They do respond to pathogens, and they do protect us from pathogens. And there are published papers, people can look up a paper done by authors Seti (ph) and Corati (ph) that was published in a nature journal, and it shows very clearly, as to several very good peer-reviewed publications, they show very clearly that natural acquired immunity against SARS coronavirus two is very potent. It's very long-lasting. And importantly in the context of novel variants, it is very broad in its scope. So it is going to be very balanced. We're going to have lots of antibodies and T cells. And the thing is, it targets multiple components of the virus."

Yet you don't want them to have security. But you will pay $75,000, she said she will pay even $100,000, whatever it takes to keep her black and brown body safe while everybody is struggling. She is a complete hypocrite. Defunding the police never works. It never will work. It is going to put people in danger. And the funny thing is that why is she talking about defunding the police in her city, her constituency? Because if you look at 2021, there has not been one single black person shot unarmed by police. There was one in 2020, and the last time somebody was shot unarmed by police who were black was in 2015 in her own city. She is lying to the public, and she needs to come correct.
