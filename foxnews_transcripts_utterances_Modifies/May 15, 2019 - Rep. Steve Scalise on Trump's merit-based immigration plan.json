Rudy Giuliani, Sol Wisenberg will be here in just moments to explain just how and why White House lawyers repelled that Jerry Nadler and the rest of the probe addicted Democrats. Plus, what might be the most consequential fight playing out across America today. Alabama's strict new pro-life bill just signed into law. Candace Owens will react to this and claim that this legislation and others like it adversely affects the minority community. And Michelle Malkin is here with her first response to being censored by Facebook for arguing against censorship. You can't make that up. It's outrageous. And Kamala Harris points to Bill Nye as her climate guru vetoes reboot hits another pothole and a tribute to Tim Conway, Raymond Arroyo is here with seen and unseen. But first, the White House Council says it will not entertain any of the Democrats requests for more documents or interviews regarding the Russia investigation.  Today, Pat Cipollone sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee Chair, Jerry Nadler saying quote congressional investigations are intended to obtain information to aid in evaluating potential legislation, not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized do over of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice. While Nadler naturally bristled at the response.",

I mean a jury might have a hard time understanding because he's not much of a lawyer but it's a legal memorandum, it's very well thought out, very well written. Obviously, it makes the point of executive privilege, but it goes way beyond executive privilege. It makes a very, very important point. I would have added Pelosi's statement last week that the legislature is the superior branch because that's the way they're acting.  They have issued not just - they have not just one hearing. They have six hearings. So, it has to be seen in the context of six hearings. They are - they have already issued hundreds of subpoenas looking for possibly a million documents or more. And we have Nadler, we have Schiff, we have Cummings. They're all kind of like want you know daytime television time. And the reality is, this is a tremendous burden on the executive and the law has a way to deal with it.   There are cases that say that legislative power is there, but it can't be used for an in-permissive purpose. It has to be a proper legislative purpose. In their subpoenas, their information requests, they don't cite a single piece of legislation, they're pursuing. Not only that, they are taking over an executive branch function. And they're afraid to call this an impeachment hearing. So, this is oversight. You don't issue hundreds of subpoenas.",

But Laura, these battles have gone back to the beginning of the Republic. Go back to 1796, Congress wanted all of President Washington's papers related to the J treaty and Washington said, you're not going to get them. And James Madison said, we as a Congress - he was a congressman. We have the right to anything we asked for. But the President has a right to say, I don't want to give it to you.

And we are told two main points in the president's new immigration plan will be securing the border and instituting now this merit-based immigration system.

Right now, 66 percent of 1.1 million green cards are doled out just because of family relationships, and they want to invert that with merit-based immigration. Joining us now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Congressman, is there a coalition that would support flipping theme narrative from entire family trees coming in here to people we supposedly need because there are not Americans to do these jobs?

Candace Owens will react to this and claim that this legislation and others like it adversely affects the minority community.

And Kamala Harris points to Bill Nye as her climate guru vetoes reboot hits another pothole and a tribute to Tim Conway, Raymond Arroyo is here with seen and unseen. But first, the White House Council says it will not entertain any of the Democrats requests for more documents or interviews regarding the Russia investigation. Today, Pat Cipollone sent a letter to the House Judiciary Committee Chair, Jerry Nadler saying quote congressional investigations are intended to obtain information to aid in evaluating potential legislation, not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized do over of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice.

I mean a jury might have a hard time understanding because he's not much of a lawyer but it's a legal memorandum, it's very well thought out, very well written. Obviously, it makes the point of executive privilege, but it goes way beyond executive privilege. It makes a very, very important point. I would have added Pelosi's statement last week that the legislature is the superior branch because that's the way they're acting. They have issued not just - they have not just one hearing. They have six hearings. So, it has to be seen in the context of six hearings. They are - they have already issued hundreds of subpoenas looking for possibly a million documents or more. And we have Nadler, we have Schiff, we have Cummings. They're all kind of like want you know daytime television time. And the reality is, this is a tremendous burden on the executive and the law has a way to deal with it. There are cases that say that legislative power is there, but it can't be used for an in-permissive purpose. It has to be a proper legislative purpose. In their subpoenas, their information requests, they don't cite a single piece of legislation, they're pursuing. Not only that, they are taking over an executive branch function. And they're afraid to call this an impeachment hearing. So, this is oversight. You don't issue hundreds of subpoenas."

There really is no such thing as saying constitutionally is saying you don't get to do a do over and congressional authority to investigate is very, very broad. But Laura, these battles have gone back to the beginning of the Republic. Go back to 1796, Congress wanted all of President Washington's papers related to the J treaty and Washington said, you're not going to get them. And James Madison said, we as a Congress - he was a congressman. We have the right to anything we asked for. But the President has a right to say, I don't want to give it to you.

There is nothing lawless about the administration's response. Sol could be quite right that it's a very broad response. But you know as a lawyer you raised all your arguments. I think there is some that are overbroad and I think there are some very, very strong. The strongest one being that in the Cheney case, the court held that the power of the Congress is very broad, not unlimited. And I think given the number of subpoenas, given the number of hearings, given the already predetermined positions of the three chairmen, who have already said he should be impeached and Nadler was overheard planning it on Amtrak. I think that they've got a very good argument to the court. How did things ever get this far. And let's check this a little. As long as they're willing to compromise. As long as they're willing to compromise if there is going to be a narrower, more focused subpoena."

And as we witnessed last week in south Texas, this is beyond crisis point now. We have updates we're going to bring you tomorrow on New Mexico. A story in New Mexico that has been completely lost on most in the media. And we are told two main points in the president's new immigration plan will be securing the border and instituting now this merit-based immigration system. The goal is to reduce the number of illegals due to family ties. Right now, 66 percent of 1.1 million green cards are doled out just because of family relationships, and they want to invert that with merit-based immigration. Joining us now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Congressman, is there a coalition that would support flipping theme narrative from entire family trees coming in here to people we supposedly need because there are not Americans to do these jobs? I'm not for increasing the number of legal immigrants. I think 1.1 million is enough. The president I think is going to keep it at the same number. But if you're going to keep it at the same number and not reduce it, this seems to make sense."

      "speaker": "REP. STEVE SCALISE, R-LA, HOUSE MINORITY WHIP",
      "utterance": "Laura, there is no talk of increasing the number. What there is talk of is getting back to rule of law, securing the border, going to a merit-based system. And think about this. Right now we have got some of the dumbest laws on the books. If we educate somebody in America to be a computer scientist and engineer, jobs we need in America, they want to stay in America, we force them to leave the country to compete against us, while we've got the visa lottery where we literally pluck names out of a hat, in many cases from countries that don't like us, to bring them here. Why don't we flip that narrative. We have caps on different countries. So if you are coming from India you might wait 20 years, whereas if you're coming from Honduras you might wait six years to come here. And like you talked about, the family tree issue. Let's get to a merit-based system where we have rule of law and were we ultimately get back to those basic foundational principles where you come to America and seek the American dream."

He's just one of the best. He's like a local reporter. But people just waiting for the Border Patrol, and they are just pulling them up, processing them in about 24 hours, and releasing them. But that goes to the asylum laws, which Lindsey Graham wants to address. But are the Democrats going to agree to any of this stuff, or are they going to own the issues? Is that the goal here, make them own the issue if they don't move?"

Look, I think in the end this issue if properly messaged will be another huge winner for the president. Although his numbers are not good on immigration now. Have you seen this? I don't know if it's because people are seeing these videos and just frustrated, like why doesn't he fix this, and they're impatient. But his numbers for his dedication to this issue are not I know where he wants them to be."

Michelle joins me know, her first television comments about all this. Michelle, in the post that was taken down, you said I don't know how long it will be until I'm next. I love that.

I even have to worry about my own website at MichelleMalkin.com which is hosted by WordPress which is now going after people based on their ideological viewpoints. I do believe, Laura, that this is an existential battle, and I'm not saying that just because it's self-serving because I've made a living over the last 20, 25 years, a lot of it online and never had to worry about this kind of de-platforming. I'm saying this because we need a vibrant marketplace of ideas. We need an informed citizenry for a constitutional republic to function. And when Facebook and Silicon Valley overloads have their thumbs on the scale of free speech, that is a concern for all of us. There is a lot to people who have been de-platformed that folks out there might be uncomfortable with, but all I did that caused Facebook to censor me, Laura, was simply stand up for a couple of my friends, Laura Loomer and Gavin McInnes. And now even I, using my Facebook platform that has 2.1 million followers, cannot even mention their names without being accused of violating the, quote-unquote, community standards of Facebook."

A lot of people asked me after my CPAC and over the past year now that we have seen people disappear and be unpersoned, and the one thing people can do is fight back with their pocketbooks and fight back with the voices that they do have, and support the people who have disappeared. There's a website called FighttheCensors.com. It's helping people like Laura Loomer and Gavin McInnes, whose names I can't say on Facebook.
