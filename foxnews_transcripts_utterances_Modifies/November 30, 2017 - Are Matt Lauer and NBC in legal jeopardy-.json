It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" New fallout for Matt Lauer as more women come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against him. Also, new questions raised over NBC's call to scrap Ronan Farrow's explosive findings on Harvey Weinstein. Did the network know the piece might eventually lead back to Lauer? More on that in a moment. The disgraced morning news anchor released an apologetic statement today, but disputes some of the accusation. He says, there are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I'm committed to beginning that effort. It's interesting that's almost the exact same words that Al Franken used. Do you remember from last week?",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" New fallout for Matt Lauer as more women come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against him. Also, new questions raised over NBC's call to scrap Ronan Farrow's explosive findings on Harvey Weinstein. Did the network know the piece might eventually lead back to Lauer? More on that in a moment. The disgraced morning news anchor released an apologetic statement today, but disputes some of the accusation. He says, there are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions. Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I'm committed to beginning that effort. It's interesting that's almost the exact same words that Al Franken used. Do you remember from last week?"

And then they had to issue a second statement which says current management didn't have that kind of briefing, which is, you know -- so they're backpedaling, Brian, rapidly. And I think it's not so much to my mind that he might be in legal difficulties, although Kimberly said it's possible, but it's that -- the question of what NBC knew and when they knew it. You know, to put it in a sort of Nixonian Watergate."

And they took decisive action and there were complaints. Now there were complaints. Meredith Vieira says that he kept sex toys in his office. Hoda and Savannah, apparently knew a lot about this from reports we're hearing, but acted like they were totally unaware when they made the announcement. And Joe and Mika over at MSNBC said this was kind of a open secret. I know that's been a band phrase here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "But this was out there. And some of it was consensual, but a lot of it was not consensual. A lot of it was humiliating, degrading, harassment, borderline sexual assault if these reports are true. So, it looks like they have a problem because when you combine them spiking the Ronan Farrow-Weinstein piece, with them spiking the Juanita Broaddrick- rape-Bill Clinton piece, and basically protecting Matt Lauer for all these years, it doesn't look good for them. And they made a half a billion dollars in profits every year and the ratings were great and, you know, that entices people to cover up stuff like that. But it's a family over there. They say it's the Today Show family. And sometimes you're pressured into keeping things in the family and this is one of those examples."

Because what's consensual if the young woman is an ambitious young person at NBC, and you're talking about a man who's paid 20-plus million dollars a year is the franchise as you've discussed, the moneymaker in terms of morning television in America, and management says, you know what? You don't want to go there. Maybe we don't want to discuss this right now. What does it say to that young person?"

He or to some degree, although you watch Matt Lauer interview him after that, he didn't let him up for air. He didn't let Bill O'Reilly up for air at all. He was brutally -- he was relentless in that interview. Knowing that this was in his closet is unbelievable in retrospect. But in the big picture, the next thing -- when people say what's next? Although you see Jake Tapper, the less high profile producer, he's gone. OK. What's next I think is going to be the management. There's going to be gutting of the management of people who were playing by the rules that got them where they were today, but the rules say this is a huge error."

I think it looks very bad for them because it makes them look like they were trying to do kind of a cover-up. They don't want to do a story like that. And then now they have their own kind of skeletons in their own closet and it's such a big story. Ronan Farrow, obviously, was telling the truth, and there was an effort there to try to not talk about any stories like this, and not shine a light."

So if you listen to these women talk, and you read some of these accounts, and you close the book, and you go, I have to go do Meet the Press. I've got to be honest. I cannot back him anymore. It's a shame what I thought he was. It turns out he's not to be that. As opposed to, I better not lose the congressional black caucus. The first thing to do I believe is to do the right thing, what Kathleen Rice did. Kathleen Rice has been the hero of this entire this. I believe freshman, right? Freshman New York congresswoman has spoken out on both sides against -- she said she walked out of a meeting with Nancy Pelosi there because they weren't addressing the elephant in the room. That takes guts, telling Senator Franken to step aside. That's takes guts telling this guy, this icon to step aside. That takes guts before everybody else was doing."

And what Nancy Pelosi wanted to demonstrate that she is a leader to her members. But also then, I think she screwed up on Meet the Press when she talked about questioning these women. The same screw-up that my friend Jim Clyburn apparently made."

You see people think they have this free rein to behave in this way, but it's injurious to others and to women.

And also on twitter, you know you can turn off retweets? That's a general good rule. He doesn't need to retweet anything. He does fine tweeting on his own. Retreating I think is a bad idea. I also think this idea that they're fake but in general we know there are Muslim extremists, and therefore it's OK is wrong.

But that really help them in the midterm elections. This will be a little bit different. Obamacare, really, for many people, was a bridge too far because it was a step toward socialized medicine. So they just didn't like it. Everybody can understand tax cuts, but the debate will be with -- on the statistics. Does the economy actually continue to do better? Do wages go up? Do people see more money in their paychecks starting in January, and does that have an effect? And the Democrats are going to try very hard to say, clearly, this is only just going to the rich. Only the corporations are benefitting. And all or you people that voted for President Trump and are disappointed, we will have a better answer for you. That's what the debate is going to be.
