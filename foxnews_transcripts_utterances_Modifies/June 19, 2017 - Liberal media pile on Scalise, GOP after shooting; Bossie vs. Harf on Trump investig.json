One of them, obviously, in silhouette there on the right-hand side. So, this statement was sort of part of a one-two punch this evening.

When they capture that Ling reporter, they had Bill Clinton get on a plane to Pyongyang, and he bowed down and kissed Kim Jong-il's ring.

I kind of think the administration is there, but I think this will make it - it toughen them up a little bit to take these guys on if they need to. And also, our patience with China is going to run out here. If China doesn't really begin to get some noticeable result that is beginning to change the behavior of the North Koreans. Obviously, our major diplomatic and economic sanctions are coming through China's hands here. And if that doesn't work, then we're going to likely have to go it alone here with some very tough sanctions on North Korea. Also, I believe we have to look hard at some sanctions on China, hard at, get-tough policy with China throughout the Western Pacific and the South China Sea.

With their use of air power, and yet threaten if we fly west of the Euphrates, they're going to shoot us down. I think that's more bluster than anything else; it's intended to soothe the wounds of the Syrian military, and particularly their air force that Russia kind of has their back. But Russia, Martha, does not want to tangle with the United States. We -- their capability, the Russian capability at that airfield, that they have in Syria is vulnerable even though they have sophisticated missile defense there.

And breaking tonight: terror investigations underway in the capitals of two U.S. allies. In France, a man rammed his car into a police vehicle on the famous Champs-Elysees in Paris. The attacker was killed, the police were not injured but they feel they stop him from doing something horrific. And in the United Kingdom, a suspect plowed his van into a crowd of people, leaving late-night services at a London mosque. At least ten people were injured.

And when he went on that floor, supposedly, there are posters and he tried to take one. And the thing is, this poster, according to North Koreans, had a portrait of the leader. Now, the leaders there are deified, so when your house is flooded, you have portraits of the leaders on the wall, you're supposed to save those portraits of the cost of your own life. There's a story of a North Korean who's lighting a cigarette with the newspaper, that picture was of the leader, and he got sent to prison. So, they have this veneration for the iconography of the leaders, which they take very seriously. Now, if you're a North Korean security guard and you see a kid doing this, you have to turn him in or your life is in danger. So, this is the whole series of dominos to ensure the absolute horrific things happen."

They usually take our people as hostages, as our guest just said, use them as a bargaining chip. And something went wrong here I suspect that they overstepped their bounds and killed this youngster. But nonetheless, I think the one thing that will help us with from his death; certainly, it'll strengthen our resolve that we really have to do something once and for all about this regime. I kind of think the administration is there, but I think this will make it - it toughen them up a little bit to take these guys on if they need to. And also, our patience with China is going to run out here. If China doesn't really begin to get some noticeable result that is beginning to change the behavior of the North Koreans. Obviously, our major diplomatic and economic sanctions are coming through China's hands here. And if that doesn't work, then we're going to likely have to go it alone here with some very tough sanctions on North Korea. Also, I believe we have to look hard at some sanctions on China, hard at, get-tough policy with China throughout the Western Pacific and the South China Sea.

We retaliated. And we're going to do what's necessary for Syria or Iraq to protect our people who are supporting the forces on the ground. Then, we're not going to stand for anything like that. I also believe that the Russians threat that they impose if we fly west of the Euphrates, where we've conducted four actions west of the Euphrates in the last year. With their use of air power, and yet threaten if we fly west of the Euphrates, they're going to shoot us down. I think that's more bluster than anything else; it's intended to soothe the wounds of the Syrian military, and particularly their air force that Russia kind of has their back. But Russia, Martha, does not want to tangle with the United States. We -- their capability, the Russian capability at that airfield, that they have in Syria is vulnerable even though they have sophisticated missile defense there. They shot down one of our airplanes; we will probably take everything out that they have at that airfield. They know that they know our airpower capabilities in the Middle East on land, and also at sea is significant-"

HOWARD KURTZ, \"MEDIABUZZ\" HOST: Martha, while Steve Scalise remains hospitalized after his near-fatal shooting at a baseball practice, some liberals in the media are attacking him and his party.

Everybody wants to put everyone in a box, give everyone labels.

What didn't matter to them, were race, and gender, and sexual orientation, or the political views of the people that they were protecting which was their job.

I mean, if you look at what's happening in the Georgia Congressional Election right now, we have the Chairman of a - Leader of the Republican Party down there. A Republican who says, \"I think the shooting is going to win the election for us,\" and the Republicans are actually running a T.V. ad in there with the shooting. I mean that is disgusting.

I'm not blaming the left or Bernie or anyone else other than the shooter, but the left plays different games here. And when they have a chance to blame it on the right, they do it every time and now, they're so frustrated and angry and disgusted that Republicans are shoving back with some of the same tactics, which I don't like, but lets at least have some consistency."

And bottom line is that this lack of confrontation of Islamism, theocratic Islam, if you will, and allowing these ideologies to brew has now brought exactly what ISIS wants. The reason they commit acts of terror in London, in Paris, and in San Bernardino, is they want to start a spark so that there's an equal and opposite reaction. So, as a response, that opposite reaction of hyper-nationalism, bigotry, racial supremacism, is exactly what ISIS wants. So, as long as the West continues to deny, because of using Muslims as a minority, as a grievance group, as long as we deny that Islam is in that time of history in which it's confronting theocracy in Iran, and Saudi Arabia, and Syria. And we can do the work for reform here in the west that they just can't do in the Middle East.

Still ahead tonight, a major first amendment ruling that was handed on by the Supreme Court today. Even though they were directly involved, why are the Washington Redskins very happy about this tonight? Plus, is President Trump under investigation or not? If you watch the Sunday shows, you know there's a lot of back and forth about this. Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us with his thought on whether or not that is the case.

In a tweet last week, the president seemingly admitted that he was under investigation by special prosecutor Robert Mueller.

Look, the federal government, the Department of Justice, the FBI, doesn't give you that formal notice until they're well into the investigation."

      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Right. That's probably what happened, knowing the president as we both do. But the former director of the FBI laid out enough of the case, not to indict or convict, but to commence an investigation. And it is the things that James Comey said under oath."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",

And there's a look at Trump's legal, Marc Kasowitz, John Dowd on the right, who is a major league baseball attorney or has represented them, Jay Sekulow, who you just saw, and Michael Bowe, who we don't have a picture apparently. Here's Mueller steam, a couple of missing faces there as well, but those are some of the individuals that he has assembled. Who has the better team?"

John Dowd is among the more senior people in the criminal defense bar in Washington, D.C., and he knows everybody, as well. I'm very fond of Marc Kasowitz, but he's not a criminal defense guy. He's a team leader and a strategist. I think you're going to see a lot more faces on those screen the next time we do this."

And Marie Harf, former spokesperson for Obama state department. Both are Fox News contributors. Welcome to both of you. Good to have you both here tonight. David, let me ask you, just listen to the conversation the Judge and I had. I know, obviously, the administration wants to get off of this topic. It's technology week. Last week was infrastructure week. But they're having a tough time changing the narrative here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I think that the president has an incredible agenda and that's what he wants to stay focused on. He is the president of the United States, and he wants to talk about his tremendous agenda for the American people. The reason that he got elected was to create tax reform opportunities, to have an infrastructure builder take care of the crumbling roads and bridges, and to fix -- you know, the repeal and replace Obamacare. Along with many other issues of the day, that he is focused on, and this is a distraction. And this investigation has been going on for nearly a year now. August, it started last August. People need to understand -- if there was a shred of evidence, if there was a shred of evidence between -- the Trump campaign colluded with."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "My question is about the agenda. But what you're heading on -- I'm sorry to interrupt you. But you look at the tweets and you look at all of this, and these reports that are coming out in many different places that say that he's very fixated on this. That he's very upset about this investigation. And that he is dwelling on it and focusing on it. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "I would be too, if I were him because I would be frustrated that the left-wing media is out to get him. They are out to nullify an election for the first time. The permanent obstruction campaign that is going on in America is something we've never seen before, never seen the likes of before, and the president is a victim of this. And so, he is out there every day trying to do the job that he was elected to and he is being berated by leaks by this deep state, by the Department of Justice folks, these folks that are leaking every bit of information to try to make political points against the president when there's not a shred of evidence to show any wrongdoing whatsoever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And Marie, Washington loves this stuff. You know, they love hiring lawyers, they love digging into investigations. They're not particularly interested in the president's agenda. I mean, tonight, I was watching a lot of CEO's, a lot of technology folks, and they're all talking about business. They're all talking about Military contracts. They're talking about all kinds of things that they want to get done. The president has a very solid team by most accounts on both sides. So do you think that the other side of the aisle will be able to see its way clear to get anything done here? You've got health care they want to do before July 4th."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": ". it's not the left-wing media that is making this investigation grow and get press coverage. A lot of the reason that's happening is things that President Trump himself is doing. Look, sending Jay Sekulow out to say what he said had made that the new story today, instead of tech week. That did not do President Trump any favor in terms of defending him. So if President Trump could stop the tweeting, could stop doing some of the things that has made this investigation have legs, then maybe we actually would be talking about the agenda. But the problem is he can't seem to help himself from doing that. And he would actually I think do better."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "BOSSIE",

      "utterance": "True."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "So that's a fact and he knows it. So the other part of that is, is that he takes to social media to make sure he's able to bypass the left- wing media, who is out to get him. And so, he's able to speak directly to the American people, and in only 140 characters, he can only do so much. So I'm a believer in his use of twitter. Certainly, we can look at a tweet here and there and try to dissect it."
    },

But an 8-0 ruling, the justices sided with the band, they struck down the ruling against disparaging trademarks. The decision also being notice and hailed by the NFL's Washington Redskins, which is currently fighting its own battle with the feds over their mascot. Charlie Hurt is as a political columnist for the Washington Times, a very big flint fans, I know. Julie Roginsky is a Democratic analyst. Both are Fox News contributors.

But what I think it does shows is -- it does show that an absolute unified belief that the first amendment is there to protect offensive speech, not on offensive speech, or we wouldn't need the first amendment. And also, I think underscores the fact that we have federal bureaucrats in the federal government who don't have that same regard even in a case where you had 8-0 justices ruling that they'd been wrong all these years."

I mean, look, on Georgia somebody wanted to call themselves The Hitler's, they could do that, as well. We have a first amendment in this country for a reason, and in defense free speech.

This is a district that has been Republicans for a generation or more, the fact that it's even competitive does not bode well for the Republicans going to 2018."

His parents said this today. \"It will be easy at a moment like us to focus on all that we lost, future time that won't be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man. His curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person.\" You can tell, from the outpouring of emotion from the community that he touched, Wyoming, Ohio, and the University of Virginia, to name just two.
