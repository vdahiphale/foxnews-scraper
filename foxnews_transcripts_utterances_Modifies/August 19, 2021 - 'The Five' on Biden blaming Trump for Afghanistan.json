And we are deeply grateful for that and we know firsthand like I've been contacting friends of mine who served, and just trying to reach out to them which is what we all do because we have empathy and we have hearts and we have souls and we believe in prayer. That being said, you mentioned new Joe versus old Joe. I think that there's just one Joe. When he speaks it's a debacle. When he doesn't speak it's a  debacle. He's plumbing new depths of moronery (ph) in a career, what a 50- year career in government highlighted by the fact that he opposed the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden.

And all Joe Biden needs to say to make everyone feel confident is that the United States is going to do everything within our power no matter how long it takes to get all of our people home safely.  Do you think this would ever happen with Donald Trump? Donald Trump would never leave people behind in a hostile country like this. He was renowned for bringing back hostages. That was one of the best accomplishments in four years. So, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that Joe Biden was briefed throughout the summer that there were mass desertions going on within the Afghan army, collapse was rapidly occurring, and the Taliban takeover may have been imminent. Now, he didn't do anything about that. Didn't change his plan. Went out and lied to the American people and said everything's going to be just fine. I don't foresee it happening. So, the question is, did the commander-in- chief lie to the American people, strand thousands of Americans behind enemy lines, abandoned billions of dollars of lethal military equipment just to get a political photo op to pull out on 9/11? So Republicans, when they take the House back, they're going to have to decide is this high crime or misdemeanor.",

Here's a mom, when did you last see those images of moms handing babies to benign force so the baby doesn't get harmed? I hate to bring up the illusions, but it is unbelievably heart-wrenching to watch, but it also says another thing about America. Yes, we screwed up the plan, there was no evacuation plan.

And we are deeply grateful for that and we know firsthand like I've been contacting friends of mine who served, and just trying to reach out to them which is what we all do because we have empathy and we have hearts and we have souls and we believe in prayer. That being said, you mentioned new Joe versus old Joe. I think that there's just one Joe. When he speaks it's a debacle. When he doesn't speak it's a debacle. He's plumbing new depths of moronery (ph) in a career, what a 50- year career in government highlighted by the fact that he opposed the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden.

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Because here's the truth, the president has stranded thousands of Americans in a war zone and the only way for them to get out is an airport that's surrounded by an enemy. An enemy that's committing atrocities every single day on camera for the world to see. And I don't think the president understands that this is going to dominate the news cycle until every single American is evacuated safely. And sadly, he's created a kill zone. In the military they say that's where every single person that wants to leave has to funnel through the same route that's controlled by who? The enemy. So they're going to block them. They're going to kidnap them. They're going to shake them down or they might kill them. So now we have an Afghan hostage crisis where Americans are going to have to pay bribes to the Taliban to get out. The U.S. government might be paying them. Cash is king. Private entities could be paying them. We don't know, but we're going to have to be paying terrorists to evacuate Americans. Now, I know we want to get Afghans out too, but I want to get Americans out. That should be a priority. And right now, I think only 300 Americans left."

We don't know and we don't have the capability to go out and extract them. And all Joe Biden needs to say to make everyone feel confident is that the United States is going to do everything within our power no matter how long it takes to get all of our people home safely. Do you think this would ever happen with Donald Trump? Donald Trump would never leave people behind in a hostile country like this. He was renowned for bringing back hostages. That was one of the best accomplishments in four years. So, \"The New York Times\" is reporting that Joe Biden was briefed throughout the summer that there were mass desertions going on within the Afghan army, collapse was rapidly occurring, and the Taliban takeover may have been imminent. Now, he didn't do anything about that. Didn't change his plan. Went out and lied to the American people and said everything's going to be just fine. I don't foresee it happening. So, the question is, did the commander-in- chief lie to the American people, strand thousands of Americans behind enemy lines, abandoned billions of dollars of lethal military equipment just to get a political photo op to pull out on 9/11? So Republicans, when they take the House back, they're going to have to decide is this high crime or misdemeanor."

You know, your heart breaks because number one, it shows the absolute dysfunction of the evacuation. Here's a mom, when did you last see those images of moms handing babies to benign force so the baby doesn't get harmed? I hate to bring up the illusions, but it is unbelievably heart-wrenching to watch, but it also says another thing about America. Yes, we screwed up the plan, there was no evacuation plan. It was total dysfunction, but once that child was in that G.I.'s hand, you knew, we knew that that child was safe. That's America. We're going to get this -- we're going to get through this. We're going to get these people out. We're going to get our people out first as we should and we get the people that are like dear friends of ours who put their heart and soul on the line for America. We're going to get them out.

So, why tangle with the new landlord? If you know that you're not going to get air power and you know the United States is leaving, it seems that the fast transition that the Afghan army was allowing was just them looking out for their self-interest. It's like what -- like why fight, why go down with the ship, right? If the ship -- why don't I just, you know, I don't want them to kill my family so we'll just let them in. They made deals. I think in terms of accountability, they have -- we have to go further back. There were -- I mean, again, I always say it's on my head. I take responsibility for ignoring certain things. And, you know, I ignored claims of well-documented stories about fraud and misuse of funds because it wasn't, like it was Afghanistan. It was so confusing and blah, blah, blah or it was maybe it was just part of anti-war assumptions that I thought were silly, but they ended up being right.

It started to deteriorate big time right when the border catastrophe was at its zenith, gas prices started to go up, and labor shortage. Small business couldn't find workers, so people were pessimistic. Then, as Greg mentioned, you get into August, late July, he flip flops on masks as delta comes up, and then Afghanistan just put them below 50. People are feeling insecure, and they're not stable.
