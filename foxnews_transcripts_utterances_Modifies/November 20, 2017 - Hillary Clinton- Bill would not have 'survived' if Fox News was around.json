At a Clinton Foundation event marking the 25th anniversary of the '92 election -- I wasn't invited -- she said Bill wouldn't have survived if Fox News was around.",

So isn't Hillary agreeing with these new critics by saying FNC wouldn't have let Bill slide but the media monopoly did? So without knowing it, Hillary exposed the media's lack of guts while saluting Fox's. It's hilarious.   She also claims that Bill wouldn't have tweeted about his achievements as president. Someone should tell her Twitter wasn't around back then. Hillary, Twitter wasn't around back then. But what a blind spot she has to think that not tweeting makes Bill a man of sound character. He violated an intern in the Oval Office. Sorry, I'll take the tweeting instead. Which raises a question: What if FNC and twitter have been around back then when Bill was president? How would that have change things? Twitter would have kept Bill busy and Fox would have kept him in line, and perhaps Hillary would have ended up president. How hilarious is that? If Fox News was around, Hillary would have been president. Instead, Bill got away with all sorts of crap as the media covered for him. And now they call him on it years later only because there's no consequence. You can't throw a bum out that's been out for 17 years.   So Hillary, I'm glad you enjoyed the party at the Clinton Foundation. I hope Russia picked up the tab and someone besides Bill brought the cigars. So Dana, isn't this the irony is that she's coming out against two things that, if they existed, probably would have paved the way for her presidency because if Clinton had been impeached and resigned, that would have given them more moral authority to go after somebody like Trump.",

So I would just advise them, as they start to figure out how they're going to ask Congress for the money to appropriate, that yes, it will be possible to have an actual structure in certain places, but to take the win, if they get sort of more border security and virtual wall type of equipment down there.",

The media devotes way too much ink on -- on the irrational fascination with evil. We see hours of forensic files in all these special documentaries. Meanwhile, thousands of good people die every single day. They lead quiet, noble lives. The little old lady who slips in a bathtub that you don't ever hear about. The guy who gets hit by a bus, trying to meet his family. Della Reese died today. A great woman.",

So without knowing it, Hillary exposed the media's lack of guts while saluting Fox's. It's hilarious. She also claims that Bill wouldn't have tweeted about his achievements as president. Someone should tell her Twitter wasn't around back then. Hillary, Twitter wasn't around back then. But what a blind spot she has to think that not tweeting makes Bill a man of sound character.

And now they call him on it years later only because there's no consequence. You can't throw a bum out that's been out for 17 years. So Hillary, I'm glad you enjoyed the party at the Clinton Foundation. I hope Russia picked up the tab and someone besides Bill brought the cigars. So Dana, isn't this the irony is that she's coming out against two things that, if they existed, probably would have paved the way for her presidency because if Clinton had been impeached and resigned, that would have given them more moral authority to go after somebody like Trump."

It's not enough where Politico runs stories by you so you can approve them. I mean, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, all the newspapers, all the magazines, Facebook, twitter, Google, that's not enough? If that's not enough to carry Hillary over the finish line, maybe she didn't deserve it. And you're right, stunning admission. She is saying if Fox News was around, we would have been fair and balanced with the sex scandals.

I think that the wall, writ large, when they get down to business and start writing this legislation and having the discussion, I think it needs to be very clear that there's a lot of things that you can do on the security front, as the president has mentioned, a virtual wall in some places is going to be more practical, and it actually could help, probably, save lives of our Border Patrol agents before any actually structure can be built, because of just the terrain of that area. So I would just advise them, as they start to figure out how they're going to ask Congress for the money to appropriate, that yes, it will be possible to have an actual structure in certain places, but to take the win, if they get sort of more border security and virtual wall type of equipment down there."

I mean, a wall, some kind of physical obstruction, I think, makes it a little bit easier for their job in terms of making it more difficult for some of the menacing, you know, individuals that try to come over and violate the law."

Up 50 percent just from last year: 720 assaults on Border Patrol agents this year alone, not even counting September.

And they're confronted by large numbers, because they know the math on it, that you've got two guys, and then therefore, they can, you know, overcome them."

And we put in more of the type of equipment Dana was talking about: everything from drones to electronic surveillance. And all the rest. But I think in this instance, and it's very tragic. Because he wasn't even shot. He was beaten to death. So this is a really horrible personal type of attack where you have anger and violence involved. But I don't see why you would politicize it, then, as the basis for a wall when, as Jesse says, you know, crossings are down. In fact, they're a record down. And you've had 30 -- only 38 -- 38 -- agents involved in this kind of violence since '03. And one this year. So is this a new justification for building a wall that nobody in the U.S. wants and nobody in Mexico is willing to pay for? Apparently."

The advent of terror plus technology is going to make it possible for one person -- one person -- to sneak across with a drone and bioterror married together and create havoc that will make 9/11 look smaller.

And he has faithfully, every time, been summoned and gone to fight on behalf of these victims, prevent these animals from being released. That history and time should not forget the misdeeds and the horrific crimes that they committed.

So they've got the camera set up. Everything is good to watch the implosion. It's going to be great. Everything is perfect, and then as it's about to happen.
