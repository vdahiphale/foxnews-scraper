He will be leaving shortly, heading back to Washington, D.C., but not before reminding Wisconsinites and those in Kenosha in particular that the government has their back, that it will be looking after them, and great respect for the police who will continue doing the same.  He spoke in favor of peaceful protesters, but not when they cross the line and get into something decidedly different, something he says that has been playing out across this country, and not just in Kenosha.  Busy day. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is “Your World.’  So, for the president of the United States, who went ahead to Kenosha, despite the mayor there saying he shouldn't have, the governor saying, now is not the time. There were many others who did want to see him today, were grateful for that opportunity. Mark Meredith with more on the President's day -- Mark.",

The president and the attorney general had a chance to meet with some of the law enforcement officers that are trying to keep the peace here on the ground in Kenosha. The president also offered more than praise, promising some financial relief to this community that's been rocked by violence the last several days.  While he was here, he also had a chance to meet face to face with some of these small business owners that are really picking up the pieces after the violence that has really rocked this community. These small business owners are really trying to decide what they're going to do from here after their businesses were either destroyed or severely damaged.   The president also put out some tough words for the people responsible. This is what he had to say during a roundtable within the last hour:",

Well, President Trump's campaign manager said today that he hasn't seen the tightening of the race so much a response to the convention as it is just a whole bunch of voters tuning in right now. And so with the riots and the violence that has gone on, that is certainly getting a lot of attention and heightening awareness of the race.

And so I think that we can understand that law and order and justice can go hand in hand. There is a Justice for Breonna Taylor Act waiting for President Trump to lean into it and demand Congress sign it. There is a lot of justice reform bill that Tim Scott has authored waiting for President Trump to demand Congress do their job and get it enacted. So I think that there is a way for President Trump to actually carry the day, to tell the Republican Party and to tell America that, if you're in the streets for justice, that justice will not be deferred at the hand of the Republicans and certainly not in the name of Donald J.

You got to focus on one or two things. You also have to know how to communicate with people. You can't lead people if you don't have followers. You have to learn how to communicate with them by good writing or good oral communication or by leading by example. The most effective thing is leading by example. So, if you want to be a leader -- and not everybody wants to be a leader -- but if you want to be a leader, I have tried to outline what some of the most famous leaders in our country have done.

Right now, we have got two competing worlds across the Hudson River. On the West Side, we have got Hoboken, New Jersey. Across the river from there, you have got New York City.

We got to hire the same staff. You got to hire servers. You got to hire a manager for the front of the house. There's a whole bunch of dynamics if you're going to service it properly operationally that you have as challenges. So, I'm not sure. I think we can get a longer season by getting outdoor heaters. In New York City, you made the point earlier, I believe -- or someone did - - that gas-fired heaters are not allowed. They're illegal, but there -- electrical heaters are. It'll require some electrical installation, required some -- but restaurant tours, by nature, we're up to challenges. And this is a challenge, one more New.

And people who are on his circle went on national television and said it, like Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, who's from Michigan. She's from a state that we lost in 2016 that we did not need to lose. And I think Joe Biden's entire team is acutely aware of the fact that President Trump is running a law and order campaign. And whether you own it or not, this violence is going on. The looting and the rioting is unacceptable. And it's clearly separate from the peaceful protesting that we all support, or should support. We also saw a tightening with independents. And this was a key issue that they were talking about. Those independent voters are the ones that are going to sway this race. We know where Democrats are going. We know where Republicans are going, though there's that never-Trumper group who are on the Democratic side, though I don't really know how many people that is. So it's those independents that are going to decide this election. And they are paying attention to the rioting.

He's supposed to start traveling after Labor Day to swing states, things that we haven't really seen from Joe Biden all summer. And so, as the race is tightening, there's a lot of talk about was there a convention bounce for either party. Well, President Trump's campaign manager said today that he hasn't seen the tightening of the race so much a response to the convention as it is just a whole bunch of voters tuning in right now. And so with the riots and the violence that has gone on, that is certainly getting a lot of attention and heightening awareness of the race. And that's something that -- of course, that's why we saw Vice President Biden step up and address it, because this is something that voters are paying attention to. Exactly how much this is going to affect things and which message is going to end up being victorious, I think it's a little bit too early to tell which party has the edge there."

I think the reality is that it's -- every time a business burns, a Trump voter is born. But the fine print to that is that we have to be able to find a way to give dignity and to affirm the identity of individuals who feel as if they haven't been heard. I think every time we have somebody on TV equivocating on what happened in Kenosha, we lose not only a voter, we lose an entire subset of soccer moms in Pennsylvania. And so I think that we can understand that law and order and justice can go hand in hand. There is a Justice for Breonna Taylor Act waiting for President Trump to lean into it and demand Congress sign it. There is a lot of justice reform bill that Tim Scott has authored waiting for President Trump to demand Congress do their job and get it enacted. So I think that there is a way for President Trump to actually carry the day, to tell the Republican Party and to tell America that, if you're in the streets for justice, that justice will not be deferred at the hand of the Republicans and certainly not in the name of Donald J. Trump. And he can call America to come together around those things that I think will hand him reelection and, in the process, bring a fractured nation back together."

      "utterance": "I think, if you work less than 9:00 to 5:00 five days a week, you might have a very enjoyable life, you might play a lot of golf and tennis, but I don't think you're likely to make a big mark on the world. Now, there's obviously some people that would disagree. And some people have written one book, that's all they have ever done, and they had a big mark on the world. But, as a general rule of thumb, I think working harder is better than not working hard. I don't think you have to be brilliant. I don't think you have to be creative. I think you have to be reasonably intelligent. But working hard is very important. But, again, there are other criteria. I think focus is important. You can't try to do 1,000 things at once. You got to focus on one or two things. You also have to know how to communicate with people. You can't lead people if you don't have followers. You have to learn how to communicate with them by good writing or good oral communication or by leading by example. The most effective thing is leading by example. So, if you want to be a leader -- and not everybody wants to be a leader -- but if you want to be a leader, I have tried to outline what some of the most famous leaders in our country have done. They didn't do things perfectly. They'd all say they make mistakes. But most of them would say they had some luck, they worked hard, they had a persistence, and they overcame a lot of obstacles in their youth."

      "utterance": "You know, one thing that's interesting, too, in a lot of your conversations, that some of them, it's not about themselves. They have become very, very successful at what they do, but they readily share the credit with other people. And I'm -- and that is not among everyone you profile, but certainly most. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Ronald Reagan famously said, there's no limit to what humans can accomplish if they're willing to share the credit. And that's certainly true. So, to me, the most important thing, if you're a leader, is trying not to convince everybody that you're the superstar and you're making all the decisions. You got to convince them that they are helping you, and if they follow you, they will be better off. And that's a key to leadership. But I do think that sharing the credit is very important. As President Kennedy said, victory has 1,000 fathers and defeat is an orphan."

    {

      "utterance": "No, I think you're right. We try to tell our kids the same thing. But you know what I found fascinating, David, in looking at some of these people is, they overcame enormous doubters, naysayers, Jeff Bezos literally laughed at, some of the ideas that were imparted by President Clinton early on, that you could be a sort of a moderate Democrat and swing and entice more people into the party. That was dismissed pretty readily here."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But they had the courage of their convictions of all stripes, even George W. Bush, profiling him and how he was dismissed, and almost he relished the dismissiveness. And I'm wondering if there are lessons for all of us here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. John Kenneth Galbraith, the famous economist, once said, the conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. And he's right, because when people say you can't do something, in the end, they're probably wrong. And somebody comes along and does what Jeff Bezos did or Bill Gates did or Steve Jobs did proves that you can overcome conventional wisdom. And that's what really marks a great leader, overcoming conventional wisdom, and persisting, persisting, persisting. If people tell you no, no, no, you should be more inspired to go ahead and try to do it. Not everything will work that way. But, generally, the people I have written about and other leaders are people that overcame people who said they couldn't do what they wanted to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Right. Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "When you netted your first billion dollars, you could have just said, I'm done. I can kind of slow down. But you haven't. You didn't. And I'm thinking the same about Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Tim Cook, where you could -- you could argue with the success - - look at Tim Cook of late, post your book, coming out. His wealth has gone up fivefold, and Jeff Bezos now the $200 billion-plus man. But that doesn't -- I'm not saying it's unimportant to them, but it does not take the fire out of their belly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, the implication of the question is, work is not as much fun as not work. But, actually, for people who really are driven, work is the most pleasurable thing they can do. The trick is to make sure they have some time to do something else, because you want a more balanced life. But I think Jeff Bezos loves what he's doing. Bill Gates loves what he's doing. Steve Jobs loved what he was doing. And so I love what I'm doing. So I don't really want to just play golf or play tennis, neither of which I'm very good at. I want to do something that I think is making a contribution. And I would say that those people who build great companies think that they're making a contribution to the world. And I think they probably are. So, it's not -- just in your own career for example, you work very hard, and do you think that this is work, or is it pleasure? You enjoy doing it. If you enjoy doing it, it's not work. It's pleasure."

I like the way you can criticize yourself. I think my dad used to say that, if you can't laugh at yourself, you're going to miss the fun others are having doing it for you. But I think, in your case, even joking about -- your financial acumen is never in doubt. Yet you were among those saying, Carlyle invested in this up-and-coming company Amazon as soon as it went public, cashed out, or I think it was soon after it went public."

And I guess maybe, for whatever reason, I always look back and say, these are the mistakes I made, I should have done something better. Maybe it's not an endearing quality, but I can't resist it. In some cases, it's easy to say, I never made a mistake, but I don't think that's the right thing to do. I think people should look back and be honest about the mistakes they made, so you can learn from those mistakes. And, believe me, I made many of them, in addition to passing on the Facebook. When my daughter was at Harvard, and she met a young man that she's now married to, I heard about Facebook and I said, this was never going anywhere. And that was a mistake."

The Dow wants to complete the hat trick, I guess. It's only a few percentage points from a record itself, S&P and Nasdaq already there. What is the market telling us? Does it get you worried? Does it get you psyched? What?"

But I don't think it can keep going on like this forever. I just think something will change. As Herb Stein, the famous head of Council of Economic Advisers under President Nixon said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. And I just don't know if this can keep going on forever. I think the economy's in reasonably good shape because of the Fed and other things that Congress has done. But, at some point, I think the markets will take a breather."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "David, real quickly, the president said, just echoed again today before hopping a plane to go to Kenosha, that if you elect Joe Biden, market is going to crash, your 401(k) is going to be decimated. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "I think trying to predict what the market is going to do is very different. So, as I have said, I think the market will take a breather. But I don't really know exactly when that's going to be. If I did, I would take some action relating to it, but I don't really know. So it's just hard to say. I would say that the markets are probably going to tolerate whoever is elected president, but whoever is elected president will probably have to deal with very high deficits and debt. And, at some point, I suspect we will have to address the fact that right now half of our budget is coming from borrowing."

Couples were forced to stay home together, some homeschooling their kids. Throw in the stress of income loss and work from home, and it was just too much for some. Divorces jumped by 34 percent compared to last year, according to one survey, while interest in separation skyrocketed by 57 percent in April from February, with newer marriages of five years or less accounting for more than half of the divorces. Now, across America, couples in Southern states were far more likely to seek a breakup, highest divorce rates in Mississippi, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, and a spike in uncoupling during coronavirus, a trend seen around the rest of the world. For instance, in China, divorce rates hit records in some cities, while cases of domestic violence also jumped. Tough times, Neil."
