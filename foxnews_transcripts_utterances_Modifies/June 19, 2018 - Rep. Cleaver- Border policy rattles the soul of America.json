You can go really easy on someone or you can go really hard against someone. In the Clinton e-mail probe, every time there was a fork in the road, they went easy on Hillary Clinton and her associates, whether that was declining to ring people up on false statement charges, even though they knew they were giving false statements -- and that goes all the way up to and including Hillary Clinton -- or giving immunity to everyone in her orbit, they really took the path of just going easy on her.   And you look at that, and you take what we know about this Russia probe, where a very different course of action seems to be taking place, where people are rung up quite -- quite hard for everything that they're doing. Both of those things might technically be what the FBI is allowed to do, but that lack of consistency is really telling.",

But when you look at these troublesome texts and you put them in context, they were being written at the time that this -- that this Russia probe was being spun up. And it shows such animus against Donald Trump and a promise of a conspiracy to prevent his election, this is, at the very least, deeply problematic. And when the I.G. asked all these people who had these texts for explanation, they to a man said, oh, no we didn't mean anything bad by that.  But I think it's very hard to have a nice spin on some of these claims that they had about working to prevent his election, insurance policies to prevent his election, and all the just vile insults against Trump supporters, and fantasizing about his impeachment.

Now, a lot of this has to do with a trade flare-up that is very close to becoming a trade war. This started, remember, with $50 billion in tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods the president was imposing. Then the Chinese responded by saying, all right, we got $50 billion. And then of course that ignited the president's temper in a way we have rarely seen on this trade issue. He said, all right, just for that, another $200 billion. If you ever think of trying to top that, another $200 billion on top of that.   It got that nasty. It got that widespread. And for a while today, it got people that worried.

      "sentences": "Rhetoric and headlines and tweets, Neil, but the Dow and investors certainly taking notice, as these trade tensions -- we will call it tensions for now, not a war -- between the U.S. and China continues to ratchet up.  As you mentioned, the Dow off today 287 points. That's the sixth session in a row that the Dow has finished in the negative. We haven't done that for about 15 months. Year to date, the Dow is still hanging in there, essentially flat. The S&P and the Nasdaq still up just slightly for the year, but, as you can see, down about 0.1 percent on the Dow so far this year. But certainly talk of trade tensions has a habit of forcing investors to sell and uncertainty certainly no friend to the markets.  Let's take a look. It's not just here that the shudders are being felt a little. It's around the world. Check out the agent markets ahead of the opening today on the Dow, and you can see across the board the Hong Kong down nearly 3 percent. Shanghai, by the way, that was the worst performance in two years today, down nearly 4 percent. Same story in Europe, maybe not as extreme. They're not in the crosshairs, but they certainly are affected. Germany one of the biggest losers today, the DAX down more than 1 percent in Frankfurt. The French -- the CAC also in France down 1 percent. Now, what about the big companies that get wrapped up in all of this? Well, certainly, Boeing is one of those, the big airplane maker, the jet engine maker, lost again today, down nearly 4 percent. It's been down nearly 8 percent just over the past week for Boeing. And another name that always comes up, caterpillar, the big machine maker, also down about 3.5 percent, also 8 percent over the last week. All of this on what it could mean to get into a tariff war with China. But what it means to you and me? We know what it does to the markets. We know what it does to big companies, but what about consumers? Well, consider this. How about Canadian lumber? There's been a 20 percent tariff on Canadian lumber going back to last November. According to the National Association of Home Builders, that adds $9,000 to the price of a new single family home. And that's been in place since January of this year. So there is an impact that. What about car prices? What if we put a 25 percent tariff on imports? Well, for instance, the GM Envision SUV, which is actually made in China -- there are a handful that are made there to come back here -- it will cost you an additional $8,000.  That's potential impact. We don't have that in place right now. And then there is washing machines. We have a tariff. We do have a 20 percent tariff on those. In the past three months, we know that the prices on washing machines have gone up 17 percent. There really is an impact, Neil, even though we look at the big companies in the markets, it is having an impact, because a tariff is a tax. And, by the way, I should note that Amazon and Netflix hit all-time highs today, which mean investors probably worried about the trade wars decided go shopping online and watch a movie.",

You have economic growth this quarter, by our views at Kingsview, that is going to be over 4 percent on average annualized basis. You have got average hourly earnings at multiyear highs. You have got the stock market just a skosh off of all- time highs. And you have got more jobs available than we have workers available.

To me, these tariffs are not going to get there. We're about 10 years too late on the theft of intellectual property. That doesn't mean we shouldn't address it right now. This made in China 2025 is what President Trump is worried about. The E.U. is also worried about that. But we're fighting the E.U. too right now. So we don't have any allies right now. We're putting tariffs on these guys. And I'm not sure that tariffs are the answer. The downside potential to this is huge. It looks like it's a negotiation tactic. I hope it is.",

Well, when you read through this report -- and I think we're all getting to spend more time with it and understand its significance -- technically, it's just about the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. But it's totally related to the Russian probe as well. One of the things the I.G. looks at is how you have broad discretion when you're in the FBI. You can go really easy on someone or you can go really hard against someone. In the Clinton e-mail probe, every time there was a fork in the road, they went easy on Hillary Clinton and her associates, whether that was declining to ring people up on false statement charges, even though they knew they were giving false statements -- and that goes all the way up to and including Hillary Clinton -- or giving immunity to everyone in her orbit, they really took the path of just going easy on her. And you look at that, and you take what we know about this Russia probe, where a very different course of action seems to be taking place, where people are rung up quite -- quite hard for everything that they're doing. Both of those things might technically be what the FBI is allowed to do, but that lack of consistency is really telling."

But they argue that it cost Hillary Clinton the election, that that bias or whatever, whether to go light or not, nevertheless took on enormous implications so soon before the campaign. But very little has been explored until today about what might have been festering in the background on this Russian probe. And I'm wondering. Again, I know I keep trying to find context for the remarks we got from Strzok and others for their incredible, over-the-top, damning comments about then candidate Trump, whether that was part of it, they were privy to something that wasn't available to everybody else at the time, and that was driving it, or they just hated him."

So I think the anger from Democrats is that they weren't better at helping Hillary Clinton and they did such a bad job with it. But when you look at these troublesome texts and you put them in context, they were being written at the time that this -- that this Russia probe was being spun up. And it shows such animus against Donald Trump and a promise of a conspiracy to prevent his election, this is, at the very least, deeply problematic. And when the I.G. asked all these people who had these texts for explanation, they to a man said, oh, no we didn't mean anything bad by that. But I think it's very hard to have a nice spin on some of these claims that they had about working to prevent his election, insurance policies to prevent his election, and all the just vile insults against Trump supporters, and fantasizing about his impeachment. They can say they didn't mean anything wrong by that, but I think reasonable people will have a very difficult time believing that."

Now, a lot of this has to do with a trade flare-up that is very close to becoming a trade war. This started, remember, with $50 billion in tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods the president was imposing. Then the Chinese responded by saying, all right, we got $50 billion. And then of course that ignited the president's temper in a way we have rarely seen on this trade issue. He said, all right, just for that, another $200 billion. If you ever think of trying to top that, another $200 billion on top of that. It got that nasty. It got that widespread. And for a while today, it got people that worried. Ashley Webster keeping track of all of it. Ashley, whoa."

      "utterance": "Rhetoric and headlines and tweets, Neil, but the Dow and investors certainly taking notice, as these trade tensions -- we will call it tensions for now, not a war -- between the U.S. and China continues to ratchet up. As you mentioned, the Dow off today 287 points. That's the sixth session in a row that the Dow has finished in the negative. We haven't done that for about 15 months. Year to date, the Dow is still hanging in there, essentially flat. The S&P and the Nasdaq still up just slightly for the year, but, as you can see, down about 0.1 percent on the Dow so far this year. But certainly talk of trade tensions has a habit of forcing investors to sell and uncertainty certainly no friend to the markets. Let's take a look. It's not just here that the shudders are being felt a little. It's around the world. Check out the agent markets ahead of the opening today on the Dow, and you can see across the board the Hong Kong down nearly 3 percent. Shanghai, by the way, that was the worst performance in two years today, down nearly 4 percent. Same story in Europe, maybe not as extreme. They're not in the crosshairs, but they certainly are affected. Germany one of the biggest losers today, the DAX down more than 1 percent in Frankfurt. The French -- the CAC also in France down 1 percent. Now, what about the big companies that get wrapped up in all of this? Well, certainly, Boeing is one of those, the big airplane maker, the jet engine maker, lost again today, down nearly 4 percent. It's been down nearly 8 percent just over the past week for Boeing. And another name that always comes up, caterpillar, the big machine maker, also down about 3.5 percent, also 8 percent over the last week. All of this on what it could mean to get into a tariff war with China. But what it means to you and me? We know what it does to the markets. We know what it does to big companies, but what about consumers? Well, consider this. How about Canadian lumber? There's been a 20 percent tariff on Canadian lumber going back to last November. According to the National Association of Home Builders, that adds $9,000 to the price of a new single family home. And that's been in place since January of this year. So there is an impact that. What about car prices? What if we put a 25 percent tariff on imports? Well, for instance, the GM Envision SUV, which is actually made in China -- there are a handful that are made there to come back here -- it will cost you an additional $8,000. That's potential impact. We don't have that in place right now. And then there is washing machines. We have a tariff. We do have a 20 percent tariff on those. In the past three months, we know that the prices on washing machines have gone up 17 percent. There really is an impact, Neil, even though we look at the big companies in the markets, it is having an impact, because a tariff is a tax. And, by the way, I should note that Amazon and Netflix hit all-time highs today, which mean investors probably worried about the trade wars decided go shopping online and watch a movie."

And that obviously is going to end up impacting the consumers. But let's just look at the backdrop, my friends. You have economic growth this quarter, by our views at Kingsview, that is going to be over 4 percent on average annualized basis. You have got average hourly earnings at multiyear highs. You have got the stock market just a skosh off of all- time highs. And you have got more jobs available than we have workers available. So to me, while we could see a few extra pennies at the grocery store if you're buying some fruit, maybe melon, which you shouldn't be buying anyway, because it's gross, there's not going to be a big impact to you as the consumer just yet."

That's what President Trump said at the G7, saying that if you lower your tariffs, China, Mexico, E.U., Canada, we will also lower ours. And so far only $50 billion has actually been imposed. The $200 billion today that was discussed has been just suggested. But I'm worried, because, yes, it damages relationships, it can cause higher inflation due to higher prices passed on to the consumer, because it costs more for the likes of companies like Campbell's Soup or auto manufacturers here like GM and Ford in the U.S. to produce their goods, because the cost of raw materials is going to go up if we place tariffs on our allies and China, because that is a form of tax."

To me, these tariffs are not going to get there. We're about 10 years too late on the theft of intellectual property. That doesn't mean we shouldn't address it right now. This made in China 2025 is what President Trump is worried about. The E.U. is also worried about that. But we're fighting the E.U. too right now. So we don't have any allies right now.

So, from early March to now, you could make the argument the Chinese have a lot more financially on the line. They're trying to rein in and overheated economy and all that, so they have a vested interest in seeing that this doesn't go against their interests on paper. That's the rational view.

A man who once never really loved his country, save under duress or orders or whatever you want to call it, is going to be meeting with Vladimir Putin in the fall, a host of other dignitaries who have invited him.

China is referred to often as North Korea's big brother. China has taken credit for what it perceives as success from the summit between United States and North Korea. And so it looks like North Korea is sort of debriefing the Chinese and telling them what they think. And the Chinese are certainly probably giving the North Koreans some advice about what to do next vis-a-vis the United States, because this next step is that they're supposed to be making moves to denuclearize.

He hasn't done that with any other country. And so that remains to be seen. But it is interesting how hard he is being and relentless. You got to wonder. Something's got to give. I would like to see the Chinese continue to put pressure on North Korea. That's not what they have done. In fact, the Chinese have begun to relax some of their trade restrictions that they had on North Korea leading up to the summit and since then. President Trump even acknowledged that and said that's OK, as long as they're continuing to help the North Korea issue. So there's a lot going on there.

They're trying to settle this immigration issue where kids are getting separated from their parents. It's become this sort of what the heck do we do about this, as if it's exclusively a Republican problem. But you know how the P.R. is to anybody. They worry about this and how it's going to fall out.

Now, what the president is trying to do and at least Senate Republicans have been trying to do is come up with something that will at least avoid or have legislation that would stop these families who get separated, even though this is something that was really put in place back when Bill Clinton was president. Now, no other president has exercised that to the degree this administration has. Nevertheless, the pressure is on Republicans right now to take this onus off of them, as if they're solely to blame for this. But it's become an embarrassing point for Senate Republicans and then, of course, House Republicans, who are going to be meeting with the president in about an hour.

The midterm elections are coming up. They obviously want this addressed. Many conservatives, Gabby, and you have reminded this as well, have been using this sort of as a lightning rod to differentiate some Republicans that they're just honoring the law, they're not mistreating kids, they're just doing what the original intent was, to police those who try to, they say, break into this country. Where is this going?"

And it's certainly something that's going to be discussed when President Trump meets with House Republicans on the Hill in just about an hour. If you asked Republicans who are facing reelection this fall what they envisioned themselves talking about and arguing over six months before the midterm elections, they would not say family separations at the border. This is something that has become a P.R. nightmare for the Republican Party. And that's why we're hearing from so many Senate Republicans and now House Republicans, people like House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, who is making an effort and drafting legislation at the moment to create some one-off solution to end this practice. I think there is a great deal of concerns about the P.R. campaign that is being waged by Democrats and progressive groups ahead of the midterm elections and really how this entire situation is unfolding and impacting the GOP and the administration."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Gabby, you could go back to the Clinton years, when, of course, we had this tougher policy on dealing with those who try to come into this country for asylum or whatever means. And while it was understood that you would avoid the kids going with the parents into a situation where they would essentially be in a jail, and that was the heart of this, it then was taken to a new level by the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to really get tough and separate them, albeit, they argued, for limited periods of time. But it is what it is, and here they are now. So, how much of this is going to thrown back on Jeff Sessions' lap and that he was the one who botched it?"

      "speaker": "MORRONGIELLO",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think that the policy that Jeff Sessions enacted, which is a zero tolerance policy that creates criminal prosecutions for every single person who crosses into our country illegally, is separate from what's happening with the family separations. It's obviously the primary cause of the surge in children being separated from their parents at the border, but it's not a policy in and of itself. And that's something that's been mistaken by the media over the past few weeks, as we have talked about this and as the...."

But that's for others to debate who know this issue far better than I. But I am curious as to how Republicans are leaping on this, because it clearly seems they were embarrassed. And for some of them who might welcome the economic and market improvement, today notwithstanding, under this president, they have often recoiled at some of his more controversial moves and statements. And this is chief among them. So, was this their opportunity?"

They would prefer to be talking about their tax bill. They would prefer to be any talking about improved economic conditions, about the raging economy, things that are really crucial for voters to be paying attention to come November."

And we know the views they had of then candidate Trump. They didn't like him. But what is revealing in the Horowitz report is all these other unnamed agents who harbored similar, if not far more damning views. \"I'm just devastated. Can't wait until I can leave today and just shut off the world for the next four days,\" this, of course, somebody who wasn't very happy about the election results. \"You think Hillary Clinton is going to win, right? You think we get nails and some boards in case she doesn't? Well, she better win. Otherwise, I'm going to be walking around with both of my guns.\" And again and again, these are multiple agents, multiple folks at the FBI who harbored these views of then president candidate Donald Trump. There are a lot of them there. And a lot of Republicans today, even some Democrats saying, are finding out, who are these people? Why are they all unidentified? Of course, Horowitz not letting on or revealing the identities. But it's fair to say that it goes just beyond the two lovebirds here, right? So it does raise legitimate questions about whether this was a pack of folks who really didn't care very much for Donald Trump. Now, you could -- benefit of the doubt, give them context for this. Maybe they were privy to some information. But were they all privy to this information? Because a whole bunch of people didn't like Donald Trump. Former FBI Assistant Director Ron Hosko on all of this. Ron, what are we to make of all that?"

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, it should come as no surprise that FBI employees, FBI agents -- here, I think some FBI lawyers -- held their own personal political views, and in some cases expressed them to others in the work force. And they, of course, were captured and then shared with the inspector general during the conduct of his investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, Ron, they work at the FBI. I look at people like you who are -- you have to be really smart and shrewd to work at the FBI. It's not just any Schmoe. They're freely texting back and forth these views about a guy who could become the next president of the United States. Few even envisioned it and scoffed at it. But I thought they were smarter than that, which makes me think, how rampant was this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOSKO",
      "utterance": "Well, I suspect it was probably a bit more widespread than the report reflects. Just these folks were captured because they were so proximate to the investigations that the inspector general was looking at. And, yes, I agree with you. I would hope that the work force was smarter than this, that if they were sharing these sorts of point of views, they would do that privately or not on devices that were owned and the content captured and saved by the FBI. I don't know that it changes much."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Should we know their identities, Ron? Would it make any difference? These come out, and the inspector general comes out, and I suspect, where there's smoke, there's fire, or there's many more who harbored these views. These ones, I don't know the means by which they became part of this report, but they did. And I'm wondering how many more there might be and whether the president has a legitimate gripe, whether you like him or not, to say this was a cabal targeting him."

      "utterance": "Yes, I think it's that, Neil, to say, look, it wasn't just Strzok and page. There were others. And those others did have an intersection with these important cases. And I think that's why these folks will be the subject of follow-on inspector general investigation or FBI inspection division investigation. And I do think they will be subject to punishment for it, and maybe very severe punishment, because they let their personal political views get too close to the work that they were supposed to do, that it raised doubts and questions about their professionalism, about their use of FBI communications technologies. And I think there's going to be a price to be paid by these folks."

A lot of your Democratic colleagues say, Republicans are heartless, they're mean, they're ripping kids from their parents' arms, and they meant to do it, it's all targeted, they're heartless.

And they were not as humane as I would like, because I think the kids were having some trauma when I saw them down outside of Brownsville, Texas. But the problem we have now is that this has been ratcheted up to a point where we're talking about thousands of kids. And the days gone by, when I didn't know about it, we still -- we had kids, but it was nothing at this same level. And I think it's tugging, as I said, at the soul of the country."

And we can't continue this, because it's tearing -- it's ripping through the fabric of this country. And it's going to continue. And that is, we don't go through regular order.

So we should be meeting now. A group of us have been meeting here, a group of Democrats, talking about the fact that when and if we ever resume power in the House, that we're going to push against our own leadership about writing bills, leaving the other side out, because then, whenever they come back, they will say, well, we remember that.
