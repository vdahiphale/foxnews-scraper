If they were, they would invite Larry Summers to the White House to give the entire cabinet and senior staff, like Ron Klain, a tutorial in basic economics. Last week, the New York Times described the Build Back Better plan as filled with budget gimmicks, and noted that the price tag is likely closer to $4 trillion, not $1.8 trillion. It's pretty simple. Printing and borrowing money than flooding the economy with it will guarantee that inflation only gets worse. But Biden's again don't care. They don't care. They're not interested in solving problems. To them, it's always about controlling the narrative. And 'The Hill' today, quotes \"A democratic donor telling the White House to get in front of the issue, that they can't let Republicans run this narrative\". And sure enough, the White House has launched a media blitz to stem the political bleeding. But again, they get it wrong. Biden and his team don't have a political problem. They don't have a communications problem, or a narrative problem. They have a substantive problem. Their policies are not working in large part, because these people are incapable of understanding or predicting how the U.S. economy actually works. But the voters, oh, they seem to understand, because they live in the real world that Rick Santelli mentioned earlier on in the 'Angle'. Every day, they live in that world, and they have to pay actual bills. Bills that come due. They don't just roll them over a year after year after year like the federal government. Families understand that because of Biden's energy policies, they could be forced to choose between heating their homes, or feeding their kids this winter. They feel less hopeful, and they feel less safe on the streets. And by the way, not just in urban America, but the suburbs as well are waking up. A new morning console \"Politico\" poll explains why. The survey found that suburbanites trust the GOP more than the Democrats on the economy by 16 points; on jobs by eight points; on gun policy and immigration policy by 12 points; on national security by 19 points. That is devastating. Look, suburban voters aren't stupid. Rural voters aren't stupid. And urban voters aren't stupid. But Democrats keep treating them as if they are. Atlanta is suffering the worst of all major U.S. cities. Prices are up 7.9 percent over a year ago there. And it's not much better in St. Louis and Phoenix, where prices jumped 7 percent. And, of course, the nincompoops running our government, they just get off scot-free, because the press routinely covers for them. Indisputable facts, remember, were dismissed as right wing fiction.",

And I've been trying to think of the right word for what Biden's doing. Bidenomics is not negative enough. He's really doing econ aside. He's got a demand stimulus, that's as big as we've ever seen. And then he's whacking the heck out of supply. He's regulating firms, promising big tax hikes, you'd have the highest marginal tax rate in the whole developed world if they pass those tax hikes. And all that is basically creating, all this cash chasing supply, but supply is going down. And so you see inflation. People sort of say, Oh, it's looking like the 1970s. I actually think it could be worse than the 1970s, if you look at all these forces. These are policy errors that are unlike anything economists have ever seen.

If she gets this nomination and appointment as the head of the currency, which means she's the top regulator of all banks, she'll be bringing that shovel from Khrushchev to work every day to bury us. She'll bear the oil and gas industry. Prices will skyrocket. And we will be left cold in the winter and sweating in the summer. Because, Laura, you cannot run America on green energy. Renewables are fine to be in your portfolio. But we have to have thermal gas, we have to have coal, and we have to have nuclear. We saw it in our freeze last year in Texas, we needed more thermal gas, not more Green New Deal. So she would drive the price up on her way to destroying it. And you say, well, how can you destroy someone if you're driving the price up and their profits are going up? It's just a matter of time before, under her ideas of Karl Marxism, theory of revolution, economic analysis to destroy that industry. And when you destroy the oil and gas industry, you lose our independence from the world. And it's not coming back. And in Texas, it cost us 400,000 jobs and about $14 billion a year in state and local taxes.",

Remember, he was strutting on stage in Glasgow, wearing a mask and then taking it off when he spoke, makes zero sense. Everyone knows it. And on the childcare issue that Pete mentioned, how is it that during the pre-pandemic Trump years, childcare issues somehow didn't prevent the lowest unemployment on record for women? And by the way, rising wages as well. The fact of the matter is, neither Biden nor his transportation, his energy, nor his Treasury Secretary have a clue about how to get people back to work, or how to fix the supply chain issue.

If they were, they would invite Larry Summers to the White House to give the entire cabinet and senior staff, like Ron Klain, a tutorial in basic economics. Last week, the New York Times described the Build Back Better plan as filled with budget gimmicks, and noted that the price tag is likely closer to $4 trillion, not $1.8 trillion. It's pretty simple. Printing and borrowing money than flooding the economy with it will guarantee that inflation only gets worse. But Biden's again don't care. They don't care. They're not interested in solving problems. To them, it's always about controlling the narrative. And 'The Hill' today, quotes \"A democratic donor telling the White House to get in front of the issue, that they can't let Republicans run this narrative\". And sure enough, the White House has launched a media blitz to stem the political bleeding. But again, they get it wrong. Biden and his team don't have a political problem. They don't have a communications problem, or a narrative problem. They have a substantive problem. Their policies are not working in large part, because these people are incapable of understanding or predicting how the U.S. economy actually works. But the voters, oh, they seem to understand, because they live in the real world that Rick Santelli mentioned earlier on in the 'Angle'. Every day, they live in that world, and they have to pay actual bills. Bills that come due. They don't just roll them over a year after year after year like the federal government. Families understand that because of Biden's energy policies, they could be forced to choose between heating their homes, or feeding their kids this winter. They feel less hopeful, and they feel less safe on the streets. And by the way, not just in urban America, but the suburbs as well are waking up. A new morning console \"Politico\" poll explains why. The survey found that suburbanites trust the GOP more than the Democrats on the economy by 16 points; on jobs by eight points; on gun policy and immigration policy by 12 points; on national security by 19 points. That is devastating. Look, suburban voters aren't stupid. Rural voters aren't stupid. And urban voters aren't stupid. But Democrats keep treating them as if they are. Atlanta is suffering the worst of all major U.S. cities. Prices are up 7.9 percent over a year ago there. And it's not much better in St. Louis and Phoenix, where prices jumped 7 percent. And, of course, the nincompoops running our government, they just get off scot-free, because the press routinely covers for them. Indisputable facts, remember, were dismissed as right wing fiction."

They need to put an end to this inflation- exploding disaster before things spiral any more out of control before; Americans start dying from these irresponsible policies. And that's the 'Angle'. All right. Joining me now is Kevin Hassett, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Trump, author of \"The Drift: Stopping America's Slide to Socialism\".

The shelves are empty, but it's the supply disruption; the prices are going up, but it's transitory. But it's not. When inflation gets this high, it just keeps going up. And I've been trying to think of the right word for what Biden's doing. Bidenomics is not negative enough. He's really doing econ aside. He's got a demand stimulus, that's as big as we've ever seen. And then he's whacking the heck out of supply. He's regulating firms, promising big tax hikes, you'd have the highest marginal tax rate in the whole developed world if they pass those tax hikes. And all that is basically creating, all this cash chasing supply, but supply is going down. And so you see inflation. People sort of say, Oh, it's looking like the 1970s. I actually think it could be worse than the 1970s, if you look at all these forces. These are policy errors that are unlike anything economists have ever seen. And finally, the last thought is where are the economists? I mean, Larry Summers, you're right to cite him. But there's - the academy is just silent about this.

We didn't do this giant stimulus, we basically tried to fill the holes as we recognize how big they're going to be. By the end of the year, we had just about leveled it off. The GDP growth after the biggest decline since the Great Depression was about level for the year, because President Trump sized it correctly. Then Joe Biden comes in, and he gives you the biggest stimulus every while he attacked supply. And so, it's really a policy error for the agents. It's - inflation right now at six (inaudible) inflation is at eight is going to go up from there in all likelihood. And there's no sign at all that it's temporary or transitory."

Renewables are fine to be in your portfolio. But we have to have thermal gas, we have to have coal, and we have to have nuclear. We saw it in our freeze last year in Texas, we needed more thermal gas, not more Green New Deal. So she would drive the price up on her way to destroying it. And you say, well, how can you destroy someone if you're driving the price up and their profits are going up?

Regardless of your politics, Pfizer is clearly targeting children here, promising them that taking the vaccine makes them superheroes. I'm sorry, a COVID vax does not make you a member of the Justice League.

But I don't think it was surprising for New Jerseyans. And we started our exploratory committee in June. We knew that this was going to be an opportunity for us. But I think really what the deal for me and what really brought me over the edge is what happened on August 17th with this disastrous Afghanistan evacuation.

Imagine New Jersey and New York City not having serviceable roads and tunnels. It would be a disaster for our economy. But at the end of the day, if this is the best bill that can be put forward by our Congress, then that is a great reason to run for Congress. This is a terrible bill. It's filled with pork barrel spending. It's filled with green initiatives that at this juncture just aren't serviceable for our economy. We need to think about grey infrastructure, bridges, rail, roads, tunnel. At the end of the day, this bill just does not answer the mail for that."
