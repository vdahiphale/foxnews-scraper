Kim's retort to the president's U.N. speech went like this: \"I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.\" So, there's that. Then, came the President response: \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who was, obviously, a madman, who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before.\" So, that led to these headlines in the New York Times: \"Kim Jong-un called Trump a dotard.\" How harsh is that burn? The Washington Post: \"Sorry, Trump, you were Trumped. Kim Jong-un Insult level: expert.\" And this tweet from Comedian Chelsea Handler: \"Uhhhh, Kim Jong's letter to @realDonaldTrump is a little bit saner than @realDonaldTrump. Maybe we trade?\" That, as we learn that Kim is considering testing a hydrogen bomb in the atmosphere which could rain down radioactive nuclear material all over the Pacific or wherever it, God forbid, might crash land. So, with all that on our plate, in moments, we will talk to former CIA officers about this latest threat: Buck Sexton and Marie Harf. But we begin with Trace Gallagher, live on the west coast newsroom with the real story on the danger of Kim Jong-un.",

      "sentences": "You know, Martha, Kim Jong-un's anti-Trump statements marked the first time that Kim, the younger, has ever issued a comment directly against another head of a state. And experts say, that's an indication that the standoff is escalating and that Kim might be willing to live up to his threats -- which is saying something, considering the North Korean leader has reportedly put his uncle in front of a firing squad, had his half-brother poisoned with nerve gas, and presides over one of the poorest countries in the world, yet has used its resources to build a nuclear weapons program. Kim Jong-un himself has gone on state-run television claiming his country has successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb underground. Some remain skeptical of those claims, but there are no doubters when it comes to North Korea's rapid firing of ballistic missiles. 22, this year alone, including one, the Pentagon says, could have reached the shores of the United States. Some Korean analysts believe Kim Jong-un's nuclear weapons are nothing more than insurance policies for his regime to maintain power. But they also believe his behavior is getting erratic and risky. For example, the recent firing of a missile over North Japan had that missile fallen short, as the majority of North Korea missiles have. It could easily have landed inside Japan and then declared an act of war. And many U.S. authorities still say the brutal treatment of American student, Otto Warmbier, while he was held in North Korea prison, and who died days after coming to the U.S. was very much a provocation by Kim Jong-un. The U.S. president's going back to 1969, have chosen not to retaliate against Pyongyang, but the tone and tenor appear to be changing. Watch.",

And the reality here is that there should be a bipartisan sense that we face a very real and growing problem from Kim Jong-un, that we face a regime that we cannot really guess what their next steps are going to be.

I mean, that's at the crux of how you deter a country from using nuclear weapons once they have them.   I think what worries me a little bit and what worries other people is that if we get trapped in this really escalatory rhetoric where it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, there is a bigger chance that someone like Kim Jong-un, who is crazy, will miscalculate and will do something stupid, and it will start a wider conflict that has really serious consequences for the U.S., for our allies, and for our American soldiers -- for example, who are stationed in the DMZ today.

But on this point about the escalation of rhetoric, let's understand that there's also been an escalation of capability from the North Korean regime, there has been an escalation of provocation. They've been doing more aggressive, belligerent stuff in recent months than they have for years prior to that. And so, the status quo is unsustainable. The way that we've been approaching North Kora, the Obama administration's strategic patience, which is really just a fancy way of saying, don't do very much.  This notion of kicking the can down the road endlessly, won't come with any problems. We can literally see the problems getting worse and going further with these missiles. And that's what I think the president understands now and trying to take action on. And I should note that the, you know, allies that we have in the region understand that miscalculation has always been at play here. There's always been the possibility that Kim Jong-un might actually try to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force.

So, we can debate about how to prevent Iran from getting a weapon. I would, obviously, argue that the Iran deal does that and staying in it is the best way to do that. I'm sure they would disagree with me.

You mentioned John McCain, joining Rand Paul as two \"no\" votes. A tiny glimmer of hope for the bill if Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins vote \"yes\". But Collins has but said she's going to vote \"no\". That means, the expiration date premiers in reconciliation, where the president could use just 51 votes in the Senate. If he gets this through, it's done at the end of the month. So, now, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer can bank on the fact that it will take 60 votes to pass any health reform.

So, any moment now, we're going to watch this stage fill up and this crowd probably go pretty wild, as they usually do when President Trump walks out there because this is Huntsville, Alabama, a place or he's very popular. So, he's taken sides in a fierce Republican Senate primary. In many ways, politics doesn't get any more interesting than this, folks. The president's loyal advocates are backing the other candidates. And hours ago, one of his own cabinet members broke ranks with the president to support the other guy. Who better than Chris Stirewalt to weigh in on this and he's excited.

Earlier today, after a man was pulled alive from the rubble here overnight, official rescue teams swarmed this site, using every tool at their disposal to try to discover whether there might be more survivors. But then, about three hours ago, all of those hundreds of workers were called together. They all stood motionless. They removed their hard hats in unison. They sang the national anthem. And then, this. That traditional Mexican tribute to the fallen marked, as it turned out, Martha, the moment at which those official rescue crews deemed it impossible for there to be any more survivors. They then pulled out of this site, but as I say, tonight, a small group of civilians still there hoping against all reality and logic that they might find someone. Similar scenes going on around Mexico City tonight, Martha. Search and rescue operations still underway, but clearly, we are moving, tragically and inevitably, to the point where the Mexican government declares this a recovery rather than a rescue operation.

That made Plame a hero of the left, but then she retweeted this disgusting story you mentioned, entitled, America's Jews are driving America's wars, on a website that had other stories like it's time to rethink David Duke. Shocking because, remember, one of the uglier parts of the debate over the war in Iraq is the Bush aides -- coming under fire for allegedly being too close to the pro-Israel lobby. Past forward to this week, over the course of less than 40 minutes, it unraveled for Plame, America's Jews are driving America's wars, first of all, she wrote as respond -- first, calm down. Retweets don't imply endorsements. Yes, very provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks, she said, are Jewish. Then, just FYI, I am of Jewish descent. I'm in not in favor of war with Iran or getting out of the Iran- nuclear treaty, there are simply too many who are so ready to go to war, haven't we had enough for a while. Then she said, read the entire article and try, just for a moment, to put aside your biases and think clearly.

We all have had too much coffee and too little sleep. But, in fact, this is one of several times that she has retweeted things that can be broadly interpreted as anti-Semitic. But beyond that, Valerie Plame has really made a career out of a fraud, and that is out of the notion that she was an innocent victim of an outing, her own outing, as a CIA agent, which caused terrible harm to the national security and terrible harm to her family. She went on and on portraying herself in senate testimony and then a best- selling book as a victim. The truth of the matter is, according to John Rizzo, who was the former general counsel of the CIA, no harm was done to either Ms. Plame, or national security, or any of the Iraqis who she worked with when she was at the CIA. It was all fraudulent. And so, I believe that Ms. Plame should not only be apologizing for her anti-Semitic tweets, the retreating of them, this kind of vile notion that Jews brought us to the war in Iraq and threaten to do so again. She ought to really apologize for going along and giving aid and comfort to the lie that the CIA knew there were no WMD in Iraq, and they misled the country into war. She was part of that narrative. She benefited from that narrative. She's been giving speeches all over the country based on that narrative. And that is a fraud. And it led to Scooter Libby's trial. He was the aid to the vice president, Dick Cheney. It led to his conviction. And I have actually written a book called, The Story, which attempted to set the narrative straight in which I recant my own testimony at the trial. So Valerie Plame has been a very important person in the lives of everyone who tried very, very hard to bring honest information to the American people, and for many of us who did not succeed, we never said we were lied into anything.

Kim's retort to the president's U.N. speech went like this: \"I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.\" So, there's that. Then, came the President response: \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who was, obviously, a madman, who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before.\" So, that led to these headlines in the New York Times: \"Kim Jong-un called Trump a dotard.\" How harsh is that burn?"

Maybe we trade?\" That, as we learn that Kim is considering testing a hydrogen bomb in the atmosphere which could rain down radioactive nuclear material all over the Pacific or wherever it, God forbid, might crash land. So, with all that on our plate, in moments, we will talk to former CIA officers about this latest threat: Buck Sexton and Marie Harf.

      "utterance": "You know, Martha, Kim Jong-un's anti-Trump statements marked the first time that Kim, the younger, has ever issued a comment directly against another head of a state. And experts say, that's an indication that the standoff is escalating and that Kim might be willing to live up to his threats -- which is saying something, considering the North Korean leader has reportedly put his uncle in front of a firing squad, had his half-brother poisoned with nerve gas, and presides over one of the poorest countries in the world, yet has used its resources to build a nuclear weapons program. Kim Jong-un himself has gone on state-run television claiming his country has successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb underground. Some remain skeptical of those claims, but there are no doubters when it comes to North Korea's rapid firing of ballistic missiles. 22, this year alone, including one, the Pentagon says, could have reached the shores of the United States. Some Korean analysts believe Kim Jong-un's nuclear weapons are nothing more than insurance policies for his regime to maintain power. But they also believe his behavior is getting erratic and risky. For example, the recent firing of a missile over North Japan had that missile fallen short, as the majority of North Korea missiles have. It could easily have landed inside Japan and then declared an act of war. And many U.S. authorities still say the brutal treatment of American student, Otto Warmbier, while he was held in North Korea prison, and who died days after coming to the U.S. was very much a provocation by Kim Jong-un. The U.S. president's going back to 1969, have chosen not to retaliate against Pyongyang, but the tone and tenor appear to be changing. Watch."

And there seems to be this effort to create a kind of equivalency, as though North Korean propaganda and Donald Trump tweets are somehow in the same sphere, in the same universe. And the reality here is that there should be a bipartisan sense that we face a very real and growing problem from Kim Jong-un, that we face a regime that we cannot really guess what their next steps are going to be. And Donald Trump is just calling him out, calling that regime out for what it truly is. He's speaking plainly about a problem that everyone sees and knows is there in House for a long time."

He's made a lot of serious threats, that it might convince Kim Jong-un that if he uses weapons against the United States or our allies, Donald Trump will respond. I mean, that's at the crux of how you deter a country from using nuclear weapons once they have them. I think what worries me a little bit and what worries other people is that if we get trapped in this really escalatory rhetoric where it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, there is a bigger chance that someone like Kim Jong-un, who is crazy, will miscalculate and will do something stupid, and it will start a wider conflict that has really serious consequences for the U.S., for our allies, and for our American soldiers -- for example, who are stationed in the DMZ today.

    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "At some point, the provocations will be met with more than just words, and I think that's what President Trump has been trying to make abundantly clear to the regime, in North Korea. But on this point about the escalation of rhetoric, let's understand that there's also been an escalation of capability from the North Korean regime, there has been an escalation of provocation. They've been doing more aggressive, belligerent stuff in recent months than they have for years prior to that. And so, the status quo is unsustainable. The way that we've been approaching North Kora, the Obama administration's strategic patience, which is really just a fancy way of saying, don't do very much. This notion of kicking the can down the road endlessly, won't come with any problems. We can literally see the problems getting worse and going further with these missiles. And that's what I think the president understands now and trying to take action on. And I should note that the, you know, allies that we have in the region understand that miscalculation has always been at play here. There's always been the possibility that Kim Jong-un might actually try to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force. I think it's better for them to be reassured that we take a strong stance on this and not just the status quo."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what North Korea shows us about Iran is that your options get much more limited when they already have nuclear weapons. So, today, Iran is, yes, a very dangerous player in the region, but thank God, they can't put a nuclear warhead on one of those ballistic missiles today -- like North Korea can. So, we can debate about how to prevent Iran from getting a weapon. I would, obviously, argue that the Iran deal does that and staying in it is the best way to do that. I'm sure they would disagree with me. But I think what it shows is that if you got an Iran deal-like agreement with North Korea, most security experts today would probably take it, because once you get nuclear weapons, those options go way down, and the cost of military action goes way up."

The door is open to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. So, the president was on the verge of two major victories, taxes, and health care. And now it's his fellow Republicans pulling the rug out from under. You mentioned John McCain, joining Rand Paul as two \"no\" votes. A tiny glimmer of hope for the bill if Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins vote \"yes\". But Collins has but said she's going to vote \"no\". That means, the expiration date premiers in reconciliation, where the president could use just 51 votes in the Senate. If he gets this through, it's done at the end of the month. So, now, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer can bank on the fact that it will take 60 votes to pass any health reform. The president will have to try to find a compromise with Schumer and Nancy Pelosi that falls well short of repeal and replace or simply do nothing at all. Vice President Mike Pence, said in his home state Indiana a short time ago, he insisted, they're not giving up."

Of course, left out of those monologues, the fact that under ObamaCare right now, there are people who've lost their doctors, they've lost their plans. In John McCain's home state of Arizona, you've got premium spiking 115 percent. People never mentioned about the current system, Martha.

But this president is now going more the way of General John Kelly, his White House chief of staff, which he let's find some middle ground. Be a statesman here, find some compromise, you know, prop up the insurance markets, do something that will win the president's praise, maybe from Independents, but you know this better than anyone, Martha. His political base is going to freak out if it's something short of repeal and replace heading into those 2018 midterms.

I remain supportive of Graham-Cassidy and encourage others to do the same.\" And then, let's look at this tweet from President Trump on this. \"Rand Paul, or whoever votes against the health care bill, will forever, in future political campaigns, be known as 'the Republican who saved ObamaCare.'\" David?"

There is no reason John McCain is against this bill, except to be against President Trump. And I don't understand why he is failing the rest of his Republican colleagues who has lectured for the last 30 years for being part of the team to help get these types of bills across the line. And he's a team player, he seems to have been, his entire career, until today, and it is incredibly disappointing. As somebody who wants to desperately replace ObamaCare, repeal and replace ObamaCare, somebody who -- look, Jimmy Kimmel, it's a ridiculous argument. He has all the money in the world and can afford the best care for his kids. And so, I find it, you know, a little bit nauseating as somebody who has four children and somebody who has had major health problems in my family, it is not something to hang your hat on, Jimmy.

Earlier today, after a man was pulled alive from the rubble here overnight, official rescue teams swarmed this site, using every tool at their disposal to try to discover whether there might be more survivors. But then, about three hours ago, all of those hundreds of workers were called together. They all stood motionless. They removed their hard hats in unison. They sang the national anthem. And then, this. That traditional Mexican tribute to the fallen marked, as it turned out, Martha, the moment at which those official rescue crews deemed it impossible for there to be any more survivors. They then pulled out of this site, but as I say, tonight, a small group of civilians still there hoping against all reality and logic that they might find someone. Similar scenes going on around Mexico City tonight, Martha.

      "utterance": "I say this admiringly as a West Virginian. Alabama politics beats all. This is really something. And basically what you have are people saying that the president is not in control of himself, that he is not the master of his destiny and he doesn't know what he wants. And if you read between the lines on what Palin and others are saying, it's basically, they'll determine what constitutes the real agenda of Donald Trump, not Donald Trump. You have to pity the president in this situation a little bit because the truth for him is, he desperately needs some wins. He needs a legislative victory. He's got a little polling uptick going on right now. He needs to try to get this tax cut over the finish line. He got to have something on ObamaCare. He's got to have all of these things. Luther Strange has run, essentially, as an empty vessel to channel the will of Donald J. Trump into the United States senate. He said I am nothing but a 6'8\" tall funnel that will flow right into the United States senate. And these folks say not good enough because you don't understand the original attitude of Trumpism that they think they more effectively channel than the president."

I mean, you can really see, sort of, the people who are very driven behind things like the wall on the southern border, and the disgruntlement that they've expressed in recent days and months, really, since the White House sort of turned over a different leaf and Kelly came in, and they're seen as, sort of, more traditional in terms of the Republican --. That's the heart of the battle that's really going on here, right?"

      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "This is absolutely truth. But conversely, Moore is ahead. The incumbent, Luther Strange is the underdog. But if Trump can pull him over the finish line, and he can have a comeback win, then the president's chances for getting that health insurance bill across next week go way up. His chances on taxes go way up. His agenda chances go way up if he can deliver a win for Strange down here, because then it demonstrates that he still has the clout to deliver for Republicans, and that he can make primary decisions. He can determine primary outcomes. If he fails, if Palin and those folks succeed in defeating Trump's candidate when Trump goes to the senate next week and says, all right, boys, this is a tough vote but I need you to go out there and vote for this bill that's complicated, it's a hard vote, they're going to think, man, this guy couldn't even get a win in a state that he won the primary by more than 20 points and won the general by almost 30 points. What gives?"

This is what he wants to do on this Friday night. And my guess is he's going to go in there very fired up. And the stakes are very high here for all the reasons that you've just pointed out.

Why is she is apologizing, and apologizing, and apologizing today. Journalist Judith Miller, who was at the vortex of all of that whole thing, joins us with her reaction coming up. Plus, Hulk Hogan battled many opponents in the ring, but one of his biggest fights involved a sex tape and the first amendment. The wrestling icon sat down with Harvey Levin for a brand-new Fox News show. Harvey joins me with a preview."

She is attempting to defend yourself against anti-Semitism charges after re-tweeting a rather vile and offensive article that was titled, America's Jews are driving America's wars. Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry here again with that story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Martha, particularly shocking because these retweet was on the first full day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Remember, there was a special counsel probe of whether Valerie Plame was outed as a CIA spy by the Bush administration in order to seek revenge against her husband Ambassador Joe Wilson for being a fierce critic of the case for war in Iraq. That made Plame a hero of the left, but then she retweeted this disgusting story you mentioned, entitled, America's Jews are driving America's wars, on a website that had other stories like it's time to rethink David Duke. Shocking because, remember, one of the uglier parts of the debate over the war in Iraq is the Bush aides -- coming under fire for allegedly being too close to the pro-Israel lobby. Past forward to this week, over the course of less than 40 minutes, it unraveled for Plame, America's Jews are driving America's wars, first of all, she wrote as respond -- first, calm down. Retweets don't imply endorsements. Yes, very provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks, she said, are Jewish. Then, just FYI, I am of Jewish descent. I'm in not in favor of war with Iran or getting out of the Iran- nuclear treaty, there are simply too many who are so ready to go to war, haven't we had enough for a while. Then she said, read the entire article and try, just for a moment, to put aside your biases and think clearly. Well, Alan Dershowitz said the problem for him is that he thinks Plame was thinking too clearly, as the thing with twitter, he said, is you sometimes retweet something so quickly it can reflect your real genuine beliefs."

      "speaker": "UNINDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Who would imagine that a former CIA operative would retweet that and, I believe, endorse it. Because I don't think this is just retreating. You know, if you want to retweet something that you disapprove of, you can say that. Oh, read this terrible article about how people claim Jews control the media. This is retweeting a blatantly anti- Semitic article."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Claiming knowledge she failed to do her homework, and missed what she called gross undercurrents in this article, adding one word that sorts of sums it up, ugh. Martha?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Ed. All right. So here now with more tonight, someone who was swept up in the Plame affair, Judith Miller. She's a Pulitzer prize-winning investigative reporter and adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute. She's also a Fox News contributor. And this also led to a rather difficult and very interesting chapter in her life where she spent some time behind bars as a result of all of this. So when you see this, Judith, what do you make of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDITH MILLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think that had it been the first time that Ms. Plame had actually retweeted an article that contained anti- Semitic settlement, I would give her a pass and say we all make mistakes. We all have had too much coffee and too little sleep. But, in fact, this is one of several times that she has retweeted things that can be broadly interpreted as anti-Semitic. But beyond that, Valerie Plame has really made a career out of a fraud, and that is out of the notion that she was an innocent victim of an outing, her own outing, as a CIA agent, which caused terrible harm to the national security and terrible harm to her family. She went on and on portraying herself in senate testimony and then a best- selling book as a victim. The truth of the matter is, according to John Rizzo, who was the former general counsel of the CIA, no harm was done to either Ms. Plame, or national security, or any of the Iraqis who she worked with when she was at the CIA. It was all fraudulent. And so, I believe that Ms. Plame should not only be apologizing for her anti-Semitic tweets, the retreating of them, this kind of vile notion that Jews brought us to the war in Iraq and threaten to do so again. She ought to really apologize for going along and giving aid and comfort to the lie that the CIA knew there were no WMD in Iraq, and they misled the country into war. She was part of that narrative. She benefited from that narrative. She's been giving speeches all over the country based on that narrative. And that is a fraud. And it led to Scooter Libby's trial. He was the aid to the vice president, Dick Cheney. It led to his conviction. And I have actually written a book called, The Story, which attempted to set the narrative straight in which I recant my own testimony at the trial. So Valerie Plame has been a very important person in the lives of everyone who tried very, very hard to bring honest information to the American people, and for many of us who did not succeed, we never said we were lied into anything. She continues to live on that fraudulent narrative."

And then it was later revealed -- you know, obviously, this was a very difficult time for you. Do you think that-- first of all, on these articles, on this article that she retweeted, you know, as you pointed out, this was written by a person named Philip Geraldi, a former CIA case officer, and she has praised his work before. She retweeted an article that he wrote in 2014, and said that his argument that criticized Israel and Benjamin Netanyahu was, quote, well put. So, you know, are we to believe her, sort of, scrambling sentiment now that she really, you know, didn't do her homework on this issue? That seems a little bit of a far-fetched."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "No, exactly. She said she was busy moving, but she also told her readers to read the entire article, suggesting that she had done so. So either she was lying about having read the article, or she was, you know, lying to her twitter followers, or she was just lying."

It was always kind of a thing, but not to a big group. It was when Hulk came around. So he's experienced those highs, but with his divorce, with his kid, you know, with that horrible car accident where his son went to prison, the divorce, the sex tape, the N-word, all of this stuff. You know, he has seen his share and taken his share of lumps. But the way he handles it in this interview is different than what I expected. He makes no apologies for it. He doesn't try to explain anything away. And I think that actually the way he has taken it in has given him final -- ultimately, strength. But it almost, like you said earlier, it almost killed him. He had a gun in his mouth."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, the way I see it, and you have to kind of draw your own conclusions from the show, but the way I see it, it wasn't so much revenge against gawker. He talks about getting a phone call when he was urged to settle this thing before trial. You know, from somebody who kind of suffered something similar where one of their relatives was horribly embarrassed by something that had come out and the relative committed suicide. And, you know, he says to me, that call made a difference to him when he got it. And that it was really not just about getting revenge. It was about trying to draw a line where people just should not be able to do that. I mean, he wanted to make an example of all of this, and he talks about it. Again, this cost him a lot, this trial. He made a lot of money, but he's been banish from wrestling for life, and that wounds him deeply. And he talks about that. It's not like he passes that off as though it's nothing. He doesn't."

Look, there are doctors, the doctor who's featured in Will Smith's Concussion, the doctor who's based on, he is convince that he committed suicide because of this, and may be committed the murder because of this. What I find stunning is Belichick, a deflection, and saying, well, doctor's deals with this stuff. It is impossible for me to believe, I hope at least, that there wouldn't have been long discussions with the Patriot staff and every football team about CTE. They should know about this.
