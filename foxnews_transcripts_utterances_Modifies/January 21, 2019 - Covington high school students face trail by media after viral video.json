      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" If you were on social media over the weekend, you probably saw this video. It was shot Friday afternoon on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. It seemed to show a group of teenage boys taunting an elderly American Indian man who was holding a drum. The young man had come to Washington from a Catholic School in Kentucky to demonstrate in the March for Life. Some of them wore Make America Great Again hats. They seem menacing.  Within hours, the video is being re-played by virtually every news outlet in America. Here's what you may have seen.",

      "sentences": "Well it's hard to remember the last time the Great American meme machine produced a clearer contrast between good and evil. It was essentially an entire morality play shrunk down to four minutes for Facebook. On the one side, you had a noble tribal Elder weather-beaten, calm and wise, seems like a living icon, you could imagine a single tear sliding slowly down his cheek at the senselessness of it all.   And on the other side, you had a pack of heedless sneering young men from the South, drunk on racism and White privilege. The irony was overwhelming. The indigenous man's land had been stolen by the ancestors of these boys in MAGA hats. And yet, they dared to lecture him about walls designed to keep people who look very much like him out of what they were calling, \"Their country.\" It was infuriating to a lot of people. At the same time, it was also strangely comforting to those who watched it from Brooklyn and L.A.  The people who run this country have long suspected that Middle America is a hive of nativist bigotry, and now they had proof of that. It was a cause for a celebration of outrage because there's nothing quite as satisfying as having your own biases confirmed.   But did the video really describe what happened? That should have been the first question that journalists asked. Checking facts and adding context is what journalists are paid to do. It's in the first line of the job description. And yet, amazingly, almost nobody in the American media did that. And that's a shame because there was a lot to check. The full video of what happened on Friday in Washington is well over an hour long. The four minutes that made Twitter don't tell the story but instead distort the story.  A longer look shows that the boys from Covington Catholic in Kentucky were not a roving mob looking for a fight. They were in fact, and it shows it on the tape, standing in place waiting to be picked up by a bus. As they waited there, members of a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, it's a Black supremacist organization, began taunting them with racial epithets. And then, Nathan Phillips, the now-famous American Indian Activist approached them, pounding on his drum.  Now the footage seems to suggest that the boys were unsure of whether Phillips was hostile or taking their side against the Black Hebrew Israelites. But in any case, there is no evidence at all that anybody said \"Build a wall!\"  Here's a selection of what didn't make social media.",

      "sentences": "Hmm! So, what really happened on Friday? Well you can watch for yourself and decide. There's plenty of video out there of it, and some of it is fascinating and revealing.  But what we know for certain at this point is that our cultural leaders are, in effect, bigots, and they understand the reality on the basis of stereotypes. When the facts don't conform to what they think they know, they ignore the facts. They see this country not as a group of people or of citizens but as a collection of groups. And some of those groups, they are convinced, are morally inferior to other groups. And they know that's true. They say it out loud. And that belief shapes almost all of their perceptions of the world. It's not surprising then that when a group of pro-life Catholic kids, who look like lacrosse players and live in Kentucky, are accused of wrongdoing.   The Media don't pause for a moment before casting judgment. Maggie Haberman of The New York Times suggested the boys needed to be expelled from school. Ana Navarro of CNN called the boys racists and asswipes, and then went after their teachers and their parents.  Others called for violence against them. CNN Legal Analyst Bakari Sellers suggested one of the boys should be \"punched in the face.\" Former CNN Contributor, Reza Aslan agreed. Aslan asked on Twitter this. \"Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?\" Longtime CNN Contributor, Kathy Griffin seemed to encourage a mob to rise up and hurt these boys. \"Name these kids. I want names. Shame them. If you think these F-ers wouldn't dox you in a heartbeat, think again.\"  Then she repeated her demand again later. \"Names please. And stories from people who can identify them and vouch for their identity. Thank you.\"  Hollywood film producer, Jack Morrissey tweeted that he wanted the boys killed. \"#MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper.\" And then he paired that with a graphic photo. Actor Patton Oswalt linked to personal information about one of the boys in case anyone wanted to get started on that project.  Meanwhile Twitter, which claims to have a policy against encouraging violence, stood by silently as all of this happened. But in case you think the response was entirely from the Left, you should know that the abuse was bipartisan. It wasn't just Left versus Right. It was the people in power attacking those below them as a group. Plenty of Republicans in Washington were happy to savage the Covington kids, probably to inoculate themselves from charges of improper thought.   Bill Kristol asked his Twitter followers to consider, \"The contrast between the calm dignity and quiet strength of Mr. Phillips and the behavior of #MAGA brats who have absorbed the spirit of Trumpism.\"  And then, when the actual facts emerged, Kristol quietly deleted his tweet. He never apologized, of course. He hasn't apologized for the Iraq War either. There's no need. People keep giving him money. National Review, meanwhile, ran a story entitled \"The Covington Students might as well have spit on The Cross.\" That story has since been pulled too, but not before the author admitted he never even bothered to watch all of the videos. He knew what he knew and that was enough. What's so interesting about the coverage of Friday's videos was how much of it mentioned something called privilege. Alex Cranz, who's an Editor at Gizmodo, for example, wrote this.   \"From elementary school through college, I went to school with sheltered, upper-middle-class White boys, who could devastate with a smirk, a facial gesture that weaponized their privilege. Infuriatingly, you can't fight that F-ing smirk with a punch or words. We saw that as Trump smirked his way through the election and we'll see it as that boy from Kentucky's friends, family, and school protect him. I F-ing hate that smirk. It says, I'm richer, I'm White, and I'm a guy.\" What's so fascinating about all of these attacks is how inverted they are. These are high school kids from Kentucky. Do they really have more privilege than Alex Cranz from Gizmodo? Probably not. In fact, probably much less. They're far less privileged in fact than virtually everyone who was called for them to be destroyed on the basis they have too much privilege. Consider Kara Swisher, for example. She's an Opinion Columnist to The New York Times.   Swisher went to Princeton Day School and then Georgetown and then got a graduate degree at Columbia. She has become rich and famous in the meantime by toadying for billionaire tech CEOs. She's their handmaiden. Nobody considers her very talented and yet, she's somehow highly influential in our society.  Is she more privileged than the boys of Covington Catholic at Kentucky? Of course, she is. Maybe that's why she feels the needs to call them Nazis, which she did repeatedly. So, what's actually going on here? Well it's not really about race. In fact, most of the stories about race aren't really about race. And this is no different. This story is about the people in power protecting their power and justifying their power by destroying and mocking those who are weaker than they are.  Why? Simple. Our leaders have not improved the lives of most people in America. They can't admit that because it would discredit them. So instead, they attack the very people they have failed. The problem, they'll tell us, with Kentucky isn't that bad policies have hurt the people who live there. It's that the people who live there are immoral because they're bigots. They deserve their poverty and their opioid addiction. They deserve to die younger.  That's what our leaders tell themselves. And now, that's what they're telling us. Just remember, they're lying when they do.  Robby Soave is an Associate Editor at Reason. Unlike most reporters, he bothered to take a closer look at the Covington incident before passing judgment. He's also the Author of the forthcoming book, Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump. Robby Soave joins us tonight.  Robby, thanks for coming on.",

      "sentences": "The current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in this country's history. And every year, the number of deaths rises. In 2017, 72,000 Americans died from ODs, and the vast majority of those were caused by some sort of opioid drug. There are a lot of causes of this epidemic. Declining job prospects of the working class, the collapse of marriage and families, the suffocating loneliness generated by modern life. But good old-fashioned greed and moral turpitude from big business played a role too. One of the key drugs behind the opioid tragedy is called OxyContin. OxyContin is a powerful and effective prescription painkiller. It's been a miracle for many cancer patients. But it's also very addictive. Thousands of Americans have received prescriptions for OxyContin after surgery or for chronic pain, and have wound up addicted to it. Since OxyContin's release in 1996, 200,000 Americans have died of overdoses linked to prescription painkillers. That, for perspective, is almost twice this country's death toll in World War I. OxyContin is produced by a company called Purdue Pharmaceutical. That company is owned by the Sackler family. OxyContin has made the Sacklers one of this country's richest families, are collectively worth about $13 billion. Now, new filings in a lawsuit in Massachusetts against members of the Sackler family showed just how far they were willing to go to get rich. Prior to the release of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma argued that the drug was less addictive than other opioids because it was released gradually because of its packaging. They had no proof this was true. And, of course, it turned out not to be true at all. OxyContin was and is, again, remarkably addictive. But it didn't matter. Purdue Sales Reps were told to claim the drug had an addiction risk of less than 1 percent. At the drug's launch, Richard Sackler boasted about how successful the drug would be. \"The launch of OxyContin tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white.\" Well he was right. That blizzard came and people began to die. The Sacklers didn't appear to care. In 1997, Richard Sackler deduced that doctors were prescribing OxyContin more often because they had the mistaken belief that it was weaker than morphine. In fact, OxyContin is stronger than morphine. Purdue personnel were told to suppress this fact to keep the prescriptions flowing. In 2001, a Federal Prosecutor noted that 59 overdose deaths had occurred in his state alone. Sackler's response in an internal company memo, \"This is not too bad. It could have been far worse.\" The company refused to take responsibility for the people it was killing, so they went after the addicts themselves. In 2001, Richard Sackler said this in an internal memo. \"We have to hammer on abusers in every possible way. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.\" As the crisis worsened, Purdue continued to deny the addictiveness of their pills, saying the epidemic was simply a matter of immorality on the part of individual users. Meanwhile, year after year, the Sacklers kept pushing their company to sell more and more painkillers. Sales personnel were pressured to market OxyContin to doctors for all kinds of ailments, and at higher and more addictive doses. If prescriptions didn't rise fast enough, sales reps were threatened with termination. And, of course, they got the message. OxyContin salesmen held sometimes daily meetings with physicians urging them to prescribe more and more OxyContin. Several doctors the company lobbied eventually lost their licenses for malpractice, for following this advice. When some of the more ethical doctors expressed concerns about addiction, the company placated them by saying their patients actually suffered from \"pseudo-addiction.\" That was in - a condition, they claim, could be treated with, you guessed it, more OxyContin. Meanwhile, Raymond Sackler meddled with the company's advertisements. He was angry they didn't portray OxyContin positively enough. Purdue only discontinued direct sales efforts for OxyContin in February 2018, less than a year ago. How many lives might have been saved if they'd stopped earlier or if they never lied at all? Those are pointless questions now. They didn't care. They were getting rich. Another Caravan coming for the U.S.-Mexico border. That Border remains unsecured by a government with a broken immigration system. A lot of things happening there that people in Washington are denying. We'll talk to someone who was just there who's got the latest and the truth about our Southern border, after the break.",

Mr. Trump offered to temporarily extend protections for DACA recipients, those who were brought to the country illegally as children. But now, Conservatives are accusing the President of embracing amnesty. The President shot back that his offer was temporary, not permanent, quoting here, \"No. Amnesty is not part of my offer. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else.\" And now, some GOP Senators want to get the President's proposal on the Senate floor, not that it has the 60 votes necessary to pass, but as a way to get debate rolling. Meantime, as thousands of Central American migrants continue their trek toward Tijuana with hopes of getting into the U.S., thousands of other migrants are taking Mexico up on its offer of asylum. Mexico says almost 3,700 people have now registered for temporary status. And following a series of cartel attacks on Mexican police, the U.S. government has now issued a security alert for Juarez, Mexico that is just across the Rio Grande from El Paso.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" If you were on social media over the weekend, you probably saw this video. It was shot Friday afternoon on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. It seemed to show a group of teenage boys taunting an elderly American Indian man who was holding a drum. The young man had come to Washington from a Catholic School in Kentucky to demonstrate in the March for Life. Some of them wore Make America Great Again hats. They seem menacing. Within hours, the video is being re-played by virtually every news outlet in America. Here's what you may have seen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well the American Indian man with the drum you just saw is called Nathan Phillips, and he described the young men he encountered, the ones in the hats, as aggressive and threatening, essentially shock troops for Donald Trump. Watch."

      "speaker": "NATHAN PHILLIPS, OMAHA NATION ELDER AND ACTIVIST, NATIVE AMERICAN VIETNAM VETERAN",
      "utterance": "I heard them saying, \"Build that wall! Build that wall!\" You know, this is indigenous lands. You're no - not supposed to have walls here. We never did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well it's hard to remember the last time the Great American meme machine produced a clearer contrast between good and evil. It was essentially an entire morality play shrunk down to four minutes for Facebook. On the one side, you had a noble tribal Elder weather-beaten, calm and wise, seems like a living icon, you could imagine a single tear sliding slowly down his cheek at the senselessness of it all. And on the other side, you had a pack of heedless sneering young men from the South, drunk on racism and White privilege. The irony was overwhelming. The indigenous man's land had been stolen by the ancestors of these boys in MAGA hats. And yet, they dared to lecture him about walls designed to keep people who look very much like him out of what they were calling, \"Their country.\" It was infuriating to a lot of people. At the same time, it was also strangely comforting to those who watched it from Brooklyn and L.A. The people who run this country have long suspected that Middle America is a hive of nativist bigotry, and now they had proof of that. It was a cause for a celebration of outrage because there's nothing quite as satisfying as having your own biases confirmed. But did the video really describe what happened? That should have been the first question that journalists asked. Checking facts and adding context is what journalists are paid to do. It's in the first line of the job description. And yet, amazingly, almost nobody in the American media did that. And that's a shame because there was a lot to check. The full video of what happened on Friday in Washington is well over an hour long. The four minutes that made Twitter don't tell the story but instead distort the story. A longer look shows that the boys from Covington Catholic in Kentucky were not a roving mob looking for a fight. They were in fact, and it shows it on the tape, standing in place waiting to be picked up by a bus. As they waited there, members of a group called the Black Hebrew Israelites, it's a Black supremacist organization, began taunting them with racial epithets. And then, Nathan Phillips, the now-famous American Indian Activist approached them, pounding on his drum. Now the footage seems to suggest that the boys were unsure of whether Phillips was hostile or taking their side against the Black Hebrew Israelites. But in any case, there is no evidence at all that anybody said \"Build a wall!\" Here's a selection of what didn't make social media."

      "utterance": "Hmm! So, what really happened on Friday? Well you can watch for yourself and decide. There's plenty of video out there of it, and some of it is fascinating and revealing. But what we know for certain at this point is that our cultural leaders are, in effect, bigots, and they understand the reality on the basis of stereotypes. When the facts don't conform to what they think they know, they ignore the facts. They see this country not as a group of people or of citizens but as a collection of groups. And some of those groups, they are convinced, are morally inferior to other groups. And they know that's true. They say it out loud. And that belief shapes almost all of their perceptions of the world. It's not surprising then that when a group of pro-life Catholic kids, who look like lacrosse players and live in Kentucky, are accused of wrongdoing. The Media don't pause for a moment before casting judgment. Maggie Haberman of The New York Times suggested the boys needed to be expelled from school. Ana Navarro of CNN called the boys racists and asswipes, and then went after their teachers and their parents. Others called for violence against them. CNN Legal Analyst Bakari Sellers suggested one of the boys should be \"punched in the face.\" Former CNN Contributor, Reza Aslan agreed. Aslan asked on Twitter this. \"Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?\" Longtime CNN Contributor, Kathy Griffin seemed to encourage a mob to rise up and hurt these boys. \"Name these kids. I want names. Shame them. If you think these F-ers wouldn't dox you in a heartbeat, think again.\" Then she repeated her demand again later. \"Names please. And stories from people who can identify them and vouch for their identity. Thank you.\" Hollywood film producer, Jack Morrissey tweeted that he wanted the boys killed. \"#MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper.\" And then he paired that with a graphic photo. Actor Patton Oswalt linked to personal information about one of the boys in case anyone wanted to get started on that project. Meanwhile Twitter, which claims to have a policy against encouraging violence, stood by silently as all of this happened. But in case you think the response was entirely from the Left, you should know that the abuse was bipartisan. It wasn't just Left versus Right. It was the people in power attacking those below them as a group. Plenty of Republicans in Washington were happy to savage the Covington kids, probably to inoculate themselves from charges of improper thought. Bill Kristol asked his Twitter followers to consider, \"The contrast between the calm dignity and quiet strength of Mr. Phillips and the behavior of #MAGA brats who have absorbed the spirit of Trumpism.\" And then, when the actual facts emerged, Kristol quietly deleted his tweet. He never apologized, of course. He hasn't apologized for the Iraq War either. There's no need. People keep giving him money. National Review, meanwhile, ran a story entitled \"The Covington Students might as well have spit on The Cross.\" That story has since been pulled too, but not before the author admitted he never even bothered to watch all of the videos. He knew what he knew and that was enough. What's so interesting about the coverage of Friday's videos was how much of it mentioned something called privilege. Alex Cranz, who's an Editor at Gizmodo, for example, wrote this. \"From elementary school through college, I went to school with sheltered, upper-middle-class White boys, who could devastate with a smirk, a facial gesture that weaponized their privilege. Infuriatingly, you can't fight that F-ing smirk with a punch or words. We saw that as Trump smirked his way through the election and we'll see it as that boy from Kentucky's friends, family, and school protect him. I F-ing hate that smirk. It says, I'm richer, I'm White, and I'm a guy.\" What's so fascinating about all of these attacks is how inverted they are. These are high school kids from Kentucky. Do they really have more privilege than Alex Cranz from Gizmodo? Probably not. In fact, probably much less. They're far less privileged in fact than virtually everyone who was called for them to be destroyed on the basis they have too much privilege. Consider Kara Swisher, for example. She's an Opinion Columnist to The New York Times. Swisher went to Princeton Day School and then Georgetown and then got a graduate degree at Columbia. She has become rich and famous in the meantime by toadying for billionaire tech CEOs. She's their handmaiden. Nobody considers her very talented and yet, she's somehow highly influential in our society. Is she more privileged than the boys of Covington Catholic at Kentucky? Of course, she is. Maybe that's why she feels the needs to call them Nazis, which she did repeatedly. So, what's actually going on here? Well it's not really about race. In fact, most of the stories about race aren't really about race. And this is no different. This story is about the people in power protecting their power and justifying their power by destroying and mocking those who are weaker than they are. Why? Simple. Our leaders have not improved the lives of most people in America. They can't admit that because it would discredit them. So instead, they attack the very people they have failed. The problem, they'll tell us, with Kentucky isn't that bad policies have hurt the people who live there. It's that the people who live there are immoral because they're bigots. They deserve their poverty and their opioid addiction. They deserve to die younger. That's what our leaders tell themselves. And now, that's what they're telling us. Just remember, they're lying when they do."

Now, if you were a normal Editor or a Reporter, you might pause before repeating this because BuzzFeed is a joke. This is the outlet that gives us stories like \"19 husbands who sent the most hilariously random texts ever,\" and \"10 signs your cat is a wizard.\" So, you might have thought, well how could BuzzFeed have gotten the one story that nobody else can replicate but that everybody else has been searching for? You might have asked yourself that question before repeating the key assertions in the story mindlessly, and as if they were true. But nope. Nobody did. Everybody assumed BuzzFeed had landed an exclusive scoop that would bring down the President and that was so thrilling, they couldn't hold back.

Of course, you'd just be speculating but wild speculation is exactly what the press did all day last Friday. Between them, CNN and MSNBC mentioned the word impeachment nearly 200 times in one day. In the end, if true turned out to be not true at all. We know this because late Friday, the Mueller investigation itself issued a rare statement calling BuzzFeed's reporting inaccurate. Talk about a bombshell, you might say. The Mueller team almost always refuses to comment publicly about things that it's doing. It was a humbling moment for the press. They were not humbled though. How do we know? Because on Meet the Press, Chuck Todd, the host, said the problem wasn't that the press was foolish and reckless and bad at their job of reporting, and the story wound up being untrue.

      "utterance": "The current opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug crisis in this country's history. And every year, the number of deaths rises. In 2017, 72,000 Americans died from ODs, and the vast majority of those were caused by some sort of opioid drug. There are a lot of causes of this epidemic. Declining job prospects of the working class, the collapse of marriage and families, the suffocating loneliness generated by modern life. But good old-fashioned greed and moral turpitude from big business played a role too. One of the key drugs behind the opioid tragedy is called OxyContin. OxyContin is a powerful and effective prescription painkiller. It's been a miracle for many cancer patients. But it's also very addictive. Thousands of Americans have received prescriptions for OxyContin after surgery or for chronic pain, and have wound up addicted to it. Since OxyContin's release in 1996, 200,000 Americans have died of overdoses linked to prescription painkillers. That, for perspective, is almost twice this country's death toll in World War I. OxyContin is produced by a company called Purdue Pharmaceutical. That company is owned by the Sackler family. OxyContin has made the Sacklers one of this country's richest families, are collectively worth about $13 billion. Now, new filings in a lawsuit in Massachusetts against members of the Sackler family showed just how far they were willing to go to get rich. Prior to the release of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma argued that the drug was less addictive than other opioids because it was released gradually because of its packaging. They had no proof this was true. And, of course, it turned out not to be true at all. OxyContin was and is, again, remarkably addictive. But it didn't matter. Purdue Sales Reps were told to claim the drug had an addiction risk of less than 1 percent. At the drug's launch, Richard Sackler boasted about how successful the drug would be. \"The launch of OxyContin tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep, dense, and white.\" Well he was right. That blizzard came and people began to die. The Sacklers didn't appear to care. In 1997, Richard Sackler deduced that doctors were prescribing OxyContin more often because they had the mistaken belief that it was weaker than morphine. In fact, OxyContin is stronger than morphine. Purdue personnel were told to suppress this fact to keep the prescriptions flowing. In 2001, a Federal Prosecutor noted that 59 overdose deaths had occurred in his state alone. Sackler's response in an internal company memo, \"This is not too bad. It could have been far worse.\" The company refused to take responsibility for the people it was killing, so they went after the addicts themselves. In 2001, Richard Sackler said this in an internal memo. \"We have to hammer on abusers in every possible way. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.\" As the crisis worsened, Purdue continued to deny the addictiveness of their pills, saying the epidemic was simply a matter of immorality on the part of individual users. Meanwhile, year after year, the Sacklers kept pushing their company to sell more and more painkillers. Sales personnel were pressured to market OxyContin to doctors for all kinds of ailments, and at higher and more addictive doses. If prescriptions didn't rise fast enough, sales reps were threatened with termination. And, of course, they got the message. OxyContin salesmen held sometimes daily meetings with physicians urging them to prescribe more and more OxyContin. Several doctors the company lobbied eventually lost their licenses for malpractice, for following this advice. When some of the more ethical doctors expressed concerns about addiction, the company placated them by saying their patients actually suffered from \"pseudo-addiction.\" That was in - a condition, they claim, could be treated with, you guessed it, more OxyContin. Meanwhile, Raymond Sackler meddled with the company's advertisements. He was angry they didn't portray OxyContin positively enough. Purdue only discontinued direct sales efforts for OxyContin in February 2018, less than a year ago. How many lives might have been saved if they'd stopped earlier or if they never lied at all? Those are pointless questions now. They didn't care. They were getting rich. Another Caravan coming for the U.S.-Mexico border. That Border remains unsecured by a government with a broken immigration system. A lot of things happening there that people in Washington are denying. We'll talk to someone who was just there who's got the latest and the truth about our Southern border, after the break."

So, on day 31, the partial government shutdown is no closer to ending. And the President's attempt at gaining support on the Left may have caused a bit of anxiety on the Right. Mr. Trump offered to temporarily extend protections for DACA recipients, those who were brought to the country illegally as children. But now, Conservatives are accusing the President of embracing amnesty. The President shot back that his offer was temporary, not permanent, quoting here, \"No. Amnesty is not part of my offer. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else.\" And now, some GOP Senators want to get the President's proposal on the Senate floor, not that it has the 60 votes necessary to pass, but as a way to get debate rolling. Meantime, as thousands of Central American migrants continue their trek toward Tijuana with hopes of getting into the U.S., thousands of other migrants are taking Mexico up on its offer of asylum. Mexico says almost 3,700 people have now registered for temporary status. And following a series of cartel attacks on Mexican police, the U.S. government has now issued a security alert for Juarez, Mexico that is just across the Rio Grande from El Paso. U.S. government personnel are now being told to avoid all police and law enforcement agencies in and around the City of Juarez. Tucker."

They have Chinese nationals who are showing up doing this same thing, spending tens of thousands of dollars because they know that once they get processed and let - let free, they'll be in the interior of the United States, and they're going to have to wait two to five years, probably, for the backlog of cases, and no Judge at that point is going to let them go.

You're talking about a night - and, by the way, I took this photo the day we were there, the first day. This was four, actually, Mexican illegals crossing the fence. It was a double-layer fence. We caught them - I - I didn't catch them. I was just observing the journalists. But Border Patrol caught them as they were - they finally making - making landfall here on the U.S. side. But people are saying, \"Well see this shows you that the fence doesn't work.\" And I said, \"No. They were caught within 30 seconds of crossing because of the sensors and the barriers and the fence.\" But it just goes to show you how widespread the problem is still at the Border. When you can be there for a few hours, you are very likely to see illegal crossings happen. By the way, they had previous criminal records, which is the only reason that they didn't just turn themselves in, and say, \"I want asylum.\" We had other people show up with a kid that, by the way, they may have either rented or recycled, which is now a tactic they use as well, where they pass children to people who don't actually, they're not family members. But they - people will rent their children into this process to make money, and say, \"This is my child,\" because then they know they get a special - they get special treatment when they claim asylum. So, there's a lot of ways that people are gaming the system. But if you have a previous criminal record, the asylum thing's not going to work. So that's why they try to sneak over illegally."
