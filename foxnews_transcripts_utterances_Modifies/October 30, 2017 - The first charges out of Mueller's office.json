The president tweeted earlier today before all of this, \"Sorry, but this is years ago,\" this is when the indictments first came out, \"before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't crooked Hillary and the Dems the focus??? Also, there is no collusion!\" The second part of the release today was about George Papadopoulos, who was by all accounts a volunteer on the Trump campaign. But there you see in a national security meeting a couple pictures from the Trump Instagram account. And he pled guilty October 5th to misleading statements to the FBI in this investigation. And I guess those were the eyebrow-raising developments today because we don't know what has done since he was arrested in July.  Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief of The Weekly Standard; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.

If he is interested in people not doing a good job with registering their work on behalf of foreign governments and the election meddling, he is going to be curious to look more into Fusion GPS, which is the firm that was hired by the Clintons, by the Clinton campaign and the DNC to run that Russia-Trump dossier operation.
