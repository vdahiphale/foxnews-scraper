Remember, it was just last Friday that we learned about another sickening effort by certain bad actors inside the bureau to target the President. Remember after Peter Strzok's insurance policy failed to prevent Trump from winning the White House, Comey's FBI cronies pulled another surprise out of its bag of tricks.  They launched an unconstitutional and unprecedented counter-Intel investigation of the sitting President. They should all be fired at least those who are still working within the department. Well, by the way, this was supposedly done, get this, because Trump fired Comey which of course if they read the little pocket constitution, the President was fully entitled to do under Article 2 of the constitution. Now the Inspector General's final report should expose all of this, can't wait. And as if things couldn't get more poisonous, we learn today that the former General Counsel of the FBI, James Baker himself is under investigation for media leaks against President Trump. Turns out, he was in regular contact with Mother Jones Leftist writer David Corn, are they still publishing? Well, it's just a coincidence I'm sure. It was a - remember, it was the first to report on that phony Steele Dossier you know, the thing that was a predicate used to start the entire Trump- Russia probe.

But today they didn't lay a glove on Bill Barr and that's THE ANGLE. Here now, is former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova, Senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Victor Davis Hanson and former Clinton aide and Attorney, Richard Goodstein. All right Richard, after today and what I just laid down on THE ANGLE, how can Democrats or you, in any real and credible way, object to Bill Barr's nomination?   RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISOR & ATTORNEY: I think the paramount influence right now where we are as a country is to follow the mold of Elliot Richardson.  When he was confirmed as Attorney General in the midst of Watergate, when we had a President that was under a legitimate investigation who said, if I'm asked to basically fire or if the special counsel is fired, I quit and Bill Ruckelshaus, his deputy did the same thing. And when the Archibald Cox was fired, they said it was the easiest decision they ever had to make in life, they were lionized for it but they quit because that's what they had promised to do. I was waiting for Barr frankly in the interest of the country. Look, if we cared about the rule of law, Donald Trump should testify about everything he knows--",

But more importantly, his task is to re-establish the concept of equality under law because we know that people like James Comey were leaking, Andrew McCabe was leaking, Baker was leaking. We know that FISA courts were deceived, we know that the Director of the FBI went before Congress under oath 245 times that he didn't know or didn't remember something that they'd bring Trump up to Miller and he did that, they would indict him. So there's a perception out there in America whether it's warranted or not, that there's two sets of laws. There's Mueller's investigation of Trump that goes over you know, every type of business, tax, relationship, the whole 20-months-worth of investigation and then there's these key players in the FBI and DOJ that are involved in behaviors.  I'm not even getting in to the unmasking and leaking of the Mike Flynn or the national security council's leaking of on-mask names or the Hillary Clinton's work probe but there's this perception that there's no quality under the law and that's fatal for democracy.  So that's what he has to do. He has to look at all of this behavior, not just the Mueller investigation but all the tangential behavior and ask himself, was American federal law applied equally across the board regardless of a person's stature, income, money or position and so for that hasn't been true.",

All right, guys, thanks so much and coming up, former house speaker Newt Gingrich with a history lesson for a Democratic star who wants to set aside what? Founding document. And why does today's Brexit vote really, really matter?

So there's been - always been an underlying critique from the left.  To take the example of the popular vote. The truth is outside of California, Donald Trump won by a 12,00,000 votes. The entire margin for Hillary Clinton came in one state, a state in which Trump didn't even campaign because under the current rules, he knew he could win without it. Yet, that can't - that's not good enough for some radical Democrats. The degree to which Democrats on the left dislike their own country, whether it is O'Rourke calling for rethinking the constitution or whether it is at least three Democratic Senators being overly anti-Catholic or several of new House members being overly anti-Semitic.

But same thing with the constitution, I mean, the constitution in many areas of the university is taught to be a creation of a bunch of old white - dead, white, racist guys so why should we listen to that.

And I think this is one of the things that most frightens the left. They have used judges deliberately to try to impose a radical agenda on America. We are gradually beating that back. Mitch McConnell deserves a lot of credit for taking the lead in getting through the Senate the largest number of judges in the first two years I think in American history. That's going to continue.

And what happened in Europe has happened between the Greeks and the European government, the Italians of the European government, you are seeing it in France where they have been having riots, and you see in Great Britain where they voted to leave. So you are seeing the falling apart of what had been a European contract that the elites had worked desperately to create for the last half-century. The same thing is happening here. The reason the left hates Trump -- and I think he is the most attacked president since Abraham Lincoln -- and the reason is, much like Lincoln, he represents a fundamental breakdown in the old order and a willingness to do new things in new ways. And as you saw with the FBI report, I listened to you earlier, they literally hate him. What Theresa May tried to do is she tried to cleverly straddle the fence, and the guy who made the point, you have a choice between chaos and order, and by two to one they said they preferred chaos because they repudiate the order of the old left and refuse to be governed by it.",

He's a friend, don't hold that against him but the bottom line is, he knows a legal terrain really well and he even oversaw the Robert Mueller guy that we're focused on, once before when Mueller was head of DOJ's criminal division.

Well Bill Barr couldn't assume this job of Attorney General fast enough especially given the revelations of the FBI's war against this President. Remember, it was just last Friday that we learned about another sickening effort by certain bad actors inside the bureau to target the President. Remember after Peter Strzok's insurance policy failed to prevent Trump from winning the White House, Comey's FBI cronies pulled another surprise out of its bag of tricks. They launched an unconstitutional and unprecedented counter-Intel investigation of the sitting President. They should all be fired at least those who are still working within the department. Well, by the way, this was supposedly done, get this, because Trump fired Comey which of course if they read the little pocket constitution, the President was fully entitled to do under Article 2 of the constitution. Now the Inspector General's final report should expose all of this, can't wait. And as if things couldn't get more poisonous, we learn today that the former General Counsel of the FBI, James Baker himself is under investigation for media leaks against President Trump. Turns out, he was in regular contact with Mother Jones Leftist writer David Corn, are they still publishing? Well, it's just a coincidence I'm sure. It was a - remember, it was the first to report on that phony Steele Dossier you know, the thing that was a predicate used to start the entire Trump- Russia probe. Barr understands the danger inherent in the Department of Justice that becomes its own political strike force and the danger of criminalizing politics and of over-zealous prosecutors."

But because many of them, not all, but many are infected with this anti- Trump virus, everyone Trump nominates, every idea that Trump has must be resisted or the individuals involved at least bruised in the process. But today they didn't lay a glove on Bill Barr and that's THE ANGLE. Here now, is former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova, Senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Victor Davis Hanson and former Clinton aide and Attorney, Richard Goodstein. All right Richard, after today and what I just laid down on THE ANGLE, how can Democrats or you, in any real and credible way, object to Bill Barr's nomination? RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISOR & ATTORNEY: I think the paramount influence right now where we are as a country is to follow the mold of Elliot Richardson. When he was confirmed as Attorney General in the midst of Watergate, when we had a President that was under a legitimate investigation who said, if I'm asked to basically fire or if the special counsel is fired, I quit and Bill Ruckelshaus, his deputy did the same thing. And when the Archibald Cox was fired, they said it was the easiest decision they ever had to make in life, they were lionized for it but they quit because that's what they had promised to do. I was waiting for Barr frankly in the interest of the country. Look, if we cared about the rule of law, Donald Trump should testify about everything he knows--"

Now some conservatives as I pointed out in THE ANGLE and on Twitter, you can see their comments, they're nervous because they think wait a second, is this kind of a stealth nominee.

They asked him pointed questions, most of them were well within the range except for some occasional stupid questions from Cory Booker and of course, Crazy Mazie Hirono but well, I must say this, Bill Barr gave perfect answers. He indicated that he was his own person. He would make independent judgments, it's all you can ask from a serious person and I think the Democrats have actually caved, this is over, he's going to be voted out of committee, he's going to be confirmed and Elliot Richardson, you know, God rest his soul, that's all fine and wonderful. Bill Barr has to deal with today and right now, he's going to be the next Attorney General and let me tell you, the people in the FBI and the DOJ who conspired to deny Donald Trump, his civil rights both during the election, during the transition and after he became President, when they committed those crimes, they are shaking in their boots at the thought of Bill Barr being the next Attorney General of the United States."

      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "Well, because he's taking over and Justice Departments have a large number of departures and in FBI, at least 10 people have been reassigned, retired or fired so the agency has lost his reputation and so has the Department of Justice. But more importantly, his task is to re-establish the concept of equality under law because we know that people like James Comey were leaking, Andrew McCabe was leaking, Baker was leaking. We know that FISA courts were deceived, we know that the Director of the FBI went before Congress under oath 245 times that he didn't know or didn't remember something that they'd bring Trump up to Miller and he did that, they would indict him. So there's a perception out there in America whether it's warranted or not, that there's two sets of laws. There's Mueller's investigation of Trump that goes over you know, every type of business, tax, relationship, the whole 20-months-worth of investigation and then there's these key players in the FBI and DOJ that are involved in behaviors. I'm not even getting in to the unmasking and leaking of the Mike Flynn or the national security council's leaking of on-mask names or the Hillary Clinton's work probe but there's this perception that there's no quality under the law and that's fatal for democracy. So that's what he has to do. He has to look at all of this behavior, not just the Mueller investigation but all the tangential behavior and ask himself, was American federal law applied equally across the board regardless of a person's stature, income, money or position and so for that hasn't been true."

If they really were concerned about the Russians, they would have been concerned about President Obama telling Mr. Medvedev that he would have more flexibility after the election to kowtow to Putin, they would have been concerned about the removal of defensive missiles from Eastern Europe. They would have been concerned about all the things that Hillary Clinton tried to do, to so- called reset the relationship with Russia, this is a phony argument that the Democrats are making because they have nothing else and as part of the conspiracy to frame Donald Trump, which we now see playing out on the front page of The New York Times.

So there's been - always been an underlying critique from the left. To take the example of the popular vote. The truth is outside of California, Donald Trump won by a 12,00,000 votes. The entire margin for Hillary Clinton came in one state, a state in which Trump didn't even campaign because under the current rules, he knew he could win without it. Yet, that can't - that's not good enough for some radical Democrats. The degree to which Democrats on the left dislike their own country, whether it is O'Rourke calling for rethinking the constitution or whether it is at least three Democratic Senators being overly anti-Catholic or several of new House members being overly anti-Semitic.

Interesting that you know some Democrats you know, they don't - they're not very popular but they say like, we like those statues to remain because it allows us to debate where we were, where we are now and it keeps the sweep of history in front of us instead of eradicating the memory of what happened before. But same thing with the constitution, I mean, the constitution in many areas of the university is taught to be a creation of a bunch of old white - dead, white, racist guys so why should we listen to that. I mean and - but it's a toxic brew, both on the cultural front, educational front and you know concluding in the political front which is where we heard it."

I mean just go around the planet and look what happens when you don't have a constitution, the rule of law, exactly what Bill Bar was standing for today and I think we need to understand, the totalitarian left in this country doesn't want any memory left, that isn't their memory. That's what they want statues torn down, they want books eliminated, they want speakers banned from campuses, they are determined to impose a very left wing world view and anything else gets automatically attacked."

It is true that we have a worldwide reach, it's also true that Thomas Jefferson talked about being an empire of liberty but he meant, we want to be the beacon that people come to because most people want to live with freedom, most people don't want to live in a tyranny and most people in the long run, we want to have govern themselves on their terms."

How is it that we can't determine how many citizens and non-citizens are in the country, that's now unlawful?"

These judges are the judicial branch extension of the same crazy left-wing-ism that we were seeing from politicians, that we see on academic campuses, that we see in \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post.\" They just happen to have the power of judges. And of course, one of the reasons that the left hates Trump is that Trump is appointing conservative judges who are going to follow the constitution and are going to permit freedom. And I think this is one of the things that most frightens the left. They have used judges deliberately to try to impose a radical agenda on America. We are gradually beating that back. Mitch McConnell deserves a lot of credit for taking the lead in getting through the Senate the largest number of judges in the first two years I think in American history. That's going to continue. But it's the same fight. These are all the same kind of people with the same crazy values, and they are all determined to impose on you and me and everybody else their particular worldview, whether in fact it's legal or not."

On every level, they want to kind of smash the old norms and replace it with what? They want to replace it with a sort of an international understanding where America is just another cog in an international scheme of governmental control?

What you see is a popular rebellion against what is literally a 50-year-old elitist leftwing effort, both in Europe and in America, to create a system in which, if you are a professor or a lawyer or a bureaucrat, you acquired enormous power. And what happened in Europe has happened between the Greeks and the European government, the Italians of the European government, you are seeing it in France where they have been having riots, and you see in Great Britain where they voted to leave. So you are seeing the falling apart of what had been a European contract that the elites had worked desperately to create for the last half-century. The same thing is happening here. The reason the left hates Trump -- and I think he is the most attacked president since Abraham Lincoln -- and the reason is, much like Lincoln, he represents a fundamental breakdown in the old order and a willingness to do new things in new ways. And as you saw with the FBI report, I listened to you earlier, they literally hate him. What Theresa May tried to do is she tried to cleverly straddle the fence, and the guy who made the point, you have a choice between chaos and order, and by two to one they said they preferred chaos because they repudiate the order of the old left and refuse to be governed by it."

      "utterance": "I can debate that, but I asked her a question after that. And it was a really simple question, in a majority black country, say in Africa, those with privilege, are they exhibiting black privilege, applying the logic that is used by those who apply white privilege in this country? That is what makes it's false. If you want to talk about economic situations, privilege classes versus non-privileged, that's different. But to ascribe it to the color of skin is the falsehood in this."

You can grow up as a middle-class white kid in a suburb of Hartford, Connecticut, what I did, or you can grow up as a really rich white kid in Greenwich, maybe have a totally different worldview, maybe you agree on issues. You can grow up an African-American kid in a poor neighborhood or in a wealthier neighborhood. It doesn't necessarily mean that we are privileged, which is a shorthand, I think -- I don't think it brings people closer together. I really don't."
