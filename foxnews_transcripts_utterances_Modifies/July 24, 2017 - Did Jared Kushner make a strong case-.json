It begins with the fake news!

And it was not what we might've anticipated a couple weeks ago when news first broke of that meeting.  There's also another thing, though, which is that obviously Jared Kushner is not ground zero of the Russia conspiracy, but if people are interested in Russian meddling in the election, I think they need to start looking at Fusion GPS, which is the Democratic opposition research firm that's run by a bunch of former \"Wall Street Journal\" reporters who were behind the dossier, they had ties to this meeting, they were running interference for the company that was involved in the sanctions.

The more forthright of them, the Democrats should never have lost this election to somebody like Donald Trump. But for many reasons, many of which were their own fault, they did. And so now what's happening is in the middle of this scandal or whatever it is about Russia, some of these senior people in the party and their pollsters and focus group people are getting together and trying to learn some lessons from that and pivot to a positive message aiming toward winning back some seats in November of 2018. Perhaps the bad news from their point of view is what they actually produced today was pretty tentative, and talked about things that are very familiar -- infrastructure, minimum wage, nothing really very new. And I thought it was interesting there was nothing in it about trade. Obviously that's an issue that divides the party because Bernie Sanders has a position almost like Donald Trump, but Hillary, of course, was more of a free trader, and they haven't resolved that internally. So here's this huge issue that really played favorably for Trump in the election and they haven't reformulated it.",

But overall, I thought it was a good statement, and it looks like he's clean.  As for Sessions, I said on Friday he was a wounded man walking. I would revise that after the tweet today about, from Trump. I think he's an extremely, dangerously wounded man walking. And I think it only now a matter of time.
