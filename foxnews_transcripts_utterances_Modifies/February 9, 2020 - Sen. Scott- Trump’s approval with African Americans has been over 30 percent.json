      "sentences": "Good Sunday, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo. A big week for President Trump this past week, after his acquittal and the State of the Union address.  Coming up right here, the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani is with me.  Plus, we are two days away from the New Hampshire primary, the next big test for the Democrats, followed by South Carolina, and then Super Tuesday on March 3.  Also this morning, the death toll from the coronavirus is on the rise. The Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, Chad Wolf, is here live to tell us how the department is moving to keeping America safe, plus his take on why New York is fighting the department over changes to the Global Entry program. In the aftermath of a bitter impeachment battle, we will finally see accountability for misconduct within the DOJ and the FBI. Will we? We will talk with Congressman Devin Nunes and Congressman Doug Collins, along with Senator Tim Scott, coming up.  All that and a lot more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we have a lot to get to you this morning.  First, some Republican senators on Capitol Hill pledging to press ahead with investigations into Hunter Biden and his finances after President Trump's impeachment acquittal last week.   The president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has said he backs that effort. Mr. Giuliani joins me right now. Rudy, it's wonderful to see you.",

Now, if -- if New York, again, wants to restore this access, then we're happy to continue to process these applications. But, specifically, what they did is, they don't allow CBP to check their DMV database as they vet applicants for a Global Entry or another trusted traveler program. So, what does that mean? It means that CBP doesn't have access to indicate if an individual has a DUI, or has another aggravated traffic offense. Either one of those are disqualification for the program. So, my job is to make sure that that program maintains its integrity, so that individuals in New York are processed and evaluated the same as individuals in Michigan, Minnesota, or California.

This whole Russia hoax and Ukraine hoax, they were in on it from the very beginning. They have refused to talk about just how wrong the Democrats really were. You have to ask yourself, why is that?

The lower-level folks who are involved in this, what is happening to them? He wouldn't comment on that.

A big week for President Trump this past week, after his acquittal and the State of the Union address. Coming up right here, the president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani is with me. Plus, we are two days away from the New Hampshire primary, the next big test for the Democrats, followed by South Carolina, and then Super Tuesday on March 3. Also this morning, the death toll from the coronavirus is on the rise. The Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, Chad Wolf, is here live to tell us how the department is moving to keeping America safe, plus his take on why New York is fighting the department over changes to the Global Entry program. In the aftermath of a bitter impeachment battle, we will finally see accountability for misconduct within the DOJ and the FBI. Will we? We will talk with Congressman Devin Nunes and Congressman Doug Collins, along with Senator Tim Scott, coming up. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we have a lot to get to you this morning. First, some Republican senators on Capitol Hill pledging to press ahead with investigations into Hunter Biden and his finances after President Trump's impeachment acquittal last week. The president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has said he backs that effort. Mr. Giuliani joins me right now. Rudy, it's wonderful to see you."

And now they're looking at where the money went to Joe. The whole deal there was between the owner of the company and Joe, and it was to protect the company.

And we're talking millions. We're not talking pennies. Joe claims he didn't know, he didn't notice that his brother and his son, who has this challenge with drugs, were becoming millionaires right around him.

So, what we have done is, we have put together a multilayered strategy, an across-agency task force to address this issue. So, we have put measures in place at airports of entry, at land ports of entry and at maritime ports of entry. So, in the air environment, we're funneling flights from China to 11 airports. And that also includes any other individuals coming from any other country that have been in China in the last 14 days, to make sure that they get the right medical screening and the medical care that they need at those 11 airports. And so what we hear from the CDC and the medical professionals at CDC, that 14-day period, whether you're symptomatic or asymptomatic, is very critical. So, we're looking at that. We're making sure that, again, folks have the right medical care. And if they need to be government-quarantined or a self-imposed quarantine, that they are -- that they do that and, again, that they have the medical information they need to protect themselves and their -- and their loved ones."

What we have seen over the past several weeks is, the three major U.S. carriers all but ceasing flights from China. So, the majority of flights that are coming in from China are Chinese airlines carrying mainly U.S. passengers -- or U.S. citizens, I should say. But, as we look at land ports of entry, when we look at the total amount of individuals crossing, we see the highest amount of Chinese nationals crossing in Blaine, Washington, San Ysidro -- and that's in California -- and Buffalo. So, we're taking extra precaution at those ports of entry, as well as all ports of entry, to make sure ,again, the medical care and screening is occurring there, and, again, if quarantine is necessary, that they have the procedures and the facilities to do that at those ports of entry.

That's dangerous, and that's irresponsible. But that's separate from what we're -- what we did this week. New York is the only state -- and that bears repeating -- the only state that restricts CBP access to their DMV data across the board, not only for immigration purposes, but for law enforcement purposes, for customs purposes, but also for trade and travel facilitation purposes, the only state, which is precisely why we took the action that we did. Now, if -- if New York, again, wants to restore this access, then we're happy to continue to process these applications. But, specifically, what they did is, they don't allow CBP to check their DMV database as they vet applicants for a Global Entry or another trusted traveler program. So, what does that mean? It means that CBP doesn't have access to indicate if an individual has a DUI, or has another aggravated traffic offense. Either one of those are disqualification for the program. So, my job is to make sure that that program maintains its integrity, so that individuals in New York are processed and evaluated the same as individuals in Michigan, Minnesota, or California. And, right now, because New York took this action, the department had to respond and take appropriate action to make sure that the rest of the individuals in these programs continue to be able to use the program."

If you have a DUI, if you have another aggravated traffic offense, whether that's a misdemeanor or a felony, you are -- you are disqualified from this program.

And it is now gaining traction in African-American communities across this nation. And that's really good news for this president.

And it all started with Devin Nunes exposing the truth. Take a look at this, President Trump calling out Congressman Devin Nunes. He's going to be joining me next. Despite the impeachment saga ending in acquittal, House Democrats are still yet to release one of the transcripts from their closed-door politicians. Joining me right now is Republican Congressman Devin Nunes of California. He is ranking member of the House Intel Committee. And, Congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us."

      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's not going to end. They have been doing it since the president was first elected, just like Senator Scott just said. All the major newspapers in this country, the legacy media owned by the billionaires, they have all been calling for it. So this has been a work in progress. And they imploded with the Russia investigation in a big way, because it was a complete hoax. And then they manufactured this new Ukrainian hoax, which we're starting to get to the bottom of this hoax. And I think, as soon as the whistle-blower actually gets called -- or the supposable whistle-blower gets called before the Senate and conducts an interview, you will be able to fit the pieces in between the Democrats in the House and their staff, who met with the whistle-blower, and this scam that the ICIG is under, who refuses to provide the evidence for his outlandish claims that you didn't need to have firsthand information, you only had to have secondhand information, and that somehow, miraculously, the form was changed, and then none of those stories actually make any sense. And when you put all that together, I think you're going to find a fake impeachment hoax."

      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, we sent -- the Republican leader Jim Jordan and I sent a letter originally in October. We didn't want to get in the middle of the impeachment hoax while we were going through that. We said, we're going to come back and revisit this. When that was -- when it was -- finally, the impeachment was out of the House, we tried to get a response again at the beginning of January, which I think you broke on your show. So, still no response. I mean, he's responding, but he's refusing to provide documentation. So, if indeed you -- that this wasn't -- that the policy wasn't what it said on your form, OK, if indeed that happened, then there has to be e-mails and drafts of the form that would have been created. And all we're asking is for the ICIG to provide evidence. And, remember, I.G.s, they're really good about getting evidence."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. And I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, who sent a letter to I.G. Michael Atkinson asking for information about the whistle-blower and how the I.G.'s office handled the whistle-blower in the impeachment. Congressman, do you think we're going to see any accountability here? I mean, there is debate about the president firing Ambassador (sic) Vindman. And now there is question -- there are questions about where this is going. We know what took place in 2016, that Durham has a criminal investigation under way. What about accountability?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I believe we're going to get accountability. I believe Durham is going to get to the full story. You see what the president is doing. I have been saying for a long time that the National Security Council that's there at the White House, 400 and some people, he would be best to take all of those people, ship them across the Potomac, put them -- quarantine them, get them the hell away from the White House, because we know that a lot of the leaks for the last three-plus years have been coming from that National Security Council. So the president really needs to only have Trump appointees that are close to him in the White House, because we know they're talking to the media. And, look, that's really what's caused this problem, Maria. It's been the media. The legacy media in this country, they're not doing their jobs. This whole Russia hoax and Ukraine hoax, they were in on it from the very beginning. They have refused to talk about just how wrong the Democrats really were. You have to ask yourself, why is that? At some point, you have to understand they're just part of the team. They're part of the socialist left. There's no other excuse for it. If you -- everything that the Republicans in the House have done over the last three-and-a-half years -- you have had John Ratcliffe on."

But the very thing that Adam Schiff and the Democrats in the House accused President Trump of doing, of trying to dig up dirt from foreigners, OK, that's what the Clinton campaign did.

Number one, Chris Wray actually has taken care of a lot of the senior leadership at the FBI that we all know was part of that corrupt cabal of Strzok, Comey, Page that we have been fighting against for so long, but then also wasn't real clear on what he's going to do on how -- besides implementing the instructions from the Horowitz report, is there other things that can be done? The lower-level folks who are involved in this, what is happening to them? He wouldn't comment on that. He wouldn't talk about the Woods report, which is a documentation background into the Carter Page FISA application. And he wouldn't really talk about the FISA leaks that has caused such a stir here that I know Devin and others have talked and we have been talking about for so long. That's part of the problem that's got to be fixed. He's going to have to do more in that regard."

They're not going to get anything done. When you have the FISA, which is -- we need to actually work on FISA on our Judiciary Committee. But I have got Jerry Nadler taking his time during the Chris Wray testimony to talk about Brett Kavanaugh. He's wanting to go back and discuss something that was almost two years ago that has been put to rest. And he's wanting to focus on possible things that he don't think the Trump administration did right then. Between Schiff and Nadler, who, by the way, are not getting along real well -- you can tell that in their public demeanor. When we can't get the two of them to get along, Democrats are fighting Democrats, then we can't get anything done in the House."
