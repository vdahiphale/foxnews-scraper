It's now a category four hurricane and it is expected to make landfall in the coming hours. The warnings going out to residents in danger that the storm surge could be un-survivable as the word that they are using obviously they're encouraging everybody to get out of there. So almost 15 years to the day since Katrina, roared into the Gulf at the end of August that year so we are keeping close eye on that situation we will take you there live.  We're going to update you throughout the hour. So stay with us for that. Meanwhile, the police shootings of Jacob Blake triggering more killing in Kenosha, Wisconsin tonight. Two people were shot to death in the third night of unrest.  Now, a 17 -year-old suspect is in custody on suspicion of first-degree first degree homicide. A reporter for daily caller interviewed the young man he says as the alleged suspect before the shot rang out. Watch this.",

There was the first shooting where a man was shot in the head and my coworker Richard - actually helped carry him to a car and transported him to a hospital. Then I remained out in the street, and there was a second shooting where a man was shot in the arm, and there was a third victim. So we do know that a 17 -year-old suspect has been arrested, it appears that this person in this video is this aspect. Of course, we are still waiting for more details to come out because the scene was so chaotic. It was in the middle of a night of riots in Kenosha so we are still learning details hour by hour.",

I was sort of across the street pretty close to where the gunshots rang out, and as soon as they started firing, my first thought was I have to make sure that my coworker is okay. So, after the gunshots stopped, I ran towards where the shooting had occurred and, I put myself into the middle just to make sure because it seemed this scene seemed fine. I had seen the shooter, or the alleged shooter run past me.  People were chasing him saying this is the shooter, so they went the opposite direction, I went towards where the first victim was and that's where I saw Richie, literally take the shirt off his back to apply pressure to this man's head wound, and picked him up, carried him across the street with some other men and loaded him into a car.   So I think the adrenaline was pumping at that point and I was just more concerned for the safety of the team. And likely come out we were all totally fine and definitely a scary situation but, these things are it gets out of control sometimes.",

About a minute after that, there was another round of gunshots police arrived after all of that, so I would guess it took police about five or six minutes to arrive, which was surprising because as far as I knew, they were just down the street and they had been out all night sort of trying to disperse these rioters.",

I've got to tell you they have got to take quicker swifter or action there. We went to a situation like this several years ago and we called that we brought the Wisconsin State Patrol and, we brought the National Guard and we did it immediately.  The other thing that actually helped is at times was clergy coming to try to defuse that situation in Milwaukee. And it never even got close to escalating into something like this. But sadly, the Governor and other officials haven't acted as quick enough. Thankfully they try and retook the advice from the president accepting his help and I don't know why it took Joe Biden three days - three nights of rioting in the violence into desk before speaking out against the violence. You can be upset about what you saw in the videotape, there is no doubt about that, but at the same time you have got to call out the violence.

And it has been such a wonderful ride for a boss and the president that has been so good that let me know he has been elevating women in business and government on his campaign and his corporation and his cabinet for a decade. And it's just been very natural he lets us - he confides us consults us and whether the man knew it or not or liked it or not President Trump has always made sure that I and the other women here have been on equal footing with the men. But I told him on Sunday night in the Oval Office what I was doing and I said you know for the next two months, you have to focus on winning, and I have to invest leisure wear and hover over my kids as they hover over their computers doing school from home. So what I'm doing is what millions and millions of parents across this country are doing Martha, which is trying to navigate this new not so normal where the kids are learning from home. I want to be there for them. During the spring I was here every day seven days a week when COVID-19 first hit, and when we were working around-the-clock. I didn't have the same opportunity that I want to have now to be there for them. But when the history books are written I want people to remember its Donald J. Trump who plucked me out of plain sight. I'd been working for decades at this and it was passed over by many people in the old boy's network and frankly the new boy's network and lots of those candidates lost. But he saw in me somebody who he wanted to help with his team, and it was a big team effort. He and Vice President Pence won that election by going across this country. But when people are you know - we have these handbooks that say women's empowerment, but it's only real if somebody lives it, if they walk it, if they actually promote women and not just talk about it.

I see these people leave the White House and write books about they were in this meeting and the president said that and now they believe this the time to do that is when you are here because the president not just accept, but expects dissenting opinions and different backgrounds. He once said two years ago that's absolutely which I like to watch them fight it out right in front of me. And we have done that because this is a man who wants people in front of him who come from different points of view, but then he weighs the consequences and advice and eventually makes the decision. So for me I think I've just always known that first of all I am as staffer, I'm not the principal, not everybody understood that. And also there are two people in the building with their name on the ballot, it is Donald Trump and Mike Pence, they ultimately will make the decisions. But also I think that in Washington D.C. Martha that people often overestimate how much you can or should get done by this Friday and they totally underestimate how much you can and could have get done in the next two weeks or two months. So I've also tried to be organized and planned that out. Also I know this sounds very simple but the truth is I love my job. And I always thought it was a blessing not a burden to work through this great nation and this great country. You don't come here for the money. I use to make - what I make here in a year I used to making a few speeches. You don't come here for the money; you come here for the love of country to think that you can be one molecule that's a positive force for change. I did put on my statement that I wanted to thank the right people, the president, the First Lady, and the Vice President Mrs. Pence, but I also want to thank the people I met along the way. Because this is a beautiful country filled with amazing people.  For all of our political differences and cultural grievances cleavages, the promise that of America belongs to us all. And what I put in there is that the people have re-affirmed my later in life believe that public service can be meaningful and consequential. I entered this job on my 50th birthday. I literally turned 50 the day he was inaugurated. Later in life, and I tell young people, you can put public service as part of your vocation and your career. I highly recommend it.

But I will say this I really very rarely mentioned my kids. I kept our lives very private, that's why people usually use the picture of the six of us from the Yankees game five years ago because I never had a Facebook account or Instagram account believe it or not. I don't post pictures of my kids every day. I want them to think I'm a good mom, I don't need the whole world to think I'm because I'm posting pictures and maybe one day I will get an Instagram account and you will see you know Kellyanne and their kids after the White House. But I've tried to keep them out of the spotlight and out of the limelight quite a bit all the while showing them the value progress. Isn't that I tried to teach them also as they matured, now in middle school and high school four of them that this is what mommy does at work. This is what I'm working on I tried to tell them I'm doing adoption and foster care, we're working on healthcare today. Or I was just in a meeting about the economy. Or I can't believe missing murdered indigenous women has been ignored for so long of the drug crisis or people are languishing in prison long after they paid their debts to society.  So I tried to be them bring them along as best I can all the while letting them be kids. But what I would say is that I don't let anybody define me and nobody can make you feel badly without your permission. That is my message to people. And I think that American couples can disagree and all of that, but I prefer to - you know we made much more private about that and try to use my social media platform to not attack people, to not attack me. My speech tonight, to the RNC to the country is much like the First Lady's last night in that she said hey, if you haven't noticed, I didn't use my precious time here didn't tonight to attack the other side. We had to do Former First Lady's last week doing exactly that, attack, attack, attack. And I think for all the talk of unifying the country and coming together there is so much more that unites us and divides us. And some of us are trying and had tried to appeal to these better angles.

I only went on one foreign trip Martha because I really didn't want to go away for six days, seven days, eight days at a time, five days at a time and leave the kids here while I did that.

It is true that there have been rough times for certain farmers and certain states, but the economy has performed very well under President Trump particularly before the coronavirus. And more than that, there is not a particularly good case being put forth by the opposing party in terms of Joe Biden recently said that he would reinstitute the -- or he would -- he would take away that tax cuts and tax reform that had been passed previously, which is not going to be a message that they want to hear.  But farming isn't really the big issue here even though it has been something that's been focused on at the convention. More interesting, I think, is that the Trump campaign is working very hard to expand the voting base in some of these states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Tremendous outreach to the black community and not just that kind where they focus on someone who's black, speaking at the convention, but basing it in policy decisions that the Trump administration has made over the previous term whether that's support for historically black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform, or job growth. And these are the types of things that don't just appeal to black voters, but to the middle-class voters in general.

Because they are saying why are Democrats standing back as stores are being burned to the ground, as people's livelihoods are being destroyed. It's one thing to have a peaceful protest, but it's transformed into this violence. And the Democrat Party is sitting on their hands silently.

It's now a category four hurricane and it is expected to make landfall in the coming hours. The warnings going out to residents in danger that the storm surge could be un-survivable as the word that they are using obviously they're encouraging everybody to get out of there. So almost 15 years to the day since Katrina, roared into the Gulf at the end of August that year so we are keeping close eye on that situation we will take you there live. We're going to update you throughout the hour. So stay with us for that. Meanwhile, the police shootings of Jacob Blake triggering more killing in Kenosha, Wisconsin tonight. Two people were shot to death in the third night of unrest. Now, a 17 -year-old suspect is in custody on suspicion of first-degree first degree homicide.

      "utterance": "Right now we pretty much know what everybody else knows. I think that the main thing is that there is so much chaos last night when this whole thing happened. There were multiple gunshots, there were it seems to be coming from different directions. There was the first shooting where a man was shot in the head and my coworker Richard - actually helped carry him to a car and transported him to a hospital. Then I remained out in the street, and there was a second shooting where a man was shot in the arm, and there was a third victim. So we do know that a 17 -year-old suspect has been arrested, it appears that this person in this video is this aspect. Of course, we are still waiting for more details to come out because the scene was so chaotic. It was in the middle of a night of riots in Kenosha so we are still learning details hour by hour."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "TALCOTT",
      "utterance": "The first thought that I had was you know I had just actually just gotten off the phone with Richie because we were trying to meet up again because we'd gotten separated. I was sort of across the street pretty close to where the gunshots rang out, and as soon as they started firing, my first thought was I have to make sure that my coworker is okay. So, after the gunshots stopped, I ran towards where the shooting had occurred and, I put myself into the middle just to make sure because it seemed this scene seemed fine. I had seen the shooter, or the alleged shooter run past me. People were chasing him saying this is the shooter, so they went the opposite direction, I went towards where the first victim was and that's where I saw Richie, literally take the shirt off his back to apply pressure to this man's head wound, and picked him up, carried him across the street with some other men and loaded him into a car. So I think the adrenaline was pumping at that point and I was just more concerned for the safety of the team. And likely come out we were all totally fine and definitely a scary situation but, these things are it gets out of control sometimes."

      "speaker": "TALCOTT",

So the first shooting occurred and it probably took me about five seconds to get to the actual scene of the shooting and it probably took the boys I would say two or three minutes or so to get this man across the street, loaded into the vehicle and take into the hospital. About a minute after that, there was another round of gunshots police arrived after all of that, so I would guess it took police about five or six minutes to arrive, which was surprising because as far as I knew, they were just down the street and they had been out all night sort of trying to disperse these rioters."

Did you ever imagined that you would see in your home state, this kind of total anarchy where you've got a 17 - year-old walking down the street with a gun, all of these other anarchy as to who have been burning buildings, you can see the baseball bats in their backpacks.

Increasingly it's tragic for the people who live in Kenosha who now three nights in a row have had to live through fired scum of riots, and mayhem on the streets. I've got to tell you they have got to take quicker swifter or action there. We went to a situation like this several years ago and we called that we brought the Wisconsin State Patrol and, we brought the National Guard and we did it immediately. The other thing that actually helped is at times was clergy coming to try to defuse that situation in Milwaukee. And it never even got close to escalating into something like this. But sadly, the Governor and other officials haven't acted as quick enough. Thankfully they try and retook the advice from the president accepting his help and I don't know why it took Joe Biden three days - three nights of rioting in the violence into desk before speaking out against the violence. You can be upset about what you saw in the videotape, there is no doubt about that, but at the same time you have got to call out the violence. Unfortunately that's been a pattern we've seen there in Portland, Seattle, Chicago and elsewhere across the country."

We still haven't had confirmation that actually happened. And Scott Walker should know he was a guy who sued Obama many, many times over states rights.

I have posted my message publicly and have gotten tremendous support from people right, left, and center and non political people because they understand that we are mother's first most important best job most wonderful job ever. And it has been such a wonderful ride for a boss and the president that has been so good that let me know he has been elevating women in business and government on his campaign and his corporation and his cabinet for a decade. And it's just been very natural he lets us - he confides us consults us and whether the man knew it or not or liked it or not President Trump has always made sure that I and the other women here have been on equal footing with the men. But I told him on Sunday night in the Oval Office what I was doing and I said you know for the next two months, you have to focus on winning, and I have to invest leisure wear and hover over my kids as they hover over their computers doing school from home. So what I'm doing is what millions and millions of parents across this country are doing Martha, which is trying to navigate this new not so normal where the kids are learning from home. I want to be there for them. During the spring I was here every day seven days a week when COVID-19 first hit, and when we were working around-the-clock. I didn't have the same opportunity that I want to have now to be there for them. But when the history books are written I want people to remember its Donald J. Trump who plucked me out of plain sight. I'd been working for decades at this and it was passed over by many people in the old boy's network and frankly the new boy's network and lots of those candidates lost. But he saw in me somebody who he wanted to help with his team, and it was a big team effort. He and Vice President Pence won that election by going across this country. But when people are you know - we have these handbooks that say women's empowerment, but it's only real if somebody lives it, if they walk it, if they actually promote women and not just talk about it. He has done that."

I see these people leave the White House and write books about they were in this meeting and the president said that and now they believe this the time to do that is when you are here because the president not just accept, but expects dissenting opinions and different backgrounds. He once said two years ago that's absolutely which I like to watch them fight it out right in front of me. And we have done that because this is a man who wants people in front of him who come from different points of view, but then he weighs the consequences and advice and eventually makes the decision. So for me I think I've just always known that first of all I am as staffer, I'm not the principal, not everybody understood that. And also there are two people in the building with their name on the ballot, it is Donald Trump and Mike Pence, they ultimately will make the decisions. But also I think that in Washington D.C. Martha that people often overestimate how much you can or should get done by this Friday and they totally underestimate how much you can and could have get done in the next two weeks or two months. So I've also tried to be organized and planned that out. Also I know this sounds very simple but the truth is I love my job. And I always thought it was a blessing not a burden to work through this great nation and this great country. You don't come here for the money. I use to make - what I make here in a year I used to making a few speeches. You don't come here for the money; you come here for the love of country to think that you can be one molecule that's a positive force for change. I did put on my statement that I wanted to thank the right people, the president, the First Lady, and the Vice President Mrs. Pence, but I also want to thank the people I met along the way. Because this is a beautiful country filled with amazing people. For all of our political differences and cultural grievances cleavages, the promise that of America belongs to us all. And what I put in there is that the people have re-affirmed my later in life believe that public service can be meaningful and consequential. I entered this job on my 50th birthday. I literally turned 50 the day he was inaugurated. Later in life, and I tell young people, you can put public service as part of your vocation and your career. I highly recommend it. Boy, the president did it in his 70s."

We're doing that for our kids there is no question. You know Martha for all my public facing responsibilities and roles; I've worked on policy here most of all. But I will say this I really very rarely mentioned my kids. I kept our lives very private, that's why people usually use the picture of the six of us from the Yankees game five years ago because I never had a Facebook account or Instagram account believe it or not. I don't post pictures of my kids every day. I want them to think I'm a good mom, I don't need the whole world to think I'm because I'm posting pictures and maybe one day I will get an Instagram account and you will see you know Kellyanne and their kids after the White House. But I've tried to keep them out of the spotlight and out of the limelight quite a bit all the while showing them the value progress. Isn't that I tried to teach them also as they matured, now in middle school and high school four of them that this is what mommy does at work. This is what I'm working on I tried to tell them I'm doing adoption and foster care, we're working on healthcare today. Or I was just in a meeting about the economy. Or I can't believe missing murdered indigenous women has been ignored for so long of the drug crisis or people are languishing in prison long after they paid their debts to society. So I tried to be them bring them along as best I can all the while letting them be kids. But what I would say is that I don't let anybody define me and nobody can make you feel badly without your permission. That is my message to people. And I think that American couples can disagree and all of that, but I prefer to - you know we made much more private about that and try to use my social media platform to not attack people, to not attack me. My speech tonight, to the RNC to the country is much like the First Lady's last night in that she said hey, if you haven't noticed, I didn't use my precious time here didn't tonight to attack the other side. We had to do Former First Lady's last week doing exactly that, attack, attack, attack. And I think for all the talk of unifying the country and coming together there is so much more that unites us and divides us. And some of us are trying and had tried to appeal to these better angles. But I think very consistent about coming here and doing the job. I didn't change my mind, and I haven't changed my beliefs at all. I have grown tremendously. I didn't win every debate with the president."

But I do want to ask you, do you think that you should be getting more support from some women out there who might be giving someone in your shoes making the incredibly difficult decision that you have just made who is on the other side of the aisle; do you think that person would be treated differently?"

And people in the media who otherwise weren't nice to me or my boss, they really see this for what it is which is that we all make our decisions and we can't have everything all at once. And I also told the president on Sunday night you are really well- positioned in this White House and at your campaign to win a second term. And I think that's because of all those stuffs that he has done while he has been here. The progress report the vision piece for the future. But also I have to say, us as mothers aren't term limit. I've always been there for my kids, but now I can be there more with them. I only went on one foreign trip Martha because I really didn't want to go away for six days, seven days, eight days at a time, five days at a time and leave the kids here while I did that. So I did put limits, I didn't just run around and say and I didn't go on a foreign trip. You just make your decisions quietly. But, I'm not leaving the arena forever. I will announce my plans in the future. But as I said and I see it is also a T-shirt now somebody made it and it's selling it on FC that's says less drama more mama. It only comes in at kid's sizes, so I think that that is somebody probably took them and said you know what kids like that slogan. And but you're right, I do want to say you know George has sent out a tweet a while ago saying our kids are off limits, we don't give you consent to speak to our minor children who are 15, 14, 12, and ten. And most people did lay off, but some didn't. And they shouldn't have done that Martha for lots of reasons. And they should respect you know for ticks and clicks you got to think about this, a minor as a minor and you got to think about that. And you're absolutely right that things are off-limits.

Writing, quote, \"Convincing farm state voters to give Trump another four years could be trickier in 2020. Unlike other industries upended by the coronavirus, agriculture has been in a downturn for years. Trump's fate in November could largely depend on how much backlash he faces in key places like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from voters feeling the ripple effects of weakness in agriculture and the economy at large.\" Here now, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor of The Federalist and Fox News contributor.

      "utterance": "I don't think Donald Trump needs to worry too much about losing the agricultural vote, these were people who came out to support him in 2016, some people might have even been reluctant in doing it and in the intervening four years the case for voting for Trump in their minds has likely strengthened, not just because of a strong economy. It is true that there have been rough times for certain farmers and certain states, but the economy has performed very well under President Trump particularly before the coronavirus. And more than that, there is not a particularly good case being put forth by the opposing party in terms of Joe Biden recently said that he would reinstitute the -- or he would -- he would take away that tax cuts and tax reform that had been passed previously, which is not going to be a message that they want to hear. But farming isn't really the big issue here even though it has been something that's been focused on at the convention. More interesting, I think, is that the Trump campaign is working very hard to expand the voting base in some of these states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Tremendous outreach to the black community and not just that kind where they focus on someone who's black, speaking at the convention, but basing it in policy decisions that the Trump administration has made over the previous term whether that's support for historically black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform, or job growth. And these are the types of things that don't just appeal to black voters, but to the middle-class voters in general. And that's going to make a difference in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in North Carolina, Florida, and throughout the country."

      "utterance": "It is. And I'm -- it's a little unclear what what's the entire goal of walking off or boycotting one's own game is, but politically speaking, this is a serious challenge for the Democratic Party. You've had violent protests and riots going on for months in cities across the country. The violence is deeply alarming to a lot of voters, and at the Democratic National Convention there was not one word of condemnation of the violence in response to some of these shootings which always turn out to be a bit more complicated than first presented by the media. And it is, you know, there is a lot of pressure on Democrats as polling numbers show that this, that violence in cities across the country are starting to hurt Democrats. There's a lot of pressure on Democrats to finally speak about it, but it might be too little too late. And the fact that you have walkouts happening right now also means it's going to be harder for them to speak against some of these violent riots that are going on because their own base has some -- does not want them to speak against some of these protest movements."

It wasn't that he was Winston Churchill, because he wasn't, but it was a normal boring debate, you know, nothing amazing happened. And we're going to call for a drug test because there is no way.

Not because he was trying to court their vote, he was coming to say I care about you and I'm going to be a president that represents every American, and you deserve better because the Democratic Party has let you down. And you've seen that with his policies. He is the one who passed criminal justice reform. Joe Biden and Obama could have done it. They didn't. He's the one who's expanded economic opportunity zones and put that into the tax cuts and Jobs Act. He's the one who's given loan forgiveness for HBCUs, and he is the one that under his administration took black unemployment to the lowest level in history.

And then you've black women at 98 percent for Hillary Clinton in the last election. They seem to be gravitating more towards Joe Biden in this election as well. What are your numbers? Are you about 14 percent? Can you give us a sense of the internal polling? Where does that number lie right now, do you think?"

And the party, and the Trump campaign, we are opening offices in urban communities and we're reaching out to black voters. And we are saying it is time for the Republican Party to fight for your vote, we want you in our party, we want your voice heard in our party because the Democrat Party just takes you for granted. Look at what Daniel Cameron said last night. Joe Biden said if you don't vote for me, you are not black. Talk about something demeaning and dismissive. He says there's no diversity of thought in the African-American community. That is not how the Republican Party views black America, and that's why we've launched black voices for Trump and we are absolutely making up ground in these communities who are finally saying you know what, we've been with the Democrats long enough, maybe it's time to look at the Republican Party."

One area that is difficult for your party and for President Trump's election is suburban women. He's down about 13 percent in the polls right now with suburban women. We've obviously seen a big effort over the last few nights to try to speak to those women. Hillary Clinton, he ended up in about the same spot, so he really has not budged since 2016 with that group, Ronna."

Because they are saying why are Democrats standing back as stores are being burned to the ground, as people's livelihoods are being destroyed. It's one thing to have a peaceful protest, but it's transformed into this violence. And the Democrat Party is sitting on their hands silently.
