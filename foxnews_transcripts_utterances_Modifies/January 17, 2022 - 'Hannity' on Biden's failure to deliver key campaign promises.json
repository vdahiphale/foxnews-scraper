      "sentences": "Thank you, Sean. Welcome to this special edition of HANNITY. After historically bad week capping off a historically bad year, Joe Biden's presidency is now on the ropes. Things are going so poorly that even as one-time protectors, the media mob, they're now beginning to take note. Look at this headline from fake news CNN, you can't make it up. Quote: Is Biden's presidency doomed? Meanwhile, one article from \"Axios\" titled: Biden's epic failures. It details the litany of Biden-caused disasters both here at home and abroad. According to the article, quote: It's rare for a president to be at odds with Republicans, with moderate Democrats, and liberal Democrats all at the same time. But that's where Biden finds himself. In other words, nobody likes you Joe. Poor Joey, nobody. Nobody thinks he's competent either. Even MSDNC's top Democrat Chucky Todd blasting Biden for failing to change the tone in the country, bring people together after a speech last week. Former President Trump in Arizona, this is funny, he said that Biden was more destructive than five presidents combined. Now, a new CBS poll shows that 50 percent of Americans are frustrated with Biden's presidency, only 25 percent are satisfied. You know, it takes an awful lot of failure to get 75 percent of the country not loving what you're doing and fully 50 percent of the country frustrated at what you are doing. Look at this graph from Gallup. In just one year, Biden managed to flip America's party identification average -- look at this -- a nine-point Democratic advantage to a five-point GOP advantage, the best numbers for the Republican Party since 1995. Donald Trump runs again, just needs one bumper sticker, maybe a few rallies and all needs to say is, miss me yet? Anyway, and when they won in 1995, that was when the Republicans had been in exile out of power for years. Now, one reason for Joe's difficulties, he rarely works a full week, even a full day. It's clear he's not up to the job because of his cognitive decline that is getting worse. He is weak, he is frail. On most days, he doesn't even start work until around 10:00 a.m., typically calls a lid between 1:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon. He averages less than one public event a day. And, of course, you'll almost never see the leader of the free world working at the White House on a weekend. He's almost always in Delaware presumably taking lots of naps. In fact, during his first year, Biden spent more than a quarter of his time in Delaware. Now, during the week of Christmas, remember, when COVID-19 was surging to record highs, we didn't have tests available, therapeutics ran out, antivirals hadn't been manufactured, Joe was nowhere to be found. And today, while most Americans were celebrating the amazing life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Joe Biden, MIA again. He was once again enjoying a three- day weekend in Delaware and could not be bothered. They need to really rest him this week because we're going to get a presser out of him and he had fewer press conferences than the last six presidents, anyway, in his first year. We did however hear from Vice President Kamala Harris. She used today's holiday to trash Americans, calling them complicit, because the Democrats so-called voting rights bill is now pretty much DOA.

Hillary is so desperate to be relevant, kind of sad. Recently, Democratic strategist James Carville -- I actually know James, like James, have debated James, he's not a dumb guy.

There is no systemic racism in this country. Dr. King eliminated that with the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act. But the Democrats will keep reinventing the race card. You know what it is now? It's critical race theory.

It's about a woke agenda that doesn't sell. Getting rid of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and my judgment would be like giving whiskey and car keys to a teenage boy. Point two, the Biden administration has mismanaged COVID, it has mismanaged inflation, it has mismanaged the border, and it has mismanaged foreign policy, all in one year. If the aliens landed tomorrow and said, take me to your leader, it would be embarrassing. Now, President Biden is trying to change the subject by talking about race, and he is mismanaging that. America is not perfect. Americans know that, but they also know that that we are good. Black lives have mattered to most Americans for a long time. That's why we passed civil rights laws in 1866, 1871, 1875, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1990, 1991. That's why we elected an African-American president twice. That's why we have over ten thousand elected public officials in this country who happen to be black. And President Biden is wrong to say that tens of millions of Americans are racist because they don't support his woke agenda. The truth is most Americans don't think that much about race. They think about character. They understand that that souls have no color. Most Americans understand that to a bear, we all taste like chicken. And I'm very proud of the racial progress that we've made in America, and President Biden should be too. And I feel very strongly about this issue. If you'd like to go to my website, JohnKennedy.com, John Kennedy.com.

Here with reaction, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, along with Florida Congressman Byron Donalds is with us. Byron, you know, Kamala Harris -- she praised the LAPD when they started cutting and defunding that department. They cut a billion dollars from the police in New York City. How's this defund, dismantle and no bail law madness working out for the country?",

Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work without having to look over their shoulder. You can't have a thriving economy, you can't have a thriving society if you're not keeping people safe.

We respect law enforcement. We want to see them on the streets to keep us safe. And that's not what's happening in these liberal cities, at least in New York. Now, you have a mayor, he's saying that he is pro-law enforcement still, and that he's going to add men and women of law enforcement to help protect, New Yorkers, but you know, he says it's perception. It is perception because you need to put many, many more men and women of law enforcement in the subways, on the streets in New York, to do everything he can.

      "speaker": "Look at this headline from fake news CNN, you can't make it up. Quote",
      "utterance": "Is Biden's presidency doomed? Meanwhile, one article from \"Axios\" titled: Biden's epic failures. It details the litany of Biden-caused disasters both here at home and abroad. According to the article, quote: It's rare for a president to be at odds with Republicans, with moderate Democrats, and liberal Democrats all at the same time. But that's where Biden finds himself. In other words, nobody likes you Joe. Poor Joey, nobody. Nobody thinks he's competent either. Even MSDNC's top Democrat Chucky Todd blasting Biden for failing to change the tone in the country, bring people together after a speech last week. Former President Trump in Arizona, this is funny, he said that Biden was more destructive than five presidents combined. Now, a new CBS poll shows that 50 percent of Americans are frustrated with Biden's presidency, only 25 percent are satisfied. You know, it takes an awful lot of failure to get 75 percent of the country not loving what you're doing and fully 50 percent of the country frustrated at what you are doing. Look at this graph from Gallup. In just one year, Biden managed to flip America's party identification average -- look at this -- a nine-point Democratic advantage to a five-point GOP advantage, the best numbers for the Republican Party since 1995. Donald Trump runs again, just needs one bumper sticker, maybe a few rallies and all needs to say is, miss me yet? Anyway, and when they won in 1995, that was when the Republicans had been in exile out of power for years. Now, one reason for Joe's difficulties, he rarely works a full week, even a full day. It's clear he's not up to the job because of his cognitive decline that is getting worse. He is weak, he is frail. On most days, he doesn't even start work until around 10:00 a.m., typically calls a lid between 1:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon. He averages less than one public event a day. And, of course, you'll almost never see the leader of the free world working at the White House on a weekend. He's almost always in Delaware presumably taking lots of naps. In fact, during his first year, Biden spent more than a quarter of his time in Delaware. Now, during the week of Christmas, remember, when COVID-19 was surging to record highs, we didn't have tests available, therapeutics ran out, antivirals hadn't been manufactured, Joe was nowhere to be found. And today, while most Americans were celebrating the amazing life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Joe Biden, MIA again. He was once again enjoying a three- day weekend in Delaware and could not be bothered. They need to really rest him this week because we're going to get a presser out of him and he had fewer press conferences than the last six presidents, anyway, in his first year. We did however hear from Vice President Kamala Harris. She used today's holiday to trash Americans, calling them complicit, because the Democrats so-called voting rights bill is now pretty much DOA. Take a look."

Of course, Kamala Harris isn't the only Democrat to shamefully exploit race to push a political agenda. It's used every election. It used every two years, every four years, every election cycle, Democrats accuse their political enemies, same playbook. They're racist. They're sexist. They're homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, now transphobic. They want dirty air, water, and they want to take us back to the days of Jim Crow.

There is no systemic racism in this country. Dr. King eliminated that with the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act. But the Democrats will keep reinventing the race card. You know what it is now? It's critical race theory. But if you look at the polls, it's not just Joe Biden is shrinking in the polls, he's losing black support and Hispanic support, because people of color, all colors, they have woke. They're awake.

We spend more per capita on education per student with the worst results.

Here with more is the great senator from the great state of Louisiana, John Kennedy is with us. Senator, so we got a president right now -- Joe Biden's approval index is minus 31, with Rasmussen. Donald Trump's worst with minus 26. Quinnipiac has him at 33 percent. You see the vaccine mandate, Supreme Court didn't go along with it. We're watching disaster at our borders. We're watching a 40-year high in inflation, the worst economic conditions. A dollar is worth seven cents, fully less than it was, maybe 10 cents less than just a year ago. Energy prices are up a buck 50 a gallon. We'll spend another thousand dollars to heat our homes this winter.

      "utterance": "Well, two points, Sean. Number one, the Biden administration's effort to get rid of the 60-vote threshold in the United States Senate is not about a Senate that doesn't work. It's about a woke agenda that doesn't sell. Getting rid of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and my judgment would be like giving whiskey and car keys to a teenage boy. Point two, the Biden administration has mismanaged COVID, it has mismanaged inflation, it has mismanaged the border, and it has mismanaged foreign policy, all in one year. If the aliens landed tomorrow and said, take me to your leader, it would be embarrassing. Now, President Biden is trying to change the subject by talking about race, and he is mismanaging that. America is not perfect. Americans know that, but they also know that that we are good. Black lives have mattered to most Americans for a long time. That's why we passed civil rights laws in 1866, 1871, 1875, 1960, 1964, 1968, 1990, 1991. That's why we elected an African-American president twice. That's why we have over ten thousand elected public officials in this country who happen to be black. And President Biden is wrong to say that tens of millions of Americans are racist because they don't support his woke agenda. The truth is most Americans don't think that much about race. They think about character. They understand that that souls have no color. Most Americans understand that to a bear, we all taste like chicken. And I'm very proud of the racial progress that we've made in America, and President Biden should be too. And I feel very strongly about this issue. If you'd like to go to my website, JohnKennedy.com, John Kennedy.com. I've got an article on there that I think is very interesting, and while you're there, if you want to help me with my reelection, I'm up in nine months. I'd appreciate it if you care to."

Well, federal law enforcement officials and border patrol agents who are working that side of the border say it's because their hands are tied behind their backs, and the drug cartels and the human traffickers realize and know that the Biden administration is going to do very little to stop them. I want you to take a listen to Chris Cabrera. He's with the National Border Patrol Council in the Rio Grande Valley where this incident took place after New Year's. Take a listen."

I think it's a big target but not that big especially from that distance, so a fairly accurate shooting and they're very lucky -- our agents are very lucky that they came out of that unscathed. But it is -- it is coming to a point where, you know, somebody's going to get hurt and I think what people are starting to see on the Mexican side is the federal government is not really serious about protecting this border and they know that that we lack teeth.

The suspect was killed after an 11-hour standoff. The survivors are recounting the harrowing moments, including a rabbi that threw a chair at the gunman to help bring everyone to safety. But the FBI's conduct prompted scorn from the Jewish community, I would argue rightly so. One Jewish leader telling FOX News, quote, trying to separate Jews from the idea that Jews were targeted on their holy day at their house of worship is a mistake, and it's insulting and disappointing. Here with reaction, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, along with human rights lawyer Brooke Goldstein. Brooke, I'll start with you. I know you know a lot about this. Preet Bharara is a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, probably one of the most prestigious in the country. And he prosecuted this woman Siddiqui, which is the motivation behind this Texas synagogue hostage taker, and was quoted to say, you know -- that she was quoted as saying, I want to kill as many F-ing Americans as I can, and other anti-Semitic things and had been radicalized after 9/11. So, how do you possibly make that statement with the FBI knowing the facts are on the record? This person got 86 years in jail."

I first want to say that the Jewish community is incredibly grateful to the FBI and to the Texas SWAT team for ending this hostage situation without any innocents dead. But I will say that I'm equally troubled by the cover- up that is happening right now as to the truth of the matter, because the truth is an inconvenient one, and that is that the Jewish community is a minority community that has been targeted with violence and that Jew hatred is systemic and on the rise and that Islamist terrorism, not Islamophobia, but Islamist terrorism remains a very real threat to the national security of this country. And the reason why the FBI and the mainstream media now that is taking advantage of this very poorly worded statement is engaging in these, you know, mental acrobatics to deny the truth is because we have been victimized by a coordinated bullying campaign by hate groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations that you know well, to slander anyone as Islamophobic and to bully them into being silent about the threat of Islamist terrorism and the Jew hatred that really is inseparable with that threat."

I'm looking at the comments of the -- of the lead prosecutor in this case, in the southern district of New York. Again, this guy was motivated by this very virulent anti-Semitic woman, who made anti-Semitic comments even during the trial and at other times, and I'm just trying to understand why they would rush out there and say something that they on the surface would know likely is not true.. I do applaud them for what they did. It takes great courage to put your life on the line the way these FBI agents did, but I'm not talking about the agents that went into the synagogue to save lives and the other law enforcement, talking about specifically the comments that are made afterwards when all common sense is pointing at the fact that that this guy was motivated by virulent anti-Semitism."

And, Sean, I've got a question maybe I'd love to ask the FBI -- how are we going to expect to keep America hating anti-Semitic terrorists out of our synagogues when we can't even keep him out of Congress? And a lot of this behavior is justified by people who sit in Congress today and that is a tragedy."

Brooke, you mentioned something that is now true and well-documented and that is the rise of anti-Semitism around the world. To me, it's getting chilling and frightening and I'm especially concerned about the Biden administration, you know, taking its foot off the gas when it comes to pressuring Iran and easing sanctions on Iran. I don't know -- I -- if you marry radical Islam with weapons of mass destruction, I don't like the outcome or the potential outcome."

And when you have groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations who on the one hand are lobbying for the release of Lady al-Qaeda and also at the same time telling their Muslim communities that Zionists are the enemy and synagogues are the enemy, they are parroting that radical language coming out of Pakistan, they're parroting the radical language coming out of Iran, and we're facing a very real problem that we need to be able to talk about freely and openly without being slandered."

That's what worries me, is that we have people who aid and abet this attitude and behavior, and we need to be rec - - just very, very clear that there are people who hate the Jewish people. And this is wrong and it's dangerous and we need to stand with Jewish people across the world especially here in our own United States.

Dr. Fauci and his spouse made almost $2 million during 2020. So, during 2020, you recall, if you were a bartender or a barber, you couldn't make a living. But Dr. Fauci managed to squeak together almost $2 million, and as you know, and you alluded to earlier in your show, a significant amount of these investments are investments in China and Hong Kong.

Dr. Fauci is the cash cow and the head cheerleader for viral gain of function, going back to at least 2014 when President Obama's administration put a moratorium on it. Dr. Fauci continued to fund viral gain of function in North Carolina with Dr. Shi (ph) to build a protein spike that took a SARS virus and allowed it to stick to human lung cells like glue. And then in '18 and '19, 2018 and '19, continued to fund the Wuhan lab via the Eco Health System to develop the furin cleavage site which allows that virus to dump its guts into the cell.

Sadly, it is only the latest tragedy in a city that refuses to take the issue of violent crime seriously. It's happening coast to coast. Democratic-run cities, they are almost all becoming less safe, less secure, more dangerous, no law, no order. In New York, a 40-year-old woman Saturday pushed to her death in front of a subway train at the time square station. This is happening more and more as well. The suspect, a 61-year-old homeless man, has been charged with murder, has a long criminal history, including a robbery conviction. Ask yourself, why are violent criminals being coddled in almost all are blue major cities? How many more of these stories do we have to cover before Democrats start taking the issue seriously? By the way, in case you're keeping count, 29 people were shot in Chicago this weekend. Here with reaction, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, along with Florida Congressman Byron Donalds is with us. Byron, you know, Kamala Harris -- she praised the LAPD when they started cutting and defunding that department. They cut a billion dollars from the police in New York City.

Kids can't go to school, people can't go to work without having to look over their shoulder. You can't have a thriving economy, you can't have a thriving society if you're not keeping people safe. The Democrats are wrong on this. They've been wrong on this.

Oregon, the ones in California, New York. It's not happening in the state where Byron and I live, is it? Florida is a safe state because we respect our men and women in blue. We respect law enforcement. We want to see them on the streets to keep us safe. And that's not what's happening in these liberal cities, at least in New York. Now, you have a mayor, he's saying that he is pro-law enforcement still, and that he's going to add men and women of law enforcement to help protect, New Yorkers, but you know, he says it's perception. It is perception because you need to put many, many more men and women of law enforcement in the subways, on the streets in New York, to do everything he can. And I think the problem he's going to have is Alvin Bragg, that district attorney in New York who's Soros-funded liberal woke district attorney who's letting people out of jail left and right not protecting New Yorkers."
