Good evening everybody, I'm Ed Henry in for Martha McCallum. In a Thanksgiving surprise, Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch have both been subpoenaed to testify behind closed doors next month to answer questions about the FBI and DOJ handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. The behind closed doors part is what Comey is taking issue with. He tweeted in part \"I will resist a closed door thing because I've seen enough of their selective leaking and distortion. Let's have a hearing and invite everyone to see.\"  That response triggering a bit of outrage among Comey critics quick to remind the former FBI chief of this moment last year when he himself admitted under oath to yes selective leaking.",

That's also a big worry of the Inspector General as it turns out which launched a review and why Comey's memos with classified materials about meetings with President Trump wound up leaked to a media outlet. But Comey's lawyer still says a closed hearing is a no-go explaining that while the authority for congressional subpoenas is broad. It does not cover the right to misuse closed hearings as a political stunt, to promote political as opposed to legislative agendas.  Mr. Comey embraces and welcomes a hearing open to the public but the subpoena issued yesterday represents an abuse of process, a divergence from House Rules, and it's presumption of transparency. Accordingly, mr. Comey will resist in court this abuse of process. Now, Democrats in Congress are sympathizing with Comey's concerns.",

And then as more and more things come out, yes, it did show that his record was not what he claims it was and he's not really been held accountable.  Now, here he is the former FBI director who conducted so many interrogations in private and then you would find things being selectively leaked out including excerpts from your Russell reports and everything else, and now he wants to be all out in public.

Good evening everybody, I'm Ed Henry in for Martha McCallum. In a Thanksgiving surprise, Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch have both been subpoenaed to testify behind closed doors next month to answer questions about the FBI and DOJ handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe. The behind closed doors part is what Comey is taking issue with. He tweeted in part \"I will resist a closed door thing because I've seen enough of their selective leaking and distortion. Let's have a hearing and invite everyone to see.\" That response triggering a bit of outrage among Comey critics quick to remind the former FBI chief of this moment last year when he himself admitted under oath to yes selective leaking."

That's also a big worry of the Inspector General as it turns out which launched a review and why Comey's memos with classified materials about meetings with President Trump wound up leaked to a media outlet. But Comey's lawyer still says a closed hearing is a no-go explaining that while the authority for congressional subpoenas is broad. It does not cover the right to misuse closed hearings as a political stunt, to promote political as opposed to legislative agendas. Mr. Comey embraces and welcomes a hearing open to the public but the subpoena issued yesterday represents an abuse of process, a divergence from House Rules, and it's presumption of transparency. Accordingly, mr. Comey will resist in court this abuse of process. Now, Democrats in Congress are sympathizing with Comey's concerns."

Donald Trump should also ask DOJ, FBI why they still protect Clinton, Comey, etcetera.

      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "As far as I'm concerned, any hold is none. And I was never one of those people who was opposed to Jim Comey when he was FBI director but I really been disappointed in what he's done since he's left and also looking back on what he did when he was with the FBI. For instance, he used to test -- I'm on the Intelligence Committee and he'll be telling us one thing behind the scenes at these closed hearings and then given a totally different impression when he was out in public. For instance, he would say good things about General Flynn and then he makes a big thing later on about how President Trump was trying to help General Flynn. He told us in executive sessions that the FBI thought the General Flynn had not lied. He never said that in public."

And then when we get him in public hearings, I don't know how many questions he would say well I can't answer that, we have to go into a private session or executive session. And then he brags about the fact how clever he was in leaking out the really important material."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Right. So let me take another tact in which is that I checked the record and back in April you said in another interview that James Comey's actions were all blowing up in his face. You were probably right at the time, I'm not questioning the accuracy of it, but I'm wondering here we are months later. It doesn't seem like he's been held accountable, Congressman, and doesn't that frustrate people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "It's to me very frustrating. He had his big book tour, he was hailed as a hero, and then he got caught. It was actually Brett Baer that caught -- you know, caught him on the fact that he had said privately that General Flynn had not lied. Then when he was confronted with it, he didn't recall saying that. And then as more and more things come out, yes, it did show that his record was not what he claims it was and he's not really been held accountable. Now, here he is the former FBI director who conducted so many interrogations in private and then you would find things being selectively leaked out including excerpts from your Russell reports and everything else, and now he wants to be all out in public. Again, this to me is really -- it is hypocritical, it's a double standard that he's applying to himself. And really the media shouldn't let him get away with it, even I'm not having too much help from the mainstream media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Sure. Congressman, let me ask you about another key player in this, Loretta Lynch. As Peter Doocy reported, there also -- your fellow Republicans are trying to bring her in for testimony. In addition to the Bill Clinton tarmac meeting and wanting to get more information about that which is a critical piece here, James Comey in his book teased out that there were some sort of a reason, that he didn't really tell the public that she was Lynch tortured in a response to the Clinton probe, that maybe there was some reason why she was conflicted. What do we know about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "You know, I don't we caught all the details. Other than the fact, I think Comey was taken in by that. I think that was a story being put out by the Russians and he believed it, that there was something that was going to be a scandal about Loretta Lynch and he wanted to go forward on his own because he thought this would tarnish the investigation. I think I was literally fake news or phony news that he was taking from its source that he turned out to be wrong. I mean, he's relying on wrong information and then he was taken in by it."

The public also wants to know tonight, are you going to get some of these FISA documents about the surveillance of Carter Page for example. Is the President going to declassify that or are Republicans in their final days going to push to get more information out about what went on the Obama days?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "We should. And I certainly don't know why the President does not declassify them. To me it would show that this investigation, this whole FBI investigation of Russia followed by the special prosecutor had no basis. There was no reason for it, there was no legal justification for it. And if they were basing at all on that Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, it shows this investigation never should've been started in the first place. It was an investigation in search of a crime not to solve a crime but to try to find one. And so far they haven't find anything involving Russia and collusion after all this time, two years."

      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "The bottom line is if we deny this open hearing and don't couple it with this private hearing, what we will allow is Comey to hide behind potentially issues of perjury, right, because the Department of Justice right now is investigating him for leaking. And if we don't hold him to an account, then I think what you're going to see is basically an arsonist who started a forest fire and he's going to be complaining about it the whole time when we can't hold his feet to the very fire that he started."

Now, you have Republicans who are not happy with the way he handled the Trump investigation and as you say what about the rest of the FBI been waiting for the Trump Justice Department to get to the bottom of that not just Comey and is leaking, Andrew McCabe who lost his job, Strzok and Page, the FBI agents who were texting back and forth, their hatred of Donald Trump, why don't we still have those answers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Well, I cannot tell you. If this goes beyond I think what a lot of us in the Democratic Party are saying publicly, and I think it privately, folks that I've talked to on Capitol Hill said look we're hitching our wagons to a bureau that very clearly through the I.G. report has shown they're up to some dirty bad things, very questionable things, that if were to happen to us, we'd be raising you know, holy hell. So I think privately Democrats are saying FBI needs to be held to account here and they have been so far and that's wrong, irrespective of a party that is wrong."

Another thing he says he wants to investigate is the U.S. Intel Assessment of Jamal Khashoggi. As you know, the President has come under criticism for not seeming to accept the CIA's analysis. You're a former CIA official as I -- as I noted, where do you think all that stands to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Look, everybody wants to think the intelligence community can come up with 100 percent truth or 100 percent certainty with their assessments and that's just not how it works. We give assessments that were high or medium or low degrees of confidence based on our understanding of our sources and different kinds of sources we get. But the bottom line this is going to be a political decision. Do we want to make our bed with some folks or questionable character for broader strategic interest? Every president has done it, Democrat or Republican alike. So are we going to give Trump of the leash to do the same and that's what this really boils down to."

The back and forth between the President and the Chief Justice actually stems back to the President's comments about Judge Jon Tigar's nationwide injunction to effectively stop the President's new policies on asylum along the U.S. border. It's a hot topic and to say the least we have seen this before, a lower-level federal judge and an Obama appointee for that matter making a ruling to effectively thwart the Trump administration forcing it now to go through the courts before the policy can take effect. The President calling the judge and Obama judge which the Chief Justice rejected saying we do not have Obama judges, or Trump judges, Bush judges, or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appear to for them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for. But let's be frank given the Ninth Circuit's well-earned reputation for being progressive and frequently ruling against the president. Well Mr. Trump said it's high time someone called them out for their judicial activism."

I spoke over the weekend with Andrew McCarthy we're going to get to in a moment whether it's wise for the president to continue attacking various federal judges. It's not the first time he's done that. But let's start with Andrew McCarthy over the weekend was telling me look, Chief Justice Roberts should know there are in fact Obama judges. They are trying to undermine the President's agenda, and politics has been played for a long time here and maybe this is one that the Chief Justice should have set out."

Presidents have criticized the Supreme Court since really the earliest days of the Republic. But having said that, I am sympathetic with the Chief Justice's decision. You know, he has remained silent for a couple of years. The President has been unrelenting and what I think are unfair attacks on many judges. And I think he felt that as the head of the judiciary, he had to say something. You know, where I -- where I have a slight problem as I say in the column tomorrow on the Hill is really the balance for Chief Justice Roberts in making these comments. There have been long al controversies on the court with his own members engaging in political commentary, even going to political fundraisers and he has never given nary an objection."

July 2016, the heat of a campaign, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says this about candidate Trump. He is a fake, he has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? And I wonder professor, where was the chief justice to adjudicate that and to say wait a second that's not fair?"

He should never have made those objections public. That violated a long history of the court remaining neutral. But the point is still a good one. You know, judge -- many of us have criticized Justice Ginsburg for her many political statements and she has apologized on occasion but continues to make them. It is really the domain of the Chief Justice to make it clear that this conduct is not appropriate for members of the court and he should start there, I think, when he wants to fight the politicalization of the courts."

I think it is fair to say Europe has done its part and must send a very clear message, we are not going to be able to continue providing refuge and support because we don't deal with the migration issue it will continue to roil the body politic.\" Her comments drawing criticism from some fellow Democrats tonight and a lengthy walk back it seemed like from Mrs. Clinton who later tweeted in part \"I have always been and remained a staunch advocate of comprehensive immigration reform. So could her clarification be yet another signal of a possible 2020 bid?

Clinton warns Europe of migration peril and I thought hasn't President Trump been warning Europe, been warning the United States, warning the entire world for the last two years about this peril. Is she seeing the like? Well, look I think as you just said, Hillary Clinton has been very clear throughout the entire course of her career that what she favors and is advocating for is comprehensive immigration reform. And with respect to Europe, I mean. you know, immigration is a challenge that both the Europeans and Americans have to solve together. But here in America, you know, there's one party that is working for immigration reform that is humane, that does not separate families, and there's another party that wants to divide us.

So, it was a long journey and kids worked this all aspects of the business. Then I had my own little business ventures selling gum and candy.

That was one of the things that attracted me at first to Trump was that he had been in business until -- when the country is going good economically, there is opportunities for business and so that's better for entrepreneurs everywhere. There's more chances to make money and, you know, it's a great country still for people who want to start businesses and in some ways a lot easier now than back in the beginning of the country where financially the country wasn't as stable, and so and we chronicle those. In fact, a lot of entrepreneurs had to help in and bail the government out and loan them money. And so, but, yes, I think the state of America is good.

And now at Cornell University they are going to have this historical exhibit that among other things is going to showcase Ocasio-Cortez's shoes. You see them there."

      "speaker": "CAMPOS-DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Well, and she did. And she frankly has the shoes to prove it. I'll tell you what, my husband has shoes very similar to that. He is a member of Congress who has run. He also gets calluses on his hands from shaking so many hands during campaign season. So, those are true stories. She is the youngest member of Congress. She has as I said the proof from these shoes. I think it's interesting that they are putting them in. She deserves to be in the museum for that in particular. And I applaud her for that. I disagree with everything she is trying to do to our country. And economically, but, for the shoes, she deserves it."

I think if we are talking about what this museum is for which is women at the front lines, you cannot take that away from her whatever your political ideology is, she works for it."

So, these shoes, yes, they are symbolic and they mean a lot. But, you know, in finance, there is a term that says when you own the ups, you also own the downs, right? And so, there has been so much criticism on her what she is wearing whether it's on her feet or on her body."
