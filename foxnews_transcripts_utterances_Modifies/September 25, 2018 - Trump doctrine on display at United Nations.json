What was interesting to me is normally when Donald Trump is in New York City, he's on his home turf. But when he's speaking at the U.N., he's at an away game. And what I mean by that is there are so many people there sitting around the table. He knows that a lot of them have disdain for him, but those same people rely on his security umbrella. And I think we continue to see a president who is very forthright. There is no dancing around what he sees or what he feels. A lot of people were critical of him for calling Germany, for calling out China. I think it is to be expected. His supporters would have been disappointed if he wasn't so forthright.   What remains to be seen for me, the big question is on Iran, because we saw many European nations, Russia, China come together Monday night to discuss potentially a special purpose vehicle in order to evade U.S. sanctions potentially. I think that is very big news. I don't think that European banks who operate in America are going to go along with it.

In that respect, I didn't see a whole lot new there. I think along with Morgan, I was struck by the overt mention of patriotism and sovereignty, which is not exactly what a group like the United Nations loves to hear. But he was determined to get that across as if there were any question about his philosophy and America first and so on.  And with respect to Iran, I think it is true that there is sort of a moment coming up here between the United States, Europe, and Iran where the Iranians are clearly being restrained in terms of breaking out on the nuclear deal to see if they can somehow work around the U.S. sanctions and perhaps just simply wait out Donald Trump's first term.",

So there will be a divorce point I think at some level between Moon and Trump on North Korea because at the present track, the indicators, where it matters in terms of the warhead vehicle, in terms of what is going on behind the scenes, yes, not in terms of the missile flights through the atmosphere or into orbit, but in those hidden factories and those hidden research centers, that is a problem that President Trump, Mike Pompeo need to address, and at some point there will be a crunch between these two sides.",

Listen, this is all, I think, an exercise to get this peace, end the way, a peace agreement. Moon really needs that. His approval rating has gone done by at least 33 percent in South Korea. I think that he would also like to see the sanctions lifted. He wants to do more business with North Korea. He wants that land bridge to China.
