And Federal investigators are on the scene right now trying to figure out what caused the crash. President Trump is delaying immigration raids for two weeks. That's after a telephone call from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting that delay. On Sunday, I.C.E. agents we're going to start to arrest and deport immigrant families in 10 cities.
