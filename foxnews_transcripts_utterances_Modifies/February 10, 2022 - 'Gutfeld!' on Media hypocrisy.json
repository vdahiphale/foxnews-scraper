      "sentences": "Hmm. It's official, you can now add these goobers to the list of other invertebrates like jelly fish, slugs, snails and tapeworms. Because since things have changed and the Dems are doing what Youngkin already did, the mockery stops. Now to be fair, you say they follow the science but why be fair when they really followed the political silent -- science? Just days ago when Youngkin suffered a legal setback over ending masked mandates. Dems were dunking on him like Brian Stelter on a crawler. But now they're voting on legislation that copies him. They're like the dumb kids copying the answers of the smart kid's tests. So you think in the media's coverage, they'd credit Youngkin for being bravely ahead of the game. But you got a better chance of Pelosi admitting or faces 85 percent modeling clay because admitting they're hypocrites isn't in their DNA. I doubt they even know what that word means. Now, while it's great to change your mind based on data, you think they would think ahead about that possibility before mocking the dude who made that right call first. But no, they're obviously two faced fair-weather liars jumping on the bandwagon. This is not amnesia. It's arrogance for they believe they can get away with it. I'd call them flip phonies. Pretty clever A. I came up with it this morning, after putting mescaline in my Count Chocula. In one instant, they'll defend actual rioters, then the next brand peaceful protesters as insurrectionists. That claim that Canadian truckers are violent radicals without evidence, but then ignore the Antifa militant who plowed his Jeep patriot of all things into the convoy protests. And another they'll defend -- defund the police then claimed they never did. And when homeless men start beating women with baseball bats in the unpolished streets of Seattle, they hide their anti-cop bias, like it's an ugly baby. They questioned the validity of an election in 2016 and then call anyone else to trade or if they do the same thing four years later. So rather than analyze their own rush to judgment, they just run away from the crime scene like smash and grabbers from Kay Jewelers. Maybe it's how they're able to sleep at night. Well, that and hanging upside down. But it all stems from one insecurity. They can't admit they're wrong. It's quite the contrast when you see the podcast world exploding or successes like this little weird show that comes on at 11:00 p.m. What do they all have in common? Other than most of us can't pass a drug test, we all admit that we're wrong. I tried to do it a few times a week, though, it's hard when you're almost always right. But every now and then I have to take off my cape. Back in 2016 I was wrong on Trump and initially I was wrong on Covington. I was wrong to take hair advice from Kilmeade. And it was wrong taking the under on how long Jesse Schell would last. Finally, I was wrong on Canada. Turns out they do have indoor plumbing. Anyway, being able to admit you're wrong. It's like having opposable thumbs or no tail. It's a sign you've evolved. But being resistant to it means you're just like the dying legacy media, which can never admit they're wrong at all, because maybe they're wrong so much. They do four hours of news than have to do four hours of undoing their news. But maybe they're coming around under Jill Biden's White House, or whoever is responsible for changing Joe's batteries and then steering him towards the podium. The Department of Homeland Security just issued a heightened terrorism alert due -- to get, this the proliferation of false or misleading narratives which sow discord, or undermine public trust and U.S. government institutions. They also cite conspiracy theories introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threats. This advisory, much like Kat;s house arrest remains in effect until June 7th. But this morning's big news. The DHS finally got around to watching CNN and MSNBC because it's the legacy media churning out the false and misleading narratives that sow discord. They peddle the Russian collusion hoax, they - - which undermined our elections. They lied about Kyle Rittenhouse and then a terrorist who ran over six people at a Christmas parade. They portrayed all police's violent rogues causing a Ferguson Effect that led to the crime wave. And they denied the lab leak. They embraced every hate crime hoax they could find. They push to funding the police had no cash bail. They even called parents terrorists. Oh wait, that one was the government. It's going to be funny when they have to kick down their own doors at dawn and arrest themselves. Maybe they should put up that fence around the Capitol again and just put a padlock on it. Anyway, it's good to see the President and his administration coming around just seeing the destructive nature of a vindictive media. I bet it sure going to be hard to slap the cuffs on your best friends. But I could be wrong. I probably am. It's not hard, but at least I'll admit it.",

And they have their group think collectively that they have to do. And if I can just make one quick point too about the mask wearing and now everyone points to like a higher authority that is infallible. So everyone points to the CDC, right? That you have to wear masks, you have to mask your kids. Virginia passes a state law that says, we will rely on the CDC guidance for everything that we have through the school board. And this is why we're arresting people right and left for breaking laws basically. Right? But that same CDC says that 51 percent of kids, there's been a 51 percent increase in suicides. That same CDC says that these kids are declining in mental health and in peer groups social -- social status and sociality by double digits right now, they are saying that our kids are dying on the inside. So, if they're perfectly infallible on this, and that's what we rely on in laws, says mainstream media, says state law then why can't the other things they say be correct also? It's only with COVID, it's only in the certain instances that these authorities are correct.",

Gawker echoes the progressive left's attacks on Sinema for her refusal to support Biden's Build Back Better Bill -- and Gawker is telling the world they have a private data, which is obvious payback, perhaps a threat, and then they're washing their grubby little hands by acting like this info won't be used to harass her by people even grosser than them. Yes, if you thought following her into the bathroom was bad. Gawker said, hold my pee. How they score this amazing journalistic coup, turns out these bottom-feeders simply filed a public records request for Sinema's divorce papers. The records came back unredacted full of private info like her driver's license number and bank account info. Just like the intel I bought from Kat's college boyfriend. Best eight bucks I ever spent. Well, with government fraud protection so lacks, it's no wonder people don't trust elections. The Scuzz Lords at Gawker say this kind of doxxing is a good thing for freedom of the press and transparency of our elected officials. But the only thing that's transparent is the left's need to bully a woman who's standing up for herself. But that's really the case, Gawker, now go get Nancy Pelosi stock records and verify if her birth year is 1940 A.D.

But that's compared to just 56 percent of the time the man asked for the date. Well, one thing is for sure humans are sluts. Repent. Researchers asked more than 20,000 students detailed questions about their dates, like who initiated, who paid, and what kind of sexual activity happened later? They then asked the students what they were wearing and started breathing heavily. Turns out, just 36 percent of college dates followed a traditional script, like the one where my wife's a welder, and I'm selling girl scout cookies. And women just initiated one out of every 10 hookups, that's 10 percent. Talk about inequality. I feel like marching. But the most important takeaway is obviously that asking thousands of college students detailed questions about their sex lives actually counts as research now. If that had been the case in the 80s, my Uncle Steve wouldn't still be in prison. Granted, his subjects were tied up at the time, but it was all in the name of research. Kat, thoughts on this?",

Because since things have changed and the Dems are doing what Youngkin already did, the mockery stops. Now to be fair, you say they follow the science but why be fair when they really followed the political silent -- science? Just days ago when Youngkin suffered a legal setback over ending masked mandates. Dems were dunking on him like Brian Stelter on a crawler. But now they're voting on legislation that copies him. They're like the dumb kids copying the answers of the smart kid's tests. So you think in the media's coverage, they'd credit Youngkin for being bravely ahead of the game. But you got a better chance of Pelosi admitting or faces 85 percent modeling clay because admitting they're hypocrites isn't in their DNA. I doubt they even know what that word means. Now, while it's great to change your mind based on data, you think they would think ahead about that possibility before mocking the dude who made that right call first. But no, they're obviously two faced fair-weather liars jumping on the bandwagon. This is not amnesia. It's arrogance for they believe they can get away with it. I'd call them flip phonies. Pretty clever A. I came up with it this morning, after putting mescaline in my Count Chocula. In one instant, they'll defend actual rioters, then the next brand peaceful protesters as insurrectionists. That claim that Canadian truckers are violent radicals without evidence, but then ignore the Antifa militant who plowed his Jeep patriot of all things into the convoy protests. And another they'll defend -- defund the police then claimed they never did. And when homeless men start beating women with baseball bats in the unpolished streets of Seattle, they hide their anti-cop bias, like it's an ugly baby. They questioned the validity of an election in 2016 and then call anyone else to trade or if they do the same thing four years later. So rather than analyze their own rush to judgment, they just run away from the crime scene like smash and grabbers from Kay Jewelers. Maybe it's how they're able to sleep at night. Well, that and hanging upside down. But it all stems from one insecurity. They can't admit they're wrong. It's quite the contrast when you see the podcast world exploding or successes like this little weird show that comes on at 11:00 p.m. What do they all have in common? Other than most of us can't pass a drug test, we all admit that we're wrong. I tried to do it a few times a week, though, it's hard when you're almost always right. But every now and then I have to take off my cape. Back in 2016 I was wrong on Trump and initially I was wrong on Covington. I was wrong to take hair advice from Kilmeade. And it was wrong taking the under on how long Jesse Schell would last. Finally, I was wrong on Canada. Turns out they do have indoor plumbing. Anyway, being able to admit you're wrong. It's like having opposable thumbs or no tail. It's a sign you've evolved. But being resistant to it means you're just like the dying legacy media, which can never admit they're wrong at all, because maybe they're wrong so much. They do four hours of news than have to do four hours of undoing their news. But maybe they're coming around under Jill Biden's White House, or whoever is responsible for changing Joe's batteries and then steering him towards the podium. The Department of Homeland Security just issued a heightened terrorism alert due -- to get, this the proliferation of false or misleading narratives which sow discord, or undermine public trust and U.S. government institutions. They also cite conspiracy theories introduced and/or amplified by foreign and domestic threats. This advisory, much like Kat;s house arrest remains in effect until June 7th. But this morning's big news. The DHS finally got around to watching CNN and MSNBC because it's the legacy media churning out the false and misleading narratives that sow discord. They peddle the Russian collusion hoax, they - - which undermined our elections. They lied about Kyle Rittenhouse and then a terrorist who ran over six people at a Christmas parade. They portrayed all police's violent rogues causing a Ferguson Effect that led to the crime wave. And they denied the lab leak. They embraced every hate crime hoax they could find. They push to funding the police had no cash bail. They even called parents terrorists. Oh wait, that one was the government. It's going to be funny when they have to kick down their own doors at dawn and arrest themselves. Maybe they should put up that fence around the Capitol again and just put a padlock on it. Anyway, it's good to see the President and his administration coming around just seeing the destructive nature of a vindictive media. I bet it sure going to be hard to slap the cuffs on your best friends. But I could be wrong. I probably am. It's not hard, but at least I'll admit it."

I think what I see is different here than those -- the mainstream media is in part that -- I mean, were thoughtful, there's not groupthink."

You know what, I changed my mind. That's OK, too. No one in the mainstream media is doing so because they're saying their talking points. And they have their group think collectively that they have to do. And if I can just make one quick point too about the mask wearing and now everyone points to like a higher authority that is infallible. So everyone points to the CDC, right? That you have to wear masks, you have to mask your kids. Virginia passes a state law that says, we will rely on the CDC guidance for everything that we have through the school board. And this is why we're arresting people right and left for breaking laws basically. Right? But that same CDC says that 51 percent of kids, there's been a 51 percent increase in suicides. That same CDC says that these kids are declining in mental health and in peer groups social -- social status and sociality by double digits right now, they are saying that our kids are dying on the inside. So, if they're perfectly infallible on this, and that's what we rely on in laws, says mainstream media, says state law then why can't the other things they say be correct also? It's only with COVID, it's only in the certain instances that these authorities are correct."

Following Jeff Zucker CNN exit disgraced anchor Chris tends to demand as much as a $60 million settlement. Almost a million bucks for each one of his viewers. But it's a bargain for helping to destroy CNN's credibility. That number is according to the New York Post, which is owned by our parent company Tom Cruise. Apparently Chris was candid December for helping his brother Andrew fend off sexual harassment allegations instead of helping women fend off his brother. That will claim that Zucker not only knew about it but that Zucker had inappropriate dealings with Andrew as well.

And now their big scoop, they've obtained Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema's Social Security number. And damn it, all I wanted was her phone number. Gawker echoes the progressive left's attacks on Sinema for her refusal to support Biden's Build Back Better Bill -- and Gawker is telling the world they have a private data, which is obvious payback, perhaps a threat, and then they're washing their grubby little hands by acting like this info won't be used to harass her by people even grosser than them. Yes, if you thought following her into the bathroom was bad. Gawker said, hold my pee. How they score this amazing journalistic coup, turns out these bottom-feeders simply filed a public records request for Sinema's divorce papers. The records came back unredacted full of private info like her driver's license number and bank account info. Just like the intel I bought from Kat's college boyfriend. Best eight bucks I ever spent. Well, with government fraud protection so lacks, it's no wonder people don't trust elections. The Scuzz Lords at Gawker say this kind of doxxing is a good thing for freedom of the press and transparency of our elected officials. But the only thing that's transparent is the left's need to bully a woman who's standing up for herself. But that's really the case, Gawker, now go get Nancy Pelosi stock records and verify if her birth year is 1940 A.D. Emily, if this info is used for ID theft or to do something with Sinema, like some kind of fraud, would Gawker be held legally responsible?"

So, remember, the, the existence of the sex tape was newsworthy, but the content itself was not, and that's what got them shut down. So, here they are reporting they have her SSN because as they put it, they legally obtained it for 11.00 bucks because there wasn't redacted because her records were made the part of the public record there in Arizona before the laws changed, whatever. So, they're just reporting they have it, and everyone, you can do it too because it's not us, we're not breaking the law, right? So, it's, it's legal but it's dirty. Remember when Rebecca Schaefer was killed by a stalker fan on her doorstep? At that time, it was legal also to obtain an address of anyone from the DMV, and that's why the laws changed.

They're everything -- everything about what makes you a woman is taken away from you. And then, whenever, a woman is standing on her own and showing that she's strong, she's ripped down."

A new study of the dating lives of college students finds that 63 percent of dates and in sex if the woman was the one who asked the guy out, which seems low unless the lady is a real pig, a sexist would say. But that's compared to just 56 percent of the time the man asked for the date. Well, one thing is for sure humans are sluts. Repent. Researchers asked more than 20,000 students detailed questions about their dates, like who initiated, who paid, and what kind of sexual activity happened later? They then asked the students what they were wearing and started breathing heavily. Turns out, just 36 percent of college dates followed a traditional script, like the one where my wife's a welder, and I'm selling girl scout cookies. And women just initiated one out of every 10 hookups, that's 10 percent. Talk about inequality. I feel like marching. But the most important takeaway is obviously that asking thousands of college students detailed questions about their sex lives actually counts as research now. If that had been the case in the 80s, my Uncle Steve wouldn't still be in prison. Granted, his subjects were tied up at the time, but it was all in the name of research. Kat, thoughts on this?"

And secondly -- don't look at me like that -- and secondly, they had, they had this whole thing about how like, the culture skips the steps and everyone is just like in rooms. So, like, yes, because of COVID. All college students are doing is hiding in their dorm rooms and making out and doing more. And third and final point, the fact that they say it's because the women initiated the date, like yes, of course."
