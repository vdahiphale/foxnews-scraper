And at that time, he issued these statements which were just egging on -- with perfunctory asking for peace, but mostly, he was just egging them on to continue. So, this is a plain violation of Facebook's rules against praising dangerous individuals and organizations at a time of violence.  So, Mr. Trump is subject to the same rules on Facebook as everyone else and the oversight board held that this was in fact a violation and, thus, Facebook was justified in taking them down. What we did say, though, was that they were not justified taking them down indefinitely, that they did not provide any reasons for that, that is not a provision in their rules, that was wrong. And we gave them a certain amount of time to get that -- get their house in order. They needed some time because their rules are shambles. They are not transparent. They are unclear, they are internally inconsistent. So, we made a series of recommendations about how to make their rules clearer and more consistent and the hope is that they will use the next few months to do that.

Is this party going to be unified or still badly split going into the 2022 midterms? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Well, the House is -- is unified. The House and the Senate are very different. And the fact is Liz Cheney does not represent the Republican conference. She's the leader there. She doesn't represent them. They're not with her. She doesn't represent the voters. We've done polling comparing Liz Cheney's standing to other figures in the party.

How -- how smart are House Republicans to base their chances for 2022 on getting along with and the support of Donald Trump? SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": Well, I think that the House Republicans have adopted a -- a risky strategy for a political party in tying their fortune to the defeated presidential candidate from last time around. You know, that -- that's just never happened before in modern times. Usually somebody gets the nomination, loses the bid for the White House, as President Trump did in 2020, and then they move on to some other figures. We've never seen a time when the losing presidential candidate continues to dominate, continues to be the face of the political party, even to the point of meddling in these primaries. You know, at the moment, the Republican Party is pretty united. I don't see a big civil war in the party. But if that's the basis for your party, if that's the appeal that you're making, the grievances over the last election, it is hard for me to see how that appeals to voters beyond the core Trump supporters, which is, as Karl Rove pointed out, maybe down to about a third of the electorate.",

So it can't really be boiled down to a sort of bumper plate. The problem with tying this sort of conceptually to what's coming next with infrastructure is it's -- it's sort of -- it's kind of bogus because what the White House will tell you is this infrastructure plan is spaced out over a number of years.

Professor, your board decided to uphold the ban for six months while Facebook clarifies its policy. Why did you decide to enforce the ban or to continue the ban during that period, rather than to lift it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAEL MCCONNELL, FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD CO-CHAIR",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, on January 6th, President Trump issued those statements as a mob was rampaging through the Capitol, as members of Congress were cowering in fear, as mob - - as the rioters were threatening Vice President Pence's life. And at that time, he issued these statements which were just egging on -- with perfunctory asking for peace, but mostly, he was just egging them on to continue. So, this is a plain violation of Facebook's rules against praising dangerous individuals and organizations at a time of violence. So, Mr. Trump is subject to the same rules on Facebook as everyone else and the oversight board held that this was in fact a violation and, thus, Facebook was justified in taking them down. What we did say, though, was that they were not justified taking them down indefinitely, that they did not provide any reasons for that, that is not a provision in their rules, that was wrong. And we gave them a certain amount of time to get that -- get their house in order. They needed some time because their rules are shambles. They are not transparent. They are unclear, they are internally inconsistent. So, we made a series of recommendations about how to make their rules clearer and more consistent and the hope is that they will use the next few months to do that. And then when they come back and look at this, they'll be able to apply those rules in a straight-forward way."

    {
      "speaker": "MCCONNELL",

He's not -- Facebook is not a government, and he is not a citizen of Facebook. But in a broader sense, what we are trying to do is bringing some of the most important principles of the First Amendment, a free expression law globally into this operation. Facebook has been -- exercises too much power. They are arbitrary. They are inconsistent and it is the job of the oversight board to try to bring some discipline to that process. So what we have done is to identify ways in which Facebook has been nontransparent, ways in which they've been arbitrary and trying to nudge them toward a more -- free speech, free expression, friendly environment."

It's a matter of freedom of reach. How do you respond to that?"

    {
      "speaker": "MCCONNELL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's, of course, up to Congress to decide what the anti- trust laws are going to be, but this is not a free -- this is not a First Amendment issue. It is not as if -- you can't go to court, no judge in the country would hold that Mr. Trump's free speech rights were violated. Now, if Congress wants to pass a new law similar to, you know, must-carry rules or fairness doctrine of the past, they can do that and the courts will decide whether that -- it comports with the First Amendment. The oversight board has nothing to do with that. Our job is to -- is to provide oversight for Facebook to make sure that they are applying their rules in a fair, consistent, non-arbitrary fashion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But I want to pick up on exactly that point, sir. There's certainly a practical effect to the Facebook ban. President Trump in 2020, as Mike Emanuel mentioned, got to his message out to millions of voters through Facebook. He raised millions of dollars through Facebook. I want to -- when you were appointed to oversight board, you said it was, quote, your goal that Facebook act as a, quote, neutral platform that, quote, does not decide elections. Couldn't one argue that what Facebook is doing now goes exactly what you said the goal of the oversight board is, it's acting on bias to very hinder President Trump's ability to run for re- election?"

Remember, Mr. Trump is the one who issued those inflammatory posts at the very time when rioters were invading the Congress and shutting down the constitutionally prescribed process for counting electoral votes. He issued those posts. He is responsible for doing that. He bears responsibility for his own situation. He put himself in this bed and he can sleep in it."

And let me emphasize fairness and consistency are absolute bedrocks of freedom of expression rules. Freedom of expression depends upon a lack of vagueness. It depends upon even treatment of everyone. Now, if Facebook simply let Mr. Trump off the hook completely, it would not be even treatment of everyone because all users of the platform are subject to the same set of rules and that includes Mr. Trump."

Cheney voted with Trump positions these last four years 93 percent of the time. Stefanik voted with Trump positions 78 percent of the time. If Cheney is being replaced and -- and she's clearly, it seems, more conservative than Stefanik, is it just because of the fact that she's not as loyal to Donald Trump?"

Let me tell you, Republicans are almost completely unified in a single mission to oppose the radical dangerous Biden agenda and win back the majority in the midterm election. And any other focus other than that is a distraction from stopping the Biden agenda from what it -- what it's already done in three months, sending this economy in a tailspin, the crisis that the border, making America less safe abroad from appeasing those like in Iran by -- by flirting with reentering the Iran nuclear deal. That -- that's our focus as a House Republican conference. And any leader who's not focused on that, on pushing back against the Biden -- the radical dangerous Biden agenda, at this point, needs to be replaced.

Chris, it's uncomfortable at times, but one of my jobs is to hold my Republican leadership accountable for being focused on the Republican ideals that we stand for and the single mission that we have to win back the majority. And, at this point, the reason, Chris, that you and I are talking about Liz Cheney on this important program on Sunday morning is -- is exact -- the exact evidence that she's failed in her mission as the chief spokesperson of our party. We shouldn't be talking about Liz Cheney, we should be talking about pushing back against the radical Biden agenda. And this is all a distraction from our ability to be able to do that.

But as a rank and file member -- and -- and make it clear, make it clear to all of your viewers, Chris, that we're not kicking her out of the Republican Party if she's removed from her leadership post. But in her leadership post, she doesn't just -- any member of Congress doesn't just represent their district, they represent 212 members of the Republican conference and -- and right now it's clear that she doesn't represent the views of the majority of our conference or the focus that all of us have to win back the majority."

That's why I wrote a bill that's co-sponsored by nearly 100 of my colleagues to strengthen voter identification laws at the federal level and support those measures nationwide. And it's -- it's -- it's why I'm -- I'm -- I'm even more concerned about HR-1, the radical Democrat -- their -- their bill to nationalize and federalize elections, a very dangerous move forward. And -- and that's what we should be focused on. And, once again, when we're focused on beating Democrats, beating back the -- the radical, dangerous Biden agenda, we should be focused on winning back the majority in the midterm election to save this country.

But the focus on this program and that -- and on other news shows about Liz Cheney and January 6th and Donald Trump distract us from what we have to do to save this country, to win back the majority in the midterm election. That's what I am focused on. Every single day that goes by that Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi pass more radical bills and send this country down a socialist path is -- is a day that we -- we lose and this -- and the mission to save the country.

If -- if Liz Cheney somehow prevails, it will only be because there's a two-thirds rule. She has to -- they have to get two-thirds of vote to remove her from office. But she will have been rebuked for a vote of conscious and for her statements on the January 6th assault on the Capitol and on the prodigious untruth that there was massive voter fraud in six states that somehow cost Donald Trump the election. If she loses, which is likely, it's going to further alienate the minority of Republicans who like what Donald Trump did in office but don't like how he handled himself, particularly in the aftermath of the election, and it's going to make it more difficult to attract swing voters in the 2022 elections. An NBC poll this week had President Donald Trump's approval at 32 percent. And 44 -- and in losing strength within the party, 44 percent of -- of those surveyed said they were more supporters of Trump than of the Republican Party, 50 percent said they were more supporters of the Republican Party than Donald Trump. That's the first time that it's ever gotten to 50 percent for that. And the -- and -- and it's showed clear deterioration of his position within the party since -- since the November election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Right. Jonathan, let me add something to that. If congressional Republicans seem to be tying themselves to the former president, Mr. Trump doesn't seem to be returning the favor. He has made it pretty clear he's looking to -- to set up primary opponents to a number of Republican incumbents, including all 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him. Just this week he launched another attack on Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. Is the Republican Party, the -- I'm -- I'm talking about, you know, the -- members of Congress, are -- are they going to get it together with President Trump? Is this party going to be unified or still badly split going into the 2022 midterms? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Well, the House is -- is unified. The House and the Senate are very different. And the fact is Liz Cheney does not represent the Republican conference. She's the leader there. She doesn't represent them. They're not with her. She doesn't represent the voters. We've done polling comparing Liz Cheney's standing to other figures in the party. She is -- her -- she is so far under water, it's not -- you know, it's -- it's really stark how far under water she is. By the way, so is Mitch McConnell. So the fact is the Republican voters are much more on the side of Donald Trump than they are on her side. And that's what the -- the conference is responding to. As for how many priories Donald Trump intervenes in, he's certainly going to intervene in some. I would actually be surprised if he does aggressive primaries in all of those impeachment votes. Kevin McCarthy's trying to ward him off. And in some ways I think, you know, putting Liz Cheney forward as a, you know, sacrificial lamb is -- is -- is part of that attempt to try more -- it may not work, by the way. There's no controlling Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "Yes, I want to pick up on that, Susan, because there's a report this week out of Mar-a-Lago that President Trump is even considering as loyal as Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader has been to him. Well, you know, if -- if Republicans were to win -- take back the House, the speaker is the real golden position, and that he might not necessarily support McCarthy. How -- how smart are House Republicans to base their chances for 2022 on getting along with and the support of Donald Trump? SUSAN PAGE, \"USA TODAY\": Well, I think that the House Republicans have adopted a -- a risky strategy for a political party in tying their fortune to the defeated presidential candidate from last time around. You know, that -- that's just never happened before in modern times. Usually somebody gets the nomination, loses the bid for the White House, as President Trump did in 2020, and then they move on to some other figures. We've never seen a time when the losing presidential candidate continues to dominate, continues to be the face of the political party, even to the point of meddling in these primaries. You know, at the moment, the Republican Party is pretty united. I don't see a big civil war in the party. But if that's the basis for your party, if that's the appeal that you're making, the grievances over the last election, it is hard for me to see how that appeals to voters beyond the core Trump supporters, which is, as Karl Rove pointed out, maybe down to about a third of the electorate."

Even within the Republicans, you have some who say, repeal of Section 302 will solve the problems, others say reform, others say the real problem is anti-trust, others say none of the -- those other three proposals have anything to do with keeping us conservatives from being de-platformed. So I -- you know, if there's that kind of disagreement within the Republicans, it's likely mirrored with inside the Democratic Party as well. I find it hard to believe that they're going to be able to find something that can draw together and get meaningful legislation passed with, you know, 218 votes in the House and 51 votes in the Senate or 60 votes in the Senate.

And we're back now with the panel. Susan, there has been quite a debate ever since those numbers came out Friday morning about what they mean. President Biden says that it shows the need for that $4 trillion in additional government spending, but Republicans say, you know, the -- what it -- what it shows is that big government, and especially the enhanced unemployment benefits, are the problem. Did it suddenly get easier or harder for Biden to pass his agenda?"

Obviously, as you say, both sides seized on -- on these disappointing numbers as evidence supporting their view of how the economy should work. I think that what we know from polling is that Americans are really eager to get government help as we face the recovery from the -- from the COVID pandemic. And so I think it probably makes it easier for Joe Biden to hold every Democrat together as he needs to do and push through this huge package. Americans have been surprisingly supportive of the idea of a stronger government safety net, at least until we recover some of these millions and millions of jobs that have continue to be lost because of the pandemic."

I mean there were -- we're expecting more than a million jobs and we -- we come up, you know, 800,000 short. And they also downgraded March. And there's going to be analysis as to, you know, where these jobs are -- where the weak points are. Part of it is -- is there's certainly a question about the unemployment payments. There's also a question about people being hesitant to go back because of COVID and also the child care problem, which still remains a real problem with, you know, schools not fully reopened and parents still having these really complicated relationships. So it can't really be boiled down to a sort of bumper plate. The problem with tying this sort of conceptually to what's coming next with infrastructure is it's -- it's sort of -- it's kind of bogus because what the White House will tell you is this infrastructure plan is spaced out over a number of years. It's actually long term investment. And this is not going to solve some monthly employment blip. We're talking about, you know, rebuilding the nation's infrastructure over a really long period of time with spaced out spending. So everyone will do their sort of political hackery (ph) and say this justifies my position. But the fact is there's a pretty tenuous condition between the infrastructure part and, you know, trying to get the immediate task of getting Americans back to work and back into the workplace."

The next two plans, the $4 trillion more in infrastructure, in social programs, those are supposed to be, as -- as Jonathan says, much longer term, slower, structural change. So -- so even if the president were able to pass them, is that going to give the -- the quick boost to unemployment?"

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "No. Back of the envelope scratches suggest that of the $4 trillion, more than 90 percent of it will be spent in fiscal year 2022 through fiscal year 2029. If we've got an immediate problem here, it ain't going to do anything to solve that immediate problem. And I agree with Jonathan's point about -- about this being, you know, the unemployment rate today is -- is -- if you look at it compared to its height during COVID, we're -- we've -- we've reduced that unemployment rate 80 percent of the way back to the 3.5 percent unemployment we had when this COVID hit. And -- but the labor force participation rate, though, that is the number of people who are willing to work, is back by only half that rate. And -- and I had dinner last week with about eight CEO's of companies from around the country, mostly family-run, privately held companies. And I said, what's the number one issue you're facing. Every one of them said, I -- we can't get enough workers. Particularly, and this caught my -- my -- my ear. They said, if the job pays $50,000 or $60,000 or less, it is virtually impossible for us to find workers. So I did a little research. The federal bump up of $600 a week that exists through November works out to an annual of $31,200. In -- In New York, if you look at the existing payments, New York, California and Illinois, think about this, you're getting paid tax free $57,408, so in New York, well, actually on the first 10,000, 54,600 at an annual rate in California, and 55,592 in Illinois. Why work if you can get that kind of money and stay home and Netflix?"

But the glass is definitely not full. We continue to be vulnerable as a nation to these variants that we see devastating places like India. And this issue of vaccine hesitancy among Americans is a serious one. I've talked to people -- I've been surprised. People I would have assumed would already be vaccinated, who are worried about getting vaccinated, not sure if they're going to get vaccinated. You -- we cannot be safe as a nation and fully out of this pandemic unless we reach -- unless we double the number of people who are now fully vaccinated in this country. It's a -- it's going to be a big -- a big task."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I -- Karl, that raises the question, obviously our understanding of this virus continues to evolve, but how damaging is it, both in terms of public attitude and particularly public attitude toward getting the vaccine when the messaging about what you can do after you're so fully -- after you're fully vaccinated is so garbled?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "It is garbled. And -- and, look, back to Susan's point, I think the only way we're going to be able to solve this is by two things happening. Every American who's gotten vaccinated encouraging those that are in their sphere, their family, their friends, the people they worship with, or work with, socialize with, to get vaccinated as well. We're all going to have to make this a personal appeal. And, second of all, we've got to have more local governments being -- and state governments being very aggressive in their efforts to get people vaccinated. One of the great stories here in Texas, for example, was Amarillo, which basically said -- Potter and Randal County said, we're going to set up a central place in our -- in our convention center and we don't care where you're from or who you are or what age you are, come and get it. And as a result, a lot of people did. And so we've got to have -- our governor is sending out inoculation teams, vaccination teams, to get people in -- in -- in more remote parts of our state, or communities that might be hesitant, to step forward and get vaccinated, to get vaccinated."
