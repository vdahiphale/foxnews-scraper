And the socialist skates one step closer to the nomination, where he can spread his bitter hatred for achievement all around. And isn't that what socialism really is? It is not about spreading wealth, but spreading misery driven by envy, which Bernie has a limitless supply. But Bernie won the debate, because everyone went for the billionaire. Sanders is like the scrawniest piece of chicken in the bucket. Everyone gets eaten before him. And then that grizzly chunk of poultry ends up with the Democratic nomination.

He's now just an old white, sexist male, so skin him alive, boys. But what a contrast, imagine if Trump was up there instead of Mini Mike. You know how different it would have played out.

The next day he designates orphans as a new source of protein. March 2022, Trump buys Disney Plus and renames it Trump Plus. They only broadcast two shows, \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\" April 2023, Trump anoints Mike Pence, supreme ruler of Canada, and sells Vermont to Australia in exchange for five koala bears. The new American Vice President, Rob Blagojevich. By fall of that year, baby lotion is reformulated to be chemically identical to self-tanner. Toddlers everywhere turn a beautiful hue of orange. By spring, Trump adds a dancing meerkat to the Supreme Court and privatizes the Alphabet. May 2024. Trump removes George Washington from the $1.00 bill. His replacement, Lou Dobbs. The following winter, in his final act as President Trump, declares war on the sun. To prove he is serious, he blows up the moon. Legal murder. Ketchup fountains. Emperor Pence. Orange babies.

Okay. They don't need to be my best friend guys, but a little, hey, Kat, how are you? Or maybe a little wave, it would be nice because it feels like high school all over again. But you know what, I'm not that 17-year-old weirdo with the hot topic pants and the weird mullet and the safety pin necklace desperate for attention for people who want nothing to do with me anymore. So I'm just going to say aliens, never heard of them."

There was an asteroid that was cylindrical and they thought it might be as spaceship from an alien civilization, IT turned out it was just a rock. And they took that rock and they extrapolated that maybe aliens are already here. How did you get that from this thing that wasn't a spaceship that aliens are already here?

Sixty seven percent admit that a plant is more of a challenge than they bargained for, 20 percent say they'd rather have a root canal because this is too much pressure and they are rights.
