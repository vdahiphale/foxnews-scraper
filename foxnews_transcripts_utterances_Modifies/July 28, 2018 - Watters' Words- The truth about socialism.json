Look what the experiment with socialism has wrought. Nearly 90 percent now live in poverty. Starvation -- the average person lost 24 pounds last year, and they are not trying to diet. Sick people are taking dog medicine.   There is a massive toilet paper shortage and it's now the murder capital of the world behind El Salvador. If Democrat want to be bring socialism to America, it makes me wonder, do they want to destroy America? Now, they're going to say, \"Oh, no we mean Scandinavian countries, that's where socialism works.\" Democratic socialism, like Sweden. The Scandinavian socialism success story is a liberal fantasy. You know a country that's doing better than Sweden? Switzerland because it's a capitalist power house. Sweden isn't even really a truly socialist country anymore. Sweden was going off a cliff until about a decade ago when conservatives took over and implemented pro-capitalist reforms. Plus the Scandinavians nations are teeny and homogenous, they don't even compare to America.  And by the way, did Scandinavia defeat the Nazis? Put a man on the moon? Create the iPhone? No, that was America. What are the major contributions to humankind from Scandinavia? Ikea.  This Cortez individual says she wants free healthcare, free housing and free college. Free healthcare alone costs $30 trillion. You raise taxes on everyone in America and that won't even make a dent in paying that bill. And if socialists don't trust Trump, why give the Trump administration more power over your life? You want Trump in charge of your healthcare. You want Trump as your landlord. You want Trump running our colleges? I thought didn't like Trump University.   The Federal government has a hard enough time taking care of our vets, securing the border and protecting us from hackers. The Obama administration couldn't even launch a website, and you want to give the government more responsibility? So when you hear people talk about socialism, just ask them, where has socialism ever worked?  Here with reaction, the founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk and the host of CRTV's \"Michelle Malkin Investigates, \" Michelle Malkin. All right, Michelle, let's start with you. What do you think about this socialism experiment within the Democratic Party?  MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\": Well, I think that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is everything that's wrong with overpriced liberal ivory towers plus extreme radical identity politics plus a slavering liberal media advocacy machine that is waiting for you the next savior. And Ocasio-Cortez really is like the logical fruit of the radical progressivism that we survived under Barack Obama. I mean, this is the man who said you didn't build that, who at some point you've earned enough money. And so of course now, we have this progeny, Ocasio-Cortez who is so economically and historically illiterate, Jesse, and thank you for giving that overview in your opening points there because you don't get that most liberal universities. I mean, she is so clueless. This is somebody who graduated with an economics degree from Boston University, she claims, who doesn't even know what the unemployment rate is.",

They hate the fact that we are founded on this principle of unleashing the great potential of hard working ambitious people.  And under Obama, we had eight years of wealth shaming and success shaming, and it's only going to get worse under the Ocasio-Cortez regime which is again, taking over the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Here is what I want to say, which is very important because these people are peddling an ideology that is based on dependency and coercion. And these things are the most anti-progressive of values. They are regressive. There are not enough people in the media who want to tell the stories, and I have people all the time over the last 25 years who are like me -- who are children or grandchildren of immigrants who love this country because of the potentials that it promised them. It was not a guarantee. It was not an entitlement. It was simply the opportunity that which we enjoy. Look, I have been in this business for 25 years. I've started three web ventures. I am a proud unapologetic capitalist quote-unquote \"of color.\" And the only color that we care about really of course is green, not because we are greedy, but because we are trying to put find our table and other people's tables.   I have been able to employ dozens of people, and every one of these businesses is based on voluntary associations of people mutually pursuing their self-interests. That is the beauty of American exceptionalism that people like Ocasio-Cortez have never ever experienced in their lives.

Sick people are taking dog medicine. There is a massive toilet paper shortage and it's now the murder capital of the world behind El Salvador. If Democrat want to be bring socialism to America, it makes me wonder, do they want to destroy America? Now, they're going to say, \"Oh, no we mean Scandinavian countries, that's where socialism works.\" Democratic socialism, like Sweden. The Scandinavian socialism success story is a liberal fantasy. You know a country that's doing better than Sweden? Switzerland because it's a capitalist power house. Sweden isn't even really a truly socialist country anymore. Sweden was going off a cliff until about a decade ago when conservatives took over and implemented pro-capitalist reforms. Plus the Scandinavians nations are teeny and homogenous, they don't even compare to America. And by the way, did Scandinavia defeat the Nazis? Put a man on the moon? Create the iPhone? No, that was America. What are the major contributions to humankind from Scandinavia? Ikea. This Cortez individual says she wants free healthcare, free housing and free college. Free healthcare alone costs $30 trillion. You raise taxes on everyone in America and that won't even make a dent in paying that bill. And if socialists don't trust Trump, why give the Trump administration more power over your life? You want Trump in charge of your healthcare. You want Trump as your landlord. You want Trump running our colleges? I thought didn't like Trump University. The Federal government has a hard enough time taking care of our vets, securing the border and protecting us from hackers. The Obama administration couldn't even launch a website, and you want to give the government more responsibility? So when you hear people talk about socialism, just ask them, where has socialism ever worked? Here with reaction, the founder of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk and the host of CRTV's \"Michelle Malkin Investigates, \" Michelle Malkin. All right, Michelle, let's start with you. What do you think about this socialism experiment within the Democratic Party? MICHELLE MALKIN, HOST, \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\": Well, I think that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is everything that's wrong with overpriced liberal ivory towers plus extreme radical identity politics plus a slavering liberal media advocacy machine that is waiting for you the next savior. And Ocasio-Cortez really is like the logical fruit of the radical progressivism that we survived under Barack Obama. I mean, this is the man who said you didn't build that, who at some point you've earned enough money. And so of course now, we have this progeny, Ocasio-Cortez who is so economically and historically illiterate, Jesse, and thank you for giving that overview in your opening points there because you don't get that most liberal universities. I mean, she is so clueless. This is somebody who graduated with an economics degree from Boston University, she claims, who doesn't even know what the unemployment rate is."

They hate the fact that we are founded on this principle of unleashing the great potential of hard working ambitious people. And under Obama, we had eight years of wealth shaming and success shaming, and it's only going to get worse under the Ocasio-Cortez regime which is again, taking over the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Here is what I want to say, which is very important because these people are peddling an ideology that is based on dependency and coercion. And these things are the most anti-progressive of values. They are regressive. There are not enough people in the media who want to tell the stories, and I have people all the time over the last 25 years who are like me -- who are children or grandchildren of immigrants who love this country because of the potentials that it promised them. It was not a guarantee. It was not an entitlement. It was simply the opportunity that which we enjoy. Look, I have been in this business for 25 years. I've started three web ventures. I am a proud unapologetic capitalist quote-unquote \"of color.\" And the only color that we care about really of course is green, not because we are greedy, but because we are trying to put find our table and other people's tables. I have been able to employ dozens of people, and every one of these businesses is based on voluntary associations of people mutually pursuing their self-interests. That is the beauty of American exceptionalism that people like Ocasio-Cortez have never ever experienced in their lives. These are people only who have signed the back of a paycheck, and not the front of a paycheck."

That's not because of the spread of socialism, that is the spread of free market capitalism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Right, so free market capitalism has been the greatest wealth creating engine in the history of the world. Life expectancy in the year 1900 was a little over 40 years. Now, we are living late into our 80s. We have an abundance problem in the west. We throw away more food than we consume. We have an obesity epidemic, not a starvation epidemic. Now, mind you, it's very important, you can look at human migratory patterns as the best argument against Marxism. No one ever flees free market capitalism to go back to Marxism. They are leaving Havana for Miami, they're not leaving Miami for Havana."

They love those same techniques when to Stephen Colbert uses them every single week, and they can't stand the fact that conservatives, whether it's Charlie Kirk or me or you, Jesse, or Allie actually has fun bringing down these people and exposing them for how vacuous and moronic they really are. And so, what do you have here? The bottom line point here though is that just like with Barack Obama, they are propping up these empty vessels because it's all they have. It's moral bankruptcy. It is historic and economic bankruptcy and it's going to fail. Look, the Democratic Party slogan sounds like it's ripped off from Maduro or Chavez in Venezuela. For the people, right, we get it.

I believe in family separations because if you get arrested and get prosecuted for a crime just like any American family, you're going to get separated.

He is a lawmaker, so there should be some type of code of conduct where you don't drop it like it's hot, so people could see your derriere, nor do you use derogatory language, so I think that she should have stepped down because he doesn't have a sense of direction nor a sense of knowledge to know that certain things, you just don't do. But also, if he stepped down, other people should step down, too, like that one that keeps running around talking about, \"We've got to impeach 45.\""

Can you believe that?"

People who don't look like you. People who don't sound like you. People who don't worship like you. People who are not the same color and who didn't speak the same language. Fill in the blanks. It is their fault. What he wants to do is pit working people against working people -- black working people against white working people."

But it's a shame that Pocahontas don't even realizes that what the President is doing is bringing our country together, following the law. Something that they are not used to doing. But remember now, she is a left-leaning liberal -- a Democrat. She don't have a message. They are a mess over there, so they will race bait in order to get a vote. That's what they always do. So we have to ignore them. We know what the president is doing and we are so happy that he's making this place greater than we have ever seen it before."

One of the most of famous weather girls, I think in the entire world and everybody wants to date her. She is a very eligible bachelorette as they say, so she gets together with this guy. This guy's name is Douglas Martin. Douglas Martin is a video game player. He is a professional gamer. So, they are dating for a while and things are going great, and this guy Douglas dumps this woman here -- dumps, Yanet Garcia because he wants to dedicate more time to playing video games full time. Can you guys believe it?"

Acting like you're just some bread on a shelf instead of a diamond behind a glass, that's probably why people keep dropping your you know what, so you might as well keep your goodies to yourself.

Up next, late night hosts turn on James Comey. Unbelievable. Watch this. Time now for \"Last Call.\" Late night turning on James Comey this week as the former FBI Director took to Twitter to urge Americans to vote for moderate Democrats, not socialists in the midterms. Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler had a little fun with that."
