Some people think -- you would think the moderators went to her too often, although they say she didn't interrupt and jump-in in the second half. But I think, clearly, given that she went as the leader in the polls, the only person in double digit polling. I think she came out of it better than she went in.

One, it was in Miami, but two, Telemundo, Univision, all these places will play clips from the debate.

And they're not doing anything to stop the influx. All their doing is when they get here they want to catch and release. So, that's open borders. Enough said. I think what the problem is with the Democrats is that they've now gone so far on immigration. They've gone so far on taxes and spending, and then ripping private healthcare away in reparations. It's the most radical progressive crop of candidates you've ever seen. And what happened with President Obama when he went so far-left, so much change in such a short period of time, he got shellacked so hard at the end of his term, the Democrats were out of power so far since they hadn't been in 1920. The American people can't handle all of that radical change that quickly. And this crop of Democrats is doing it twice as fast and twice as crazy, and it's really going to hurt them."

If the Democrats -- if the Congress had listened to Trump, a child would be alive that died, because he was talking about preventing this from happening. When you have thousands and thousands of people coming, when you have a large movement of people coming, there are risks, people will get hurt, people will die, it happens, and it's terrible. It wouldn't have happened if you had actually addressed the problem when all of us were talking about the problem. But the point is these politicians are too scared to address this problem because of the activists consensus media. You know they -- Trump will nail this in a debate if he says who do you want to decide our immigration policy, other countries or us? That's the simplest question. And the Dems -- Democrats can't decide on that question the same way they can't decide on homelessness, or they can't decide on law and order. Think about it. It's not the victim. It's always the criminal. It's not the store owner. It's always the guy loitering in front of the store. It's not the citizen who decide immigration, it's the other country.

He went on to lead Project Blue Book, which was a classified Air Force study of UFOs. So he was one of the first. He did all of that and he worked to keep the memory of the Tuskegee Airmen alive until the end. Last year, at age 98, he traveled around to talk about it and he told somebody - \"Because I am an American and it was the right thing to do\" that he would go and fight for our country that wouldn't fight for him."
