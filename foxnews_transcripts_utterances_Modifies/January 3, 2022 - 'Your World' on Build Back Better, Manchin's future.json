We're going to have the government step in and pay for something that a lot of businesses are willing now to provide their employees in order to attract and keep a strong work force?

And we suddenly find ourselves in a place where, if a party controls the House, the Senate and the White House, it does dramatic things.

That's right, 2022 getting off to a dangerous start for one Border Patrol agent after he was shot at from the Mexican side of the river on New Year's Day. Take a look at these photos given to us from a law enforcement source showing some of the bullet holes in that border agent's vehicle. What we're told happened is that agent was arresting a migrant who had just crossed illegally near Roma, Texas, about an hour away from where we are, when that gunfire erupted from the Mexican side. Only his vehicle was hit. Thankfully, that agent was not injured, CBP and the FBI both now investigating this incident. If we can pull up this video right here, human smuggling certainly did not take a break over the holiday weekend. What you're looking at is Texas DPS pulling over and stopping a pickup truck being driven by a suspected human smuggler in Mission, Texas, on New Year's Eve. They get the driver out. They arrest him. Take a look at what they find in the vehicle, seven illegal immigrants being smuggled both in the bed of that pickup truck, as well as hiding inside of that truck. That Mexican national, the driver, was arrested and charged with multiple counts of human smuggling. Then take a look at these photos out of Del Rio sector also on New Year's Eve, more human smuggling, Texas DPS pulling over this truck with a tractor-trailer -- or with a trailer attached to it. You can see in the photos there was a large group of illegal immigrants being smuggled inside of that trailer. What's interesting here is, you will see underneath that vehicle the driver altered the suspension. He put blocks underneath the car, so it wouldn't look like the frame of the vehicle was riding low from the weight of the people he was smuggling, that driver also arrested for human smuggling after he had people up in the crawlspace of that trailer.

It does not.

I can see them coming up with something.

And we suddenly find ourselves in a place where, if a party controls the House, the Senate and the White House, it does dramatic things. And then, when it loses control and the other party gets in, we ping-pong back the other direction. Does anybody think that if Republicans -- if the 60-vote requirement goes away and Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, they wouldn't do things like impose a national voter I.D. requirement on -- quote -- \"voting rights\"? I mean, let's not kid ourselves. This is a very bad mood maneuver. I don't know why Schumer is doing it because he doesn't have the votes to pull it off.

You definitely see that America is at a stage where now we are not having the energy portfolio that we did before, that we literally now have to go and beg the Mideast for energy, that we are on our knees to China and Russia and Iran, that we are weaker in our military, that our police have been demeaned and diminished."

And, listen, we have always been that, right? We fought two World Wars. We dug the world out. We have bailed them out. We have lost treasures of lives around the world. We have been the world's policeman, keeping everything on a steady keel.

Now, the CDC -- the FDA's external experts had significant concerns about boosting young people. That's why the FDA did not convene them. They bypassed them altogether, because they probably knew they were going to vote it down again. They voted it down last time it was up for a vote. So this is really a violation of the integrity of the process. Now, the CDC is going to hold their own expert meeting, but that's a kangaroo court. They have experts that are like-minded.

So the media headlines seem to shift it from that -- that angle to children. That's all I saw were headlines last week about Omicron and children. And anyone with a child had to be scared to death.

Look, Omicron now has laboratory evidence that it's not infecting the lung cells or the deep parts of the respiratory system. It's more in the upper respiratory system. We have got epidemiological data that people are not getting severely ill, with rare exceptions, and those people have certain medical profiles that they can be aware of. And we have bedside observations that it's mild. So the best news is, Omicron confers immunity to Delta. And that's good news right now.

Only beef prices have went up. And, actually, just the opposite has happened with cattle prices. In the last -- well, since 1980, we have lost -- as a cattle rancher, we have lost 40 percent of the farmer and rancher share of that retail food dollar.

If you only -- if you have these four companies that dominated or -- I will use air quotes -- for the last 30 years, why at this particular point have they made their move at this sort of -- to abuse a system?

Just about 3.5 hours ago, the jury indicated it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on three of the 11 fraud and conspiracy charges against Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. As always, Holmes arrived here at the courthouse shortly before the judge read the jury's note with her mother and boyfriend by her side, and she had nothing to say to the throng of media outside. Inside the courthouse, Holmes listened as the judge read the jury's note out loud and, after a brief discussion with the lawyers, told the jury to keep trying. The eight men and four women must reach a unanimous verdict to convict. Holmes is accused of conning patients and investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars, intentionally lying to them about the effectiveness of her blood testing technology. Now, we don't know which three counts the jury cannot agree on, nor do we know if the jury has perhaps reached a verdict on the remaining eight counts. And while we cannot know for sure what Elizabeth Holmes is feeling right now, it is perhaps hope that a deadlock on three counts today could mean a deadlock on all 11 accounts eventually and a possible mistrial. But for now, Charles, the deliberations have resumed, a divided jury here in San Jose ordered by the judge to stay at it -- back to you."

Goldman Sachs the latest company pushing back its return-to-office plans, now telling its workers to clock in from home until January 19. The question, though, is, how long can the economy keep moving if workers aren't moving back to the office anytime soon? Let's ask Larry Glazer from Mayflower Advisors. Larry, I think Goldman can do a lot of things from home, but most businesses can't, right? You got to be hands on, especially these small businesses, which were just now starting to recover. So what's the deal now? How long can we keep postponing this?"

      "utterance": "That's so true, Charles. Look, when big businesses don't go back to work, it's the small businesses that get hurt the worst, these little businesses that support the Goldman Sachs of the world. Yes, of course, Goldman can work from anywhere. But Vinny's Pizza can't. The lobby shop can't. The parking attendant can't, the dry cleaner, all those businesses. These are mom-and-pop small businesses, the backbone of this country. They get crushed. And if you look at a city like New York, what is so awesome about New York, the reason people come visit it in the summer is because they want to see all these local businesses. They want to go to Little Italy. They want to go to Chinatown. They want to see Times Square. And if you put all these little businesses out of business, it just becomes another mall. It becomes another Gap. And you know what? No one's coming in to visit The Gap. So I think it's really tragic here. And I think we got to restore our soul and protect these little businesses."

It's the ultimate safety. But I think the markets also look beyond COVID, beyond Omicron. They're looking at midterm elections. They're looking at sunny skies ahead, better times ahead. And I think that's where the market will start to broaden out, some of these smaller names, some of these names that really did have a correction in the fourth quarter, not Apple, but other companies. Those will start to come back as the economy really fuels back. So we're going to get past all these higher prices, all the shock of inflation, everything else that's hurt the consumer and crushed sentiment."

      "utterance": "Charles, good afternoon to you. That's right, 2022 getting off to a dangerous start for one Border Patrol agent after he was shot at from the Mexican side of the river on New Year's Day. Take a look at these photos given to us from a law enforcement source showing some of the bullet holes in that border agent's vehicle. What we're told happened is that agent was arresting a migrant who had just crossed illegally near Roma, Texas, about an hour away from where we are, when that gunfire erupted from the Mexican side. Only his vehicle was hit. Thankfully, that agent was not injured, CBP and the FBI both now investigating this incident. If we can pull up this video right here, human smuggling certainly did not take a break over the holiday weekend. What you're looking at is Texas DPS pulling over and stopping a pickup truck being driven by a suspected human smuggler in Mission, Texas, on New Year's Eve. They get the driver out. They arrest him. Take a look at what they find in the vehicle, seven illegal immigrants being smuggled both in the bed of that pickup truck, as well as hiding inside of that truck. That Mexican national, the driver, was arrested and charged with multiple counts of human smuggling. Then take a look at these photos out of Del Rio sector also on New Year's Eve, more human smuggling, Texas DPS pulling over this truck with a tractor-trailer -- or with a trailer attached to it. You can see in the photos there was a large group of illegal immigrants being smuggled inside of that trailer. What's interesting here is, you will see underneath that vehicle the driver altered the suspension. He put blocks underneath the car, so it wouldn't look like the frame of the vehicle was riding low from the weight of the people he was smuggling, that driver also arrested for human smuggling after he had people up in the crawlspace of that trailer. Former DHS Secretary Chad Wolf says the Biden administration's messaging throughout this border crisis is just enticing people to come here. Take a listen."

And that's the issue here. And that's what the Biden administration needs to address."

      "utterance": "It does. And I think the problem is not that she went out in Florida, that she went on vacation. The problem is the hypocrisy that people see. It causes a lot of confusion. I mean, the American people in general are confused over the rules. Should they wear masks? Shouldn't they wear a mask? What type of masks? Should they be going out in public? Should they not? And they also feel very judged by a lot of people on the left for their confusion and often for people themselves saying, you know what, I don't think the masks are going to work, and so I'm going to go out, I'm vaccinated, I'm going to live my life, and they feel very judged. And then this kind of behavior comes out from Ocasio-Cortez. And it's not just her. There's others who have done the same thing. And I think it causes a huge amount of mistrust in institutions and any advice that they're -- that they're seeking to provide."

And here it is, AOC decides, well, I want to live free. I want to let my hair down, and where does she go? To Florida. It kind of contradicts the message that somehow Florida is doing it all wrong."

      "utterance": "Well, she wasn't wearing a mask outside in both instances, Charles, the one you're talking about and at the -- at the outside event with Billy Porter. But here's what I will say. I'm going to quote Mariah Carey, because I know we all haven't had enough of her this holiday season in her song, \"Why Are You So Obsessed With Me?\" The right has been obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez since the beginning. Lou Dobbs called her a little girl. Rep. Ted Yoho called her an F'ing B. Rep. Paul Gosar made a video of himself murdering her. And the right has constantly called her unintelligent, and, frankly, stupid this entire time. So, does the right-wing conservative media outlets calling Ocasio-Cortez a hypocrite surprise me? It does not. The power of her ideas, put simply, tax the rich, lower health care costs, and raise wages for American workers, is something that not only resonates with the left, but also the populist right. I think what you're seeing in these critics is someone afraid of an idea."

But I don't think that this is -- this is the case in this particular point. We -- AOC has set herself up to be a lightning rod, to be a leader, and leaders have to take criticism. In this particular case, you can't not legitimately push back on this. This is why Laura changed the subject."

The optics are awful. I mean, Lee, you're a pollster. The Biden administration is struggling right now. They can't get COVID right. They promise on November 2 they would be perfect. They have more deaths than the Trump administration. They have cases, more cases than the Trump administration. And then they tell people, well, do this, do that, do this. How can you get a cohesive message, how can you get people to even believe in you if you don't follow your own rules, your own advice?"

This is a woman who put herself out there and talked about all of these issues. And then she goes against her own word. She also was critical of the governor of Florida for taking time away with his wife, instead of being on vacation and dealing -- instead of dealing with the rise in COVID cases. She's got the same issue here in New York. And so the hypocrisy of this issue is one that is particularly troubling."
