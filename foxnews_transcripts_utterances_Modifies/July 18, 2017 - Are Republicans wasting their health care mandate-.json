The senate's repeal and replace bill died last night after two more GOP defections. And today, senate Republican starting to move for a straight Obamacare repeal vote, but the Republican senators already announcing they would not vote for a straight repeal, effectively killing any chance of any health care bill going forward, at least for now. Now, majority leader Mitch McConnell is indicating that he wants to still hold a vote on straight Obamacare repeal this week, even knowing that it might fail.

The senate's repeal and replace bill died last night after two more GOP defections. And today, senate Republican starting to move for a straight Obamacare repeal vote, but the Republican senators already announcing they would not vote for a straight repeal, effectively killing any chance of any health care bill going forward, at least for now.

Now -- or forever be on record saying that you voted against repealing Obamacare. Now, you put up the full-screen of those three senators, let's talk about them very quickly. Shelley Capito, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski, two of the three of them voted to repeal it 18 months ago, now, all of a sudden they're saying they're not going to. I will tell you, they will get primaries, all three of those will be primaries, 2020 for Capito and Collings, and Lisa Murkowski in 2024.

So Mercedes, I was kind of discussing with both Eric and Kat around, I get the notion of repealing Obamacare.

This is why Republicans were voted, and there was a clear mandate of repealing and replacing Obamacare. Why? Because when you look at the fact that there is a destabilization in our individual insurance markets, that's troubling. When you have the fact that you're still seeing premiums continue to rise, I mean a family of four next year will have -- it will increase to 40 percent in terms of what their health care costs will be in many cases. I mean, Eboni, it is troubling. And the mere fact that the Republicans cannot come to that middle ground, where you see this division amongst moderates and the conservatives, I think that it's just a disturbance for the American people.

And so much of this discussion of, why it's a disservice to the American people, is all about how many people the government is going to pay for in giving the Medicare. And it says nothing about the fact that there are doctors every day not accepting new Medicare patients. So what happens to those Medicare patients? They don't continue to get coverage. And we haven't talked about the things that really need to start happening in health care reform. We need innovation, we need consumer predictability and freedom for them to pick the plans they want. We need states, not the federal government running the insurance markets. We don't allow states to sell insurance policies across state lines, so how about letting states actually dictate what their policies are going to be."

Among other top Obama officials appearing behind closed doors on Capitol Hill this week, over unmasking and the Russia probe, former national security advisor Susan Rice is now slated to speak with the senate intel committee. I'm going to go to you, Eboni, because I'm trying to figure out why the delays, why they're finally agreeing, and why in the world are they doing this behind closed doors?"

However, I also know, which is something that Eboni brings up all the time, that there's -- the standard is so broad that it's a very easy cover for you to do something politically motivated. So I think there's another issue which is to look at what those standards are. I know that Senator Paul has said that if you are going to be unmasking a politician or a candidate you should have to go to a judge and sign up for that, which would be a great way to prevent these kinds of politically motivated actions."

While we might not get a lot from these closed-door meetings. There're going to use a lot of big lawyerly terms.

Susan Rice is very well-positioned, probably along with Loretta Lynch, to be the best place to fall women for the Obama White House because they are put in a position to where a lot of the questions and unanswered questions and sketchiness of politically motivated things that for sure came out of the Obama White House fall on them, and the consequences they have at this point are going to be very small."

Again, this isn't new for Iran to say, \"You were spying\" and sentence to prison without that likely being the case. President Trump was very critical of the Iran deal. I understand why he can't back out of it. Do you understand? Or is that something that irks you a little bit?"

I think the steps that the Department of Treasury took on the sanctions are a solid step, a good first step in -- in trying to target these entities that are involved in the ballistics program and dealing with criminal activities. But it is surely not enough, especially when you're saying that Iran continues to violate, whether it be not allowing international inspectors to come into the country, accelerating its ballistic missile program, basically exceeding the limits on the uranium -- uranium enrichment, it's very problematic.

It was something that we saw under President Obama. I think what you're seeing here with President Trump is that there is clearly a message being sent to Central America, South America, basically saying the door is -- you know, you've got to come in; there's only one way to come in and that's legally. This does not solve the problem, though, of dealing with the visa overstays. Over -- close to over that 47 percent of individuals who come illegally are visa overstays. So we have a fundamental problem with our immigration system, which what we're seeing, it's bureaucratic. It's arcane.

And three, he is working on the visa issue, Eboni, to make sure that the workers we need get here. All that said, let me also add I think it goes to a bigger picture. If you want to look at where the success in the Trump administration is coming, look at all the cabinet secretaries and the things they're doing, whether it's what Scott Pruitt is doing at EPA, Rick Perry is doing at the Department of Energy to help create jobs and get more sources of energy going, whether it's here, with the border security with what Kelly is doing, we ought to be doing segments on the Trump administration's cabinet secretaries and the success they're having."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Time to \"Circle Back\" with our specialists, Mercedes Schlapp and Dave Avella. Mercedes, my question is for you. You're a mom. You have five kids. Five."

      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",

    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Yes, very easy. Listen to your mother. So in this case, listen to Mitch McConnell; listen to President Trump. We've got to get this thing done. It's very clear. I mean, part of this is that sometimes you have to give things up and you have to compromise; and that's part of the deal. And I think that that's a big lesson that you learn when you have -- when there's five children in the house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Mine is also for you, Mercedes. We were talking in the break, and this is my proposal for Iran, and I want to know your take on it. Don't give them out any sanctions. Throw that off the table and let them know on the front end, this deal is coming apart at the seams. We are rescinding the Iran deal in its entirety. How about playing it that way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think that's a smart move. I do think that the goal of the administration is to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal. I think that's really the only viable option that we have in order to stop Iran from developing the nuclear technology. Hopefully, they can convince these other countries to join along."

      "utterance": "My comment is to David. I don't know if you want to weigh in on this, but this is a real thing. Did you know that right now there's currently a tropical storm Don, which is expected to turn into a Hurricane. True story. And a tropical depression named Hillary?"

      "speaker": "AVELLA",
      "utterance": "The heightened awareness on politics has never been higher, and it includes even our weather forecasting."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "How appropriate is that, Hillary as a tropical depression. Had no idea."

      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
