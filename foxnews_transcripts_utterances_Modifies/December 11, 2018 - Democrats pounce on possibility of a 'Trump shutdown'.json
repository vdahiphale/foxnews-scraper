We're all jerks, clowns, sinners, bigots and pigs. And of course, we're petrified of the mob,\" meaning they're actually human. And just as every human has a skill or talent, we all have a past or a life, one worth more than a tweet. But for some, a simple dignified apology will never be enough. The moral majority is now the mobbing morality, and forgiveness is viewed as an accessory to evil. And the Oscars is responding the way everyone does now: to be so gun shy about the social media fallout that they just give up and give in. No one wants to share the risk. So nothing too edgy, and humans are just that in the face of unforgiving hordes. So after decades of filling that hosting position, humans need not apply. So who then? How about Deep Blue, the chess playing computer? It's cold, faceless and never told a joke offensive or otherwise ever, much like Seth Meyers. Or how about a drone, something that can drop a crude joke from on high, then completely disappear? Like Michelle Wolf.

Nancy's getting interrupted the whole time. It was an extraordinary physical performance. At the end of the day, though, if you take -- no, I mean, look, on a debate stage, he did the same thing with Hillary. But these are two weaker people and he, you know, basically tag teamed both of them until they looked like blithering idiots. At the end of the day, though, he said I'm shutting this time for border security and I don't care if I take the heat. This is the last chance he's ever going to have to get the wall funding. It's either do-or-die. He's not going to get it in the next two years, and he may not get it in the next six. He has to go to the mattress on this. He has to own the issue.

We'll deal with DACA. You deal with the wall. There's a solution there, but they can't do it because even if they agree with what Trump is doing, they can't do it because it's Trump. They would agree -- that border security is important, but they can't admit it because then it would be Trump. And the challenge here is for Trump is that he's always choosing the long-term benefit that creates short-term public relations nightmares. This makes him look mean. The shutdown makes him look mean. But the long term win is enhanced border security, which is like national security, like law and order. He always take the long-term vision, but he gets, you know, reamed over this stuff."

This is -- and as you point out in that NPR poll. Apparently, a majority of the Trump party people say that's the case.

And when he finally got the president to say, he had this like -- on his face, like he was so happy that he got it out there. But I actually love this press conference. And I think a lot of Americans did. And the reason one is because it was -- it was the thing that people liked about Bernie and about Trump, no matter what party you came from, it's this ultimate disrupting politics. You know, instead of everyone getting in front of the press conference, in front of the press, and pretending like they all get along and like each other, they all just sort of threw it out there.

You know, clearly -- and I think a lot of it is the fact that Flynn, you know, led the DIA and was a decorated general for so long, went into -- what Mueller said ultimately. I mean, all of this stuff is really difficult because it is all speculative. But Flynn has been the one that I've had my eye on the entire time because he was so intimately involved in the top of the campaign for a long time. And so, if he's cooperating that is -- I think if there were any collusion which, so far, I agree with Jesse, we haven't seen that, but if there were any collusion, I think Flynn would be the one to know about it."

By the way, I did watch the Clinton affair, which is the ANE. And it makes me full dersh now.

If you look closely, you'll see the people who bring you FOX News. They put on their holiday finery and headed over to a fancy restaurant in midtown to celebrate Christmas and the Hanukah season. They had -- or I should say we had an indoor snow machine and enough food to feed Rudolph and the rest of the reindeer. You know it's fun to see people you work with. You can see Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade, Ainsley Earhardt there. Thanks to FOX and to all the cooks, the waiters, the technicians who made our holiday party a reason to blow the roof off last night. It was fun."

Vacations for the Gold Star families were coordinated by the Gary Sinise Foundation's Snowball Express program. According to a press release, the foundation will host a five-day experience for almost -- well, 1,722 children of the fallen and their surviving parent or guardian.
