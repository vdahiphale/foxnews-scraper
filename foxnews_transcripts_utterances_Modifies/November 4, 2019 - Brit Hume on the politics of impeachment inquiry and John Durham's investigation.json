They think it certainly was not.  I think it was not for what little that may be worth. But remember, Bret, as was pointed out in Chad Pergam's report tonight. In the end, this is legal. Yes, but it is political. And because it is political, all sorts of calculations come into play. For example, if people want to go after the President on the strength of this phone call and the investigation that grew out of it is ongoing in the House of Representatives right now. It will matter whether people think that investigation was fair.  If the Durham investigation turns up information suggesting that there were people in the government were plotting against the President from day one, that will leave a bad taste and will affect the political atmosphere. And people might say, well, you know, I don't like what he did. But look, what they were doing to him, more sinned against than sinning. So, what people vote on in an impeachment vote and in a subsequent conviction vote, if it comes to that in the Senate will depend on all kinds of factors, some of them relevant at law and a lot of them not.",

That could leave a bad taste and make it easier in the end for Republicans whose votes will be needed if he's ever to be convicted to vote against that.
