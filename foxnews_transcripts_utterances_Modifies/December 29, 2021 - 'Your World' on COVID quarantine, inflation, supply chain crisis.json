But, today, the administration mentioned National Guard troops helping out with testing, and that brings people back to the early days of 2020. A lot of people don't want to hear those two terms together. However, the administration asserting they have a strong plan to deal with testing after getting raked over the coals for the past few days after people are waiting in line for a long time to get testing. Administration officials today announced a plan, 13,000 National Guard troops helping with testing and other COVID-related issues right now in 48 states. Jackie testing is and continues to be a serious problem, with people waiting, as I said, not just one or two hours or three or four, sometimes five or six hours to get a simple test. The president himself just two days ago admitted his team is behind the eight ball when it comes to testing. Listen.",

That's about half the rate at its peak last winter. The decision by the CDC that recommend cutting isolation for asymptomatic COVID patients from 10 days down to five days is getting a lot of pushback.

If you have no symptoms after five days, but you are testing positive, you can leave the house, but you have to continue to wear your mask. It's not very complicated. If you're exposed, Jackie, and you have been boosted and you completed the vaccinations within six months, you wear a mask for about 10 days. Just use common sense. Wash your hands and wear the mask.

He was a guy who was very knowledgeable, and he knew how to get his points across. But he also was a guy who players really would run through walls for, because they respected him that much. Going into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, I went in with Reggie White and Troy Aikman and Rayfield Wright and Warren Moon. And the one person that I was really excited about going in with was John Madden, because he was just one of those guys that he was kind of an icon, as far as I was concerned.

A lot of people don't want to hear those two terms together. However, the administration asserting they have a strong plan to deal with testing after getting raked over the coals for the past few days after people are waiting in line for a long time to get testing. Administration officials today announced a plan, 13,000 National Guard troops helping with testing and other COVID-related issues right now in 48 states. Jackie testing is and continues to be a serious problem, with people waiting, as I said, not just one or two hours or three or four, sometimes five or six hours to get a simple test.

That's about half the rate at its peak last winter. The decision by the CDC that recommend cutting isolation for asymptomatic COVID patients from 10 days down to five days is getting a lot of pushback. The largest nurses union in the U.S. said such a move will endanger patients, and the flight attendants union as well pushing back, especially against the fact that you're not required to take a test, a COVID test, after isolation, that you could basically come back to work sick.

People are really curious about the latest CDC guidance. And we have been saying that the messages have been mixed, the rules have been changed. People don't know what to believe at this point.

      "speaker": "DR. BOB LAHITA, ST. JOSEPH UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL",

So, the law, as to make it very clear, if you test positive, you stay home for five days. If you have symptoms, you stay home for at least five days. If you have no symptoms after five days, but you are testing positive, you can leave the house, but you have to continue to wear your mask. It's not very complicated. If you're exposed, Jackie, and you have been boosted and you completed the vaccinations within six months, you wear a mask for about 10 days. Just use common sense. Wash your hands and wear the mask. That's all you have to do. But it's helping us, because you know there's a shortage of doctors and nurses in hospitals now."

But it's confusing to me, because you look at the CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, and she used to say, we're following the science. Now she's saying, well, it's also about people's tolerance, which many people have been saying for a long time, right?"

Sean Kennedy is with the National Restaurant Association. Sean, want to get your reaction to what we're seeing right now. A shorter quarantine period means workers can go back to work if they choose to, by the way. They might not. And that's one of the problems we have been seeing in the industry."

Today's news that we can reduce the quarantine period for our employees is a good one. It doesn't have a lot of bottom line impact. Restaurants are already using best practices, making sure that the safety of our guests and our staff remain the top priority as a result of those best practices. That's why you have not seen a systemic outbreak from a restaurant over the past 20 months of this pandemic."

We want things to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Restaurants are a huge part of that. But there's a big headline today in Politico -- pardon me -- this week talking about Omicron and essentially saying that it's triggering businesses and an outcry for a Washington lifeline again. You were mentioned in that article. I'm wondering what you would like to see Congress do when it returns next week to help restaurants, to help get back on track."

Congress has generally responded to this pandemic in fits and starts, as if this is going to be a short-term problem. We are at month 20 right now. And we need a long-term solution. One easy step would be to continue funding the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. It's a grant program that was able to take care of one in three restaurants. But there are still 200,000 restaurants waiting right now to get word from SBA. Unless Congress steps in soon, the 90,000 restaurants that are closed permanently or long-term, that number is only going to creep up."

We can't get by without one. And right now, we're in that perfect storm where we don't have any of them. Customer demand is down because of Omicron. We are still don't have the work force that we need. Wholesale food prices for restaurants are at a 40 year high year over year. So,there are a lot of things that President Biden, as well as Congress, can be doing and should be focusing on when they come back from the holiday season.

It's a slightly different tone across the channel in England. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he won't tighten restrictions before New Year's Eve. Hospitalizations here are down compared to during previous waves. And health officials are attributing that to a couple different reasons. They say that we're seeing slightly less significant symptoms when it comes to Omicron. And they're also touting the country's vaccine and booster efforts.

Again, we have seen a lot of these protests throughout the pandemic of people struggling, wanting these restrictions to lift, wanting to be able to spend time with family, spend time at businesses.

What can the president do right now to keep this economy from stalling out? Well, former Reagan economic adviser Art Laffer is here to weigh in. Art, always great to see you.

But, yes, of course, what he should do on the Build Back Better, he should admit defeat, get rid of it. It's done. People don't want it. The Senate's not going to pass it. It would be the gracious thing for him to do. They went through all sorts of finagling to get it there. It shouldn't be on reconciliation. It shouldn't be that. It should be literally a separate bill, but it wasn't. It shouldn't be past 51-50. That's not the right way to do it either. He should be gracious, and just say that's over, let's get on to the next business. I mean, what he also should do, I think, is do a payroll tax waiver, partial, probably, to really make it more attractive for low-income workers to come back into the labor force, especially those people who have left the labor force, who are almost all low-income workers. That should happen as well. And, lastly, the thing I think Biden should do is what I think he's trying to do is really pass the decision-making onto the states, rather than mandating everything from Washington, D.C. Let it go to the states. This is where states have an enormous advantage over the federal government of knowing what's good in this state vs. that state vs. others.

They don't know who they can bring on, what the status of those workers has to be to come into the office. It changes week by week, it seems like. You have got the Fed continuing to pump money into this economy at an incredible rate. Now we're talking about schools maybe going back to remote learning?

That will actually help us out potentially next year and into 2023 because we're not going to spend an extra $5 trillion over the next 10 years. But this administration keeps providing solutions to the problems we don't have, and it neglects addressing the problems we do have. At this point, what the president really needs to do in 2022 is make a sharp break with the left. He has to start saying and doing things that are uncomfortable to his left-wing base. He has to say we need to get workers back on the job. We're going to drop all of these mandates. We have got to keep schools open. We're going to take that off of the table. He needs to set the stage for businesses to hire and people to work. It's as simple as that. If he does that, we can make progress on inflation faster. If he doesn't do that, Jackie, we're going to have this conversation for a really long time."

You have got people that have less disposable income. There's a new survey out that finds that 29 percent of people are actually delaying their homebuying plans because of inflation, 10 percent canceling their plans altogether. Homebuying, Brian, is part of the American dream."

      "utterance": "Now, we know, because of the housing bubble, that you can't just give mortgages out to anybody. And there has to be some rules and regulations. But, still, you have got people whose hands are tied right now because they're just trying to put food on the table. And so you look at this and say, this isn't going to get better next year either. In fact, with inflation going up, I think you're going to see interest rates rising too, but you're not going to see those prices come down the way they normally would."

And, right now, homebuyers are sitting there thinking -- some of them are saying, I just can't do this. Prices are too high. There's actually a whole bunch right now who are saying, I don't know if I should be buying a home right now, but I feel like I better, because, if I don't do it now, prices are going to go up even more."

      "speaker": "BRENBERG",
      "utterance": "And then there are some just throwing their hands up sitting on the sidelines. Jackie, this is the problem with inflation. When inflation runs rampant, it's impossible for people to make plans, to make long-term investments. That's what kills an economy. You have got to get inflation under control because you got to put people back in the driver's seat. Right now, they're just feeling like they're being taken for a ride."

      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",

FOX's own David Lee Miller is live from New York's La Guardia Airport. And looking at the lines there, David, it looks like people are tired."

      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "They are very tired, frustrated and exhausted. Things here at Terminal A at La Guardia Airport relatively mellow, but, system-wide, there are still a lot of problems. Today alone, more than 900 flights scheduled to land or take off in the U.S. were canceled because of COVID-related staffing shortages. Now, the good news is, that number is an improvement over the day before. New CDC guidance says workers testing positive and without symptoms only now have to be quarantined for five days, instead of the previous 10. But for thousands of airline customers, there's still plenty of disappointment to go around. JetBlue today canceled 9 percent of its scheduled flights, United 7 percent, Delta 4 percent. Alaska Airlines canceled 12 percent, citing the weather. The airlines says it proactively reduced departures to allow more time for aircraft to be deiced in Seattle. Across the country, there have been long lines at many major airports, especially the hubs. And frustrated passengers are simply running out of patience."

And while the flight disruptions have dwindled, they are not over. Poor weather that's in the forecast, as well as problems related to COVID, will likely plague many of the holiday travelers who will soon be returning home. And consider this, Jackie. Thursday, tomorrow, already, there are 450 flights that are now canceled. That's a number that we will only see increase -- Jackie."

They are mourning today following the death of football icon and Hall of Famer John Madden. My next guest was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame alongside the former coach and broadcaster. Former New York Giant Harry Carson is with us. Great to see you, Harry. When you think about John Madden..."

      "utterance": "... he was a coach, of course. He was a broadcaster, had that huge video game franchise essentially centered around him. He's going to have a huge legacy here. A lot of people say there is nobody that loved the sport more than he did. What did he mean to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Well, for me, he meant different things at different times. When I played, it meant that when he and Pat Summerall came together, I knew that the game was going to be something really, really special. The mere fact that these guys were going to be airing the game, that made a difference. Once he left football and he went into business and so forth, it still meant something to me, because I have been like 30, 32 years removed from playing football, and, last year, I was part of the Madden team. So I had the opportunity to be -- my grandson, my sons, they have been able to play Harry Carson from way back in the day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "It's so interesting, because you see the photographs, you see the evolution of him, and his energy was just palpable, especially when he was broadcasting. He just brought that love of the game, I think, to everybody who was listening to him. And when you think about coaches, yes, they coach teams, they inspire within their sport, but it's so much more than that, because, many times, people look to sports and sort of mimic their lives based on so many of those principles. Don't you think that he will have a wider footprint, if you will, than just within the NFL?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Well, for so many people who watch football, but weren't really into football, John Madden really made watching football popular, the way that he diagrammed plays, the way that he described various things that were happening on the field, the way he talked about the weight of players. And he was an every -- an everyday kind of guy that everybody could relate to. And I'm not going to go so far as to say he was like that old uncle. He wasn't. He was a guy who was very knowledgeable, and he knew how to get his points across. But he also was a guy who players really would run through walls for, because they respected him that much. Going into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, I went in with Reggie White and Troy Aikman and Rayfield Wright and Warren Moon. And the one person that I was really excited about going in with was John Madden, because he was just one of those guys that he was kind of an icon, as far as I was concerned. He was a guy who was a straight shooter. And, in essence, I was sort of -- I was amazed that it took him so long to get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and he was coming in with me. And that's the reason why I think the 2006 class of Hall of Famers was probably the best group of Hall of Famers to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame."
