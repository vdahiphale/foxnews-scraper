This dynamic was totally different because the president took ownership of the shutdown, and then it was the border wall funding versus American federal workers getting paid. And that really wasn't a very good dynamic for him, and Pelosi just obstructed and the media helped her, so she just waited him out.  Five weeks later and people didn't get paid and there's no border wall, so where do we stand? I don't know.

ACR, to fight over this for a few more weeks.  You know, the president yesterday at this time, the White House was saying we will do a C.R. for three weeks with a very large down payment. Well, the president agreed to do that with no down payment today. So, he, I think, saw the political writing on the wall that for the Oval Office address and all of the way he's been messaging this, the numbers haven't really moved and he's been getting blamed. I actually think that given the fact the Democrats feel like they won this round, they will feel empowered to make, possibly, a compromise.

So, even though there's inequality, the inequality may look like it's stagnant, but within that people are constantly moving. So somebody who at the top 10 percent a decade ago may not be in the top 10 percent, you know, now. And there's people constantly moving up. I mean, I started making nothing in 1988, and it took me a long-ass-time to get here, excuse the language. But it frustrates me because everybody looks at people who are wealthy and they assumed that they were always wealthy. That's not the case. Every single wealthy person borrowing -- people who get it from their mommy and daddy, it's going up the ladder. And it's the mobility that people keep forgetting. The thing that frustrates me, too, when you ask people who are appalled about raising taxes, a lot of them don't have skin in the game. So it's easy to say tax that guy. The 10 percent already pay the majority of the taxes and there's a large portion of Americans who don't pay any taxes.

I think one of the things on inequality is where you are concerned that there will be social instability because of it, right? It's because there's going to be too much between the haves and the have-nots and that's going to create more social instability and that could lead to something that none of us want. The problem is, is that they're using -- they're inciting the passions of social instability and inequality in order to get there. And not making a point, like Greg was making, that your opportunity, though, is what should be there. I think President Trump has a strong argument to make on this case. Arguably, I think, he was elected more on his economic policies than the wall. I think that he had a good point -- he's got a point to make about unemployment numbers. You can say that these tax cuts are for the rich, but you cannot argue that the unemployment didn't get better and that wages started to go up. There were impacts, good ones from his policies.",

He's got to get reelected so then maybe he has more of a mandate, more political capital to get the wall funding. But at this point, the last shutdown was the Schumer shutdown and that was perfectly teed up for the president because Schumer was protecting illegal immigrants over veterans getting paid. This dynamic was totally different because the president took ownership of the shutdown, and then it was the border wall funding versus American federal workers getting paid. And that really wasn't a very good dynamic for him, and Pelosi just obstructed and the media helped her, so she just waited him out. Five weeks later and people didn't get paid and there's no border wall, so where do we stand? I don't know. It just seems like the airplane situation, the callous statement from the commerce secretary, the FBI director coming out and saying reopening this thing, that was what cranked up the pressure in order for the president to change gears."

They'd be willing to spend more money that's he's actually asking for, so it's not about immigration at all. It's about Trump. And Trump, whether you like him or you hate him, he's the phenomenon of the last two years that has created this kind of animosity, right? These people -- I don't see any compromise coming in this, because if the Dems compromise, the media will just rip it to shreds. This is a personal vendetta against Trump. They're putting now -- they're putting security and they're putting the government employees, you know, to the side in favor of their own personal hatred of Trump.

ACR, to fight over this for a few more weeks. You know, the president yesterday at this time, the White House was saying we will do a C.R. for three weeks with a very large down payment. Well, the president agreed to do that with no down payment today. So, he, I think, saw the political writing on the wall that for the Oval Office address and all of the way he's been messaging this, the numbers haven't really moved and he's been getting blamed. I actually think that given the fact the Democrats feel like they won this round, they will feel empowered to make, possibly, a compromise.

And the fact that the president's tax plan was tilted more towards corporations, particularly corporations, but also towards higher brackets. There are middle-class people in this country who could use some relief. So, I'm not sure her plan is the right one, but she's dismissing it by saying, oh, Democrats just wants to be Venezuela, or why isn't John Kerry pay more isn't engaging with the really big problem we have in the country.

Everybody is talking about inequality but what they're doing is -- they're not talking about what makes America so unique in this capital -- this free market society mobility. So, even though there's inequality, the inequality may look like it's stagnant, but within that people are constantly moving. So somebody who at the top 10 percent a decade ago may not be in the top 10 percent, you know, now. And there's people constantly moving up. I mean, I started making nothing in 1988, and it took me a long-ass-time to get here, excuse the language. But it frustrates me because everybody looks at people who are wealthy and they assumed that they were always wealthy. That's not the case. Every single wealthy person borrowing -- people who get it from their mommy and daddy, it's going up the ladder. And it's the mobility that people keep forgetting. The thing that frustrates me, too, when you ask people who are appalled about raising taxes, a lot of them don't have skin in the game. So it's easy to say tax that guy. The 10 percent already pay the majority of the taxes and there's a large portion of Americans who don't pay any taxes. So it's very easy to say I'm for raising taxes when you have no skin in the game."

As Karl Rove has written younger people who say they want socialism, you should take them seriously and explained to them what this is all about. I think one of the things on inequality is where you are concerned that there will be social instability because of it, right? It's because there's going to be too much between the haves and the have-nots and that's going to create more social instability and that could lead to something that none of us want. The problem is, is that they're using -- they're inciting the passions of social instability and inequality in order to get there. And not making a point, like Greg was making, that your opportunity, though, is what should be there. I think President Trump has a strong argument to make on this case. Arguably, I think, he was elected more on his economic policies than the wall. I think that he had a good point -- he's got a point to make about unemployment numbers. You can say that these tax cuts are for the rich, but you cannot argue that the unemployment didn't get better and that wages started to go up. There were impacts, good ones from his policies."

They eat too much and they don't exercise enough. I just saved us $3 million. So right there, we are wasting money.
