We will have more in the aftermath of that meeting for you in just a minute. But first tonight, the Democratic Party is a diverse coalition. They themselves tell you that relentlessly. But diversity does not mean that Democrats are united. No, increasingly it means a party defined by identity politics, and by definition, that means conflict.  In the Democratic Party, skin color matters above all, some colors are good, some colors are bad. Your worth as a person depends upon what you look like. Watch.",

And so what is going on in the left right now is they're trying to twist any sort of question about Kamala Harris's his lineage or where she came from, into some sort of birther style attack, which I think is garbage. Kamala Harris is the child of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother. Now, she was born in America to two immigrant parents. She's a black American. She's not exactly African-American, right? And what she does when you see the situation that she had with Joe Biden at the last debate, and she tries to muddy the waters, when she says that she's a child of bussing. She tries to muddy the waters to pretend as if she comes from the Jim Crow lineage or the lineage of slaves, which she does not come from. That's the conversation that people are having.

Also, Kamala Harris was polling very low -- consistently low among African Americans. There is some sort of bit -- she just was not connecting with African-American voters. Surprise, surprise. After the shameless stunt with Joe Biden last week, she's polling a little bit higher now. So mission accomplished.   The stunt was shameless. The stuff was calculated, almost to the point that they were selling merchandise connected to this stuff, hours after it happened. So they run on race. They run on division. They run on all of these things, because they don't have any ideas for the American people, other than selling our entire country away to illegal immigrants when you talk about how free healthcare for illegal immigrants, when they talk about the borders being concentration camps -- complete garbage -- and most Americans look past it. The problem with the Democrats and the issue that they're having right now is that they need 85 percent to 90 percent of black voters. Black voters are making turn to the right. They're seeing record low unemployment under the President. They're seeing the President having signed the First Step Act. They're seeing actual tangible results in their lives under a Republican administration, and Democrats have no other thing to offer them besides fear and handouts.

A headline last night on \"The Post\" reads this, quote, \"Trump paints a dark picture of homelessness in cities.\" Really? Have you walked outdoors? As \"The Post\" lectured you, your eyes are lying. Those massive tent encampments destroying our greatest cities? Authorities doing nothing? That's not real. There's not really a homeless problem. Homeless numbers are down, they told us. Trump's dark picture, it's just a right wing fever dream. He's senile. He is a hater. Here is something interesting though. Just a few months ago, that very same newspaper, \"The Washington Post\" had a very different view. In March, \"The Post\" wrote that, quote, \"The significant growth in tent encampments nationwide has become one of the most visible signs of the nation's failure to alleviate widening inequality.\"  In that same piece, the newspaper admitted that tent camp cleanups have nearly quadrupled in Washington, D.C. in just the past four years. In another piece in March, \"The Post\" said that burgeoning tent cities quote,\" ... symbolize the depth of the nation's affordable housing crisis and inability to solve its homelessness problem.\" So what happened? Did some miracle occur in the last three months that changed all of this that eliminated homelessness and made it a joke to \"The Washington Post\" and Jeb Bush's former flack over at MSNBC? What changed? Well, the press changed. So Trump comes out for something and suddenly they're against it. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be open borders, it could be Antifa, and falling wages -- it doesn't matter. If the President notices a crisis, they decide it no longer exists. Who is the marionette? Who is the buffoon? I think you know. Well, it's early to tell right now, but the President's visit to the DMZ in North Korea could eventually be seen as a historic moment, a turning point in his presidency. We don't know. But it was amazing. Either way, his meeting with Kim Jong-un seems to have restarted the peace process with North Korea and it could at some point, lead to some kind of resolution, that would clearly be a good thing. No matter how odious North Korea is, and its leader is, clearly he is.  But back to the United States, the President is being denounced by the left and the press. They're indistinguishable.

You know, there's a big difference here and what's interesting, of course, I mean, this is -- it is pretty blatant, whether it be the debates or all of their immigration plan. They deny it. They realize there was some damage after the debates. But it really is decriminalizing crossing the border, eliminating these facilities, which means open borders. And they're looking for that because the more people you have in a state, the higher your representation is in the House of Representatives. It is a cold blooded calculation for political power. And these very individuals they say they care about, these migrants coming over who are looking for a better life, who are fleeing a lawless, horrible dynamic as they claim and as their supporters claim are entering into that environment being created here for them by the Democrats. So you've got a remarkable dynamic, including with Miss Ocasio-Cortez, now, they're being used as props. They're being used to win the news cycle, which was a big Barack Obama theory, right? No matter what's going on, you just win the next news cycle and people will move on. Well, the Democrats have had a bad few weeks, the debates were just awful. The President is making not only international news, but he is changing the world. And so what do they do? They're using these poor individuals as props for them to get more political power and to win a new cycle. Every day that goes on, Tucker, the Democrats lose more and the President of the United States becomes -- it becomes more apparent that he is the man who is making this nation better.",

Chicago Police and the brothers' attorney tell us the video is the brothers and in it, you can clearly see a flash of a red brimmed hat. Police notes which we reviewed and surveillance video appears to show one of the brothers purchasing a red brimmed hat along with other items like a white robe to be used during the alleged hoax. Also the new video show Smollett walking in the middle of the street in the same white sweater he was later seen wearing when police arrived and you could see on the video, it was such a frigid night here in Chicago. There's hardly any other human in sight other than what appears to be Smollett and the brothers. In another new piece of video from a loading dock appears to show Smollett in that same white sweater looking calm, perhaps a cell phone in hand and then what also appears to be, but not certain, the Osundairo brothers seen walking down the same sidewalk. The timing on that not clear. We reached out to Smollett's legal team for comment on this new video. We have not heard back.

One was a black guy dressed in a sweat suit and the other a well-dressed a white couple. And they would go into an upscale clothing store and he would act very suspicious thinking that would draw the security and they would go behind the screen to steal everything and they would meet in the parking lot and divide up the goodies. That's what we have going on here with Nike. A 31-year-old, pampered, wealthy athlete can pick up the phone and be the arbiter for black America to tell Nike to cancel. I think this was a setup from the beginning to sell. This is happening though -- he is denigrating a symbol that is very important to many African-Americans and he is denigrating this country. Black Americans fought in every war in this country and they fought bravely because they fought for the promise that was America, but they were also aware America had a problem. The problem was slavery and discrimination and racism. But what held them together because they defended it because America was promised was, outweigh the problems and they were self-correcting. We had a system to self-correct. And so for him to take this and denigrate the flag, it is very disrespectful to the memory of the sacrifices made by the Tuskegee Airmen, by the Triple Nickels who were the paratroopers, and all the other -- the 92nd Combat Unit. And so I just think that, he really does -- Kaepernick does a tremendous disservice to this country. He is plunging us into a chaotic differences where we're fighting one another, in the meantime the people in whose name he says he is doing this, low income blacks, they are the ones suffering most because as long as we are concentrated and transfixed on race, we will not address the problem of violence, of crime, of displacement due to all the other problems and what is the answer that he is asking --",

Facebook has repeatedly blocked pro-life ads for being sensational and graphic. In Ireland, they censored a pro-life ad simply for showing an unborn child. They said the image was too offensive. So it's not surprising to learn that the COO of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg has just donated a million dollars to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Sandberg says she is motivated by quote \"draconian laws\" against abortion recently passed in Alabama, Georgia and other states. She says the laws are a threat to quote, \"women of color.\" She doesn't explain, but Facebook's view on this is very clear, and so as hers. She has articulated it many times -- children get in the way of corporate profits, of the bottom line. If you have a family, you're much more likely to be loyal to other people than you are to be loyal to the company you work for, in other words to Sheryl Sandberg. So abortion is actually a huge boon to her and to shareholders. Is there a creepier motivation? See if you can think of one. There probably isn't? Well, supporters of marijuana legalization claim that marijuana is really the new frontier in civil rights. Legalizing it they tell us will help America's poorest and most vulnerable. The health hazards of marijuana don't exist, they tell us and selling it will allow former drug dealers to become thriving entrepreneurs. In other words, it's all good. Relax, man.

' And as it is now when you know the Orkin man shows up, if you've got a problem with these cockroaches, they're using several different types of chemicals to kill these things. Well, it turns out they have a very quick gestation period. They have about a hundred-day life cycle so when the survival of the fittest steps in, if it's -- you know, you can literally right with Raid and it survives and goes on to have several hundred offspring, then you can see where this is going. It's complete Darwinism.

But diversity does not mean that Democrats are united. No, increasingly it means a party defined by identity politics, and by definition, that means conflict. In the Democratic Party, skin color matters above all, some colors are good, some colors are bad. Your worth as a person depends upon what you look like. Watch."

Pete Buttigieg is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, he knows that police in his city are doing their best to keep citizens safe. But saying that won't get him the Democratic nomination.

The exact same conversation. And so what is going on in the left right now is they're trying to twist any sort of question about Kamala Harris's his lineage or where she came from, into some sort of birther style attack, which I think is garbage. Kamala Harris is the child of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother. Now, she was born in America to two immigrant parents. She's a black American. She's not exactly African-American, right? And what she does when you see the situation that she had with Joe Biden at the last debate, and she tries to muddy the waters, when she says that she's a child of bussing. She tries to muddy the waters to pretend as if she comes from the Jim Crow lineage or the lineage of slaves, which she does not come from. That's the conversation that people are having. It was not racist when Don Lemon had it on CNN. It's not racist for me or other black voters would have it and it certainly wasn't racist for Donald Trump, Jr. that asked the question, I think that idea is completely absurd."

The reason that she has injected this conversation, the reason that Democrats have come so hard, you know, to her defense, and the reason they're trying to smear Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives as racist is because they have absolutely zero ideas for black Americans or any Americans for that matter. Also, Kamala Harris was polling very low -- consistently low among African Americans. There is some sort of bit -- she just was not connecting with African-American voters. Surprise, surprise. After the shameless stunt with Joe Biden last week, she's polling a little bit higher now. So mission accomplished. The stunt was shameless. The stuff was calculated, almost to the point that they were selling merchandise connected to this stuff, hours after it happened. So they run on race. They run on division. They run on all of these things, because they don't have any ideas for the American people, other than selling our entire country away to illegal immigrants when you talk about how free healthcare for illegal immigrants, when they talk about the borders being concentration camps -- complete garbage -- and most Americans look past it. The problem with the Democrats and the issue that they're having right now is that they need 85 percent to 90 percent of black voters. Black voters are making turn to the right. They're seeing record low unemployment under the President. They're seeing the President having signed the First Step Act. They're seeing actual tangible results in their lives under a Republican administration, and Democrats have no other thing to offer them besides fear and handouts.

A headline last night on \"The Post\" reads this, quote, \"Trump paints a dark picture of homelessness in cities.\" Really? Have you walked outdoors? As \"The Post\" lectured you, your eyes are lying. Those massive tent encampments destroying our greatest cities? Authorities doing nothing? That's not real. There's not really a homeless problem. Homeless numbers are down, they told us. Trump's dark picture, it's just a right wing fever dream. He's senile. He is a hater. Here is something interesting though. Just a few months ago, that very same newspaper, \"The Washington Post\" had a very different view. In March, \"The Post\" wrote that, quote, \"The significant growth in tent encampments nationwide has become one of the most visible signs of the nation's failure to alleviate widening inequality.\" In that same piece, the newspaper admitted that tent camp cleanups have nearly quadrupled in Washington, D.C. in just the past four years. In another piece in March, \"The Post\" said that burgeoning tent cities quote,\" ... symbolize the depth of the nation's affordable housing crisis and inability to solve its homelessness problem.\" So what happened? Did some miracle occur in the last three months that changed all of this that eliminated homelessness and made it a joke to \"The Washington Post\" and Jeb Bush's former flack over at MSNBC? What changed? Well, the press changed. So Trump comes out for something and suddenly they're against it. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be open borders, it could be Antifa, and falling wages -- it doesn't matter. If the President notices a crisis, they decide it no longer exists. Who is the marionette? Who is the buffoon? I think you know. Well, it's early to tell right now, but the President's visit to the DMZ in North Korea could eventually be seen as a historic moment, a turning point in his presidency. We don't know. But it was amazing. Either way, his meeting with Kim Jong-un seems to have restarted the peace process with North Korea and it could at some point, lead to some kind of resolution, that would clearly be a good thing. No matter how odious North Korea is, and its leader is, clearly he is. But back to the United States, the President is being denounced by the left and the press. They're indistinguishable.

The problem is that not that Trump is meeting with him because the first time Trump met with him, some of the same people that you just showed were actually happy about it and actually gave him some compliments on his accomplishing that. He met with him a second time and didn't accomplish anything in that meeting, and now this is the third meeting. Now go back to the first meeting, which happened in Singapore. Remember that they signed an agreement and Kim Jong-un signed that that he was going to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. That was over a year ago, and yet, Kim Jong-un has taken no steps to denuclearize. In fact, we'll probably less see, because Kim Jong-un has continued with missile tests, short range missile tests, but that's in improving his nuclear arsenal. So that's the big problem here. It's not that he did one meeting, it's that he has now done a third meeting with no accomplishments and it is normalizing them."

He did it without any qualms. So Trump's idea that having a relationship with Kim Jong-un is going to somehow result in Kim Jong-un not attacking us. It's not right. Kim Jong- un does not give a rat's ass about a relationship with President Trump. What he cares about is surviving and making his regime survive.

Cory Booker just released an immigration plan whose tenets include immediately releasing virtually everyone here illegally who has crossed the border. In other words, de facto open borders.

They realize there was some damage after the debates. But it really is decriminalizing crossing the border, eliminating these facilities, which means open borders. And they're looking for that because the more people you have in a state, the higher your representation is in the House of Representatives. It is a cold blooded calculation for political power. And these very individuals they say they care about, these migrants coming over who are looking for a better life, who are fleeing a lawless, horrible dynamic as they claim and as their supporters claim are entering into that environment being created here for them by the Democrats. So you've got a remarkable dynamic, including with Miss Ocasio-Cortez, now, they're being used as props. They're being used to win the news cycle, which was a big Barack Obama theory, right? No matter what's going on, you just win the next news cycle and people will move on. Well, the Democrats have had a bad few weeks, the debates were just awful. The President is making not only international news, but he is changing the world. And so what do they do? They're using these poor individuals as props for them to get more political power and to win a new cycle. Every day that goes on, Tucker, the Democrats lose more and the President of the United States becomes -- it becomes more apparent that he is the man who is making this nation better."

The first piece of video shows the Osundairo brothers walking towards the direction of Smollett's apartment building. Chicago Police and the brothers' attorney tell us the video is the brothers and in it, you can clearly see a flash of a red brimmed hat. Police notes which we reviewed and surveillance video appears to show one of the brothers purchasing a red brimmed hat along with other items like a white robe to be used during the alleged hoax. Also the new video show Smollett walking in the middle of the street in the same white sweater he was later seen wearing when police arrived and you could see on the video, it was such a frigid night here in Chicago. There's hardly any other human in sight other than what appears to be Smollett and the brothers. In another new piece of video from a loading dock appears to show Smollett in that same white sweater looking calm, perhaps a cell phone in hand and then what also appears to be, but not certain, the Osundairo brothers seen walking down the same sidewalk. The timing on that not clear. We reached out to Smollett's legal team for comment on this new video. We have not heard back.

One was a black guy dressed in a sweat suit and the other a well-dressed a white couple. And they would go into an upscale clothing store and he would act very suspicious thinking that would draw the security and they would go behind the screen to steal everything and they would meet in the parking lot and divide up the goodies. That's what we have going on here with Nike. A 31-year-old, pampered, wealthy athlete can pick up the phone and be the arbiter for black America to tell Nike to cancel. I think this was a setup from the beginning to sell. This is happening though -- he is denigrating a symbol that is very important to many African-Americans and he is denigrating this country. Black Americans fought in every war in this country and they fought bravely because they fought for the promise that was America, but they were also aware America had a problem. The problem was slavery and discrimination and racism. But what held them together because they defended it because America was promised was, outweigh the problems and they were self-correcting. We had a system to self-correct. And so for him to take this and denigrate the flag, it is very disrespectful to the memory of the sacrifices made by the Tuskegee Airmen, by the Triple Nickels who were the paratroopers, and all the other -- the 92nd Combat Unit. And so I just think that, he really does -- Kaepernick does a tremendous disservice to this country. He is plunging us into a chaotic differences where we're fighting one another, in the meantime the people in whose name he says he is doing this, low income blacks, they are the ones suffering most because as long as we are concentrated and transfixed on race, we will not address the problem of violence, of crime, of displacement due to all the other problems and what is the answer that he is asking --"

Facebook has repeatedly blocked pro-life ads for being sensational and graphic. In Ireland, they censored a pro-life ad simply for showing an unborn child. They said the image was too offensive. So it's not surprising to learn that the COO of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg has just donated a million dollars to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Sandberg says she is motivated by quote \"draconian laws\" against abortion recently passed in Alabama, Georgia and other states. She says the laws are a threat to quote, \"women of color.\" She doesn't explain, but Facebook's view on this is very clear, and so as hers. She has articulated it many times -- children get in the way of corporate profits, of the bottom line. If you have a family, you're much more likely to be loyal to other people than you are to be loyal to the company you work for, in other words to Sheryl Sandberg. So abortion is actually a huge boon to her and to shareholders. Is there a creepier motivation? See if you can think of one. There probably isn't? Well, supporters of marijuana legalization claim that marijuana is really the new frontier in civil rights. Legalizing it they tell us will help America's poorest and most vulnerable. The health hazards of marijuana don't exist, they tell us and selling it will allow former drug dealers to become thriving entrepreneurs. In other words, it's all good. Relax, man. Well, Dr. Kevin Sabet was a senior adviser at the Office for National Drug Control Policy under President Obama. He is no kind of right winger. He is also President of Smart Approaches to Marijuana.

BRETT LARSON, HEADLINES 24/7: This is a very troubling revelation that we got out of Purdue University and you know, the old saying goes when Armageddon comes the only thing that's going to be left are the cockroaches and Cher, and they proved this in this new study. This is actually kind of interesting because when you dig below the surface on this, there are several hundred species of bugs and mites and spiders that in time and through their evolution become impervious to these pesticides. ' And as it is now when you know the Orkin man shows up, if you've got a problem with these cockroaches, they're using several different types of chemicals to kill these things. Well, it turns out they have a very quick gestation period. They have about a hundred-day life cycle so when the survival of the fittest steps in, if it's -- you know, you can literally right with Raid and it survives and goes on to have several hundred offspring, then you can see where this is going. It's complete Darwinism. And it's kind of terrifying because now they're saying how are we going to deal with this if nothing we can do, if none of these chemicals that we've been using are going to kill these roaches.

Our amazing translator, Sarah Moon and driver, Mr. Kim were critical. They helped us every step of the way. Our A-list technical team -- really the best -- made every show from Japan and North Korean border flawless. Benjamin West, Kyle Rothenberg -- two of our absolute favorites and of course, Charlie Cougar, and Justin Wells, our producers. We're going to be back very soon. In the meantime, 8:00 p.m., every night, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Goodbye from the border with North Korea, have the best Fourth of July. \"Hannity\" is next. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
