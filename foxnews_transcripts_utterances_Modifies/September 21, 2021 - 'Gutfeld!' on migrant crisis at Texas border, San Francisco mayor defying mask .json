      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "sentences": "Well, thank you for that. All right. So it's no longer a border crisis. It's an unmitigated border disaster mega crisis. Thousands upon thousands living under a Texas bridge and not in a good way. You know, if this was spring break and those were partying undergrads, the outrage would be palpable. It's a super spreader event. There -- where are the masks? Why aren't they six feet apart? What are they think this is, the Emmys? Which raises the obvious question, how did it get this bad? Well, it's simple. The media does its best not to cover bad news with their guys in office, or in Delaware, or wherever Joe's wandered off to in an open robe. His hands sticky from rocky road. Remember, it's not what they report on, it's what they emit that does the real damage. As long as Democrats are in power, the media holds the reins, yes, the reins. We'll get to that. Now Fox covered the border under both Trump and Biden. And the fact is, we'd all be like Biden and Harris, totally clueless about the border if it weren't for Fox News is amazing coverage. If Trump were in charge, you can bet all the networks would be covering it like the Kennedy assassination. They'd be patting themselves on the back with one hand and doing God knows what with the other. Instead, they buried this story like Joe Biden does with a private gin pill and Joe's morning scone. So it takes Fox News to shame the crummy media into doing their job. Consider this, more than 12,000 migrants are packed in a refugee camp in America, a camp. Remember that phrase? How the media often predicted that Donald Trump was going to put people in camps? They got the camps part, right? Except that took them to elect Biden so they could get the camps just like that famous republican tyrant FDR. And what do you hear from the media? Well, they're as quiet as Joe and his 1:00 p.m. nap. Until now, of course, yes, in case you wondered if there was a way to get the media to finally care about the border, there is. You flip it so that we Americans become the monsters, then their heads turn so fast, they'll need a chiropractor. So out comes a story that the Border Patrol on horseback, were whipping Haitians trying to enter the country. Yes, Americans were whipping black people. Again, just like the old days when Democrats were in charge. And so the media is now all over this story spreading this unchecked manure like a professional landscaper. They know if the story could be wielded as a weapon against America they do it whether it's true or not. When it comes to hating America, the Taliban has nothing on these clowns. Initially, both the DHS Secretary and the Border Control Chief explained that those aren't whips, but reins to control the horses, which may make sense. It protects the horses in the people closest to them. But don't tell that to the media who could only react to images that inflame them. Remember Covington? Who needs contact -- context when you have one inflammatory moment? Here's a picture of border patrol on a horse in a stream. So how long before CNN accuses these Border Patrol men of trying to drown horses in the Rio Grande? Now you know what, it's been a while since I wrote a horse. Kentucky Derby 2004. I came in eighth. Turns out you have to be on top of the horse. But even I knew this story was kind of odd. Yamiche Alcindor on PBS described the border patrol as seemingly using whips, before asking Jen Psaki if they should be fired. Seemingly, just like PBS is seemingly a news organization just because they have three letters in their name. Even if -- even if those letters stand for pure (BLEEP) but I guess -- probably be bleeped at home but you can figure out what the B.S. stands for. But the suffering of 12,000 refugees didn't matter until she found someone in law enforcement to smear.",

So instead of focusing on the thousands of Haitians living under a bridge, Chris grabbed hold of one outrageous image. Like it was his favorite plastic dumbbell. And I don't mean Don Lemon. I guess we should be -- I guess we should be grateful for a liberal media finally paying attention to this crisis that they helped create by getting Biden elected. But it has nothing to do with compassion or journalism. They just found a way to do the story. So it's not about the White House, but instead evil law enforcement. It's about Americans trying to do their jobs because the administration and the media, they won't do theirs. And now you watch the hacks in government suddenly changing their tune.",

This newly surfaced picture leaked on Twitter the day before his victory. Keyword there, victory, he's still one. Proving you can't keep a man of color down. The picture shows Justin appropriating an Aladdin character at a 2001 Arabian night's party. And if you look closely, it appears he even painted his hands black. That's dedication to bigotry. But for me the tongue is what sends it over the top. Look at that, he's culturally appropriating Miley Cyrus. Canada wants a guy wearing makeup with his tongue out they should elect Gene Simmons. I thought that would be funnier. Of course, this is the first time his black brown tan face has come back to haunt him. Pictures from the same event came out in 2019 and he apologized back then. So, you got to wonder how many more painted party face photos does Justin have? There's more photos of him pretending to be Arab than of him actually being white.

Ben and Jerry's partnered with the bill's author, Cori Bush, you know, the lady who wants to defend the police but has her own private security and wants an eviction moratorium and has been evicted multiple times. Meanwhile, a new survey by a health startup called the Gut Stuffs, found that 18 percent of U.K. adults said their biggest fear about returning to the office post pandemic was pooping at work. 53 percent said they've even left the office to go somewhere else. Wow. Like the park. Park can be nice. The Gut Stuffs number one suggestion for employers to make their employees less scared of doing number two, simply talk about it. Yes, that's great advice, Gut Stuff. I would definitely clear it with H.R. before talking to your co-workers about where to poop. But you know what, maybe Ben and Jerry's can make a flavor that touches that problem. Or better yet create delicious new flavors based on the streets of San Francisco. How about scoop-o-poop?

      "utterance": "Well, thank you for that. All right. So it's no longer a border crisis. It's an unmitigated border disaster mega crisis. Thousands upon thousands living under a Texas bridge and not in a good way. You know, if this was spring break and those were partying undergrads, the outrage would be palpable. It's a super spreader event. There -- where are the masks? Why aren't they six feet apart? What are they think this is, the Emmys? Which raises the obvious question, how did it get this bad? Well, it's simple. The media does its best not to cover bad news with their guys in office, or in Delaware, or wherever Joe's wandered off to in an open robe. His hands sticky from rocky road. Remember, it's not what they report on, it's what they emit that does the real damage. As long as Democrats are in power, the media holds the reins, yes, the reins. We'll get to that. Now Fox covered the border under both Trump and Biden. And the fact is, we'd all be like Biden and Harris, totally clueless about the border if it weren't for Fox News is amazing coverage. If Trump were in charge, you can bet all the networks would be covering it like the Kennedy assassination. They'd be patting themselves on the back with one hand and doing God knows what with the other. Instead, they buried this story like Joe Biden does with a private gin pill and Joe's morning scone. So it takes Fox News to shame the crummy media into doing their job. Consider this, more than 12,000 migrants are packed in a refugee camp in America, a camp. Remember that phrase? How the media often predicted that Donald Trump was going to put people in camps? They got the camps part, right? Except that took them to elect Biden so they could get the camps just like that famous republican tyrant FDR. And what do you hear from the media? Well, they're as quiet as Joe and his 1:00 p.m. nap. Until now, of course, yes, in case you wondered if there was a way to get the media to finally care about the border, there is. You flip it so that we Americans become the monsters, then their heads turn so fast, they'll need a chiropractor. So out comes a story that the Border Patrol on horseback, were whipping Haitians trying to enter the country. Yes, Americans were whipping black people. Again, just like the old days when Democrats were in charge. And so the media is now all over this story spreading this unchecked manure like a professional landscaper. They know if the story could be wielded as a weapon against America they do it whether it's true or not. When it comes to hating America, the Taliban has nothing on these clowns. Initially, both the DHS Secretary and the Border Control Chief explained that those aren't whips, but reins to control the horses, which may make sense. It protects the horses in the people closest to them. But don't tell that to the media who could only react to images that inflame them. Remember Covington? Who needs contact -- context when you have one inflammatory moment? Here's a picture of border patrol on a horse in a stream. So how long before CNN accuses these Border Patrol men of trying to drown horses in the Rio Grande? Now you know what, it's been a while since I wrote a horse. Kentucky Derby 2004. I came in eighth. Turns out you have to be on top of the horse. But even I knew this story was kind of odd. Yamiche Alcindor on PBS described the border patrol as seemingly using whips, before asking Jen Psaki if they should be fired. Seemingly, just like PBS is seemingly a news organization just because they have three letters in their name. Even if -- even if those letters stand for pure (BLEEP) but I guess -- probably be bleeped at home but you can figure out what the B.S. stands for. But the suffering of 12,000 refugees didn't matter until she found someone in law enforcement to smear."

You may be drawn to the desperation of the man trying to escape others and the desperation of keeping our borders safe of what I believe the former president tried to depict as a brown menace at our border. None of this. None of it is new. And it is not isolated."

He was too busy defending his corrupt brother and trying to save his job on a network hooked up to a respirator and in grave condition. Don't let his brother near the network. So instead of focusing on the thousands of Haitians living under a bridge, Chris grabbed hold of one outrageous image. Like it was his favorite plastic dumbbell. And I don't mean Don Lemon. I guess we should be -- I guess we should be grateful for a liberal media finally paying attention to this crisis that they helped create by getting Biden elected. But it has nothing to do with compassion or journalism. They just found a way to do the story. So it's not about the White House, but instead evil law enforcement. It's about Americans trying to do their jobs because the administration and the media, they won't do theirs. And now you watch the hacks in government suddenly changing their tune."

This newly surfaced picture leaked on Twitter the day before his victory. Keyword there, victory, he's still one. Proving you can't keep a man of color down. The picture shows Justin appropriating an Aladdin character at a 2001 Arabian night's party. And if you look closely, it appears he even painted his hands black. That's dedication to bigotry. But for me the tongue is what sends it over the top. Look at that, he's culturally appropriating Miley Cyrus. Canada wants a guy wearing makeup with his tongue out they should elect Gene Simmons. I thought that would be funnier. Of course, this is the first time his black brown tan face has come back to haunt him. Pictures from the same event came out in 2019 and he apologized back then. So, you got to wonder how many more painted party face photos does Justin have? There's more photos of him pretending to be Arab than of him actually being white.

No (BLEEP).\" But how they did it remains a mystery. As if that weren't stupid enough, the network was late to the dinosaur sex game by five years. Enough time for three Jurassic Park movies, talk about reproduction. Forbes ran a report a report about how dinosaurs, Jurassic Port back in January 2016. Maybe that's why they haven't gotten around to covering the implosion of Russia gates or anything else for that matter. That aside, if you're still wondering about the dinosaur mating rituals, turns out males actually did a dance to try and woo their female counterparts. Apparently, that type of foreplay is what modern day birds do, as well as others who shall go unnamed. Joe?"

But where are his balls, you know?

Ben and Jerry's partnered with the bill's author, Cori Bush, you know, the lady who wants to defend the police but has her own private security and wants an eviction moratorium and has been evicted multiple times. Meanwhile, a new survey by a health startup called the Gut Stuffs, found that 18 percent of U.K. adults said their biggest fear about returning to the office post pandemic was pooping at work. 53 percent said they've even left the office to go somewhere else. Wow. Like the park. Park can be nice. The Gut Stuffs number one suggestion for employers to make their employees less scared of doing number two, simply talk about it. Yes, that's great advice, Gut Stuff. I would definitely clear it with H.R. before talking to your co-workers about where to poop. But you know what, maybe Ben and Jerry's can make a flavor that touches that problem. Or better yet create delicious new flavors based on the streets of San Francisco. How about scoop-o-poop? Crap Frappe. And my favorite, feces pieces? Kat, I don't think there's a problem a poop joke can't solve."
