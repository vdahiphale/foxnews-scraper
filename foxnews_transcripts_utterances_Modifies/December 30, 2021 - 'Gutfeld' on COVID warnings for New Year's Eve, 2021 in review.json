Like a tiny Ghost of Christmas Present, because I'm celebrating the holiday today. Because this year COVID robbed me of Christmas with my family. COVID robbed us of our studio audience. And it robbed me of my Christmas Eve Feast of the Seven Fishes. The Italian tradition of eating seafood and yelling. So to make up for it, we are having a feast tonight. Not actual food to me. Don't get excited. It's Emily's feast of seven jokes.",

China's Wuhan Institute of virology recently hosted a conference on lab safety, to which the world responded a little (BLEEP) late, guys. In a recent segment on COVID Safety, CNN's Dr. Leana Wen admitted cloth masks don't stop transmission of the virus. They also don't stop CNN hosts from grabbing your ass. Today in New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he doesn't believe in shutdowns despite having shut down the city for months. He then added \"I also oppose letting criminals roam free to murder people.\"",

But just like Andy Dufresne, Veronica, the frog brothers, Ronald Miller, the Monster Squad and Kylie Richards in her oft overlooked role as Ellie Curtis in Watcher in the Woods. The underdogs always come out on top, except in rocky one. That's why I'm here tonight as a living breathing message of hope. Llike a tiny Ghost of Christmas Future. Not just for this hour, but for the long haul. In the immortal words of Yoko's boyfriend, it will all be OK in the end. If it's not OK, it's not the end. 2021 has sucked, no doubt. Look who's in the White House. Look who's not in the White House. Half of us are in lockdowns, under mandates. Bill Cosby is free and yet Paul Wieland is still imprisoned. China is experimenting with hypersonic missiles. And our military is experimenting with diversity training.  The only thing that grew bigger than our federal government this year was the criminal liability of CNN producers. The world is mourning the loss of Captain von Trapp, Raider nation's John Madden, screech, Clary and Joe DeVito his favorite movies Steel Magnolias, and Rosen Moonstruck. And the genius mind behind (INAUDIBLE) the mainstream media encouraged by feckless elected officials played and attention shell game where COVID played on loop.  While urban implosions the southern border record surge, skyrocketing and homicides, disconnected public schools, opioid overdoses, a social war waged on law enforcement, and Americans left behind in Afghanistan, barely received any coverage. The media did keep us well informed, however, on who would host Jeopardy. There were other stories too, stories that deserve our attention or admiration, our disgust but where was the media? MSNBC was busy chasing down (INAUDIBLE0 but what's everyone else's excuse? Where was the coverage when an escaped prisoner on the lam was finally caught after venturing out to buy Call of Duty? Where were the headlines when teens dumping in a murdered body in the woods were caught because they dutifully left their hazard lights on. Where were the media alerts when six colossal dumbasses kidnapped and held for ransom? A victim just steps away from an NYPD training facility. You can imagine how that turned out. But in the interest of fairness, I have to hold the mirror up to this show as well. I borrowed one of the 10 in Joey's office. It's true. Even Greg missed a huge story this year, likely the largest story of the year, which is shocking, honestly, because we heard it from the source himself from Channing Tatum. Yes, great news for America, Greg and me.   There will be a Magic Mike Three. Not sure why this hasn't headlined every episode of Gutfeld since. But earlier this month, it was confirmed. Two of the greatest movies of all time will now be part of a trilogy of human perfection. So take heart America. 2022 will be better than 2021. Or at the very least, it'll have better abbs. Yes. Despite all our differences. The one thing Greg and I have in common, the one love we share is Magic Mike, watching and performing.  So in our shared great anticipation of the release of Magic Mike Three next year, I put together what I knew Greg would love. A Gutfeld rendition of the most engorging or engrossing, the most delightful performance, not on Broadway. I give you Gigantic Greg.",

Germany's also banned large group gatherings. But you know who's never bans large gatherings of Germans? France. China's Wuhan Institute of virology recently hosted a conference on lab safety, to which the world responded a little (BLEEP) late, guys. In a recent segment on COVID Safety, CNN's Dr. Leana Wen admitted cloth masks don't stop transmission of the virus. They also don't stop CNN hosts from grabbing your ass. Today in New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he doesn't believe in shutdowns despite having shut down the city for months. He then added \"I also oppose letting criminals roam free to murder people.\" Chris Tucker turned down a $10 million payday for a sequel to the awesome movie Friday, saying he's too mature to be seen behaving badly on screen anymore. But producer Ice Cube has found a replacement who has no qualms about cursing or smoking weed on camera. In a CBS News interview, Vice President Kamala Harris said her biggest failure was not getting out of D.C. more. But for once I actually agree with Kamala. I'd love to see her get out of D.C. permanently. Thank you all. This has been Emily's feast of seven job. So at this point, you may be wondering how the little sister got the keys to the car. Is this like in the Goonies where the kids let the air out of brands by tire so they get a head start? No. Greg prefers a tricycle. Is Greg tied up naked with duct tape over his mouth, dumped in the girls locker room? Wait, no. That was him in high school. Is he draped over the side of Kilmeade's hot tub naked? Three bottles of wine deep. Wait, no, that was him on Christmas. No, I'm actually sitting here for one reason. I beat him and a good old fashioned card game."

But just like Andy Dufresne, Veronica, the frog brothers, Ronald Miller, the Monster Squad and Kylie Richards in her oft overlooked role as Ellie Curtis in Watcher in the Woods. The underdogs always come out on top, except in rocky one. That's why I'm here tonight as a living breathing message of hope. Llike a tiny Ghost of Christmas Future. Not just for this hour, but for the long haul. In the immortal words of Yoko's boyfriend, it will all be OK in the end. If it's not OK, it's not the end. 2021 has sucked, no doubt. Look who's in the White House. Look who's not in the White House. Half of us are in lockdowns, under mandates. Bill Cosby is free and yet Paul Wieland is still imprisoned. China is experimenting with hypersonic missiles. And our military is experimenting with diversity training. The only thing that grew bigger than our federal government this year was the criminal liability of CNN producers. The world is mourning the loss of Captain von Trapp, Raider nation's John Madden, screech, Clary and Joe DeVito his favorite movies Steel Magnolias, and Rosen Moonstruck. And the genius mind behind (INAUDIBLE) the mainstream media encouraged by feckless elected officials played and attention shell game where COVID played on loop. While urban implosions the southern border record surge, skyrocketing and homicides, disconnected public schools, opioid overdoses, a social war waged on law enforcement, and Americans left behind in Afghanistan, barely received any coverage. The media did keep us well informed, however, on who would host Jeopardy. There were other stories too, stories that deserve our attention or admiration, our disgust but where was the media? MSNBC was busy chasing down (INAUDIBLE0 but what's everyone else's excuse? Where was the coverage when an escaped prisoner on the lam was finally caught after venturing out to buy Call of Duty? Where were the headlines when teens dumping in a murdered body in the woods were caught because they dutifully left their hazard lights on. Where were the media alerts when six colossal dumbasses kidnapped and held for ransom? A victim just steps away from an NYPD training facility. You can imagine how that turned out. But in the interest of fairness, I have to hold the mirror up to this show as well. I borrowed one of the 10 in Joey's office. It's true. Even Greg missed a huge story this year, likely the largest story of the year, which is shocking, honestly, because we heard it from the source himself from Channing Tatum. Yes, great news for America, Greg and me. There will be a Magic Mike Three. Not sure why this hasn't headlined every episode of Gutfeld since. But earlier this month, it was confirmed. Two of the greatest movies of all time will now be part of a trilogy of human perfection. So take heart America. 2022 will be better than 2021. Or at the very least, it'll have better abbs. Yes. Despite all our differences. The one thing Greg and I have in common, the one love we share is Magic Mike, watching and performing. So in our shared great anticipation of the release of Magic Mike Three next year, I put together what I knew Greg would love. A Gutfeld rendition of the most engorging or engrossing, the most delightful performance, not on Broadway. I give you Gigantic Greg."

According to a new British poll, almost one in 10 mothers don't know who actually fathered their children. The other nine say, it's Pete Hegseth. Pete, I didn't write that line. Almost, eight percent of the one thousand British moms surveyed admitted to having lied about the biological origins of their kids, proving once again, moms are more honest than MSNBC. We're going to assume it's from having sex or as they call it in England, that thing we did to the Irish. And in other depressing news about kids, the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by our parent company, Skechers, profiled families who named their kids after Harry Potter characters, something shockingly popular with adults who shouldn't be allowed to play with their wand or anyone else's. Turns out, 91 Hermione is were born in the United States just last year, dooming them to a lifetime of bullying and of not having their names called out during sex. I can't believe that took -- and not nearly enough kids called Lord Voldemort, aka the baby who must not be named. Anyway, for more on all this, let's go live to our new magic correspondent disappearing Steve."

She's not one of those, one in 10 moms. Really quick to the other thing, really quick. Harry Potter, you should name your kids after fictitious characters, why? Because the public perception of them never changes. OK? You don't want to name your kid after somebody who's alive because things can get hairy. We're having a big problem right now with my daughter Ghislaine."

And like, who would I rather, like who'd rather hang out with a woman who doesn't know who her baby's father is? Or someone who knows the baby's father's name made the decision to gather name and after a Harry Potter character. I'm going to have way more fun with the first."
