I challenge some of the things he was saying and afterwards I was thanked by a lot of coaches and players who were clearly quiet because they were worried about being shamed. And just one point. He said unvaccinated people are treated like they are the most dangerous people in society. And that is coming from the top of this nation on down. Joe Biden repeatedly has said I understand why you're angry and afraid of vaxx -- of unvaccinated people. He said, we have to protect vaccinated workers from the unvaccinated but then went on to say how effective the vaccines were. People who are unvaccinated get -- can get COVID from the vaccinated.

He went through when he called an immunization protocol which he didn't really get into the details of what that meant and said he talked to the league and the Packers about it. So, he's not someone that just dismissed the whole thing.

He goes into this, he said that, they made in the team, sent a stooge early into training camp to tell us we were 19th in the league and vaccination percentage. I challenge some of the things he was saying and afterwards I was thanked by a lot of coaches and players who were clearly quiet because they were worried about being shamed. And just one point. He said unvaccinated people are treated like they are the most dangerous people in society. And that is coming from the top of this nation on down. Joe Biden repeatedly has said I understand why you're angry and afraid of vaxx -- of unvaccinated people. He said, we have to protect vaccinated workers from the unvaccinated but then went on to say how effective the vaccines were. People who are unvaccinated get -- can get COVID from the vaccinated. And there is no evidence that people are dying who are vaccinated because they were in contact with unvaccinated. This is got to end and there's got to be a lot more discussion just like this around the country."

This is someone who I think kind of universally has been decried over the last few months with what went on with Jeopardy, not showing up to camp. All of these things. And I'm not an Aaron Rodgers fan on a personal level I don't particularly enjoy him. But the lie is the problem here and when you do that, and then you continue to behave with the media as if you are vaccinated, you are endangering other people's lives.

You got Manchin, who is a squish when it comes to the Democrats. I think the progressives should hold the line. And by the way, Nancy Pelosi and the leadership should stop doing press conferences. They keep saying that they have reached an agreement. They have not reached an agreement. They have lost voter turnout. Part of that and we talked about this before we got on. The progressives being on this is that, they didn't lose this election. That the turnout was so low is because they didn't deliver on what they said they were going to deliver for the American people, and quite frankly I agree with him.

Because there are a lot of moderate Democrats that are worried about their midterm fate because of what they saw in Virginia, that New Jersey was obviously closer than it should've been even though Phil Murphy pulled off an incredible feat.

Let me just point this. What she said was totally disingenuous. The United States broke OPEC, broke the cartel. We became a net exporter of oil and oil products under President Trump. We became the world's swing producer. That means that we control the global price of oil because we had so much spare production capacity. So, she's talking about OPEC can change their price.

It's not going to turn into a situation where over 50 percent of Black voters in America are suddenly Republicans. But margins are thin in every election basically. And losing one or two percentage points makes a difference. And we've seen a realignment of traditional voting lines where race is far less of an issue than income and educational status. I mean, that's what happened in New Jersey. I mean, look, as you went down the shore, right, what happened. You have a guy who spent $153.00 or $5,000 -- I don't know what it was in the end on a campaign to unseat one of the most powerful Democrats."
