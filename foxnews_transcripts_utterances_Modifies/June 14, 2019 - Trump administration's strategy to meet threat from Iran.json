HASSAN ROUHANI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT, (through translator): The U.S. government has been violating all the international structures and regulations during the previous two years.

I think Donald Trump is telling the truth when he says Iran did it. The administration believes Iran did it. One of the things that's remarkable to me is how quickly critics of the administration are starting to float conspiracy theories that it wasn't Iran, that this is a Gulf of Tonkin situation or something like that. And so you could see how this could have cascading effects politically here as well.   I think that Iran is basically trying to send the message that if you mess with them too much, they can basically ruin the world's oil supply through the Straits of Hormuz.

Jonathan, it seems like the politics of all of this is coming front and center. JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Yes. I have had a conversation about six weeks ago with senior national security officials in the Trump administration, and they predicted something like this, not exactly this. But they were very aware, and I reported this at the time, that President Trump's maximum pressure strategy of inflicting as much economic pain at possible on Iran could cause them to do desperate things. As the official said to me, desperate nations do desperate things.   And you just have to look at the last 18 months. The Iranian economy has plummeted. Their currency has plummeted. Inflation is soaring to a point where the Iranian regime has stopped actually releasing their inflation data. So this is a desperate regime. And we could be getting very close to a point where we have conflict. The Trump administration has already said that they want to send more ground troops to the region. They sent a carrier in there. So this is very serious and in many ways could get worse.",

And I think that, obviously, Iran is very desperate. They are also the reports that Jennifer Griffin reported tonight that Iran has tried to shoot down U.S. military drones over the last couple of weeks. There's a lot of evidence of this.  The big thing, though, I think that is important to remember is the United States is in a very different position today than we were 10 years ago or 20 years ago in terms of independence from Middle East oil. And the fact that you had two tankers attacked there off of Iran and the markets didn't totally collapse, obviously, the price of oil went up a little bit but not that much. The United States is now a net exporter of oil. It puts us in a much, much stronger position to sort of deal with Iran in a much broader variety of ways.
