Basically, setting up this accusation that President Trump was seeking political help in his domestic political race from a foreign source and a quid pro quo set that up. Last reason they think is this is not a deep throat situation like the famous Watergate source. It's not that is if the whistleblower had an agreement with the press, whereby, he would remain anonymous. The press is not committed to that.  And also, if you look at the law involved which is called the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.

The second disconnect is that in both those cases, we have a special counsel's report. Leon Jaworski wrote a damning report. Independent counsel Richard Nixon and Ken Starr wrote a damning report of Bill Clinton.  We have the Robert Mueller investigation, 22 months and $35 million worth of investment and he did not write a damning report. He essentially exonerated him on the charge of collusion with Russia, and he said there was no indictable material or evidence that he could bring him up on obstruction.

Biden just unveiled a new $4 million ad by here in Iowa, the Scranton values campaign.

And in that spirit, I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.\"  Also worth keeping an eye on tonight, Elizabeth Warren. Biden and Warren attack each other throughout the day over Warren's do $52 trillion Medicare for all plans she revealed. In a statement, Biden's campaign said Warren's plan \"hinges on a giant middle-class tax height and the elimination of all private health insurance.\" Warren swung back saying the majority of her Medicare plan was approved by Obama's experts. Tulsi Gabbard did not qualify for tonight's event because she did not have the required two campaign offices here in Iowa. And Kamala Harris' campaign has indicated that they are now putting all of their efforts into the state of Iowa even closing offices in New Hampshire. Martha?",

And so I went to the county with the highest percentage of Trump voters in the country, which is in the panhandle of Texas. And I figured I would teach them a lot and they would teach me something that I could probably stitch on a doily and put in my kitchen. But instead, the people, they were very different than I imagined and you know, all white, all Christian.  And when I talked to them about whether they felt discriminated against more than black people in our country, they all said yes. And it took me almost a full week to understand what they meant, which is that there's been a lot of change that's happened that I haven't really noticed this change. Whether it's gay marriage, or transsexual rights, or the MeToo Movement, or just the knowledge economy, like there's been massive, massive changes in this country, demographically and otherwise. And they feel like they have less power than they used to, because they do. And it's all changing very quickly and no one is addressing that.

And a majority, 51 percent said Democrats are mainly concerned with hurting the president. By the way, they also believe that Republicans are mainly concerned with helping the president.

      "utterance": "And maybe behind a screen or he'd have his voice you know altered or something like that so we could remain silent. Look, Republicans do believe that they need to talk to the whistleblower, and there are few reasons. They -- one, they just believe the public has a right to know who helped start this whole big thing and how it got started the other thing is the whistleblower in his complaint really set the narrative that we've all been operating within for the last several weeks. Basically, setting up this accusation that President Trump was seeking political help in his domestic political race from a foreign source and a quid pro quo set that up. Last reason they think is this is not a deep throat situation like the famous Watergate source. It's not that is if the whistleblower had an agreement with the press, whereby, he would remain anonymous. The press is not committed to that. And also, if you look at the law involved which is called the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. It only says the only person who can't reveal the name is the intelligence community inspector general. And even he can do it if he feels that it would be impractical to conceal the name in the course of events."

He apparently said that the lawyers told him not to discuss the call that they were upset that he was upset about it.

It could have been put into the separate server to hide it from other people or maybe to protect it. What we do know is that when it became a public controversy, the president released this rough transcript of that, which is really unprecedented. Usually, these head of state phone calls are confidential and they're not just released as transcripts. So, when it became a big deal, the president just released it. He wasn't under subpoena to release it, he wasn't facing a court order to release it, he just made it public."

One of the things that Nancy Pelosi says pretty much every time she speaks about this issue is she quotes Benjamin Franklin as he came out of Constitution Hall. And she talks about the beginnings of our country -- of the constitution of our country, and that the people requested, you know, what kind of government do we have? Is it -- is it a monarchy or is it a republic? And he says it's a republic if we can keep it. And I would like to ask you, you know, sort of both sides I think have different perspectives about what we're watching unfold here.

But in the case of Donald Trump, in a -- in just about a year, the people can weigh in. They can get him out of office if they feel he's guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. The second disconnect is that in both those cases, we have a special counsel's report. Leon Jaworski wrote a damning report. Independent counsel Richard Nixon and Ken Starr wrote a damning report of Bill Clinton. We have the Robert Mueller investigation, 22 months and $35 million worth of investment and he did not write a damning report. He essentially exonerated him on the charge of collusion with Russia, and he said there was no indictable material or evidence that he could bring him up on obstruction. It would be very hard to obstruct a crime that didn't exist.

Because that behavior when he was vice president may have affected the 2016 election, which he may have had an interest in. So, just because you're running for a candidate, you can't say, well, this is personal directed against me because I'm a candidate now for behavior that took place two years passed. And then, we're also dealing with a thought crime. Again, it's analogous to the Mueller. Donald Trump may or may not have delayed Ukrainian aid, but he didn't cancel it.

So tonight, all the Democratic Front runners are going to be here given ten minutes to speak on stage with no notecard. And with just 93 days until the Iowa caucus, it's events like tonight that candidates are looking to make their breakout moment. That includes Vice President Joe Biden, who remains the party's front runner but as of late is perhaps showing signs of weakness here in Iowa, the nation's first caucus. Biden just unveiled a new $4 million ad by here in Iowa, the Scranton values campaign. It highlights Biden's blue-collar family values he claimed or instilled in him growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The new ads are a clear attempt to appeal to the working class, especially here in crucial Iowa. Of course, a big story tonight. Beto O'Rourke dropping out of the race. In a tweet a short while ago from his account, \"Our campaign has always been about see clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. And in that spirit, I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.\" Also worth keeping an eye on tonight, Elizabeth Warren. Biden and Warren attack each other throughout the day over Warren's do $52 trillion Medicare for all plans she revealed. In a statement, Biden's campaign said Warren's plan \"hinges on a giant middle-class tax height and the elimination of all private health insurance.\" Warren swung back saying the majority of her Medicare plan was approved by Obama's experts. Tulsi Gabbard did not qualify for tonight's event because she did not have the required two campaign offices here in Iowa.

And so I live in a very, very blue part of California, a part of Los Angeles where there are no Republicans as far as the eye can see. And so I went to the county with the highest percentage of Trump voters in the country, which is in the panhandle of Texas. And I figured I would teach them a lot and they would teach me something that I could probably stitch on a doily and put in my kitchen. But instead, the people, they were very different than I imagined and you know, all white, all Christian. And when I talked to them about whether they felt discriminated against more than black people in our country, they all said yes. And it took me almost a full week to understand what they meant, which is that there's been a lot of change that's happened that I haven't really noticed this change. Whether it's gay marriage, or transsexual rights, or the MeToo Movement, or just the knowledge economy, like there's been massive, massive changes in this country, demographically and otherwise. And they feel like they have less power than they used to, because they do. And it's all changing very quickly and no one is addressing that.

And I realized they had this sort of amazing community where they all hang out all the time. And to my shock, there's this mimeograph copy that they give all the people in church. And on the back page is people to pray for. Number one is the president, number two is the troops, and then it's a rotating group of people who are sick or having troubles. And what I found out is for the last two years, I'm on that list every day. The people in this town pray for me every week that I will -- I will -- because I'm Jewish.

And the way they spoke about it was if you had a cockroach infestation, and the exterminator came over and was crude, and he was showing his butt crack, but he got the job done, you'd put up with him. So they see this as an existential crisis and it took me a week to kind of understand that. And part of the existential crisis is that people like me won't listen to them and won't acknowledge that.

There was all this talk about how Melania Trump was not actually going to move to Washington, D.C.

The Labor Department reporting 128,000 jobs were added in October, that's a big number. Bigger than expectations. That put the unemployment rate at a near 50-year low.

I was talking to some folks about that to some folks about that today. But the bottom line is, you look at the stock market right now with the Dow over 27,000, the S&P over 3,000. And we are hitting new records every day. You had a Fed that just cut interest rates. This economy is booming. And that's basically the platform he's running on. He wants people to care about it.

But I think at this point it's just dangerous for men to act like men, not that the men who go overboard and disrespect the woman are acting like man. You know what I mean.\" She says to the publication. And here's an example. This is Jimmy Garoppolo, quarterback of the 49ers talking and doing a quick interview with Erin Andrews on the sideline.
