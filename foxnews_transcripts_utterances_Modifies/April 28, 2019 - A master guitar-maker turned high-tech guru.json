First annex is the entire JCPOA, which President Trump decided to withdraw from. I don't think that would put Iran in the bad light and the United States in the good category of law abiding. Secondly, 2231's language on missiles is very clear. It says that Iran will not develop missiles that are designed to be capable of carrying nuclear weapons. We do not design any of our missiles."

The United States came to our region, spends $7 trillion, and the only outcome of that was that we have more terror, we have more insecurity, we have more instability.

President Trump, just because he disliked President Obama just left that agreement without having read it. And people of Iran started to feel and started to see that engagement does not have dividends. That's a very bad message not only that you are sending to the people of Iran, but you're sending to the rest of the world. That they should not rely on the signature of the president of the United States. So, it's just the message that the United States is not reliable. Maybe he believes in America first, but America cannot be first in a globally insecure environment.

Hillary Clinton, that well-known right- wing Republican. Look, the fact is that the Iranian regime continues to oppress its own people. It continues to be the world's largest financer of international terrorism. It continues to pursue ballistic missiles. The only real purpose of which is to deliver nuclear weapons when they get that capability. There's no doubt this regime is a threat in the region and globally. And that's why we think the pressure campaign has had a significant impact on their ability to carry these tasks out. If they want to get together and speak with the president, he said almost exactly a year ago when French President Emmanuel Macron came to Washington and he told him we were going to get out of the Iran nuclear deal that he wanted to see our negotiation over all of these things. The nuclear program, the ballistic missile program, the support for terrorism and Iran's other malign behavior. When they're ready to talk, the president would be ready to talk."

He says that China and Turkey are saying that they're going to continue to buy oil from Iran."

I think it's been clear for a year now from the time President Trump announced he was getting out of the Iran deal, that we were going to return to sanctions and impose pressure on the regime there, and it's had a very significant effect. And by Iran's own estimates, the end of these waivers will have an even more significant effect. I'm touched that Zarif is worried that our allies are sometimes impatient with us on this point, but as I say, we've made clear -- our objective is the elimination of Iran's nuclear program, making sure it's ballistic missile program is under control. Europe is the region most threatened right now by Iran's ballistic missile capabilities. So, we have worked for the past year that I've been in the administration very closely with all of our European allies.

Putin also suggested a return to multilateral six party talks, which is what the U.S. has been engaged in with North Korea, South Korea, China, other countries in the region in the past.

He said repeatedly he thinks he has a good relationship with Kim Jong-un. And the six-party approach failed in the past. That doesn't mean we don't consult, as the president just did on Friday very closely with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. We consult with the Russians, the Chinese, obviously the South Koreans. President Moon Jae-in was here just a few weeks ago. So, it's not like they are excluded but I think it's not just what our preference is. I think Kim Jong-un, at least up until now, has wanted the one-on-one contact with the United States, which is what he has gotten."

I think they've been pretty good about it in recent months but I think they could always tighten up. That would help keep the pressure on North Korea, which after all is what brought them to negotiate with President Trump to begin with. But I think President Putin would love to see the possibility of a rail link between Russia and South Korea. Not North Korea, there's not much trade there, but I think he sees advantages and I have no doubt he is pursuing them. I think that's very typical of Putin. He knows exactly what rush's interests are and he goes after them."

On the other hand, you know, it was a good announcement. We had the -- the -- the video. We now do this all by video. We all do this now by e-mail. The surprise was that he had access to the Obama fundraising list. And even though it is now ancient in Internet times, it's going on six years old, he raised a bundle of money, which was one of the questions, see he the old fashioned bundler, you know, getting checks, $2,800? Is he going to be able to compete in an -- in an age in which you get $40 and $50 contributions over the Internet. And -- and that -- that played out. Having said that, the polls say that he leads the Democratic primary, but \"The Washington Post\"/ABC poll had an interesting thing. They said, name a candidate you could before for, for the Democratic nomination for president, and 54 percent couldn't come up with a name, which means this thing is wide open.

And I think from -- from Biden's perspective, this type -- kind of takes him above the fray with other Democrats, the kind of, you know, intramural elbow throwing and says, you know what, let's focus on what really matters here, the general election, and I'm the guy that can beat Donald Trump.

There are -- there are opportunities and jobs and job growth. I mean the economy really is the strong point for Donald Trump. You can do the tweets and all this other noise that are out there, but when people feel good at home, they're going to stick with the person who has the White House. And when -- when -- when Biden can't even get somebody to come, you know, to a rally and Donald Trump is there in Wisconsin with tens of thousands of people --"

Economic anxiety among the middle class on housing issues, student loans, health care is tremendous. So even as we talk about the economy booming for the very wealthy in this country, the economic anxiety is opening the door to Elizabeth Warren saying, here's how we deal with burdening -- the burden of student loan debt."

There are going to be investigations conducted by Judiciary, by Intelligence, by Oversight, by Financial Services. We can watch all of those Democrat chairman obscure any chance of the Democrats having a positive message coming out of the House for 2020., and he's going to get drawn into that. But -- but let's go back to the economy. The president's doing well on the economy. And not only is he doing well on the economy, but in the new \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll, six out of every ten independent say, I'm done with a whole impeachment thing. So he's got a chance to use the economy to grab those people who look -- those independents who looked at the Mueller report and concluded the president -- no collusion and -- and -- and -- and -- and no -- no effort, no obstruction, and let's go -- let's go pay attention to things that matter to my family and my community."

And there's a difference, because if he comes in involuntarily, he can have counsel with him.

Look, the president's going to win some of these issues, he's going to lose some of these issues. He's going to win it when they have, as Jason pointed out, overreach by trying to get people in the White House staff. But this is all going to be litigated out. And the belief that the president is doing something unconstitutional or antidemocratic by saying no, no, no, I'm not going to respond to these and agree to do all of these, he's got a right to object and let's resolve this in the courts. Let's lower the temperature. The president is not doing anything unconstitutional. The Congress is not doing anything unconstitutional.
