But what about this and the moves that the administration is potentially making?  Let's bring in our panel, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\"   Mollie, let me start with you, and this potential travel restriction that the administration is considering. This is how \"The Washington Post\" writes it, \"It's part of enhanced winter COVID strategy. Biden is expected to announce Thursday U.S. officials would require everyone entering the country to test one day before boarding flights regardless of their vaccination status or country of departure. Administration officials are also considering a requirement that all travelers get retested within three to five days of arrival. In addition, they are debating a controversial proposal to require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to self- quarantine for seven days even if their test results are negative.\" That's pretty restrictive. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": This would have been unthinkable that anybody would assert that they have this type of power to restrict Americans' freedom of movement, particularly when, as you noted, it would apply even to people who have tested negative for COVID, and even people who are vaccinated. That makes no sense at all. We are constantly told that politicians are making decisions based on the science, and, yet it really seems they are making really gross political decisions that restrict civil liberties that have no relationship to the science. We don't know that much about the Omicron variant other than it's silly we are calling it that out of deference to Xi in China. But we don't know --",

First of all, I think that officials have been pretty good this time of saying what they don't know, saying we need a week or two to see if the vaccines work against this, to learn more about this new variant.   I would be shocked if they picked that last possibility of making everyone quarantine for seven days coming back to the country vaccinated or not. But I do think that a more robust testing regime -- I left the country several times during the pandemic, and I always had to get a test before I boarded the plane to come back. And actually the countries that are gotten ahold of COVID much more than we have, like South Korea where I think there have been something like 3,500 deaths, are countries that do a mass testing regimen. That is really the key. So there probably should be more tests. Asking everyone to stay home for seven days seems extremely unlikely.",

You are telling me someone gets fully vaccinated and boosted, and they're a U.S. citizen, and they want to come back to the United States, they have to test before they get on the plane, then a few days again later. And even with all three shots and two negative test, they also have to be at home for seven days quarantining? It feels like we are going backwards. We are in a post vaccine era right now. It doesn't feel that way, and there is not a good reason why. And I think that's the most frustrating part to so many people.
