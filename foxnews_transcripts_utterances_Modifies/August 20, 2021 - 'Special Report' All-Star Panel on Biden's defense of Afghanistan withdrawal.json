STEVE HAYES, EDITOR, \"THE DISPATCH\": Yes, Bret. This is alarming. We have heard from President Biden this past week say a number of things that are provably, demonstrably untrue. We can show them. As you pointed out earlier, his claim that Al-Qaeda is gone from Afghanistan is an astonishing thing for the president of the United States to say, and I assure you that he is not using intelligence reports provided by the intelligence agencies to come to that conclusion. In fact, there are indications that not only is Al-Qaeda continuing its presence on the ground in Afghanistan, but it's likely to grow. We saw with the prison releases, the Taliban prison releases, many Al-Qaeda fighters being part of those. You have seen history of Al-Qaeda leaders being killed in Afghanistan in recent months. And if you listen to the jihadist message boards and posts on social media, it sounds like they understand that Afghanistan is likely to be an even friendlier safe haven than it has been now with the Taliban in control. So he is vastly understating the operational risks here in addition to all of the assessments that he has -- mis-assessments that he has made over the week. I think the most alarming thing from my perspective is that Joe Biden looks at what's happened over the past week and says validation of his strategy. That is just so at odds with reality and what everybody else is seeing it. It does make you question his fitness to continue to make these judgments.",

I think that he is sticking to his principles, and I think the good news there is, of course, that for all the back and forth, I think this week we have seen 13,000 people evacuated. The White House says 18,000 since the end of last month. So that's pretty good. But on the ground, you get these inconsistencies, different points of view.   But, to me, that's not the big point. To me the big point is after 20 years, after four presidents that were afraid of this kind of political static for saying we need to end this war, after that period, we finally this week ended the war in Afghanistan. To me, this is an incredible moment for America. We stopped the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist prime spot for 20 years.",

Is the forever war just going to come back in a different framework now with the Taliban, with billions of dollars of U.S. military equipment, Marc? And, you can say it was right to pull out all the troops. The Trump administration wanted to do that, too. But how you do it, and this particular moment in this week, seems like a real political loss, and potentially a loss of a lot of life. Marc. MARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, we didn't end the war. The enemy gets to vote. And you just have to go back and look at what happened in 2011 when Joe Biden presided over the disastrous withdrawal from Iraq. There were at that time according to John Brennan, the CIA director, only 700 ISIS terrorists left in the country, and they built a calibrate the size of Great Britain, and they spread their tentacles around the world and carried out 149 attacks in 20 countries that killed more than 2,000 people. Remember Charlie Hebdo, the Bataclan nightclub, the blowing up of the Brussels airport. They carried out attacks all across the world.  And Joe Biden says we have this over the horizon capability? First of all, we don't have any intelligence on the ground anymore. We don't have any Afghans who are going to tell us where the terrorists are. And even if we did, it's a landlocked country. Every other country he named has coastline. There is no coastline in Afghanistan. The only way to get to Afghanistan is over Pakistan or over Iran. So we are basically back where we were on 9/11 where our only option was to fire $2 million missile, as George Bush said, into a $10 tent and hit a camel in the butt. We have got no capability to knock down this threat when it rises up again.",
