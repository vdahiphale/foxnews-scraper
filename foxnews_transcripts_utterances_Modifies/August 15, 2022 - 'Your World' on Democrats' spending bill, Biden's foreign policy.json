After that, the administration is planning a cross- country victory tour. Democrats insisting that this bill will help bring prices down.

We have just learned President Biden is going to take a break from his vacation to return to the White House tomorrow and sign that massive tax, health care and climate bill. There will also be a big celebration at the White House on September 6, and then there will be a huge nationwide victory tour.  We got a copy of a memo that some White House officials circulated. They write: \"Between Sunday and the end of August, Cabinet members will travel to 23 states on over 35 trips touting the Inflation Reduction Act and the administration's accomplishments.\" Some of that travel, Biden will take part in. Polls show inflation is still voters' top concern. And the White House named this bill the Inflation Reduction Act to try to show he's doing something about it, even though experts agree it's not going to impact overall inflation for at least a year or more.  Cabinet officials have been making the case that this bill will immediately help, because people can spend money on things like solar panels and electric heat pumps in order to save money on their taxes. But Biden has been quick to point out in the past when inflation was getting worse that he has very little control over things like energy costs, a major driver of inflation, because of Russia's war in Ukraine impacting the global oil supply.   And Biden's Strategic Oil Reserve sales are set to end in October. There's also this new round of European sanctions set to take effect in December that will also drive prices up. Still, the White House has been using this recent dip in gas prices to claim that the economy is heading in the right direction and make the case that it is a good time to spend billions on this bill.",

But it's important to understand the price of gas is primarily based on the worldwide market's price of oil, which is just another example of why it's so dangerous in America relies on oil, on oil-rich countries.

And take a look at this video we shot this morning. It has been raining and storming all day long, and it hasn't slowed anything down. This was a group of 200 that crossed this morning in that wind, in that rain. Doesn't matter. Predominantly all adults, a lot of adult men, predominantly from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, which is typically what we have been seeing out here in Eagle Pass. But take a look at what we saw yesterday. Look at this drone video. Believe it or not, we saw more than 500 people cross in a one-hour span. That includes this group of 300 that you're looking at, once again, almost all of them, adults, single adults. They're coming from all over the world, Central and South America, some from Asian countries, some from African countries as well. You will see many of them are dressed very well and they have got their smartphones with them as they wait for Border Patrol. You will see some of them even almost got onto a local highway walking out to that road before they were stopped by Texas DPS troopers. Then take a look at the third piece of video here. These were two other groups we saw yesterday as well totaling more than 200 migrants, once again predominantly single adults. We are no longer seeing a bunch of little kids or those family units like we saw last summer. There have now been 401,000 illegal crossings just here in the Del Rio Sector since October 1. Elsewhere along the border -- Charles, you mentioned this off the top -- take a look at these photos. This is in Yuma, Arizona, where Governor Doug Ducey there just announced that Arizona is starting to stack up shipping containers to fill gaps in the federal border wall out there. They're taking two of these shipping containers, stacking them up.And they're putting concertina wire, razor wire, on the top of the shipping containers. He just announced they were doing this with an executive order on Friday, saying: \"The Biden administration has shown a dereliction of duty to secure the border. Arizona cannot wait any longer.\" So they're starting to fill gaps in the Yuma border wall by taking that strategy you see right there. And back out here live, that means we now have the state of Texas building its own state-funded border wall, and we now have the state of Arizona using state-owned shipping containers to plug gaps in the federal border wall. Both states have now said the Biden administration has shown no interest in securing the Southern border, so they got to do it themselves - - we will send it back to you.",

But Biden has been quick to point out in the past when inflation was getting worse that he has very little control over things like energy costs, a major driver of inflation, because of Russia's war in Ukraine impacting the global oil supply. And Biden's Strategic Oil Reserve sales are set to end in October. There's also this new round of European sanctions set to take effect in December that will also drive prices up.

But it's important to understand the price of gas is primarily based on the worldwide market's price of oil, which is just another example of why it's so dangerous in America relies on oil, on oil-rich countries.

The Justice Department is going to have to put into effect what's known as a taint team or a filter team. The idea here is that you don't want prosecutors who might be involved in prosecuting a case looking at attorney-client privileged documents, so the Justice Department is going to have to create an entirely separate team of lawyers to review the documents they seize from Mar-a-Lago before we can move ahead with this."

The whole purpose, the whole idea of the Fourth Amendment and the warrant requirement is to prevent federal agents from going in your house and seizing anything within their sight, anything they can get their hands on, basically boxing up all of your personal possessions and taking them away. That's why the judge says, OK, you can go into Mar-a-Lago, but you have to confine yourself to searching for these particular documents or these particular categories of evidence. And what we're hearing with every day is that this search seems to have been broader and broader and broader than we first anticipated."

      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "Well, ultimately, any of these disputes could go before a judge. If the Justice Department and the Trump lawyers are tussling over whether particular documents are protected, that ultimately may get elevated to a federal judge, who has to make the call. I'm hopeful it won't get to that point. I mean, I'm hopeful that if this DOJ taint team comes in, they do a fair, honest, independent assessment, and if there are in fact privileged documents that they took out of Mar-a-Lago, they have no business reviewing. Those needs to go back to the president. So I'm hopeful that the ordinary process will work.

This is despicable.\" Now, Rushdie has lived under the weight of death threats from Iran's regime since he published the book \"The Satanic Verses\" in 1988, which some Muslims consider blasphemous.

      "utterance": "Yes, Charles, good afternoon to you. The activity here really shot through the roof over the weekend. Just in the last 24 hours alone, we have had more than 2,000 illegal crossings in the Del Rio Sector here. That's one single sector in one day on the Southern border. And take a look at this video we shot this morning. It has been raining and storming all day long, and it hasn't slowed anything down. This was a group of 200 that crossed this morning in that wind, in that rain. Doesn't matter. Predominantly all adults, a lot of adult men, predominantly from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, which is typically what we have been seeing out here in Eagle Pass. But take a look at what we saw yesterday. Look at this drone video. Believe it or not, we saw more than 500 people cross in a one-hour span. That includes this group of 300 that you're looking at, once again, almost all of them, adults, single adults. They're coming from all over the world, Central and South America, some from Asian countries, some from African countries as well. You will see many of them are dressed very well and they have got their smartphones with them as they wait for Border Patrol. You will see some of them even almost got onto a local highway walking out to that road before they were stopped by Texas DPS troopers. Then take a look at the third piece of video here. These were two other groups we saw yesterday as well totaling more than 200 migrants, once again predominantly single adults. We are no longer seeing a bunch of little kids or those family units like we saw last summer. There have now been 401,000 illegal crossings just here in the Del Rio Sector since October 1. Elsewhere along the border -- Charles, you mentioned this off the top -- take a look at these photos. This is in Yuma, Arizona, where Governor Doug Ducey there just announced that Arizona is starting to stack up shipping containers to fill gaps in the federal border wall out there."

      "utterance": "\"The Biden administration has shown a dereliction of duty to secure the border. Arizona cannot wait any longer.\" So they're starting to fill gaps in the Yuma border wall by taking that strategy you see right there. And back out here live, that means we now have the state of Texas building its own state-funded border wall, and we now have the state of Arizona using state-owned shipping containers to plug gaps in the federal border wall. Both states have now said the Biden administration has shown no interest in securing the Southern border, so they got to do it themselves - - we will send it back to you."

Now, again, we saw an official in the mayor's office here in New York City greet these migrants and say again that they're arriving sick, hungry, tired, thirsty.

And what I find interesting about the pushback we have seen, whether it's the mayor of Washington, D.C., and certainly the mayor of New York City, is that they champion for people to come into our country illegally. But as soon as they step into their city or towns, it's the end of the world. I mean, they see now firsthand that this is a tough situation for everyone involved, isn't it?"

The fact is, we do need or require a national coordinated response that better addresses the flow of migrants while their claims of protection are pending. Unfortunately, our broken immigration system is really what is at full display here for the rest of the world to bear witness that the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, lacks the political will to address immigration reform. And, instead, what do we have? Democrats and Republicans engaging in asinine political mudslinging. And what we really need is a comprehensive immigration reform to address these issues. Keep in mind, we have been dealing with this for decades, and it's not going to end."

Now, we have to -- if we're going to allow these individuals to be in our country, which, again, that's a different topic altogether, depending on which political area you're coming from. But at this point is, we need a response. Either incentivize states, incentivize municipalities. We need to address their needs. At the end of the day, how are they going to feed for themselves? How are they going to fend for themselves? We cannot allow -- because, again, we have extremes. We cannot do catch and release. But, again, there are legitimate concerns for national security, or we cannot have family separations at the border."
