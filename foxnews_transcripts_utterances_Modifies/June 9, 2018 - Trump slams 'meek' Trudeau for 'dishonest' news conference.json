      "sentences": "Breaking tonight, President Trump just hours away from landing in Singapore for his historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thank you again for making \"Justice\" number one again last week.  The summit that could change the course of history is just days away. Tonight, we are talking about it with White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, Congressman Darrell Issa and Governor Mike Huckabee and more.  But first, my opening statement. As our President is primed to do what no other president has ever come close to doing in the history of this country with North Korea, there are many in the mainstream media cable news networks and left-wing liberals who are rooting for him to fail.  When it comes to Donald Trump, hate is their daily fare. They hate him so much, they want him to fail. Peace be damned. The success doesn't matter nor does whether they benefit from it. If he doesn't get credit for being one of the smartest, most clever and successful negotiator Presidents of all time, then we will know for sure what it's about and who they are. They are not just haters, and this is about more than just politics. They are rooting for America's failure, and that is un-American. Take a look at how they reacted a few weeks ago when the President sent a letter to North Korean dictator canceling the proposed June 12 Summit in Singapore.  CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, \"HARDBALL\": We are trapped in a one-man national security policy from hell. He blind sides his allies, he doesn't consult with Congress. As far as we know, he didn't consult with his own National Security Council. He dictates this bizarre actually, embarrassing letter.  RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\": It has always been a little hard to believe that Donald Trump was going to become the first US President ever to meet a dictator of North Korea. The effort to bring that meeting about has been chaotic and disorganized and sometimes, nonsensical from the start.   LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, HOST, \"THE LAST WORD\": Big surprise, the impossible dream turned out to be an impossible dream. President Trump canceled the June 12th Summit meeting with North Korea because according to NBC News, he was afraid that North Koreans would cancel the summit, so he wanted to beat them to it.",

      "sentences": "Beat them to it. Really? We finally have a president who has the chutzpah to tell this dictator to buzz off, no pun on his haircut. We get three American hostages back, the president hasn't lifted any sanctions, and is prepared to impose new debilitating economic sanctions pending the outcome of the summit.   Compare this to our last failure of a president who sent love letters to the Ayatollah begging Iran to come back, and then paid them off with tons of cash and euros on palettes in unmarked planes. And how does dictator Kim Jong-un react to the strength the president showed by pulling out of the summit? It he crawls back in front of the world and asks for the summit to be back on. Our President sis on schedule to forge a relationship with North Korea in Singapore that will cause Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons. The ones that have been building up ever since the Bill Clinton days when he wanted to give Kim Jong-un wads of cash, and as he beat chest parading around ICBMS when Obama was president, we did nothing -- well, nothing that mattered anyway.  The Dems have been crying about nukes forever and as this President openly negotiates for the safety and security of this nation, and enhances our military strength, destroys ISIS, they still complain. They literally don't want to see him fix this.   Take a look at this from The Economist. The headline, this is the cover, \"America's Foreign Policy, the wrecking ball the president is swinging on is the planet earth, and Senator Chuck Schumer tweets this, \"With ICBMS and nuclear warheads in the hands of North Korea, this situation is far too dangerous for seat of the pants negotiating.\" You know, Chuck, not for nothing, but it was party that screwed this up to begin with. You have no idea how much advanced work has been done. You're too busy criticizing the President or crying about people you don't even care or know.  You simply can't comprehend the genius of Donald Trump, unless of course, you were looking for a campaign contribution, but that was back then. You can't comprehend Mike Pompeo. Our President has no fear. And according to Prime Minister Abe of Japan who said it best, \"A major step forward is about to be taken. President Trump, you are about to make a new history, not only Japan, but the whole international community is strongly looking forward for the United States-North Korea Summit to open doors toward peace and stability of the Northeast Asia.\"  There was a time when liberals were known as people who are all inclusive, they were generous souls fighting for the common man to assure his success and safety, but now they are not interested in success. No, they are are just angry. In fact, they are furious.  We have a President who steamrolls the economy to historic heights. Consumer confidence at an 18-year high. A stock market hitting record highs. Tax cuts for everyone. And unemployment is not just down, there are actually more jobs than there are people to fill them. Did you hear what I just said? More jobs available than there are people to fill them. African-American unemployment is at its lowest in the history of this country. And then the same with Hispanics. Our businesses will be able to compete again as we get our mojo back on the world stage.  Take a look agent these pictures from the G-7. Our President is in middle of every photo. The man is center stage. World leaders are all over him. The questions are to him. He is dominating the G-7. America is back, folks. The truth, however, is a far cry from what stumbling Nancy said just a few weeks ago.",

You can't begin to comprehend the success and the benefits we will reap from the meeting that we have been waiting a lifetime for.  There was a time when America celebrated successes together. When we came out with our kids on the streets and parades, waving our flags and teaching our children the importance of patriotism. Donald Trump is bringing America back in front our eyes. And it's time for the un-American haters to get on board. And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine.   And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and all of the developing news tonight, deputy press secretary in the White House, Hogan Gidley. All right, Hogan, before we get to the North Korea summit. President Trump doing what he does best, causing a bit of disruption tonight with this tweet. It was sent after he left the G-7 Summit about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The president saying, \"Prime Minister Justice Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our G-7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that US tariffs were kind of insulting and that he will not be pushed around. Very dishonest and weak. Our tariffs are in response to his 270% on dairy.\"  Trudeau then responded saying, \"Canada won't be pushed around.\"  Hogan, what's going on here? HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY IN THE White House: Obviously, I am in Washington, DC tonight, Judge. Thanks for having me on. I am not at the G-7. I wasn't in the meeting. But what do I know about this President is he's the same behind closed doors as he is out in front of the cameras talking to the American people. And what he did in those meetings, I have talked to Larry Kudlow already this evening. He gave me a brief coming out of the summit, and he said, \"Listen, the president was on fire in those meetings. He was tough. He was honest. He told the world community we were not going to be the world's piggy bank anymore. We weren't going to be taken advantage of anymore and that it was time to open up trade. It was time to be free. It was time to be fair.\" That is what the president was behind the scenes and now, you see when he comes out, he says the same thing in public.   This is where this president is because he wants to defend the American worker. They have been taking it in the teeth for decades. We are in this position now because of bureaucrats and beltway politicians who have allowed us to get here and he is going to fix it.",

And instead, they would rather attack this president as opposed to the policy, him fixing the things that have made this country now back in the positive, in the red on the economy.

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight, President Trump just hours away from landing in Singapore for his historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thank you again for making \"Justice\" number one again last week. The summit that could change the course of history is just days away. Tonight, we are talking about it with White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley, Congressman Darrell Issa and Governor Mike Huckabee and more. But first, my opening statement. As our President is primed to do what no other president has ever come close to doing in the history of this country with North Korea, there are many in the mainstream media cable news networks and left-wing liberals who are rooting for him to fail. When it comes to Donald Trump, hate is their daily fare. They hate him so much, they want him to fail. Peace be damned. The success doesn't matter nor does whether they benefit from it. If he doesn't get credit for being one of the smartest, most clever and successful negotiator Presidents of all time, then we will know for sure what it's about and who they are. They are not just haters, and this is about more than just politics. They are rooting for America's failure, and that is un-American. Take a look at how they reacted a few weeks ago when the President sent a letter to North Korean dictator canceling the proposed June 12 Summit in Singapore. CHRIS MATTHEWS, HOST, \"HARDBALL\": We are trapped in a one-man national security policy from hell. He blind sides his allies, he doesn't consult with Congress. As far as we know, he didn't consult with his own National Security Council. He dictates this bizarre actually, embarrassing letter. RACHEL MADDOW, HOST, \"THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\": It has always been a little hard to believe that Donald Trump was going to become the first US President ever to meet a dictator of North Korea. The effort to bring that meeting about has been chaotic and disorganized and sometimes, nonsensical from the start. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, HOST, \"THE LAST WORD\": Big surprise, the impossible dream turned out to be an impossible dream. President Trump canceled the June 12th Summit meeting with North Korea because according to NBC News, he was afraid that North Koreans would cancel the summit, so he wanted to beat them to it."

We get three American hostages back, the president hasn't lifted any sanctions, and is prepared to impose new debilitating economic sanctions pending the outcome of the summit. Compare this to our last failure of a president who sent love letters to the Ayatollah begging Iran to come back, and then paid them off with tons of cash and euros on palettes in unmarked planes. And how does dictator Kim Jong-un react to the strength the president showed by pulling out of the summit? It he crawls back in front of the world and asks for the summit to be back on. Our President sis on schedule to forge a relationship with North Korea in Singapore that will cause Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons. The ones that have been building up ever since the Bill Clinton days when he wanted to give Kim Jong-un wads of cash, and as he beat chest parading around ICBMS when Obama was president, we did nothing -- well, nothing that mattered anyway. The Dems have been crying about nukes forever and as this President openly negotiates for the safety and security of this nation, and enhances our military strength, destroys ISIS, they still complain. They literally don't want to see him fix this. Take a look at this from The Economist. The headline, this is the cover, \"America's Foreign Policy, the wrecking ball the president is swinging on is the planet earth, and Senator Chuck Schumer tweets this, \"With ICBMS and nuclear warheads in the hands of North Korea, this situation is far too dangerous for seat of the pants negotiating.\" You know, Chuck, not for nothing, but it was party that screwed this up to begin with. You have no idea how much advanced work has been done. You're too busy criticizing the President or crying about people you don't even care or know. You simply can't comprehend the genius of Donald Trump, unless of course, you were looking for a campaign contribution, but that was back then. You can't comprehend Mike Pompeo. Our President has no fear. And according to Prime Minister Abe of Japan who said it best, \"A major step forward is about to be taken. President Trump, you are about to make a new history, not only Japan, but the whole international community is strongly looking forward for the United States-North Korea Summit to open doors toward peace and stability of the Northeast Asia.\" There was a time when liberals were known as people who are all inclusive, they were generous souls fighting for the common man to assure his success and safety, but now they are not interested in success. No, they are are just angry. In fact, they are furious. We have a President who steamrolls the economy to historic heights. Consumer confidence at an 18-year high. A stock market hitting record highs. Tax cuts for everyone. And unemployment is not just down, there are actually more jobs than there are people to fill them. Did you hear what I just said? More jobs available than there are people to fill them. African-American unemployment is at its lowest in the history of this country. And then the same with Hispanics. Our businesses will be able to compete again as we get our mojo back on the world stage. Take a look agent these pictures from the G-7. Our President is in middle of every photo. The man is center stage. World leaders are all over him. The questions are to him. He is dominating the G-7. America is back, folks. The truth, however, is a far cry from what stumbling Nancy said just a few weeks ago."

When we came out with our kids on the streets and parades, waving our flags and teaching our children the importance of patriotism. Donald Trump is bringing America back in front our eyes. And it's time for the un-American haters to get on board. And that's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine. And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and all of the developing news tonight, deputy press secretary in the White House, Hogan Gidley. All right, Hogan, before we get to the North Korea summit. President Trump doing what he does best, causing a bit of disruption tonight with this tweet. It was sent after he left the G-7 Summit about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The president saying, \"Prime Minister Justice Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our G-7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that US tariffs were kind of insulting and that he will not be pushed around. Very dishonest and weak. Our tariffs are in response to his 270% on dairy.\" Trudeau then responded saying, \"Canada won't be pushed around.\" Hogan, what's going on here?"

And what he did in those meetings, I have talked to Larry Kudlow already this evening. He gave me a brief coming out of the summit, and he said, \"Listen, the president was on fire in those meetings. He was tough. He was honest. He told the world community we were not going to be the world's piggy bank anymore. We weren't going to be taken advantage of anymore and that it was time to open up trade. It was time to be free. It was time to be fair.\" That is what the president was behind the scenes and now, you see when he comes out, he says the same thing in public. This is where this president is because he wants to defend the American worker. They have been taking it in the teeth for decades.

And instead, they would rather attack this president as opposed to the policy, him fixing the things that have made this country now back in the positive, in the red on the economy.

This is what the president is facing is on one hand, he has got this accusers, if you will, with a false assumption to begin with.

Governor Mike Huckabee is next with the most outrageous statements of the week, don't miss this. CNN's Jeffrey Toobin says that President Trump's pardon of black people are just great theater and suggesting the President still wants to fight with black people, take a look at this."

      "speaker": "JEFFREY TOOBIN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN",
      "utterance": "By fighting with the NFL players, by fighting with the UCLA basketball players, by his comments in Charlottesville, President Trump gets to fight with black people, which he thinks is a great advantage politically. This is not an olive branch. This is more opportunity to define himself."

      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge, I didn't realize Jeffrey Toobin was African-American. I guess, he is -- but he is identifying now as an African-American so that he can be the spokesman for the African-American people in America. Even the ones who supported Donald Trump, and an increasing number of them are. When he makes this comment about the pardons being theater, let me tell you something, that was one heck of a show for Alice Johnson and her family. It wasn't just theater to them, it was a family reunion, and they are glad that the President had the guts to right in the middle of his term, not the last 15 minutes when he was in the White House, but in the middle of his term, see something that was an injustice and to correct it and to do it in a very public way. I thought it was terrific. I am sorry Jeff Toobin can't find some pleasure in letting a great grandmother get off of a life without parole sentence for a non-violent first offense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "First offense, and that is the key, and you know, what's interesting as you say is more African-Americans are coming on board. I was just saying, Dennis Rodman who was tweeting about how the President is a great friend of his and so is Kim Jong-un, and the President is going to go over there and cut a deal. You know, Kanye West, all of that stuff, the rapper chance, so maybe the push back isn't going to be as bad as it was, but let's keep moving on this thing. I am going to pull up a cover of Time envisions the president in a crown and a robe, you see it there on the right side of the screen. And it says, \"King me.\" What's your reaction to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Time has become so irrelevant they ought to rename the magazine timed out. They no longer really are even making good sense. What was it supposed to mean, anyway? That Donald Trump is a strong leader and they can't handle that? He's about to go into a historic summit meeting with a North Korean leader of the hermit kingdom who begged to get that meeting back on the agenda after the president said, \"No, I don't think we are going have it.\" I think it's incredibly significant that the president just walked out of G-7 basically telling them go where the good people don't, and said to them, \"Hey, we are not going to be chumps anymore.\" A lot of Americans are cheering for an American president who puts our country first."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I think that was the most of important point you made earlier in the show was that he is not a person who comes with so many hooks in him from all of the donor class, and it's one of the reasons that some people can't stand him, because they can't control him. They can't call him up and say, \"Now, Mr. President, remember how much money that we raised for you, if you don't come through...\" he just basically says, \"No, you didn't get me here. A lot of ordinary people did and I am beholden to no one.\""

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes and yes. I think -- they do not see President Trump the way that all of us see President Trump. They have such a distorted image of who he is. They don't have the kind of reaction that we do. It's almost some sort of trick..."

      "utterance": "Well, the peacock network has become the turkey network. I think they need to need to rename it BS-NBC, and I just don't even know what happened to Nicole Wallace, they must have done a liberal lobotomy on her because I have never seen anybody have such a personality change and be insulting kind of condescending to say that Ivanka and Melania and all the women of the White House, which I guess, would include my daughter are somehow dead inside."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "No, she certainly is not, but neither is Ivanka and neither is Melania who is an extraordinary classy lady. I think they are just jealous that there are people who don't agree with their liberal nonsense. You know, you can be a woman in America as long as you are liberal, but god help you, if you might be a conservative because that just doesn't work with these people."
