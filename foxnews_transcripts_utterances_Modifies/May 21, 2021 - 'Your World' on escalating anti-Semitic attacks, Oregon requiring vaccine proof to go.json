Experts say, in recent days, there's been a major increase in both anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish behavior online. The headlines out of the Middle East certainly generating a lot of posts on platforms like TikTok, Twitter and Instagram. Facebook telling FOX News it has dedicated teams keeping an eye out for hate speech, a company spokesperson telling us today -- quote -- \"We're sensitive to the fact that conflicts like this could lead to increases in anti-Semitic and anti- Islamic speech that violates our policies. We want to make sure people have a voice. But we draw a line on content that poses a genuine risk of physical harm or creates a direct threat to public safety.\"  Experts say, for years, Web and social platforms have become a breeding ground for hate speech and extremists. The Anti-Defamation League says, while companies are increasingly spending more time and resources to combat this issue, it also wants users to rein in questionable content that they're seeing online.",

Police set up barricades to try and separate the two groups, but violence did erupt. Cell phone video caught what police described as a gang assault on that Jewish man. And this afternoon, 23-year-old Waseem Awawdeh was taken into custody and charged with five counts, including assault, as well as possession of a weapon.  A few blocks away, in the city's predominantly Jewish Diamond District, commercial-grade explosives were set off, causing one person to be injured.

For me, it seems very reasonable to take an Israeli flag with me.  And because there was a bunch of cars with Palestinian flags over the street, we took the Israeli flag with us. We tied it down to the bike. And we drove a little bit up the road. When I parked my bike, I saw what's going on around, and I figured out, if I'm leaving the Israeli flag on my bike, I will go back and I will have no bike. So, we took it with us.  We go down the road. And then we took a right turn to Third Avenue. When we took this right turn, we saw probably 500 or 600 pro-Palestinian protesters. They were already violent. When we got there, they attacked a news reporter and the police protect him.  Amit told me, listen, we're not looking for troubles. Take the flag and put it inside the motorcycle helmet. That's what I did. And when he said it, he said it in Hebrew. Someone heard that we speak in Hebrew. He looked at us, went back into the crowd.

That's a bipartisan bill that aims to make the U.S. more competitive with China. Now, Republicans say that that is a moot point, because the bills being voted on next week. It's unlikely to change. And, to them, shifting dollars from one legislative bucket to another is, in a sense, kind of like paying with a different credit card legislatively.

Now, some pointed moments during cross-examination by Epic's lawyers. That includes a back-and-forth on China with a reference to The New York Times' investigative piece about Apple storing user data on servers in China.

Cook says, yes, they pay us, if that's what you're asking. Cook also noting that, ultimately, it's the user that has been caught between the two beloved companies of Apple and Epic.

The problem is that the idea that North Korea would build up this great weapons of mass destruction capacity, not just their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capability, but the biological and chemical weapons too, just to barter it away for food and economic integration, it really strains, I think, common sense.

For me, it seems very reasonable to take an Israeli flag with me. And because there was a bunch of cars with Palestinian flags over the street, we took the Israeli flag with us. We tied it down to the bike. And we drove a little bit up the road. When I parked my bike, I saw what's going on around, and I figured out, if I'm leaving the Israeli flag on my bike, I will go back and I will have no bike. So, we took it with us. We go down the road. And then we took a right turn to Third Avenue. When we took this right turn, we saw probably 500 or 600 pro-Palestinian protesters. They were already violent. When we got there, they attacked a news reporter and the police protect him. Amit told me, listen, we're not looking for troubles. Take the flag and put it inside the motorcycle helmet. That's what I did. And when he said it, he said it in Hebrew. Someone heard that we speak in Hebrew. He looked at us, went back into the crowd.

But Republicans don't see that as a considerable shift, because part of their proposal, a key piece of their proposal would move the funds for research and development, manufacturing and supply chains to another piece of legislation, the Endless Frontiers Act. That's a bipartisan bill that aims to make the U.S. more competitive with China. Now, Republicans say that that is a moot point, because the bills being voted on next week. It's unlikely to change. And, to them, shifting dollars from one legislative bucket to another is, in a sense, kind of like paying with a different credit card legislatively. The two sides are also at an impasse on how to pay for all this.

But Republicans say that those are modest concessions and there were negligible movements on policy, with the White House pinging this back to the GOP and asking them for more money on critical things like clean energy, work force training, and, of course, the care economy, things that the Democrats think are vital to this infrastructure package, Charles."

I want to get the read from our Friday power panel, GOP strategist Alexandra Wilkes, Democratic strategist Kristen Hawn, and, from The Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe. Tiana, a lot of onus on these on these businesses to have to police this. It sounds like it's going to be tough."

You have at least one -- you least 50 percent of the country -- or 50 percent of the state is -- has at least had their first dose, and more than 40 percent is fully vaxxed. We have already seen in Israel they only need 60 percent of the -- of the adult population vaccinated in order to bring their COVID deaths down to zero. Then it does bring up putting the onus on these businesses that have already been hit hard by a full year of rioting, already been hit hard by COVID restrictions. Is this fair? No. And does it bode well for civil liberties? Probably not."

These businesses can't find enough workers with the current state of the unemployment benefits to actually staff their stores, let alone participate in what's essentially a shadow government program to mandate vaccinations and to do vaccine passports. I mean, this is ridiculous. As Tiana mentioned, the Oregon businesses have been hit terribly hard by the riots from last summer, with just the overall state of COVID. This just seems like another way that government is hitting small businesses and basically asking small business to do its job for them."

The businesses have been hurting quite a bit, as we all know, and everything does -- like you said, needs to be based on the science.

Last month, record number ever in historical time, just under 19,000 unaccompanied minors. And this is what's really scary to me, Charles, 200,000 get-aways by federal fiscal year, 60,000 just in my area of the southeast corner of Arizona here. Those are 60,000 just coming through my section of the state that are camouflaged like the pictures you have that we have sent you, that we have no idea who they are. They have been -- got away from our border. They're somewhere in United States. That's a national security public safety issue. And just to let you know, as we said, every day that goes by, over 1,000, 1,100 people, 1,100 get through our Southwest border into our country every day that we have no idea what's going on.

There's great concern that Japan and South Korea would then want their own nuclear programs. The problem is that the idea that North Korea would build up this great weapons of mass destruction capacity, not just their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile capability, but the biological and chemical weapons too, just to barter it away for food and economic integration, it really strains, I think, common sense. It doesn't mean we shouldn't try, but I think what the Biden administration is looking at probably is a measured approach, where they may reduce or eliminate some of the sanctions if North Korea makes some positive steps in the right direction."

      "utterance": "Well, it is just that. It's a cease-fire. It doesn't deal with the underlying causes of the conflict between Hamas and Israel, which are related to Hamas being a terrorist organization. They're operating from densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip, launching rockets at civilians in Israeli cities. I think that Hamas is very much interested in taking over the mantle of leadership from the Palestinian Authority, including in the West Bank. And they're also very concerned that Israel was able to sign those Abraham Accords, a major diplomatic breakthrough, which demonstrated that Israel could achieve peace with Arab Gulf neighbors without solving the issues with the Palestinians. And Hamas wants that not to be the case. They want to insert themselves such that it's impossible for peace between Israel and their Arab neighbors."
