In Fox News we bring you the strongest set of facts and opinions anywhere as they're happening, but that's not what's happening out there in the mainstream media. Donald Trump is called the mainstream media fake news and they despise them for that, but Trump may be onto something. On Monday, the Washington Post broke what they called a bombshell story stating that they had anonymous sources tell them Trump gave away classified information to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in his last meeting last week. They were high-fiving each other in the Washington Post newsroom, a smoking gun: \"We got Trump!\" But the party was premature, much like Hillary's election night party. Soon, it was noted that, A, the info in question, that ISIS was attempting to use laptops as an explosive device on airplanes, was common knowledge. So the bombshell was a dud. Fake news. The very next day, Tuesday, The New York Times delivered their bombshell that recently-axed FBI Director James Comey had a smoking-gun note he wrote after a dinner with President Trump months ago, and that Trump asked Comey to stop an FBI investigation. Again, high fives in the Times newsroom. Parties ensued, until it was also noted that Comey had been sitting on that note for months. Pretty interesting, right? Also, take note of what I dug up today. Unfortunately for Mr. Comey, in sworn testimony on May 3, the director was asked if he had been asked to stop any investigation on the Russian story. And here's what he said, and I'm quoting: \"It would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that, without an appropriate purpose. I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal.\" And here's the operative line, guys, emphasis mine: \"It's not happened in my experience.\" Another bombshell fizzling out. Fake news. A colleague of mine who passed away today once told me \"Be fast, Bolling, but more importantly, be right.\" The Washington Post and The New York Times, you should be ashamed of your reporting. As for our faithful Fox audience, our motto is, \"We report. You decide.\" And that's what we do. It means we report the facts and respectfully encourage you, the viewer, to decide what it means to you. Throwing it over to Stephen A. Smith, so here it is. Comey in sworn testimony, the Senate, says, \"Never happened. No one ever asked me to look the other way on any investigation.\"",

But remembering Roger Ailes, we must remember Roger's massive career, as well, as career that spanned five decades and transcended industries. We must remember the architect of three successful presidential campaigns; and we must remember the man who redefined what it meant to work in the media. Roger Ailes ushered in the conservative point of view out of the shadows and forever cemented its seat at the American political table. He was a patriot and a revolutionary.

And then also Further, Mitch McConnell goes in with hands the Democrats, another one on a platter saying let's do all senators, all senators invited to a discussion of this. Bring in Rosenstein. They bring in Rosenstein to talk about Mueller. And all they've done is kept this new cycle going when the reality is they're caving to the Democrats.

There wasn't anything really going on. What this could have been, all right, let's -- you've got your general counsel, let's go.

I would love to see this run its full course because I believe in the president. I believe in what he stands for. That's why we voted for him. And I believe that what will come out of this spotlight will eventually help him. I think it will clear -- and by the way, if it doesn't, as a real American, we the people guy, I want the facts to fall where they lay. I want the spotlight to get the truth out.

You have a Democrat in office, Republicans are going to come after you. If you have a Republican in office, Democrats are going to come after you.

I was on the phone with him when he (INAUDIBLE). I never had a problem with him until he campaigned and he conducted himself the way that he conducted himself. So what I'm saying to you is this, if you're going to be the leader of the free world -- I'm not getting into his politics per se because I'm certainly not as qualified as a lot of aficionados out there, but you have to conduct yourself like a statesman."

What you tweet does matters, and I think it's not necessarily always a bad thing to use twitter. I think it can be a great tool to go around -- as media. But sometimes you have to live and die by the content of your tweet. So is something is good and positive and can bolster your message and they're not talking about it."

In Fox News we bring you the strongest set of facts and opinions anywhere as they're happening, but that's not what's happening out there in the mainstream media. Donald Trump is called the mainstream media fake news and they despise them for that, but Trump may be onto something. On Monday, the Washington Post broke what they called a bombshell story stating that they had anonymous sources tell them Trump gave away classified information to Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in his last meeting last week. They were high-fiving each other in the Washington Post newsroom, a smoking gun: \"We got Trump!\" But the party was premature, much like Hillary's election night party. Soon, it was noted that, A, the info in question, that ISIS was attempting to use laptops as an explosive device on airplanes, was common knowledge. So the bombshell was a dud. Fake news. The very next day, Tuesday, The New York Times delivered their bombshell that recently-axed FBI Director James Comey had a smoking-gun note he wrote after a dinner with President Trump months ago, and that Trump asked Comey to stop an FBI investigation. Again, high fives in the Times newsroom. Parties ensued, until it was also noted that Comey had been sitting on that note for months. Pretty interesting, right? Also, take note of what I dug up today. Unfortunately for Mr. Comey, in sworn testimony on May 3, the director was asked if he had been asked to stop any investigation on the Russian story. And here's what he said, and I'm quoting: \"It would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that, without an appropriate purpose. I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal.\" And here's the operative line, guys, emphasis mine: \"It's not happened in my experience.\" Another bombshell fizzling out. Fake news. A colleague of mine who passed away today once told me \"Be fast, Bolling, but more importantly, be right.\" The Washington Post and The New York Times, you should be ashamed of your reporting. As for our faithful Fox audience, our motto is, \"We report. You decide.\" And that's what we do. It means we report the facts and respectfully encourage you, the viewer, to decide what it means to you. Throwing it over to Stephen A. Smith, so here it is. Comey in sworn testimony, the Senate, says, \"Never happened. No one ever asked me to look the other way on any investigation.\""

Here's the reality of the situation, however. No matter what entity you're working for, an individual is an individual. Everybody can't host this show. You are. You know, everybody is not hosting it.

So it's not just individuals in this day and age. It's an overall movement. And the movement of the media and academia and the left and the Democrats overall is just Saul Alinsky berserk.

So much so -- don't take my word for it; take theirs -- The New York Times came out postelection, and they apologized to their viewership, to their readership, and they said, \"We're going to do better.\" So when you do this, Eric, when they come out and they say things like this and they have to walk it back immediately after because it was a premature celebration around what felt like a conquest in that moment, it's a problem. Now, the difference is, I don't feel like \"Ha-ha, yay, the mainstream media is dead. We've triumphed.\" I feel sad for America. Because a lot of people, Eric, they're not going to do this legwork, and they don't have time to do it. That's our job as journalists and reporters and working in news media. That's what we do for a living. The typical American, they're working hard. They don't have time to look this stuff up, so they need a reliable news source.

What is the problem where these bright, young, gifted students are being held back from their full potential due to the clogged pipeline in Chicago, public schools education? The state is giving them money. It's being clogged by that man right there, Eric, and it is not getting to the students that need it. So I cannot hear this message from Rahm Emanuel."

For me personally, when -- being an African-American, seeing the crime that has been raking through certain parts of Chicago, I'm not saying that our former president didn't say anything, but I always found myself wishing that I heard more. And I always suspected that I didn't hear more as it pertained to that issue because Rahm Emanuel, his former chief of staff, was the mayor. When I hear the name Rahm Emanuel, that is what comes to my mind, the crime that exists in Chicago, what little has been done to address it. And we have a mayor that is there.

Roger Ailes built the FOX News empire and stood at its helm until he was forced out amid allegations of sexual harassment last year. But when remembering Roger Ailes, we must remember all of Roger Ailes. Personally, Roger brought me over here from CNBC, seeing something in me that even I didn't know existed, a conservative point of view. A conservative set of values and opinions that he said would resonate far better with the Fox audience rather than the NBC audience. I think Roger was right. Thank you, R.A. But remembering Roger Ailes, we must remember Roger's massive career, as well, as career that spanned five decades and transcended industries. We must remember the architect of three successful presidential campaigns; and we must remember the man who redefined what it meant to work in the media. Roger Ailes ushered in the conservative point of view out of the shadows and forever cemented its seat at the American political table. He was a patriot and a revolutionary. Our hearts, all of our hearts, are with his family, Elizabeth, his wife, and his son Zachary. We'll be right back."
