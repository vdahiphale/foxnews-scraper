I know, never forget. So why January 11th so important? Because it's this great man's birthday. Yes. Actor, stunt man, little person. RIP. Felix Silla. And if you don't know who Mr. Silla, it's OK. He was offered disguise as Cousin Itt in the Addams Family. Yes, I know he was that guy. Anyway, it's his birthday. That's why January 11 is so important to me. Another little person, even though we keep -- stop it. But we keep being told the only day that matters is January 6.",

And why did -- a better husband stock goes up each time she mentions January 6. She says predictable is Biden's 3:00 nap. And we knew the January 6 anniversary was a grift. So in case you were one of the gullible Republicans who thought January 6 was really about remembering, enjoy being patsies. January 6 was a prop. Just like Cuomo giant Q-tip used to vanquish political adversaries and help the Democratic Party regain political footing by rejiggering the rules.

Today, President Joe endorsed changing Senate rules regarding voting as Dems claim it's the biggest test of Americans democracy since the Civil War. But sorry, Joe, this isn't even the biggest test since corn pop. It's just hyperbole. And that's why they have to keep saying it. I mean, no one needed convincing that 9/11 was bad a year later. For January 6, however, never forget means we all literally would forget, unless we make a big deal out of it every year. So now it's January 6 every day as Republicans engage in extreme attacks on our most basic constitutional right, voting. Which is why now Joe pushes a filibuster carve out, which sounds like a new entree at Boston Market. Kat would know. But now you see the point of the January 6 anniversary, the Dems need an emergency to change voting rules. It's 2020 all over again. And like a serial killer's dog, the media happily played along joining in on the hysterical messaging. Yes, the messaging. That's what it's all about these days.

And when you ask him why he's there, he says something like, hey, I've always been fascinated by the monkey bars. Then you ask him which kid is his and he says, I wish they all were. Maybe that's why CNN was so wrong on Kyle Rittenhouse because by 17, they've lost interest. But it's more than just their personnel. It's their hysteria conflict based profit model. January 6 was just one example. Well, CNN and others gushed endlessly about their own PTSD. The rest of America was like what? It's the same reliable hysteria, they applied to collusion, Covington Kavanaugh. Remember the classics? That perfect phone call was worse than Watergate. Climate change means the earth dies in eight years. January 6 is Pearl Harbor all over again. You see the disconnect between them and you. And it's this gulf between their claims and actual reality that mirrors exactly the gulf between the press and the public they don't understand. And if you listen to CNN, well, it's got to be America's fault. Even though they've been so insanely wrong on everything from COVID to crime. The last time they were right, Wolf Blitzer was a mere pop. But you know, maybe CNN should be grateful. No one is really paying attention to them.

Finds that America is more liberal than it was 50 years ago yet voting for more Republicans. Those liberal NYU researchers concluded their research by jumping out of an eight-storey window. And you laugh. You're disgusting. Researchers looked at a pile of data and turns out from 70 -- 1972 to 2004 party affiliation is shifted steadily toward Republicans, even as each generation is just a little more liberal than its predecessor. With more tolerance in areas the left claims are worse than ever, like race, gender and personal freedom. At this rate and a few years that GOP ticket will be Rand Paul and RuPaul. And I'm going to vote for that. So if our country sees more liberal attitudes with each generation why haven't liberals dominated the elections? Is this because wokeism has contaminated traditional liberalism so liberal see that Republicanism is closer to reality? Or maybe it's because liberals like the nutty ideas of the squad, in theory, but not when it comes out of their own paychecks. And they also know that extremists in the party will cancel them out the moment they reveal that they might have any diversity of thought. So they lie about their preferences. Even Bill Maher noted recently that \"woke is something that is not an extension of liberalism. It's very often the opposite of what an old school liberal like me believes.

Yes, the school says be choosy with your words, so people don't think you're literally killing birds. A recent op-ed, that's short for opinion editorial, Kat, in the Wall Street Journal which is owned by our parent company Sam Goody, eviscerated the University of California Irvine's inclusive language guide. I'm surprised we're even allowed to use the word language. Don't they know it's offensive to babies who don't know how to speak yet? By the way, the mascot for Irvine is the ant eater which must be offensive to animals with eating disorders. In addition to policing pronouns, which are very short words like he, she, them, and they, Kat. The guide also encourages using less offensive metaphors that don't promote violence. A metaphor is a figure of speech not to be taken literally, Kat. So, rather than say off the reservation, use against the grain, instead of tone deaf say inconsiderate, or thoughtless, although who cares if we offend the deaf? They can't hear us anyway -- an inconsiderate jerk might say. I condemn that outright. Perhaps, most stupid of them all instead of kill two birds with one stone, say feed two birds with one scone. Don't they know that feeding bread to birds expands in their stomach and harms them? Trust me you don't want to offend birds.

So now it's January 6 every day as Republicans engage in extreme attacks on our most basic constitutional right, voting.

Americans are living their lives and not listening to you, you freaks. And CNN just found out now, haven't they seen their ratings? Are they too small to see at this point?

You're the cable version of the guy who hangs out at the playground but didn't bring any kids. And when you ask him why he's there, he says something like, hey, I've always been fascinated by the monkey bars. Then you ask him which kid is his and he says, I wish they all were. Maybe that's why CNN was so wrong on Kyle Rittenhouse because by 17, they've lost interest. But it's more than just their personnel. It's their hysteria conflict based profit model. January 6 was just one example. Well, CNN and others gushed endlessly about their own PTSD. The rest of America was like what? It's the same reliable hysteria, they applied to collusion, Covington Kavanaugh. Remember the classics? That perfect phone call was worse than Watergate. Climate change means the earth dies in eight years. January 6 is Pearl Harbor all over again. You see the disconnect between them and you. And it's this gulf between their claims and actual reality that mirrors exactly the gulf between the press and the public they don't understand. And if you listen to CNN, well, it's got to be America's fault. Even though they've been so insanely wrong on everything from COVID to crime. The last time they were right, Wolf Blitzer was a mere pop. But you know, maybe CNN should be grateful. No one is really paying attention to them.

Finds that America is more liberal than it was 50 years ago yet voting for more Republicans. Those liberal NYU researchers concluded their research by jumping out of an eight-storey window. And you laugh. You're disgusting. Researchers looked at a pile of data and turns out from 70 -- 1972 to 2004 party affiliation is shifted steadily toward Republicans, even as each generation is just a little more liberal than its predecessor. With more tolerance in areas the left claims are worse than ever, like race, gender and personal freedom. At this rate and a few years that GOP ticket will be Rand Paul and RuPaul. And I'm going to vote for that. So if our country sees more liberal attitudes with each generation why haven't liberals dominated the elections? Is this because wokeism has contaminated traditional liberalism so liberal see that Republicanism is closer to reality? Or maybe it's because liberals like the nutty ideas of the squad, in theory, but not when it comes out of their own paychecks. And they also know that extremists in the party will cancel them out the moment they reveal that they might have any diversity of thought. So they lie about their preferences. Even Bill Maher noted recently that \"woke is something that is not an extension of liberalism. It's very often the opposite of what an old school liberal like me believes.

And others. And those fundamental bedrock issues of the Republican Party, among others are crucial. And especially the more we go, the more we have presidents like Biden, who are just spending, like astronomical amounts, who are growing the federal government, astronomical sizes, then that is why people are voting Republican because they don't want the government regulating everything and making you forcing you to believe a certain way and act a certain way in the like.

A recent op-ed, that's short for opinion editorial, Kat, in the Wall Street Journal which is owned by our parent company Sam Goody, eviscerated the University of California Irvine's inclusive language guide. I'm surprised we're even allowed to use the word language. Don't they know it's offensive to babies who don't know how to speak yet? By the way, the mascot for Irvine is the ant eater which must be offensive to animals with eating disorders. In addition to policing pronouns, which are very short words like he, she, them, and they, Kat. The guide also encourages using less offensive metaphors that don't promote violence. A metaphor is a figure of speech not to be taken literally, Kat. So, rather than say off the reservation, use against the grain, instead of tone deaf say inconsiderate, or thoughtless, although who cares if we offend the deaf? They can't hear us anyway -- an inconsiderate jerk might say. I condemn that outright. Perhaps, most stupid of them all instead of kill two birds with one stone, say feed two birds with one scone. Don't they know that feeding bread to birds expands in their stomach and harms them? Trust me you don't want to offend birds.
