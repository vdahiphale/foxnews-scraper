      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Wow. Tonight, as we predicted tonight, the psychotic anti-Trump rage from the Democrats and media mob once again boiling over. I told you last night, at this time tonight that I would have all the examples of the fake, the phony selective, false moral outrage surrounding a completely reasonable statement from President Trump about campaign op research, foreign governments. Coming up, we're going to show you exactly what we predicted and how this new round of breathless hysteria by the media mob is yet another example, a glaring example, of the Democratic Party's raw hypocrisy.  Frankly, if the president didn't set them up on purpose, he could not have set them up better. And as haters, they took the bait, hook, line, sinker. We'll have more on that in a moment. You are going to love the tape we have.  First, we also have actual news to cover, stories that the media mob that will never show you because they live, they lied for two years, and it doesn't fit their political narrative. Now, this includes a breaking development out of John Durham's ongoing investigation into the investigators. Last night, we told you \"The New York Times\" first reporting, Durham expanded his probe to the CIA, and DOJ officials were reportedly interviewing senior CIA officers about their role in the origins of this Russia hoax.  Keep in mind, in a letter to Congressman Nadler, the AG's office already confirmed their investigation will be broad in scope. It will cover activities of American and foreign intelligence services, as well as nongovernmental organizations and individuals. This now represents yet another piece of the puzzle, the evidence that we are finally going to get to the truth, which is the biggest abuse of power in history. But tonight, some disturbing news from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. According to a brand-new report just breaking, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, the DOJ's internal watchdog, is doing, apparently, a top to bottom outstanding job of policing the bad conduct. But the DOJ is doing a poor job, sadly, of punishing its own.  This is a serious matter. Solomon detailing more than a half dozen FBI, DEA, other DOJ officials face virtually zero consequences after being caught abusing their power and committing crimes no other American citizen whatever get away with -- serious misconduct, lying to the government, misuse of government funds for personal gain, and dereliction of duty resulting in nothing more than just a slap on the wrist. And, of course, this comes as the DOJ probe into the origins of the Russia witch hunt, of course, is in full gear and is a troubling sign that the deep state will do anything and everything, they will protect their own. We'll have more of my opening monologue in just a minute.  First, joining us now with more on this breaking news is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon.   You know, John, when you have clear, compelling evidence, and a criminal referral with evidence behind it, and you let it go, what message does that send especially in light of the minute detail that Mueller used to set perjury traps, et cetera?",

      "sentences": "Yes, listen, I heard from people on the inside of the Justice Department concerned by this. In the last 30 days, Michael Horowitz's team have competed more than a half dozen of internal affairs investigations of FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney's office personnel, all who were confirmed to have committed illegal acts or broke the rules. Not a single one of them were prosecuted. Most of them are still in their jobs, are allowed to retire. And here's what we're talking about what they did. You have an FBI lawyer who shoplifted multiple times from stores, not any store, the marine barracks commissary store where marines get their supplies from. She shoplifted from there. She did not get prosecuted, she got some community service.   You got the U.S. attorney, assistant U.S. attorney who transported marijuana. You got a DEA supervisor who routed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his son. You got another FBI supervisor who turned the FBI's official repair garage into a personal garage to repair his and other FBI agents' cars. All of this costs taxpayers money. All of it violated the law. Nobody is prosecuted. And this is why -- why are we talking about this? We are about to enter into one of the most internal affairs investigations in Justice Department's history. The Barr review of the Russia case, if they can't hold people like this accountable it raises the question, what will they do at the end of this Russia case?",

There isn't -- there is -- I've had some people saying, suggesting strongly they believe that the attorney general already has the inspector general's report.   Now, there was apparently heading up originally a hang up on only one of the FISA applications. Surprisingly, that being the first. But according to my sources, your reporting about Kathleen Kavalec's confirmation and warning and admonition to the FBI prior to the first FISA application put that to bed in light of also the closed-door testimony of Bruce Ohr that everybody was warned. What are you hearing about the inspector general report on FISA? Because that doesn't seem like a premeditated fraud against the court with unverifiable lies as something anybody can get away with.",

They're trying to digest this question, if the FBI claims they couldn't configure out before it filed the FISA that Michael Steele was political, working for the Clinton campaign, leaking to the media and having erroneous information, how did the State Department do it on October 10th and a 45- minute meeting with them? That has raised a new question that has caused doubt into some of the things the FBI and DOJ have said, and I think there is some new examination there.  But I don't think we're along from getting that report. I think this summer, we'll see it.",

Meanwhile, House Intel Committee chairman, the cowardly Schiff who won't come on this program, he's not interested in truth or justice and Schiff is trapped in a lie, each day, digs a hole deeper and deeper.  This week, he actually threatened to subpoena the FBI Director Wray. For more information on the FBI's nine-month counter-intel investigation about -- yes, Trump-Russia collusion. He didn't get the conclusion he wanted.   They are trying now so hard to keep their hopes alive. Four separate investigations, including the Mueller investigation. It can't be any more straightforward and frankly, at this point, they are deranged, desperate and full of rage and frankly, they look pretty stupid.

As a matter of fact, the president, I suspect, I would like somebody to asking the question, I wonder if he knew exactly what he was doing, the exact way he was asked that question and the answer he gave because of time after time, he knows the media bubble and fizz like Alka-Seltzer in water and he is playing them like a flute. And because he knew they couldn't resist a story about the Trump campaign and foreign intelligence, he knew how desperate they are to keep the Russia hopes alive and as per usual, he was right. Frankly, we were right in our prediction right at the top of the show last night. Like moths to a flame, Alka-Seltzer in water, bubble, fizz, all the energy goes out. The mob erupted and yet another around of hope -- false hope. Lies, conspiracy theories, and the hopes continued for a short time. Take a look.

Now, here's the point, and the people you just us all, as we predicted, so blinded in their hatred for President Trump, they don't even realize they were set up like bowling pins showing their ridiculous hypocrisy. Because they have the very same people smearing the president hour after hour, every hour and second of every day, the same ones that ignored, let's see, for an election interference that was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, which brings us into a quick Hannity history lesson.   Let's go back to 2016. In order to skirt campaign finance laws, Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC, yes, they funneled money as a law expense to a law firm called Perkins Coie. Perkins Coie then hires the op research firm, Fusion GPS, who then hired a foreign national -- oh, I thought this shouldn't happen -- to collect Russian lies, dirt on Donald Trump.  That dirt became known as the Christopher Steele dossier. And as \"The New York Times\" suggest, likely, it was Russian misinformation from the beginning, full of Russian lies, as \"The New York Times\" even admits. Content, disinformation, Hillary Clinton bought, solicited, paid for the Russian government lies. And then Obama-Biden's government, members of the deep state, members of the intel community, members of foreign governments all worked together and let's see -- they spread the Russian lies and disinformation throughout the government and leaked to the press, \"The Washington Post\", the Clinton sycophant David Corn, Michael Isikoff, because they wanted the American people to believe the Russian lies Hillary paid for in an attempt to rig the election. After all, she got away with a rig in the primary. It's like I'm the only person who cares about Bernie Sanders.  No outrage by any of these people. She bought it, she sought it, she paid for it, they spread it, they tried to use it to impact the election. President -- let's go back. If called, I'll listen, if bad, I will call the FBI. Fake news CNN, conspiracy TV MSNBC, you got to love Roswell Rachel Maddow, oh, it's great. It's like -- and now, the moderator that she is, over a real example of seeking, paying for Russian disinformation, real collusion, real money, real exchanges, real campaign finance violations, real laws are broken, but the same outrage, never shown.  How often do we talk about selective moral outrage? This is yet another clear example. Where are the I-believers for the Virginia lieutenant governor? Oh, yes.  What about the collusion between the Ukrainian government and the emails they have, oh, from the DNC to influence the 2016 election and help Hillary? Because \"Politico\" even reported in 2016, the Ukrainian government, quote, tried to help Hillary Clinton, their words, not mine, and undermined Donald Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office, also disseminating documents, including a top Trump aide in corruption, and helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors.  Wait a minute, we are all those people that were just complaining about Donald Trump saying, if somebody calls him, he'd listen? Then if it was bad, he would call the FBI and were so outraged. That's not all. 2017, interview, \"The Washington Post,\" former Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said, he'd be happy to travel to Europe to confirm foreign dirt on President Trump himself.  By the way, that brings us to the cowardly Adam Schiff. I have my own dossier on Schiff, it's called his own words. I offered him four hours, three hours on 618 of the best radio stations in the country and an hour on the number one cable show, thanks to all of you, in America. April 2017, we got the cowardly Schiff on tape. This is about -- I can't figure out which is my favorite tape. This or Alec Baldwin trying to be a radio talk show host. It was on the tape? Oh, the cowardly Schiff colluding with Russia to get dirt on Donald Trump. And literally it was a hoax but he didn't know it was a hoax. Naked Trump, naked Trump. Did you share with Putin? Of course, we share with Putin naked pics of Trump. He was actually speaking to a notorious Russian prankster he thought it was real this idiot. Real collusion. Listen.",

George W. Bush running off to meet with a genocidal dictator, the father of the current genocidal dictator in Syria undermining our national security. Who can remember that Democrats speaker before that, Jim Wright running off to Nicaragua to meet Ortega, another genocidal communist? I mean the Democrat, it's a joke.

This conundrum was brought to us by the Third District Court of Appeals which has now overturned the 2017 convictions of five men with marijuana in their jail cells. The judge said when California voters legalized marijuana back in 2016 it included those behind bars. The court says the prisons will still have the ability to regulate cannabis possession just like cigarettes and alcohol. But now if inmates are caught with pot, it will no longer add to their prison terms. So, it's up to the Attorney General to decide whether to appeal the case to the California Supreme Court. The State Bureau of Prisons says drug use and sales in California prisons remains prohibited even though experts point out that drug use and sales in California prisons remains rampant. Big problem.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Wow. Tonight, as we predicted tonight, the psychotic anti-Trump rage from the Democrats and media mob once again boiling over. I told you last night, at this time tonight that I would have all the examples of the fake, the phony selective, false moral outrage surrounding a completely reasonable statement from President Trump about campaign op research, foreign governments. Coming up, we're going to show you exactly what we predicted and how this new round of breathless hysteria by the media mob is yet another example, a glaring example, of the Democratic Party's raw hypocrisy. Frankly, if the president didn't set them up on purpose, he could not have set them up better. And as haters, they took the bait, hook, line, sinker. We'll have more on that in a moment. You are going to love the tape we have. First, we also have actual news to cover, stories that the media mob that will never show you because they live, they lied for two years, and it doesn't fit their political narrative. Now, this includes a breaking development out of John Durham's ongoing investigation into the investigators. Last night, we told you \"The New York Times\" first reporting, Durham expanded his probe to the CIA, and DOJ officials were reportedly interviewing senior CIA officers about their role in the origins of this Russia hoax. Keep in mind, in a letter to Congressman Nadler, the AG's office already confirmed their investigation will be broad in scope. It will cover activities of American and foreign intelligence services, as well as nongovernmental organizations and individuals. This now represents yet another piece of the puzzle, the evidence that we are finally going to get to the truth, which is the biggest abuse of power in history. But tonight, some disturbing news from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. According to a brand-new report just breaking, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, the DOJ's internal watchdog, is doing, apparently, a top to bottom outstanding job of policing the bad conduct. But the DOJ is doing a poor job, sadly, of punishing its own. This is a serious matter. Solomon detailing more than a half dozen FBI, DEA, other DOJ officials face virtually zero consequences after being caught abusing their power and committing crimes no other American citizen whatever get away with -- serious misconduct, lying to the government, misuse of government funds for personal gain, and dereliction of duty resulting in nothing more than just a slap on the wrist. And, of course, this comes as the DOJ probe into the origins of the Russia witch hunt, of course, is in full gear and is a troubling sign that the deep state will do anything and everything, they will protect their own. We'll have more of my opening monologue in just a minute. First, joining us now with more on this breaking news is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon. You know, John, when you have clear, compelling evidence, and a criminal referral with evidence behind it, and you let it go, what message does that send especially in light of the minute detail that Mueller used to set perjury traps, et cetera?"

      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, listen, I heard from people on the inside of the Justice Department concerned by this. In the last 30 days, Michael Horowitz's team have competed more than a half dozen of internal affairs investigations of FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney's office personnel, all who were confirmed to have committed illegal acts or broke the rules. Not a single one of them were prosecuted. Most of them are still in their jobs, are allowed to retire. And here's what we're talking about what they did. You have an FBI lawyer who shoplifted multiple times from stores, not any store, the marine barracks commissary store where marines get their supplies from. She shoplifted from there. She did not get prosecuted, she got some community service. You got the U.S. attorney, assistant U.S. attorney who transported marijuana. You got a DEA supervisor who routed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his son. You got another FBI supervisor who turned the FBI's official repair garage into a personal garage to repair his and other FBI agents' cars. All of this costs taxpayers money. All of it violated the law. Nobody is prosecuted. And this is why -- why are we talking about this? We are about to enter into one of the most internal affairs investigations in Justice Department's history. The Barr review of the Russia case, if they can't hold people like this accountable it raises the question, what will they do at the end of this Russia case?"

There isn't -- there is -- I've had some people saying, suggesting strongly they believe that the attorney general already has the inspector general's report. Now, there was apparently heading up originally a hang up on only one of the FISA applications. Surprisingly, that being the first. But according to my sources, your reporting about Kathleen Kavalec's confirmation and warning and admonition to the FBI prior to the first FISA application put that to bed in light of also the closed-door testimony of Bruce Ohr that everybody was warned. What are you hearing about the inspector general report on FISA? Because that doesn't seem like a premeditated fraud against the court with unverifiable lies as something anybody can get away with."

Not a long time, a short while. They're trying to digest this question, if the FBI claims they couldn't configure out before it filed the FISA that Michael Steele was political, working for the Clinton campaign, leaking to the media and having erroneous information, how did the State Department do it on October 10th and a 45- minute meeting with them? That has raised a new question that has caused doubt into some of the things the FBI and DOJ have said, and I think there is some new examination there. But I don't think we're along from getting that report. I think this summer, we'll see it."

Each night, we continue to monitor the progress out of the DOJ's probe, of course, into the origins of the Russia investigation. Meanwhile, House Intel Committee chairman, the cowardly Schiff who won't come on this program, he's not interested in truth or justice and Schiff is trapped in a lie, each day, digs a hole deeper and deeper. This week, he actually threatened to subpoena the FBI Director Wray. For more information on the FBI's nine-month counter-intel investigation about -- yes, Trump-Russia collusion. He didn't get the conclusion he wanted. They are trying now so hard to keep their hopes alive. Four separate investigations, including the Mueller investigation. It can't be any more straightforward and frankly, at this point, they are deranged, desperate and full of rage and frankly, they look pretty stupid. Yet, tonight, we have another example of this psychotic anti-Trump delusion, thanks to this pretty interesting sound bite from the president. Let's take a look."

As a matter of fact, the president, I suspect, I would like somebody to asking the question, I wonder if he knew exactly what he was doing, the exact way he was asked that question and the answer he gave because of time after time, he knows the media bubble and fizz like Alka-Seltzer in water and he is playing them like a flute. And because he knew they couldn't resist a story about the Trump campaign and foreign intelligence, he knew how desperate they are to keep the Russia hopes alive and as per usual, he was right. Frankly, we were right in our prediction right at the top of the show last night. Like moths to a flame, Alka-Seltzer in water, bubble, fizz, all the energy goes out.

Now, here's the point, and the people you just us all, as we predicted, so blinded in their hatred for President Trump, they don't even realize they were set up like bowling pins showing their ridiculous hypocrisy. Because they have the very same people smearing the president hour after hour, every hour and second of every day, the same ones that ignored, let's see, for an election interference that was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, which brings us into a quick Hannity history lesson. Let's go back to 2016. In order to skirt campaign finance laws, Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC, yes, they funneled money as a law expense to a law firm called Perkins Coie. Perkins Coie then hires the op research firm, Fusion GPS, who then hired a foreign national -- oh, I thought this shouldn't happen -- to collect Russian lies, dirt on Donald Trump. That dirt became known as the Christopher Steele dossier. And as \"The New York Times\" suggest, likely, it was Russian misinformation from the beginning, full of Russian lies, as \"The New York Times\" even admits. Content, disinformation, Hillary Clinton bought, solicited, paid for the Russian government lies. And then Obama-Biden's government, members of the deep state, members of the intel community, members of foreign governments all worked together and let's see -- they spread the Russian lies and disinformation throughout the government and leaked to the press, \"The Washington Post\", the Clinton sycophant David Corn, Michael Isikoff, because they wanted the American people to believe the Russian lies Hillary paid for in an attempt to rig the election. After all, she got away with a rig in the primary. It's like I'm the only person who cares about Bernie Sanders. No outrage by any of these people. She bought it, she sought it, she paid for it, they spread it, they tried to use it to impact the election. President -- let's go back. If called, I'll listen, if bad, I will call the FBI. Fake news CNN, conspiracy TV MSNBC, you got to love Roswell Rachel Maddow, oh, it's great. It's like -- and now, the moderator that she is, over a real example of seeking, paying for Russian disinformation, real collusion, real money, real exchanges, real campaign finance violations, real laws are broken, but the same outrage, never shown. How often do we talk about selective moral outrage? This is yet another clear example. Where are the I-believers for the Virginia lieutenant governor? Oh, yes. What about the collusion between the Ukrainian government and the emails they have, oh, from the DNC to influence the 2016 election and help Hillary? Because \"Politico\" even reported in 2016, the Ukrainian government, quote, tried to help Hillary Clinton, their words, not mine, and undermined Donald Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office, also disseminating documents, including a top Trump aide in corruption, and helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors. Wait a minute, we are all those people that were just complaining about Donald Trump saying, if somebody calls him, he'd listen? Then if it was bad, he would call the FBI and were so outraged. That's not all. 2017, interview, \"The Washington Post,\" former Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon said, he'd be happy to travel to Europe to confirm foreign dirt on President Trump himself. By the way, that brings us to the cowardly Adam Schiff. I have my own dossier on Schiff, it's called his own words. I offered him four hours, three hours on 618 of the best radio stations in the country and an hour on the number one cable show, thanks to all of you, in America. April 2017, we got the cowardly Schiff on tape. This is about -- I can't figure out which is my favorite tape. This or Alec Baldwin trying to be a radio talk show host. It was on the tape? Oh, the cowardly Schiff colluding with Russia to get dirt on Donald Trump. And literally it was a hoax but he didn't know it was a hoax. Naked Trump, naked Trump. Did you share with Putin? Of course, we share with Putin naked pics of Trump. He was actually speaking to a notorious Russian prankster he thought it was real this idiot. Real collusion. Listen."

The hypocrisy continues to the Obama administration, where they would actively use the State Department to comingled their activities with George Soros-backed groups and other countries to influence elections. It was actually Judicial Watch that had a great expose on this activity, the Obama administration engaged in the Balkans and we have also seen reporting where the Obama administration did this in Israel, and, of course, you have the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC actively working with the Russians."

You know, but going back to Hillary Clinton -- you know, she wasn't only getting dirt from Russia. She was getting cash from Russia. As secretary of state, she personally was getting money from the Russians through her husband's speaking fees. Cash and collusion from Russia, that's under investigation, at least in the collusion part, and it needs to be.

I just got back from Greece and even left-wing Greece has just rejected in its European parliamentary elections, the Socialist Party. So, the interesting question is why now does this eccentric Sanders think that he has a constituency. And I think part of it is %0.5 trillion in student debt indoctrination in the university.

You've made the point. Let me underscore, Hillary Clinton, the DNC paid for information. They paid for Russian information; it didn't come to them. They had a manufacturing. They paid for it. And then of course contact the FBI. Would that be the FBI that sent spies into the Trump campaign. It was leaking to the media. You know a little bit of history does help. I seem to remember Sean in the 1990s, the Red Chinese military poured millions of dollars into Bill Clinton's re-election, remember that the Riady Group and Johnny Chung and the rest, they were bringing bags of money, serial numbers into the DNC. Does anybody remember the media getting all worked up other than really the L.A. Times? I don't remember Nancy Pelosi getting worked up. You know they didn't even appoint a special counsel to investigate that. Now that's real interference. And we, American people, we're such pleas, we're so stupid, we're really supposed to believe that China wants Trump to win. So, they're going to give Trump information on Bernie Sanders. They would love Bernie Sanders. He's a kindred spirit. Or that the Russians are really happy with the way Trump is treating them. So, they're going to give him information to defeat Kamala Harris or the Iranians or the North Koreans. How stupid is that? The rest of America watches this and we laugh at the media. Or how about the great lion of the Senate, Ted Kennedy, who used surrogates to contact the KGB to try and defeat Ronald Reagan in his re-election in 1984 and Nancy Pelosi, who can forget Nancy Pelosi in 2007 undermining the Bush administration. George W. Bush running off to meet with a genocidal dictator, the father of the current genocidal dictator in Syria undermining our national security. Who can remember that Democrats speaker before that, Jim Wright running off to Nicaragua to meet Ortega, another genocidal communist? I mean the Democrat, it's a joke. Now I want to address one other thing too. You talked about Bernie Sanders. We have two plagiarists in the race on the Democrat side. Joe Biden, who's a well-known plagiarist, because he's too dumb to even say things on his own. But then there is Bernie Sanders, Bernie Sanders.

Article 119, citizens of the USSR have the right to rest and leisure, the institution of annual vacations with full pay for workers and employees and the provision of a wide network of sanatorium, rest homes and clubs for the accommodation of the working people. Article 120, bear with me, citizens of the USSR have the right to maintain (ph) old age and also in case of sickness or loss of capacity to work. This right is ensured by the extensive development of social insurance of workers and employees at state expense, free medical service for the working people and the provision of a wide network of health resorts for the use of the working people. One more, Article 121 of Stalin's Soviet Constitution 1936. This right is ensured by universal, compulsory, elementary education by education including higher education, being free of charge by the system of state stipends for the overwhelming majority of students in the universities and colleges. And it goes on a merit (ph). So, Bernie why did you come forward and tell everybody, you're stealing from Stalin in 1936. You're stealing - I know I'm not allowed to say this. I know I'm not allowed to say this, but for the Praetorian Guard media that protects the Left, that protects big government, big centralized government.

This conundrum was brought to us by the Third District Court of Appeals which has now overturned the 2017 convictions of five men with marijuana in their jail cells. The judge said when California voters legalized marijuana back in 2016 it included those behind bars. The court says the prisons will still have the ability to regulate cannabis possession just like cigarettes and alcohol. But now if inmates are caught with pot, it will no longer add to their prison terms. So, it's up to the Attorney General to decide whether to appeal the case to the California Supreme Court.
