So in this case by contrast they've now sued specific people in the media and they say these are the ones that refused to issue apologies or corrections. And in Kentucky where this was filed, it is more difficult to sue institutions rather than people and they also say that these were the most high profile. So the first lawsuit focused on the frenzied mob of social media, and the judge basically said that's irrelevant, it's unfortunate, but it doesn't matter. Here they're pointing to specifically and say these participants furthered it.

If you want to know how the national anthem was actually written, it was a poem. What exactly happened? The significance of the Battle of Baltimore. It really saved the country with Washington in tatters. We take a look inside like you've not seen before and find out what prompted Francis Scott Key to do what he did. Also, if you love the country and love Fox, August 9th, America great from the start, we're going to be streaming this on Fox Nation.

The media didn't go running immediately to them to say, what's your response? I think it was also smart for him to kind of continue, strategically, this culture where he's driving that wedge between the urban and suburban voters. I think it was huge but he highlighted the waste of spending on these inner cities, because as the Democrats right now are putting all their policies forth and how much money they're going to dump into continuing to solve or address these problems, he's highlighting all of this money that's going to it hasn't fix a thing. He should be careful, however, not to alienate the suburban voters that identify with those cities that they live near."

If you look at any devastated city, chances are you'll see the Democrat machinery behind it. But the big loser from last night was CNN, because there was no chance. And they were -- you could tell how crestfallen they were when no chance showed up because then what is going to be their primetime lineup? What is Don Lemon going to report on? He might have to do the news. Hard to believe. I think the big contrast is the rally and the debate. So you're witnessing this positive energy which is actually derived from real data. I mean, like, you can't be happy if the economy sucks. So you're seeing this rally, right? And everybody is having a good time. Then you look up at the stage of Tuesday and Wednesday and it's a doomsday cult. So on one side you've got happy feet, on the other side you've got Soylent Green, and I think that one of them is a delusion. And the data backs up one side. The other side, it's a feeling. So it's data versus a feeling."

You actually did have pragmatists on the stage as opposed to Democrats going after one another on Wednesday evening which just is not a good look for us, and does makes us, you know, weak overall. I want to go back to this issue, though, very quickly about the inner cities. It was interesting because, you know, I took a look at this, out of the hundred -- top 100 cities only 30 of those cities are actually have Republican mayors. So the question is, is this, you know, an issue of correlation or causality with Democrats because there's no question that there are big Democrat cities, Democratic mayors that are failing. But there're also rural areas that are lagging in everything from, you know, life expectancy to educational attainment and everything else. And as someone who represented a rural area, as well as suburban and urban, Democrats -- if we paid any attention to rural communities, they are so forgotten, there's so many people out there if we just paid attention to them --"

I believe that when the president pointed out, not naming the names is correct. When the president goes ahead and says urbans are the problem. Look who's running these cities. Look who's in charge, right. But the president has to go to the next step. Tell him what you'll do. Don't just say look how bad these cities are. Give these people hope. And maybe the hope is the opportunity zone because I hear they are producing results. Ben Carson is his worst P.R. agent. He's doing a lot of great things, but he's just not getting the word out. So now, Ben Carson over the last three days had his finest week of -- as HSS secretary -- the HUD secretary, because he's coming out and he using Baltimore as opportunity. So (INAUDIBLE) let me in charge of Baltimore, I see the potential in the urban areas. I see how people have underwhelming hopes for you and --"

Pick up the phone, called the head of Sweden, he goes, we got to go through a process, the next thing you know he's about heading home. Kim Kardashian actually picked up the phone and talk to him. And here's the thing about the president, people who get to know him understand. And probably didn't make it clear to Juan last night is that people who know him say they know for sure he's not a racist. There's nothing about him that is racist. Sometimes he can be racially insensitive as Tim Scott pointed out. Here's another example, he sees a person in trouble, he doesn't see a black person in trouble, and that's what people have to understand. He went after Elijah Cummings because Elijah Cummings went after his -- Kevin --. It wasn't because Elijah Cummings is black. That's what people in other networks and other parties have trouble understanding. You don't hurt his feelings because he knows he's not a racist."

That like all -- you know, every time you get a nickname from President Trump, it means you get some street credibility, you're going to go out on fund-raise on it. So, you know, if he's resurrecting Pocahontas as his Free Bird, I think it's unfortunate -- it plays into Elizabeth Warren's hand. I suggest he lay off."

It was the loudest the crowd was because it's a Gun's and Roses hit. I agree, however, the president is the president of everyone, right? And so it goes against, unfortunately, the narrative that a lot of the left have clung to which is, no, he's a racist no matter what.

And I think a lot of progressives and Democrats were disappointed with President Obama because he wasn't as progressive and didn't go as far as they wanted him to go at the time. So now that is all coming out and you're seeing it live on the debate."

      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Well, the people -- spoke to Barack Obama today and yesterday said he's exasperated not only because the fact that his eight years have been under scrutiny by his own party, but he said how far the party has moved left. It's amazing to me when you see someone like Rahm Emanuel come out and say, I just cannot believe this is your choice to attack a guy with 97 percent approval within the Democratic Party. I don't care if you think Barack Obama is the best of the worse, it's not to your advantage. If you want to criticize Joe Biden, simple, you're in charge of the $800 billion maybe more stimulus package, where did the money go? Number two is, it was your idea to supervise the Iraq pullout. You created ISIS. How did that go? Didn't you let down the president? That's the way you go at Joe Biden. You don't go at it by a popular president. Now, Bill Clinton, remember how popular he was and what role he played in between terms for Barack Obama, his speech saved Barack Obama's reelection, but now nobody wants Bill Clinton around, no one ever wanted Jimmy Carter around.

So at this rate they will be tearing down statues of Obama before they're even built, because that's where they're going. So that's number one. And number two, they're just proving by going after Obama they're just proving that Trump was right, these problems already existed before Trump became president. He's only been there for three years. Immigration, and health care, and deficits, and trade, all this stuff was there and some of it for decades. So maybe they're right to go after Obama. But the reason why they're going after right is because they've moved -- I hate to say this, they've moved the goal posts."

It's like -- I think there are other ways both in the attack and the defense on Biden's part for there to be an acknowledgment of the reality, which is, look, this isn't a savior but it's also not the anti-Christ.

Well, they keep fighting back in a big way. The teens filing a new defamation lawsuit against -- after 12 high profile people including Elizabeth Warren, the New York Times Maggie Haberman, and comedian Kathy Griffin, called them out and never apologized when the facts got in the way. Emily, let's go with you first. So the Washington Post had their --they're being sued. They had that lawsuit thrown out. What does it mean for these new lawsuits?"

So, the reason that first one was dismissed according to the judge, he basically said, look, embarrassing isn't defamatory, and this is a group, not about you, individually. And also they're appealing, so it's not quite done yet. And remember, they requested $250 million, right? It's quite sizeable. So in this case by contrast they've now sued specific people in the media and they say these are the ones that refused to issue apologies or corrections. And in Kentucky where this was filed, it is more difficult to sue institutions rather than people and they also say that these were the most high profile. So the first lawsuit focused on the frenzied mob of social media, and the judge basically said that's irrelevant, it's unfortunate, but it doesn't matter. Here they're pointing to specifically and say these participants furthered it. Final note, they're only requesting the cost of tuition at University of Kentucky for each of them, which is between $15,000 and $50,000."

And I think that's why this Covington thing has gotten so much attention, because I will say -- I will admit I was one of these people that retweeted this immediately, and then I found out more about it, and I immediately apologized via twitter.

Just to talk about how human behavior works, this is not an uncommon thing. You just don't realize that you're doing it. I was thinking about this -- an example that is much less devastating as you're washing your hands in the bathroom and the phone rings, it's a call that you've been expecting, you run to get the phone, it's your wife, she's at the train station, she's there alone, she needs to be picked up, so you wipe your hands off on your jeans, get your keys and you go. You get to the train station and then you remember you didn't turn off the water. The human brain can only handle one thought at a time. And when another thought comes in, it often knocks that thought out and it's gone, and that's what happened here. Something happened when he was driving that he got -- something hit him in the head and he just forgot the kids were there. This is a tragic, horrible thing, but he should not be prosecuted.

But she did something super kind. She posted his resume, on her online basically to her professional network. He got flooded with offers and he got a new job as a concrete grinder which I think that shows - you could just help someone a little bit, help him get a job, it's great economy right now.

It really saved the country with Washington in tatters. We take a look inside like you've not seen before and find out what prompted Francis Scott Key to do what he did.
