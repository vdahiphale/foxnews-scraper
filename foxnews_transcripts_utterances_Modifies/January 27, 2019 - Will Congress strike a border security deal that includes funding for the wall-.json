      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining us straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right here, Senator Lamar Alexander, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that determines how your tax dollars are spent.  We will discuss the temporary deal ending the government shutdown and whether Congress can negotiate a long-term bill for border security. Will President Trump ultimately have to declare a national emergency?  Plus, the ranking member of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes, here on why he's supporting the president's hard-line stance against Chinese trade abuses, how Democrats are plotting a course of oversight for the Trump administration.  Also, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise with us to discuss how Congress can come together to pass border wall funding. And I will speak with Utah Democratic Representative Ben McAdams this morning, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, about his support for a border barrier and how he's standing up to congressional leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  Also here, Mark Penn, reacting to the charges against former Trump associate Roger Stone. All that more as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  And we begin this morning with President Trump signing a short-term spending bill to end the partial government shutdown, this after competing measures to reopen the government both fell short in the Senate.   My first guest this morning is one of six GOP senators who voted for the Democratic plan without wall funding. Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is Republican Senator from Tennessee Lamar Alexander. He sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and serves as chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Sir, it's good to have you on the program. Thanks so much for joining us.",

We can do that, just as we did for President Obama, Clinton, Bush and Bush, and come up with a reasonable number for all of those things as part of comprehensive border security. Remember, even if all of the physical barrier, wall, that President Trump asked for were approved, we would still have about 1,000 miles of the southern border that wouldn't have any sort of wall on it, and he wouldn't have asked for any sort of wall on it.

At the same time, Bruce Ohr, the top career official in the Department of Justice, is acting like some kind of secret agent, meeting with this Clinton oppo guy, OK, who's digging up dirt. He's meeting, taking custody of this -- of this information, feeding it directly into the FBI and DOJ.

Also, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise with us to discuss how Congress can come together to pass border wall funding.

Also here, Mark Penn, reacting to the charges against former Trump associate Roger Stone. All that more as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin this morning with President Trump signing a short-term spending bill to end the partial government shutdown, this after competing measures to reopen the government both fell short in the Senate.

      "utterance": "Well, you are on the Appropriations Committee, sir. What would be the appropriate number to actually come up with the money for a border wall? And we know that, on the left, many of your colleagues just want to resist this president. Is that what Nancy Pelosi is doing, given the fact that we know in the past she has voted for border fencing barriers, like the one in her own state that we just looked at?"

      "speaker": "ALEXANDER",

We can do that, just as we did for President Obama, Clinton, Bush and Bush, and come up with a reasonable number for all of those things as part of comprehensive border security. Remember, even if all of the physical barrier, wall, that President Trump asked for were approved, we would still have about 1,000 miles of the southern border that wouldn't have any sort of wall on it, and he wouldn't have asked for any sort of wall on it. So this is a very reasonable request by the president. He's done what they asked him to do, which is to cooperate in opening the government. It's now time for them to be reasonable and do again what they have done for 20 years working with other presidents."

    {
      "speaker": "ALEXANDER",
      "utterance": "Actually -- actually, that's where it is now. And that's what we suggested three weeks ago. So we have a -- we have a conference committee. It include senators and House members. They're already structured. They -- they're ready to meet. They're the ones that have in the past approved as recently as last year in the Senate more technology, more personnel, more physical barrier. And so it'll be their job, then, to recommend to the House and the Senate and the president what a solution is. And they'd be smart not to recommend something the president couldn't sign, because, under the Constitution, if you want a law, the president has to sign it. So they will be checking with him and I'm sure checking with the leaders of the Senate and the House along the way. But it won't be this highly publicized stuff, where the president comes out and says wall, and Nancy comes out of her office in five minutes and says no wall."

Because we know that many of the incoming Democrat freshman congressmen actually are moderate, and they want to get things done. They signed a letter, sent it to leadership, saying, we don't want all of this bluster about investigations. We want to get things done for the American people. Will they have the influence? Will you have the influence in order to get this done, get it out of the fighting words, and actually toward border security, including a fencing?"

Now, the president, in the middle of the year, said, well, we have got a problem on the border that I didn't anticipate. We need another $7 billion. He's asked for $4.1 billion for a physical barrier of that. That's what the Congress will consider. That's what the conference will talk about. And the Republicans will support what the president asked for. The Democrats will say, well, I'm skeptical of that, but there's some other things I would like to see in immigration policy. You put the two things together and get a result. That's what we normally do. That's what we did with Presidents Obama, Clinton, Bush, and Bush. That's what we should do with President Trump."

The president's taken his. Now, step back and let the Congress come up with a result and allow it to happen. I mean, if we can't do it on this, we can't do it on anything. And, typically, we do this. I have worked on a great many issues, like fixing No Child Left Behind, where President Obama said, there are three things I want in the bill, or I won't sign it. So, OK, Mr. President, I read the Constitution. They will be in there, but give me some time to work out a bill that Republicans can support with a lot of things that we like that you probably don't like. And so we were able to do that. That's what we do. And the speaker should step back. And the president should too, actually. Give us these three weeks to try to get a result. I think we can."

There are processes in the Congress, in our government laid out by the founders to have debates like this. That's what Congress is intended to do. So let's open the government and then let's have this negotiation. The president has a proposal that should be heard in the Congress. We should debate it. And then we should work to build common ground and try and move forward a solution on border security, on immigration reform. And let's go through the proper channels of the Congress that are built and intended to have this exact conversation.

And much of it is politics, and they are resisting anything that he would like. We know that Nancy Pelosi and many of her colleagues voted for a wall and voted for wall fencing years ago many times. We know that there's a wall right now, a border wall, in Nancy Pelosi's own state of California separating Tijuana and San Diego. But because President Trump has the idea, it's resist, resist, resist. So you come from a red state. You beat out your opponent on the Republican side. Do you think there's a movement within your new Congress to actually get things done, putting politics aside, and not necessarily resisting everything the president says because you don't like his personality?"

Before I was elected to Congress, I was a mayor. And mayors just have this attitude of, OK, what can we do to move forward to solve the problem? As a Democrat in a very red state, I never got anything done unless I could reach out and build bridges across the aisle. So as long as the debate is focused on -- as long as we're defining a win as meaning somebody else loses, we're never going to have consensus. So we have got to find that win-win. And I don't know at this time what the win looks -- that win-win looks like, but we have to find it. And I know that a lot of my freshman colleagues are moderates who want to find that win-win, that probably we should look at some things to address immigration reform. And dreamers, I think, is something important, permanent protections for dreamers, but also border security. As a mayor, I saw illegal drugs and the impacts of that in my -- in my city. And I want to do more to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the -- into the country. So I think there's a lot of common ground. And I think the way to approach this, and the way that I would approach it if I was mayor, is to say, there's a conversation, a debate about wall or no wall.

They're wide-open areas. And, if illegals come in, you can actually apprehend them easily because it's so wide-open. But then there are other areas, like the wall we have been looking at in Nancy Pelosi's state separating Tijuana from San Diego, where you have a very dense population, three million people on one side of the wall, three -- in Tijuana -- another three million people on the other side of the wall in San Diego. So what is your thoughts in terms of how much is needed for actual -- a barrier on the southern border?

Now you look at Roger Stone, Roger Stone is kind of an odd political figure. He's one of these flamboyant guys who runs around and is kind of a press guy, kind of this type of guy, says a lot of things, and hangs out with some very scurrilous people. However, I think the Mueller investigation is really at the bottom of the barrel when they're looking at people like this, because we already found in our report that Roger Stone wasn't colluding with the Russians, which that was the original intent of all this. Remember, supposedly, Trump campaign operatives, so-called, were -- were colluding with Russians. They must be embarrassed that they actually have to come to House Republicans in order to have us give them the information, the transcripts, so that they go and get Roger Stone on a process foul that occurred in 2017 that Roger Stone himself is going to fight.

It's significant because, for the last two years, through press reports, and through testimony to Congress, the FBI, DOJ top leaders have continued to say that they didn't have the Steele dossier, the Clinton- and Democratic-paid-for dirt, they didn't have this until September, October, or they weren't sure when they got it. We know now when they got it. So, remember, at the end of July, they open up an investigation -- end of July of 2016, in the middle of a campaign. They use the intelligence services in this country, and they target the Trump campaign at the end of July. At the same time, Bruce Ohr, the top career official in the Department of Justice, is acting like some kind of secret agent, meeting with this Clinton oppo guy, OK, who's digging up dirt. He's meeting, taking custody of this -- of this information, feeding it directly into the FBI and DOJ. So I'm happy that they're -- that now DOJ is going to take seriously lying to Congress, that they're going to go after Roger Stone for lying to Congress and obstructing the congressional investigation. They need to start with themselves. They need to start with the former leadership of the Department of Justice and the FBI. If I were them, if you want to see lying to Congress, I would start with Strzok and Page, two of the investigators that were fired who hated Trump, didn't want to see him elected.

Is anyone going to do that at Department of Justice, FBI?

Now, remember, we don't have a police force, OK? And the Republicans, we're not even -- we don't hold the gavels anymore, right, in the House. So all we can really do is refer people to the Department of Justice for prosecution and for this to be investigated.

So, then -- so that was around April, May of 2017. You have to go all the way to August that they put another memo forward and gave direction to the special counsel. We have no idea what's in there, OK? I -- I'm just speculating here, OK? But I believe it's very possible that they used uncorroborated information that came from the Clinton campaign. And that could be in there as part of what they told the special counsel to do, which would be a major, major problem. Look -- and I don't know if it's in there or not."

We have got a meeting this upcoming Wednesday between U.S. and Chinese officials that we could see a deal happen before a March 1 deadline between U.S. and China. But the idea of espionage, I.P. theft, forced technology transfer, I spoke with Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials in China who oversees the financial services industry. Here's what he said when I asked him about a potential deal in terms of opening markets in China and other things. Listen to this."

The Polish government, as you know, have been in a very difficult spot in the world, right on the Russian border. And for them to -- and with an emerging economy, a growing economy, for them to take on the Chinese juggernaut, hats off to them for taking this issue seriously. So, what the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party. And, essentially, this is a dictatorship. There's very few people that own these companies. They weaponize them. So, when all over the -- all over the world, you have Chinese technology, specifically as it relates to infrastructure, communications infrastructure. They will go in, and they beat every other company around the world. And, in fact, they have driven a lot of companies out of business, because they come in and undercut. Now, how is that possible? It's not possible. But they want to have control over all the com systems, the communication systems all over the globe. And I think what the -- what the Poles realized that -- was that they were coming in, doing that to the Polish infrastructure. And we need to make sure that all of our allies around the world are not using this Chinese technology, until they're willing to be totally transparent..."

We know nothing is free, because they're tapping into your phone calls and your intelligence. Look, you just mentioned Russia.

And some are neighbors of Russia. Some are not. So there are differences. There are disagreements, also, for instance, on energy issues. But the strength of NATO is that, despite those differences -- for instance, on this pipeline from Russia -- we have always been able to unite in NATO around our core task, and that is that we protect and defend each other."

Why wouldn't Germany want to buy energy from the United States, now the number one producer, rather than being vulnerable to Russia, given what we know about the Russians?"

      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, with the current Russian aggression that's taking place all over the globe, and especially in Eastern Europe, it's amazing me that the Germans have not figured this out. After two World Wars, after the Cold War, you would think they would figure this out. They don't seem to care, which I think should bother everyone around the globe. The Germans are great allies of ours. They have a -- they have a big economy. But yet -- we were just talking about Poland. Poland, Romania, and others realize that, as long as the Russians and Putin are acting the way that they're acting, it is not OK for people within NATO to be striking deals that would make them reliant, totally reliant. That's the problem here, is, if you become reliant on a dictatorship like the Putin regime, you really put yourself and you put all of Europe in a very bad position. So, where does the gas need to come from? I think it needs to come from places like Central Asia, Azerbaijan, North Africa, and the United States. And where I think -- I believe that the Poland actually did already take in LNG, purchase LNG from the United States."

We have to have a real specific conversation about how much money they will support. The president said -- and it's not the president. It's our experts who protect the border who say it's going to cost $5.7 billion for all the technology, including wall. What are the Democrats willing to support?

You had committee chairmen on the Democrat side saying, give the president the money for the wall. And so I think this growing drumbeat got Pelosi nervous. But, at the same time, she's going to now have to confront it, because in every negotiation I have been in, when we have had meetings in the White House with the president, when pressed on, what amount of money will she support, she always said, I won't talk about numbers while the government is shut down. OK, now the government's back open. It's time to get serious about these negotiations. Hopefully, there is a State of the Union that happens in the next two weeks, which I think there will be. And the president can make even a stronger case to the rest of the country, because it's that growing support across the country that ultimately will push more Democrats to our side."

The State of the Union was supposed to be this Tuesday. It feels like Nancy Pelosi has bested the president, obviously. She now forced him to not have the State of the Union this week. I'm being told it's going to be February 5. Is the State of the Union happening on February 5?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Well, the -- Nancy Pelosi was holding the State of the Union hostage. And, ultimately, the speaker has to invite the president. The Constitution requires the president to give a State of the Union. It doesn't mean it has to be in Congress, but it ought to be in Congress. And, Maria, I'm hearing similar things, that February 5 is likely the date. But, ultimately, that's something that's up to the speaker of the House, if it's going to be in the House chamber, which it should be. I thought it was disgraceful that she removed the State of the Union from the invitation that she had already issued to the president, to say that she was going to uninvite him. That had never happened before in the history of our country. I think Nancy Pelosi is afraid of the country hearing this message that the president has about why we need to secure the border."

Nancy Pelosi, I thought, was very petty in uninviting the president from the original date that they agreed upon. I think she ought to do it quickly. I think, early next week, she ought to send a letter out formally inviting the president. February 5 is a date that seems to work well. But do that quickly. End the charade. And, frankly, I think it's -- it's something the American people look at in a very negative way when they look at Nancy Pelosi trying to hold the State of the Union hostage as part of this debate over border security."

And here you have the lawyer who funded it sitting right there. You have Christopher Steele, who lied to the FBI about his press contacts.
