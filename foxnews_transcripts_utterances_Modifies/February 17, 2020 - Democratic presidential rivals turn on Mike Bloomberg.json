The president is up for a big Las Vegas rally the day before the Nevada caucuses, which are on Saturday.  And instead of putting their full focus on Trump, 2020 Democrats, they're going after each other, this time setting their sights on Michael Bloomberg and his campaign spending.",

And I defended it with people I like. And I will defend it with Bloomberg, who I'm kind of indifferent towards. But I would say that if, like, if you examine the statement that he made, it's in an audience that understands the statement. And when you take it under context, it means something else. So I'm going to take a statement that he made that now everybody is saying is really bad. So in 2011, he said that there is an enormous cohort of young black and Latino men who don't know how to behave in the workplace.  All right, that's sounds terrible. Everybody is talking about it. But then the context is he was speaking to PBS, while introducing $127 million program to help minority guides get jobs. So what he was saying was how do you -- why is that program necessary, because there's an issue. And so he explains why there is an issue and he's trying to remedy the issue. So it's not fair to anybody when you -- right, left, middle, to keep to keep pulling these things out. The problem with the Democrats is -- or the left, actually, not -- they can't pass their own standards anymore, because you have a pocket of intersectional activists who think everybody is oppressed or -- and you are the oppressor.

The Beast is 22,000 pounds of badassery. And having our American president leading the NASCAR race, the biggest race of the season and meeting all of those --- we had Brian -- Clint Bowyer who was saying, you know, I judge people on how they treat me and others I'm with. And the President in that moment, shook my hand. He was nice to everyone. He took selfies with us. He did everything we wanted him to do. He was a regular guy who was excited about being there.

We had them on Fox earlier. We're so excited about it. So definitely go and hang out near Charlotte. This Saturday in particular, they're releasing its first-ever charitable beer, the Red Line Ale. All proceeds going to the Kannapolis chapter of the firefighters burned children's fund. If you go anywhere near the area, definitely pop in for a drink or two.

And I defended it with people I like. And I will defend it with Bloomberg, who I'm kind of indifferent towards. But I would say that if, like, if you examine the statement that he made, it's in an audience that understands the statement. And when you take it under context, it means something else. So I'm going to take a statement that he made that now everybody is saying is really bad. So in 2011, he said that there is an enormous cohort of young black and Latino men who don't know how to behave in the workplace. All right, that's sounds terrible. Everybody is talking about it. But then the context is he was speaking to PBS, while introducing $127 million program to help minority guides get jobs. So what he was saying was how do you -- why is that program necessary, because there's an issue. And so he explains why there is an issue and he's trying to remedy the issue. So it's not fair to anybody when you -- right, left, middle, to keep to keep pulling these things out. The problem with the Democrats is -- or the left, actually, not -- they can't pass their own standards anymore, because you have a pocket of intersectional activists who think everybody is oppressed or -- and you are the oppressor. So they are applying today's -- I said this on Friday, they're applying today's standards to decisions that one makes in the past. And you can't do that."

Number two, before stop and frisk, people would complain, activists and politicians and media would complain, that people only care about crimes if it happens to a white person. Hence, the missing white girl gets attention but the black boys in Atlanta didn't, the young black boys that -- so that was a big criticism. So New York City decides we are going to focus on minority neighborhoods and get the crime out of there. That's racist, too. So if you focus, you are racist. And if you don't care, you are racist.

You can either defend them or somehow explain them away, which a lot of people on his behalf are doing. But I think when you stand back and look at the trend. It belies that demeaning attitude or simply the selfish attitude that up until now, the entire Democratic Party was saying that they were trying to get away from. They didn't want another New York, self-centered, narcissistic, you know, fly over country hating person. And that's exactly what this person is representing himself to be in all of those video clips and the book about him and everything. It's not just one comment where you're, like, OK, is that enough. There is a ton that sort of belie that type of I'm better than you personality, infirming and everything. And I think it's interesting what Klobuchar said, which is look, you are beating us in the ads, sure. But you are not going to beat us on the stage.

No, they were looking for a savior, not a stripper. After all, where is their spotlight now? So the media got snookered because like a remote tribe thinking an empty Coke bottle falling from the sky came from the gods, their desperation made them credulous. So hooray for self reflection, but remember these suckers just spent three years calling you suckers for supporting the president. So see this as a rare moment.

When they would complain about media bias, it was people like Sam Donaldson that would say how dare you accuse us of media bias. When Newsweek ran that -- the whimp cover about George H.W.

And it was so important for me to be that appropriate ambassador and represent that organization because it was all larger than me. And that's how I felt about this. How incredible for the president to be at the Daytona 500, and to meet people and to be among people who don't live in D.C., who don't have that sort of everyday access that a lot of journalists do, who scoffed at this. And we saw a tweet by Maggie Haberman, right, and she was saying, using the official apparatus of the government for what appears to be a political event. No, you know what that was? The Beast is 22,000 pounds of badassery. And having our American president leading the NASCAR race, the biggest race of the season and meeting all of those --- we had Brian -- Clint Bowyer who was saying, you know, I judge people on how they treat me and others I'm with. And the President in that moment, shook my hand. He was nice to everyone. He took selfies with us. He did everything we wanted him to do. He was a regular guy who was excited about being there.

We had them on Fox earlier. We're so excited about it. So definitely go and hang out near Charlotte. This Saturday in particular, they're releasing its first-ever charitable beer, the Red Line Ale. All proceeds going to the Kannapolis chapter of the firefighters burned children's fund. If you go anywhere near the area, definitely pop in for a drink or two. Buy one for first responders and our military, and also follow them on social media which I believe is a RealOldArmorBeer on Instagram or wherever you can find them.
