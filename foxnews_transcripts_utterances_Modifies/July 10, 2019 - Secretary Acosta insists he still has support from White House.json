Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Jonah Goldberg, fellow with the American Enterprise Institute. So Acosta was there today for an hour taking questions, explaining the decision that he made, but really he was there trying to save his job. Did he do an adequate job of explaining it? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": So no apologies, no regrets, refused to address the question of whether he would act differently today, blamed others, didn't take responsibility for himself. But it doesn't matter if it was persuasive to anybody else. It only matters whatever it was persuasive to President Trump, because whether Secretary Acosta keeps his job depends 100 percent on whether the president satisfied with his explanation. And if the political costs get too high, I think that it's hard for secretary Acosta to depend on President Trump's goodwill to keep them in the job.",

The \"Miami Herald\" reporter said the police report, which was heavily redacted, had over 100 jane does in it. There was plenty of evidence to go on. This whole thing stinks.
