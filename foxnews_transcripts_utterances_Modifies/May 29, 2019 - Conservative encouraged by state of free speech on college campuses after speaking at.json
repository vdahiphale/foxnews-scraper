Didn't quite deliver on expectations, then makes a hash of an investigation, maybe Mueller's predecessors FBI chief James Comey. He had a big press conference of his own, you may remember it.

Spying as some have called it. That's now under investigation too.  Comey continues to insist no wrongdoing there, but he's already admitted to leaking memos about his conversations with the president in order to trigger the naming of a special counsel. Now, that special counsel he teed up is all but urging Democrats to impeach the president. By saying the president was not charged, but maybe he broke the law. Well, the president's personal attorney has something to say about that. Rudy Giuliani is standing by to react to Mueller, Comey, and the investigation of the investigators.

The incident happened the day after Thanksgiving which is four months before a Chinese woman carrying all kinds of electronic equipment was arrested for lying to get into Mar-a-Lago. This time around, 18-year-old University of Wisconsin freshman Mark Lindblom was visiting his grandparents in Palm Beach. The grandparents belong to a tennis club that shares a beach with Mar-a-Lago. Lindblom He says he walked down the beach. Spotted the president's resort and went into a tunnel that leads to the resort. Lindblom then joined some members who were waiting in line to go through a metal detector. The 18-year-old says the Secret Service scanned him and waived him in. He spent the next 20 minutes wandering the grounds, taking pictures on his cell phone before he was finally confronted. This week, a very apologetic Lindblom told the judge that he just wanted to see how far he could get and had no evil intentions. But again, it brings into question the Secret Service's ability to protect the president when he is staying at Mar-a-Lago. Government officials have already acknowledged the Secret Service does not decide who comes in to the resort. Although agents do conduct surveillance and physical screenings. In March, 33-year-old Yujing Zhang was arrested at Mar-a-Lago for claiming that she was attending a non-existent event. She was carrying computer malware along with an electronic device that detects hidden cameras. She also had electronics in her hotel room and she is still being held in jail. Today, Mark Lindblom was given probation after a judge ruled his stunt was a youthful indiscretion. And breaking right now, federal prosecutors have sent subpoenas to Mar-a- Lago seeking information about Cindy Yang. She is a South Florida massage parlor owner who promoted events at Mar-a-Lago as a way to meet the president. The question is now whether she broke campaign finance laws by funneling money from China to the president's re-election campaign. The president and his campaign are not target of this investigation.

After two years, I can't say he accomplished either goal. This feels deeply unsatisfying.\" Where have we seen this before? A one-time FBI chief with a saintly image, how to get the goods? Didn't quite deliver on expectations, then makes a hash of an investigation, maybe Mueller's predecessors FBI chief James Comey. He had a big press conference of his own, you may remember it.

So, think of it this way, after Comey's mishandling of the Clinton probe, he moved onto investigating President Trump. Comey and other senior officials oversaw surveillance of Trump advisors. Spying as some have called it. That's now under investigation too. Comey continues to insist no wrongdoing there, but he's already admitted to leaking memos about his conversations with the president in order to trigger the naming of a special counsel. Now, that special counsel he teed up is all but urging Democrats to impeach the president. By saying the president was not charged, but maybe he broke the law. Well, the president's personal attorney has something to say about that. Rudy Giuliani is standing by to react to Mueller, Comey, and the investigation of the investigators.

And then, as you pointed out, he tossed it to Congress. You know, we now have a duty -- I think to take this to the next step, get the full Mueller report, have Don McGahn and others come in and testify. Have special counsel raise his right hand and layout for the American people."

To get the full Mueller report, have the special counsel come in, have the witnesses testify, prepare for impeachment. But recognize that this is an extreme remedy.

And if you're so innocent, why hide the unredacted report and prevent testimony? #RunningScared.\" So, I want to ask you, first of all, when you say hide the unredacted report.

How could you trust any member of Congress without others (INAUDIBLE) it? That's why -- that's why it's a real problem.

      "speaker": "SWALWELL",

Again, this isn't how innocent people act. Innocent people say -- you know what, I didn't do anything wrong, you could spend all the time you want investigating me and you going to find nothing. But that's not the case."

But is it he -- and you -- and other Democrats continuing that because if the president can't go to trial and clear his name, you're just continuing what might be false charges against an innocent man?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWALWELL",
      "utterance": "Here is how I think we can fix that. Because Mueller is saying, because he can't charge him at the crime, he's prohibited from doing that. That applies to no other American, only to the president, he can't talk and smear the president because he can't defend himself. Mueller is actually being honorable here. If the president is so innocent, he would order today the Department of Justice to lift that policy that says a president can't be indicted. And then, if Mueller has a case, he would bring it. But the president is not innocent, so he's not going to do that. I've promised, as president, day one, I would order the attorney general to lift up protection, so no future president is immunized that way."

I mean, the idea that the charge on the United States can turn over information to them, and not be in violation of the law, it's just a fiction that they're all presenting to the American people. Because they're lying to the American people. The attorney general has turned over 98 percent of the obstruction report, if not 99 percent. Even Mueller said today that the report has been largely or very largely seen, he knows there's nothing. I've read the report, you've read the report. The redaction are like this. Maybe a third of them, a footnotes."

Maybe half a percent because half of that percent are footnotes. Second, Mueller today just said what the report said. To make this into, oh my God, now we have that not a single new fact, no smoking gun. Not even a single new nuance. I mean, it's the same old story. End result for a prosecutor which obviously, he was not very good at is number one, no collusion. Well, that immediately that what that says to you is we just had 2-1/2 years of two investigations of entirely unfair, a waste of taxpayer money, and certainly justifies a man in defending himself."

If nothing, it's not reasonable doubt. So, he can't get to the level of even making a charge. You know what that means every place else in America, under American law unless you want to change it? It means you're not guilty. All prosecutors ever do is determined is there enough evidence to charge something? I never heard of exonerating someone. I never heard of it.

So I have no idea what she's talking about. But when given the choice, she had to I-words in that meeting. She could focus on infrastructure or impeachment and it is very clear they are going down the road of impeachment, most Americans don't want that.

I don't know why the radical left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a $40 million report that states loud and clear and for all to hear no collusion, no obstruction. How do you obstruct a no crime? Dems are just looking for trouble and a do-over. So he said there, Mueller said no obstruction, but then today, your colleague, your boss Sarah Sanders said something different. The report was clear. There was no collusion, no conspiracy, and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction. The point being that you may be shifting the goalposts.

Very smart guy, I know Chuck (Inaudible) says it will cost 32 billion -- 32 trillion -- excuse me, and but save $2 trillion in medical costs by cutting reimbursements to healthcare providers by 40 percent. But $32 trillion over a decade is a lot of money. And it's going to require significant increases.

They get dumped into a new single payer healthcare plan. We have lines, we have rationing. We cut -- we cut payments to healthcare providers. Hospitals, doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals by 40 percent in order to bring it in to line with Medicare. Who thinks that a lot of these struggling rural hospitals?

You tell people that what's going to happen that they lose all their private coverage. That there will be lines, that their taxes are going to go up, that healthcare professionals are going to be paid less. And this entirely flips. They won in 2018 by saying they are going to take away your pre-existing conditions and they are going to be get -- the Republicans are going to be irresponsible with big changes in healthcare.

The incident happened the day after Thanksgiving which is four months before a Chinese woman carrying all kinds of electronic equipment was arrested for lying to get into Mar-a-Lago. This time around, 18-year-old University of Wisconsin freshman Mark Lindblom was visiting his grandparents in Palm Beach. The grandparents belong to a tennis club that shares a beach with Mar-a-Lago. Lindblom He says he walked down the beach. Spotted the president's resort and went into a tunnel that leads to the resort. Lindblom then joined some members who were waiting in line to go through a metal detector. The 18-year-old says the Secret Service scanned him and waived him in. He spent the next 20 minutes wandering the grounds, taking pictures on his cell phone before he was finally confronted. This week, a very apologetic Lindblom told the judge that he just wanted to see how far he could get and had no evil intentions. But again, it brings into question the Secret Service's ability to protect the president when he is staying at Mar-a-Lago. Government officials have already acknowledged the Secret Service does not decide who comes in to the resort. Although agents do conduct surveillance and physical screenings. In March, 33-year-old Yujing Zhang was arrested at Mar-a-Lago for claiming that she was attending a non-existent event. She was carrying computer malware along with an electronic device that detects hidden cameras. She also had electronics in her hotel room and she is still being held in jail. Today, Mark Lindblom was given probation after a judge ruled his stunt was a youthful indiscretion. And breaking right now, federal prosecutors have sent subpoenas to Mar-a- Lago seeking information about Cindy Yang. She is a South Florida massage parlor owner who promoted events at Mar-a-Lago as a way to meet the president. The question is now whether she broke campaign finance laws by funneling money from China to the president's re-election campaign. The president and his campaign are not target of this investigation.

Instead of a default to emotion which is sort of standard way that people are reacting these days. So that was very encouraging. And the second piece was conversations that occurred after, you know, the on-stage moments were actually very productive and suggested that there is really maybe a chilled conservative undercurrent in a lot of these places. One of the things I reminded people and I think it's easy to forget, is that people like Ronald Reagan who I worked for as well as Colin Powell and others they didn't take, they don't take conversations.

I mean, and now in the cool of the aftermath expose facto they look back and said, that was possibly obstruction of justice when he went to the White House counsel and said to fire the special counsel.

And the reason he didn't do it, I mean, I'm guessing, I haven't psychoanalyzed the president of the United States. But I think that he -- because he is think skinned, because he is tempestuous, he gets so angry at the Democrats for accusing him that his first instinctive move is to say, there was no interference with our elections.
