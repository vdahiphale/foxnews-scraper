Tonight, part two of our exclusive interview with the leading voice of conservatism in America, the one and only Rush Limbaugh. Tonight we will ask him about the deep state, the liberal, main stream, drive-by-media as he calls them. Robert Mueller overreaching Russia investigation and so much more. Also, the president's son Eric Trump, he will join us right here in studio. And I have a special message for all of you tonight. But first, after coming under fire from President Trump for disrespecting our flag, our national anthem and the military, the NFL finally appears they may be getting the message. We're going to cover all of this in tonight's very, very important opening monologue.  So, the President, he is refusing to back down in his standoff with the NFL over the national anthem protesters. And if last night's game is any indication, the league may finally begin to start seeing how offensive and disrespectful the actions of some players, coaches and owners really are too many fans. Now during the national anthem of the Bears-Packers game, players stood. They locked arms. Now, certainly an improvement over what we saw last weekend but a lot of fans, they are still not liking this. And President Trump, he reacted to what happened at the game earlier today. Take a watch.",

Now, take a look at some of the signs that fans were holding. \"Protest on your own time, not on my dime.\" Here is another. And it simply reads \"we stand.\" Another fan held up an American flag. I say good for them. You know what? It's really not that hard to see what is going on here. In business, don't you have to serve all of your customers? The NFL is now making a killing during football season. Now, you include the price of tickets, parking, beer, what is it, $15 a beer? Hot dogs, jerseys for the kids. A family of four, they are spending what? Seven, 800 bucks to go to one single game? It is a big deal for them. Now people spend that kind of money because they want to have a good time.  Not necessarily see players making political statements that they likely disagree with in some cases. And when the fans are holding up signs and they're shouting at the protesters on the field and booing them and disagreeing with them, well, I only see one solution for the NFL. Listen to your customers. Serve your customers. Or you risk losing your customers. A brand new Fox News poll shows a majority of you, the American people, you agree with the President on this issue.   Fifty five percent say, it is inappropriate to kneel during our national anthem. Now the Pittsburgh Steelers apparently are finally listening to the fans. And one of their well-known players is now saying that the team will in fact stand for the anthem this Sunday. Now, this comes after every player on the team stayed in the locker room last week except for one. And that was the former army ranger Alejandro Villanueva. Now, the Saints quarterback Drew Brees, he tweeted this, as a way to show respect to all, our Saints team will kneel in solidarity prior to the national anthem and stand together during the anthem. Okay. That's great. The team is choosing to stand. And will not disrespect the flag or the anthem. But let's unpack this for a second here. Now, the Saints game is going to be played on foreign soil this weekend. In London. In England. Now should American sports team like you saw last weekend really be making political statements like that over the seas? When the Jaguars and Ravens played, let's see, they kneeled for the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" the national anthem and they stood for \"God Save the Queen.\" Now, like I have been saying, until things change with the NFL, Saturday is now my day for football. Also, while NFL players did not protest before the anthem last night, take a look at what Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said after the game. Watch this.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. I got a news flash for Aaron Rodgers, other players, politicians, members of the media claiming protests have nothing to do with the flag, the national anthem or the military. Okay, take a look at what Colin Kaepernick, the guy that started all of this said back in 2016. Quote, \"I'm not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football. And it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people are getting literally, paid leave and getting away with murder.\"   So unlike the false narrative that is being spread around, Kaepernick's protest was all about the flag. But, of course, the main stream media, they are never going to tell you about that. Just like he had socks that he was wearing that portrayed police officers as pigs. Why? Because it goes against the political talking point of the left. There is also this stunning headline from the \"Washington Times.\" Quote, \"Colin Kaepernick donated $25,000 to a group honoring a convicted cop killer.\" Now, the cop killer they are talking about is Joanne Chesimard, she has escaped prison and fled to Cuba after being convicted of murder back in the 1970s. Now, we checked with Kaepernick's own website and it does confirm he donated $25,000 to that group. Where is the outrage over that? And the socks? Where are the protests?  We did invite Colin Kaepernick on the show. We are told he is not doing interviews at this time. He is open airways right here. Colin, come on the program. Also tonight, the NFL is showing stunning hypocrisy over the issue. Now, take a look at this quote from an article written by Mark Thiessen that we showed you earlier in the week. The NFL's game operations manual, their own manual says, quote, \"All players must be on the sideline for the national anthem. They must stand at attention. They must face the flag. Hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking or face discipline. Such as, fines, suspensions, and/or forfeiture of draft choices. First offense.\"  So, according to that, the NFL's own rules say the players should be standing for the national anthem. And if that is the case, then the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, all he has to do is enforce his league's own rules. But it doesn't appear he is willing to do that. Goodell this week met with owners and players to talk about the controversy. But take a look at a portion of this news report.  A Giants player said that, quote, \"Goodell didn't push for players to stop kneeling during the anthem.\" And by the way, according to ESPN, FOX Sports, other outlets, that meeting only consisted of NFL owners, players and personnel. It doesn't appear that veterans or veterans groups were there to give their side of the issue. Now the NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, he reportedly said earlier this week he expects his players in the NBA to stand for the national anthem. So, why is Roger Goodell afraid to do the same? Now, according to a legal analyst, even from liberal fake news CNN, Goodell could easily stop the protests. Look at this headline. There is no constitutional right to take a knee while you are at work. The lawyer argues, rightly so, the constitution only protects against the government. Not employers from infringing upon Freedom of Speech rights. And there is also the fact that players who kneel for the national anthem, they are being praised, of course, by the left wing media, the political left in this country.  But remember, when former NFL quarterback -- remember Tim Tebow? Remember, he was kneeling to thank God and to pray. Pretty good role model. Remember how he was mocked and ridiculed and accused of only doing it for attention? See, that is the thing. The left, they love to cite Freedom of Speech when it protects whatever issue they are peddling, whatever narrative they like, whatever their ideology is.   But when it comes to somebody like Tim Tebow and he wants to express his religious freedom, thanking God, then it's a huge issue. It shouldn't be allowed. It's a huge double standard. And by the way, we will continue to expose it. Here now with reaction, the author of \"Liberalism\" or \"How to Turn Good Men in Whiners, Weenies and Wimps,\" former NFL player Burgess Owens and former NFL player Spencer Tillman with CBS. Saturday is my game day, Spencer. Big-time! You know, we need unity in this country. And by the way, both of you are friends. I love and admire both of you. We need unity. And if you are in Afghanistan and you want to watch an NFL game and you are fighting for the right, average player gets $2.4 million a year and you are making less than 40 grand a year. And you have to see people, you are risking your life and see people take a knee during the anthem and the flag that you are fighting under. How do you think they feel, Spencer?",

We come to the line of scrimmage of our circumstances. We identify threats, we call players to give us the best chance to succeed against those threats and then we execute the play. The problem here is we have not identified with the problem is. It's not disrespecting the flag or the anthem. It's the coopting of a message.

Seventy percent of black men forsake their marriage. These are the kind of conversations we need to have. Because it leads to hopelessness, it leads to anger.

And he is making a calculation that there are far more people in middle class than there are in the one percent which is an easy calculation to make. The conservatism -- and I don't even mean pure. The conservatism philosophy across the board, no class envy. Talk about how great America is. Talk about how this will spur economic growth, which will benefit everybody. You don't make victims out of some and demons out of other. You look at the country as one giant economic engine that you have to ignite. But if you are going to leave people out of your primary effort to cause growth, then that is populism. That is not conservatism.

Tonight, part two of our exclusive interview with the leading voice of conservatism in America, the one and only Rush Limbaugh. Tonight we will ask him about the deep state, the liberal, main stream, drive-by-media as he calls them. Robert Mueller overreaching Russia investigation and so much more. Also, the president's son Eric Trump, he will join us right here in studio. And I have a special message for all of you tonight. But first, after coming under fire from President Trump for disrespecting our flag, our national anthem and the military, the NFL finally appears they may be getting the message. We're going to cover all of this in tonight's very, very important opening monologue. So, the President, he is refusing to back down in his standoff with the NFL over the national anthem protesters. And if last night's game is any indication, the league may finally begin to start seeing how offensive and disrespectful the actions of some players, coaches and owners really are too many fans. Now during the national anthem of the Bears-Packers game, players stood. They locked arms. Now, certainly an improvement over what we saw last weekend but a lot of fans, they are still not liking this. And President Trump, he reacted to what happened at the game earlier today. Take a watch."

Now, take a look at some of the signs that fans were holding. \"Protest on your own time, not on my dime.\" Here is another. And it simply reads \"we stand.\" Another fan held up an American flag. I say good for them. You know what? It's really not that hard to see what is going on here. In business, don't you have to serve all of your customers? The NFL is now making a killing during football season. Now, you include the price of tickets, parking, beer, what is it, $15 a beer? Hot dogs, jerseys for the kids. A family of four, they are spending what? Seven, 800 bucks to go to one single game? It is a big deal for them. Now people spend that kind of money because they want to have a good time. Not necessarily see players making political statements that they likely disagree with in some cases. And when the fans are holding up signs and they're shouting at the protesters on the field and booing them and disagreeing with them, well, I only see one solution for the NFL. Listen to your customers. Serve your customers. Or you risk losing your customers. A brand new Fox News poll shows a majority of you, the American people, you agree with the President on this issue. Fifty five percent say, it is inappropriate to kneel during our national anthem. Now the Pittsburgh Steelers apparently are finally listening to the fans. And one of their well-known players is now saying that the team will in fact stand for the anthem this Sunday. Now, this comes after every player on the team stayed in the locker room last week except for one. And that was the former army ranger Alejandro Villanueva. Now, the Saints quarterback Drew Brees, he tweeted this, as a way to show respect to all, our Saints team will kneel in solidarity prior to the national anthem and stand together during the anthem. Okay. That's great. The team is choosing to stand. And will not disrespect the flag or the anthem. But let's unpack this for a second here. Now, the Saints game is going to be played on foreign soil this weekend. In London. In England. Now should American sports team like you saw last weekend really be making political statements like that over the seas? When the Jaguars and Ravens played, let's see, they kneeled for the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" the national anthem and they stood for \"God Save the Queen.\" Now, like I have been saying, until things change with the NFL, Saturday is now my day for football. Also, while NFL players did not protest before the anthem last night, take a look at what Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said after the game. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "AARON RODGERS, GREEN BAY PACKERS QUARTERBACK",
      "utterance": "It's never been about the national anthem. It's never been about the military. We have, we are all patriotic in the locker room. We love our troops. This is about something bigger than that. An invitation to show unity in the face of some divisiveness from the top in this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. I got a news flash for Aaron Rodgers, other players, politicians, members of the media claiming protests have nothing to do with the flag, the national anthem or the military. Okay, take a look at what Colin Kaepernick, the guy that started all of this said back in 2016. Quote, \"I'm not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football. And it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people are getting literally, paid leave and getting away with murder.\" So unlike the false narrative that is being spread around, Kaepernick's protest was all about the flag. But, of course, the main stream media, they are never going to tell you about that. Just like he had socks that he was wearing that portrayed police officers as pigs. Why? Because it goes against the political talking point of the left. There is also this stunning headline from the \"Washington Times.\" Quote, \"Colin Kaepernick donated $25,000 to a group honoring a convicted cop killer.\" Now, the cop killer they are talking about is Joanne Chesimard, she has escaped prison and fled to Cuba after being convicted of murder back in the 1970s. Now, we checked with Kaepernick's own website and it does confirm he donated $25,000 to that group. Where is the outrage over that? And the socks? Where are the protests? We did invite Colin Kaepernick on the show. We are told he is not doing interviews at this time. He is open airways right here. Colin, come on the program. Also tonight, the NFL is showing stunning hypocrisy over the issue. Now, take a look at this quote from an article written by Mark Thiessen that we showed you earlier in the week. The NFL's game operations manual, their own manual says, quote, \"All players must be on the sideline for the national anthem. They must stand at attention. They must face the flag. Hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking or face discipline. Such as, fines, suspensions, and/or forfeiture of draft choices. First offense.\" So, according to that, the NFL's own rules say the players should be standing for the national anthem. And if that is the case, then the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, all he has to do is enforce his league's own rules. But it doesn't appear he is willing to do that. Goodell this week met with owners and players to talk about the controversy. But take a look at a portion of this news report. A Giants player said that, quote, \"Goodell didn't push for players to stop kneeling during the anthem.\" And by the way, according to ESPN, FOX Sports, other outlets, that meeting only consisted of NFL owners, players and personnel. It doesn't appear that veterans or veterans groups were there to give their side of the issue. Now the NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, he reportedly said earlier this week he expects his players in the NBA to stand for the national anthem. So, why is Roger Goodell afraid to do the same? Now, according to a legal analyst, even from liberal fake news CNN, Goodell could easily stop the protests. Look at this headline. There is no constitutional right to take a knee while you are at work. The lawyer argues, rightly so, the constitution only protects against the government. Not employers from infringing upon Freedom of Speech rights. And there is also the fact that players who kneel for the national anthem, they are being praised, of course, by the left wing media, the political left in this country. But remember, when former NFL quarterback -- remember Tim Tebow? Remember, he was kneeling to thank God and to pray. Pretty good role model. Remember how he was mocked and ridiculed and accused of only doing it for attention? See, that is the thing. The left, they love to cite Freedom of Speech when it protects whatever issue they are peddling, whatever narrative they like, whatever their ideology is. But when it comes to somebody like Tim Tebow and he wants to express his religious freedom, thanking God, then it's a huge issue. It shouldn't be allowed. It's a huge double standard. And by the way, we will continue to expose it. Here now with reaction, the author of \"Liberalism\" or \"How to Turn Good Men in Whiners, Weenies and Wimps,\" former NFL player Burgess Owens and former NFL player Spencer Tillman with CBS. Saturday is my game day, Spencer. Big-time! You know, we need unity in this country. And by the way, both of you are friends. I love and admire both of you. We need unity. And if you are in Afghanistan and you want to watch an NFL game and you are fighting for the right, average player gets $2.4 million a year and you are making less than 40 grand a year. And you have to see people, you are risking your life and see people take a knee during the anthem and the flag that you are fighting under. How do you think they feel, Spencer?"

I have not found one sound bite of Colin Kaepernick saying that I'm not a shield for Colin Kaepernick. I am not defending him. What this was originally about, because I remember calling this game, it began in the pre-season of 2016. It was really a protest for what Colin Kaepernick saw was injustice. The killing of several unarmed African-Americans who had difficult exchanges with the police officers. So, law enforcement being the impetus of it, he decided to at the time sit down and not kneel."

We can go back and cherry pick those situations but that is not what this is about. Let me tell you quickly what this is about. In football we have a strategy and approach to solving problems. We come to the line of scrimmage of our circumstances. We identify threats, we call players to give us the best chance to succeed against those threats and then we execute the play. The problem here is we have not identified with the problem is. It's not disrespecting the flag or the anthem. It's the coopting of a message. Colin Kaepernick was protecting something that had nothing to do with the flag."

He is one of them that we need to be talking about. Thirty percent of the black populations, yet, 40 percent of violent crime is by the black men. And by the way, 93 percent of that is against black people. We have not talked about that. How about this? Eighty three percent of our black teen males are unemployed. And this has been for years. Seventy percent of black men forsake their marriage. These are the kind of conversations we need to have. Because it leads to hopelessness, it leads to anger. When men are not taught to be men, they look at themselves in the mirror and they will rebel. And what we have right now is we have all these black men that now riding around in the cars thinking that because I'm black, I am going to be pulled over and not be treated right. And instead of understanding what it is to be respectful, to understand its authority and you can just as easily diffuse a situation and not being targeted. We have a problem with our loyalty black class in this country who live the great American dream and tell other people they can't because of the racist white people against them.

And yes, that was initiated by the left. But once again, let's come full circle. I want the African- American home to be full and solid. And full of those Christian values that make us right and wrong. But here is the problem. We have to look ourselves in the face and many of us are more Republican than we are Christian. We get wrapped up in our ideology. And I'm a conservative telling you that. Yes. I want strong homes but let's go back and get the narrative proper. Colin Kaepernick made some atrocious mistakes in his identifying what the problem was. The pigs on the socks was asinine. It was absolutely ridiculous and it was dangerous.

Add that on top of the private jets he used here at home. Total travel tab since May about $1 million.

If what I am told is true and if the President is the reason upper brackets are not going to get any relief, then it's pure populism. He is simply saying where is the majority of people that I can get the most support from? And he is making a calculation that there are far more people in middle class than there are in the one percent which is an easy calculation to make. The conservatism -- and I don't even mean pure. The conservatism philosophy across the board, no class envy. Talk about how great America is. Talk about how this will spur economic growth, which will benefit everybody. You don't make victims out of some and demons out of other. You look at the country as one giant economic engine that you have to ignite.

The Republicans are weak, many of them as you point out, and I think they want him to fail. You have a never Trumper crowd. And then the media. All aligned against him. Ever seen it this bad?"

But I have never seen -- Trump is really exposing the people that do run or think they run this country. They are scared to death. They are angry. They feel betrayed by the election. And what they are demonstrating is, they are perfectly willing, perfectly willing to get rid of Trump any way they can and overturn the results of the election simply because they don't like it. The way the Mueller investigation is, it's a prelude to finding crime or misdemeanor that might be impeachable or creating a process run. Funny about the Mueller investigation, but I hear they can't find a crime. There wasn't a crime to start with as there should have been. What they are finding is crimes on the Democrat side. Trying to sweep aside. Hillary and the rigged primary against crazy Bernie. Never forget, folks, Trump runs the Department of Justice right now. So nothing is over until Trump does something with it. So chin up about that."

There is not a thing that the left doesn't try to take control over influence that does not become politicized. When that happens it becomes corrupted. Liberalism corrupts. Intelligence community look at what they are doing. They are actually making things up, like the Trump dossier. Whatever they can do to force the president out of office or kindle support among his voters and supporters and I think it's corruption on display. Most of it is coming from big government liberal types. But beyond that, it also, the establishment itself, I know that is a word that is thrown around. But it is the people that run the country. You don't know them. We don't know the leader is. Elected members are part of it. But they are not the power base. Elected people are told what to do. They are given the money and the donations and so forth. All this is being exposed."

I saw a news story that a little potbelly Dictator Kim Jong-un is so confused by what Trump is saying that he is calling Americans in Washington to help them understand. What is Trump saying? You keep it up, and you are not going to exist. You keep it up, and you are going to regret it. He calls, \"what does he mean?\" the people he is calling don't know. Trump is a foreign object to these people. Politics in one way so phony, it's the art of not saying what you really mean. Trump comes along, says what he means and then doubles down on it. That is why people around the country are cheering and standing up. He talks the way they do. Not in diplo-speak or political speak. He gets in, gets it and gets out. All of that is intimidating. All of it. It upsets the natural order of things the way politics is talked about. Foreign policy, especially. I love it when I think about all these people state department, Trump says to the North Korean guy, you keep it up and you don't exist. This is the way people talk to each other. The guy apparently has gotten the message if he is calling here trying to figure out what Trump means. That means he has got the message. Does he really mean -- yes, he does."

The president has taken them on. I watch it and, Rush, they never talk about the forgotten men and women and the people in poverty on food stamps that need jobs. What the election what about. It's Russia, Russia, Russia, Conspiracy, outright lies, calling the president a lie and if you said on your radio show half of what is said daily about then President Obama, the whole left wing in the country would have tried to fire you."

Sean, I don't watch CNN, MSNBC. I used to for show prep. I have banned all content from MSNBC on my show. Why promote that garbage? It just makes me mad. I don't watch it.

This is another great example of him fighting for his country. Not just fighting for taxes or better healthcare or fighting for best military. He is fighting for something that means a tremendous amount to the nation, to the people of the nation. That is the American flag. That is patriotism. There is plenty of time for protest, right? But just keep that one minute time it takes to sing the national anthem, keep it sacred. There is another 23 hours and 59 minutes in a day.

That is the divisiveness of the world we live in. How about a simple thank you. Thank you for the books.
