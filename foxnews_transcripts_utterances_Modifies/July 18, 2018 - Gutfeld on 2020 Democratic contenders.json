Perhaps we've figured out that the worst things about politics are politicians. And if we learned anything from 2016, it's that nothing will ever be the same. You can't go home again. And if you're a Democrat, that includes retirement homes. So, yes, they need a new face, especially one that knows the issues. My choice?",

Check out their ghosts of candidates past: Biden, Hillary, Bernie -- a cross between \"The Three Stooges\" and \"Cocoon.\" The only way to get out that vote is to deliver walkers door to door while yelling fire. Biden, he thinks Amtrak is a success. It loses a billion a year. Hillary, everyone loves a rematch, but everyone also loves a winner -- the only thing she's won is ridicule. It's less a rematch and more of remake of \"Bride of Chucky.\" And Bernie, a relic pushing another relic called socialism. He's likable but his beliefs are toxic. He's like those delicious berries you pick that poison your whole tribe. And we can't forget Liz, can we? But as someone who is 2 percent Native American, I have reservations. I can say that. I'm Native American, part of me. Not sure what part though. So, Dems want somebody new, somebody different. Where could they have learned this?"
