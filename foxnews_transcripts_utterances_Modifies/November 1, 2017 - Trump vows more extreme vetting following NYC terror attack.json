It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Nine victims remain hospitalized, four in critical condition, following a deadly terror attack in New York City since 9/11. Eight killed and a dozen injured by a jihadi who mowed them down with a truck and then shouted Allahu Akbar. We have more information today about the suspect, his motive and how he came to America. The immigrant from Uzbekistan was allowed into the country in 2010 on a diversity visa, President Trump now bowing to end the lottery program.",

As he just mentioned, President Trump said he is in the process of terminating the program because he favors a merit-based approach, not a program like a lottery that traditionally tilt in favor of countries with historically low rates of emigration. We learned today the suspect was among the maximum 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the state department program, and about 24,000 people have entered the U.S. from the country of Uzbekistan since 2005, and that's where the suspect was born. Also, today, two sources telling Fox News that the suspect had connection to individuals who already known to law enforcement. At that New York City briefing earlier today, the deputy commissioner for counter terrorism explained the suspect was running with a very suspicious crowd. Meantime, new photos obtain by Fox News give you a better sense of New Jersey's Omar Mosque and the focus of multiple lead after 9/11. The suspect's brick apartment building is virtually on its doorstep. You see it right there with the mosque, the white building in the distance. A former federal investigator with PENTTBOM, that's the code name for the 9/11 file, said the area is about four to five bucks from 9/11 hijackers and ring leader Mohamed Atta's apartment, as well as where the Mosul hijackers were located, and they finalized the 2001 plot. So this area remains very much a nest as it was described to us, or an enclave for radical teaching. Dana?",

      "sentences": "Well, we talk about political opportunism, but the real political opportunism after terrorism is the application of Islamophobia. If anybody expresses concern over radical Islam, you get in trouble. And there's this conflict now where you have -- today, you have the mayor and you have the governor saying they're 8 million people in New York City. There's a million pairs of eyes. If you see something, say something. But you can't say something in this current climate because you will lose your job. This guy was already on our radar. He was interviewed by the feds in 2015 because he had links online to certain kinds of bad groups. But why didn't they go after him? Maybe they were scared that they were going to lose their job. They're going to lose their jobs. And this is how everybody feels. I'm tired of this hypocrisy where they say, if you see something, say something, because they really don't want you to do anything. Because the moment you do something, you are -- you're labeled Islamophobic, you're labeled a bigot. So you look at what Trump does, the media does this, the leaders do it about Islamophobia, he doesn't. He is the closest to the ground of any president I've ever seen talking about the actual sincere fears of the average citizen. You know, there's things that -- I know I'm not going to like his tax plan, I don't understand his 401(k) stuff, it's going to drive me crazy, but his response -- and this is the most important thing, his response to the presence of terror is so much more important to the reaction after terror.  When you see Cuomo, and you see Mayor de Blasio, and everybody else saying how strong New York is, and how we're going to have that parade, that's -- who cares? It's about your response before the attack. Your willingness to admit that there is the presence of terror before terror strikes. It's no good afterwards to get sympathy after it happened. It doesn't matter. What matters is having the guts to say, it's here, how do we get rid of it, and then you get targeted for Islamophobia. So it takes guts to say what he is saying, to talk about the diversity visa is important. Diversity untethered to merit is of no value.",

My last point is, it is a coincidence that this happened on Halloween, but there's a metaphor there that has been used before that when your kids come home with a bag of candy, the parents vetted. They go through it, they make sure nothing's bad in there because they took something outside and they brought it inside and the parents go through it, and they look through it, and that's not absurd.

The government keeps saying they're going to come back. We're going to see more of these attacks at home. Well, we have to see something, say something program after 9/11.

So I think one of the ways is to change the frame of mind is that you have to untethered this simply from a religious aspect because that's what hamstringing our media. Whenever you want to preplan against terror, you're Islamophobic. So if you are to see this as a brain contaminated disease, which is what it is. It's a brain -- it turns people into homicidal zombies. If you look at it that way, the first thing to think about is quarantine, found out who these people are, quarantine them, and talked to their families and their relatives, and if this is what it is, they've got to go. That's how you do it. But if it's tethered to religion it's a bad thing. The other thing we have to talk about is that these truck attacks are common, but it's going to get worse. My worry is that there's going to be a worse method of attack that will marry technology and terror. What we're talking about is terror change. Every year there is a terror change, an increase in proficiency and killing. If the media cared as much about terror change as climate change we'll be a lot better off. People have to be looking at this in a different way, not as something that conflates with Islam, which is what the media does, not with the people who are fighting this thing. It's the media that conflates with Islam, which then paralyzes people from actually thinking about what to do.",

Eight killed and a dozen injured by a jihadi who mowed them down with a truck and then shouted Allahu Akbar. We have more information today about the suspect, his motive and how he came to America. The immigrant from Uzbekistan was allowed into the country in 2010 on a diversity visa, President Trump now bowing to end the lottery program."

As he just mentioned, President Trump said he is in the process of terminating the program because he favors a merit-based approach, not a program like a lottery that traditionally tilt in favor of countries with historically low rates of emigration. We learned today the suspect was among the maximum 50,000 people allowed into the U.S. every year under the state department program, and about 24,000 people have entered the U.S. from the country of Uzbekistan since 2005, and that's where the suspect was born. Also, today, two sources telling Fox News that the suspect had connection to individuals who already known to law enforcement. At that New York City briefing earlier today, the deputy commissioner for counter terrorism explained the suspect was running with a very suspicious crowd. Meantime, new photos obtain by Fox News give you a better sense of New Jersey's Omar Mosque and the focus of multiple lead after 9/11. The suspect's brick apartment building is virtually on its doorstep. You see it right there with the mosque, the white building in the distance. A former federal investigator with PENTTBOM, that's the code name for the 9/11 file, said the area is about four to five bucks from 9/11 hijackers and ring leader Mohamed Atta's apartment, as well as where the Mosul hijackers were located, and they finalized the 2001 plot. So this area remains very much a nest as it was described to us, or an enclave for radical teaching. Dana?"

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, we talk about political opportunism, but the real political opportunism after terrorism is the application of Islamophobia. If anybody expresses concern over radical Islam, you get in trouble. And there's this conflict now where you have -- today, you have the mayor and you have the governor saying they're 8 million people in New York City. There's a million pairs of eyes. If you see something, say something. But you can't say something in this current climate because you will lose your job. This guy was already on our radar. He was interviewed by the feds in 2015 because he had links online to certain kinds of bad groups. But why didn't they go after him? Maybe they were scared that they were going to lose their job. They're going to lose their jobs. And this is how everybody feels. I'm tired of this hypocrisy where they say, if you see something, say something, because they really don't want you to do anything. Because the moment you do something, you are -- you're labeled Islamophobic, you're labeled a bigot. So you look at what Trump does, the media does this, the leaders do it about Islamophobia, he doesn't. He is the closest to the ground of any president I've ever seen talking about the actual sincere fears of the average citizen. You know, there's things that -- I know I'm not going to like his tax plan, I don't understand his 401(k) stuff, it's going to drive me crazy, but his response -- and this is the most important thing, his response to the presence of terror is so much more important to the reaction after terror. When you see Cuomo, and you see Mayor de Blasio, and everybody else saying how strong New York is, and how we're going to have that parade, that's -- who cares? It's about your response before the attack. Your willingness to admit that there is the presence of terror before terror strikes. It's no good afterwards to get sympathy after it happened. It doesn't matter. What matters is having the guts to say, it's here, how do we get rid of it, and then you get targeted for Islamophobia. So it takes guts to say what he is saying, to talk about the diversity visa is important. Diversity untethered to merit is of no value."

The first is that you have to choose between proper vetting, more vetting of people, foreigners coming into the country, or nothing at all because you would be bigoted to do so and you're going after minorities as a result. The second thing that they're saying is, well, it's on the American people and the country to be more welcoming to -- particularly of Islamic immigrants to come to this country, because if you aren't then they're not going to assimilate, and therefore, they may go into terror and turn to terror as if that's a justification for something like this happening.

But we also have to admit the fact that they have friends and that they have relatives, and we have had two examples, the Boston bombing were brothers, and in San Bernardino it was a husband and wife. So we have to understand that this is a family thing, it's a tribal thing. It's an ideology. So it infects a lot of different people. My last point is, it is a coincidence that this happened on Halloween, but there's a metaphor there that has been used before that when your kids come home with a bag of candy, the parents vetted. They go through it, they make sure nothing's bad in there because they took something outside and they brought it inside and the parents go through it, and they look through it, and that's not absurd. To do that is not absurd it's what a parent does. Applying that logic right now in a changing world when the outside is coming in with a pernicious ideology, the razor blade in the apple is radical Islam. You have every right to vet."

The sources are saying that the suspect does not show remorse for the attack, that he is being cooperative. So that possibly could be the reason the FBI is seeking information about a second person. So we're going to have all of that for you in this hour. He may have acted alone, but all indications are the New York City terror suspect was inspired by ISIS.

He was inspired by videos by al-Baghdadi, he's the ISIS imam that everybody tries to follow and emulate. He said he choose Halloween because he thought they'll be more pedestrian.

The second part is I think Governor Cuomo is terribly misleading. He went out and said there was no evidence now that this was part of a larger conspiracy, a larger plot. Authorities knew almost immediately he left a note in the truck saying he's part of ISIS. This is a very big attack on the United States."

We talked about this on Dana's show a little bit earlier today, but we keep hearing as ISIS loses territory as we've just discussed, that these fighters are going to disperse and go elsewhere if they're not already dead. First of all, that means that we need to know who's coming out of the country as you've said, but also what does that mean for the war coming back home? The government keeps saying they're going to come back. We're going to see more of these attacks at home. Well, we have to see something, say something program after 9/11. We implemented a whole bunch of different ways that people could spot terrorism after 9/11. Things have changed. There tactics have changed. And so, I think that they need to make it clear to people what do you do when you see someone like this, acting like this, see someone watching these videos on their phone, and how do you react if you see someone running down the street with a truck? And are there ways that you could be vigilant in your everyday behavior that don't make you paranoid, but make you actually just more aware of what you're dealing during the day."

But, you know, it does show you that this person followed instructions which means that the ideology actually leaps oceans -- a wall can't stop this. So I think one of the ways is to change the frame of mind is that you have to untethered this simply from a religious aspect because that's what hamstringing our media. Whenever you want to preplan against terror, you're Islamophobic. So if you are to see this as a brain contaminated disease, which is what it is. It's a brain -- it turns people into homicidal zombies. If you look at it that way, the first thing to think about is quarantine, found out who these people are, quarantine them, and talked to their families and their relatives, and if this is what it is, they've got to go. That's how you do it. But if it's tethered to religion it's a bad thing. The other thing we have to talk about is that these truck attacks are common, but it's going to get worse. My worry is that there's going to be a worse method of attack that will marry technology and terror. What we're talking about is terror change. Every year there is a terror change, an increase in proficiency and killing. If the media cared as much about terror change as climate change we'll be a lot better off. People have to be looking at this in a different way, not as something that conflates with Islam, which is what the media does, not with the people who are fighting this thing. It's the media that conflates with Islam, which then paralyzes people from actually thinking about what to do."

And people act crazy in this cult, and let's go after them there. But you know what?

That's not in keeping with our constitutional protections.\" But I don't think it was necessarily a bad idea, per se. If you're saying let's look at the pattern. But it's just that, as in the case of this diversity program, I think it's 50,000 visas, Katie. Fifty thousand, right? That's like -- in terms of green cards, that's nothing."

And the direct result of Islamophobia phobia, is that you actually think that the aftermath of a terror attack is worse than the terror attack. It's like the first thought when the bodies hit the ground are \"Oh, they're going to be mad at the Muslims.\" So that's kind of -- that's a strange place to go, because irrational anger over Muslims now takes priority over carnage. But the carnage has already happened. The irrational anger hasn't yet. That leads to more terror attacks, because you're denying the reality, the reality of these actual attacks. Prevents you from thinking about preventing these attacks, and this all goes back to the pernicious identity politics."

Why is that even something that is part of the talking right now? And that doesn't allow us to actually get to the issue, and it's a distraction from getting at the issue of actually solving the problem. Right? But who has appointed all these media people and these pundits as experts on what Islam is? I know an expert on Islam. His name is al-Baghdadi, and he's the ISIS leader. And he has a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies from the University of -- or the Islamic University in Baghdad. So if we're going to talk about experts, I think that when you look at this guy, who as we know now, was inspired by al-Baghdadi directly on his cell phone, if you want to look at what Islam is teaching, maybe you should look at who he was inspired by, who has a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies."
