The vice president also in Iowa doing that. The RCP average, Real Clear Politics average in this Democrat nomination, as you see there, Joe Biden still ahead, Elizabeth Warren in second barely over Bernie Sanders. CNN has a new poll where Biden increases his lead a bit, and Kamala Harris drops down there to the fourth position.  Of course, we have another poll in Iowa at the Iowa State Fair. This is the cast your kernel presidential poll at the Iowa State Fair, something new this year, it has never happened before. Almost exactly as many fair goers voted for a Democrat as a Republican. President Trump received just over 32,000 kernels. Democrats split about 33,165. Joe Biden had 8,143 kernels. Elizabeth Warren, second most kernel. We just wanted to bring you that because it's the Iowa State Fair. Let's bring in the panel: Charles Hurt, opinion editor for The Washington Times; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com and host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio.  OK, Guy, what about you hear Dr. Biden, there, Dr. Jill Biden, you hear the vice president, former vice president on the trail, maybe I don't hit everything that you want to hit, but I'm the guy who can do it.",

That is the calculation, and it might be clumsy, it might be a little ham-handed for her to say it quite that openly. But if you look at that same CNN poll that you just referenced, 54 percent of Democratic voters said that their number one priority is beating Donald Trump even if they have to give up a few issues. So that's exactly the case that she's making, and she's appealing to precisely those voters. So I actually think it's an argument that makes sense. Of course, the trouble would be if he then slips in the polls and someone else comes ahead of him, then the whole raison d'etre for the campaign completely falls apart from under them.
