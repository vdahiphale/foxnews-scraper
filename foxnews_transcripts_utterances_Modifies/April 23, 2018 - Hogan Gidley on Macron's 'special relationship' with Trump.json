We're digging to get the real story behind the driver who mowed down pedestrians on a crowded street today in Toronto. Plus, despite the left narrative that migrants don't come here for handouts, we will tell you about a shocking new report on the number of immigrants now on welfare. Also, black conservatives are speaking their minds and the pc police are in total freak out mode. Wait until you hear Tom Arnold's insane rant. Trump fires back against critics who seem to fear he might actually make historic deal with North Korea. But first Trump versus the GOP again. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" When will they learn? More than a year into President Trump's first term, you would think all the Republicans would understand that the only way forward is to unify behind his agenda. It's resonating with the people. It's bringing international foes to the negotiating table, and it's having a positive impact on the economy. Some Republicans cannot help but lend aid and comfort to the president's political enemies. As Trump slowly but surely begins to remake the GOP to be more responsive to working-class Americans, the globalist wing of the party is still in total denial. The old guard's resistance to Trump, of course, big shocker is being amplified by a media machine that's been trying to take him down since he first came down the golden escalator. Watch how uncomfortable some of these Republicans are when pressed about whether they would support the president again in 2020.   SEN. BOB CORKER, R—TENN.: Any Republican senator that hasn't been conflicted over this presidency is either comatose or is pretty useless.",

They mirror those of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at about the same point in their presidency. Today's Gallup reports that among registered voters, 37 percent believe Trump should be reelected. That is the same percentage that that Barack Obama should be reelected in 2010. At one point, lower than those who supportive Bill Clinton. Last time I checked, both Obama and Clinton were reelected for a second term, right? Here is another leading indicator that the Democratic National Committee might be in some trouble. They took out a $1.7 million loan in February. They are fundraising, it is pathetic. There Republican national committee took in $39 million in the first quarter alone. Do you think that might be because of the president? Of course, the president has some work to do. He has to grow the populist movement, take his message to unfriendly territory, and sell it. That means even in states where he didn't win. Grow his base.The Democrats are in perpetual teardown resistance mode, Trump should be perceived as a doer. He is, a leader who will always defy and drain the swamp will not be defeated by it. That's what he was elected in the first place.   All the president needs to do is just a focused on what matters, growing the economy, returning more power to the people, fighting corruption along the way, and refusing to be distracted or detoured by the constant and tedious demonization game of Washington and the seemingly endless pointless investigations. I know that's easier said than done but he needs to do that. Listen to all the naysayers. Trump's reelection prospects and those of his party are on more solid ground than the media or his critics would have you believe. That's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now for reaction in New York is Monica Crowley, a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research along with Juan Williams, cohost of \"The Five.\" Great to see you. Juan, you wrote a column lately about the GOP disunity and cited Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham, who were trying to protect Bob Mueller from any type of firing or other adverse action by the executive branch, by the president specifically. Thom Tillis has always had a wisdom, in his wisdom. He has never liked President Trump. Terrible on the issue of immigration, bad on the trade issue as far as Trump is concerned. Why are we surprised that Thom Tillis and Lindsey Graham, they are not populist conservatives, are doing this Mueller deal. That is not surprising to me at all.",

In his committee, no matter what Donald Trump has to say, no matter what the Senate majority leader has to say. He thinks it's necessary. What Thom Tillis said, speaking to other Trump supporters and evidence of a crack finally in the uniform, stonewall Republicans have given Trump and made the Republican Party into the party of Trump.

The same people who criticized me for filing this bill would be absolutely angry if I wasn't pounding the table if the bill was directed at protecting the special counsel looking into Hillary Clinton. I actually am someone who believes that the executive actually has the authority to fire someone in the executive branch. I'm not saying it would be politically wise. I don't think it would be, but the idea that Congress can insulate an executive branch member from firing by the chief executive is frankly unconstitutional. I think Mike Lee is right about this.

The way we would look at, in Israel, and the reason being is I don't see it fundamental, political or fundamental or ideological motivation yet. You said that the attacker had, it was reported he was Armenian. I agree with you it's predominately Christian country. They are not directly associated with terror, as we are in Israel with how we investigate terror. There is no doubt this guy was in a specific place for a specific reason to do direct harmonic crowd of people, (inaudible) a very crowded, popular part of Toronto. I have been in and out of there for the last two months doing different training projects. What I did notice is that the vehicle was rented which is a terror red flag. The fact of the individual came out of the car and from what we've heard was waving some type of object around. We don't know if it was a gun or some weapon. That's another red flag. But what I will say is the way that you investigate terror and what I'm not seeing from the Toronto police services here. The way you investigate this type of attack at the beginning really sets the tone for a proper terror quality investigation. If you don't treat it as an act of terror early on, it affects the tone of how the investigation is carried out. That's what was concerning. Reluctant to call this terrorism. Whereas in Israel, everything is a terror attack when it involves attacking a large crowd of people, and then you can deduce backwards.

Gentlemen, great to see you both. Steve, here are some key findings. New immigrants remain twice as likely to live in poverty. New immigrants on Medicaid increased by 11 percent. The share of new immigrants living in households receiving food stamps tripled. That's from 2007 to 2017. Immigrants have been here five years or less.

For most people, those first five years of war and they were starting over or beginning a new phase of their lives wasn't necessarily an indicator, a successful indicator of what their life's trajectory was going to be. So we may see some undocumented illegal immigrants on government services, but that's not a reflection of the long-term trends. And second, obviously it's a contentious issue. People have very strong opinions on both sides. But just as a point of law, our government, our Congress made certain policy decisions. For example, the government decided with programs, for example, like the Children's Health Insurance or things like food stamps, that they were available to all children regardless of immigration status.

Also, black conservatives are speaking their minds and the pc police are in total freak out mode. Wait until you hear Tom Arnold's insane rant. Trump fires back against critics who seem to fear he might actually make historic deal with North Korea. But first Trump versus the GOP again. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" When will they learn? More than a year into President Trump's first term, you would think all the Republicans would understand that the only way forward is to unify behind his agenda. It's resonating with the people. It's bringing international foes to the negotiating table, and it's having a positive impact on the economy. Some Republicans cannot help but lend aid and comfort to the president's political enemies. As Trump slowly but surely begins to remake the GOP to be more responsive to working-class Americans, the globalist wing of the party is still in total denial. The old guard's resistance to Trump, of course, big shocker is being amplified by a media machine that's been trying to take him down since he first came down the golden escalator. Watch how uncomfortable some of these Republicans are when pressed about whether they would support the president again in 2020. SEN.

They mirror those of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton at about the same point in their presidency. Today's Gallup reports that among registered voters, 37 percent believe Trump should be reelected. That is the same percentage that that Barack Obama should be reelected in 2010. At one point, lower than those who supportive Bill Clinton. Last time I checked, both Obama and Clinton were reelected for a second term, right? Here is another leading indicator that the Democratic National Committee might be in some trouble. They took out a $1.7 million loan in February. They are fundraising, it is pathetic. There Republican national committee took in $39 million in the first quarter alone. Do you think that might be because of the president? Of course, the president has some work to do. He has to grow the populist movement, take his message to unfriendly territory, and sell it. That means even in states where he didn't win. Grow his base.The Democrats are in perpetual teardown resistance mode, Trump should be perceived as a doer. He is, a leader who will always defy and drain the swamp will not be defeated by it. That's what he was elected in the first place. All the president needs to do is just a focused on what matters, growing the economy, returning more power to the people, fighting corruption along the way, and refusing to be distracted or detoured by the constant and tedious demonization game of Washington and the seemingly endless pointless investigations. I know that's easier said than done but he needs to do that. Listen to all the naysayers. Trump's reelection prospects and those of his party are on more solid ground than the media or his critics would have you believe. That's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now for reaction in New York is Monica Crowley, a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research along with Juan Williams, cohost of \"The Five.\" Great to see you. Juan, you wrote a column lately about the GOP disunity and cited Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham, who were trying to protect Bob Mueller from any type of firing or other adverse action by the executive branch, by the president specifically. Thom Tillis has always had a wisdom, in his wisdom. He has never liked President Trump. Terrible on the issue of immigration, bad on the trade issue as far as Trump is concerned. Why are we surprised that Thom Tillis and Lindsey Graham, they are not populist conservatives, are doing this Mueller deal. That is not surprising to me at all."

In his committee, no matter what Donald Trump has to say, no matter what the Senate majority leader has to say. He thinks it's necessary. What Thom Tillis said, speaking to other Trump supporters and evidence of a crack finally in the uniform, stonewall Republicans have given Trump and made the Republican Party into the party of Trump.

The same people who criticized me for filing this bill would be absolutely angry if I wasn't pounding the table if the bill was directed at protecting the special counsel looking into Hillary Clinton. I actually am someone who believes that the executive actually has the authority to fire someone in the executive branch. I'm not saying it would be politically wise. I don't think it would be, but the idea that Congress can insulate an executive branch member from firing by the chief executive is frankly unconstitutional. I think Mike Lee is right about this.

There's definitely some prints here that closely resemble the mosaic of terrorism. I wouldn't go so far as to directly stamp it as an act of terror. The way we would look at, in Israel, and the reason being is I don't see it fundamental, political or fundamental or ideological motivation yet. You said that the attacker had, it was reported he was Armenian. I agree with you it's predominately Christian country. They are not directly associated with terror, as we are in Israel with how we investigate terror. There is no doubt this guy was in a specific place for a specific reason to do direct harmonic crowd of people, (inaudible) a very crowded, popular part of Toronto. I have been in and out of there for the last two months doing different training projects. What I did notice is that the vehicle was rented which is a terror red flag. The fact of the individual came out of the car and from what we've heard was waving some type of object around. We don't know if it was a gun or some weapon. That's another red flag. But what I will say is the way that you investigate terror and what I'm not seeing from the Toronto police services here. The way you investigate this type of attack at the beginning really sets the tone for a proper terror quality investigation. If you don't treat it as an act of terror early on, it affects the tone of how the investigation is carried out. That's what was concerning. Reluctant to call this terrorism. Whereas in Israel, everything is a terror attack when it involves attacking a large crowd of people, and then you can deduce backwards.

The share of new immigrants living in households receiving food stamps tripled. That's from 2007 to 2017. Immigrants have been here five years or less.

For one thing, as you touched on, we are talking about new immigrants which he defines people who have been in this country for less than five years. Now just in general terms, I would encourage you, ma'am, or many of the viewers to think back to say when they first graduated from high school, after they first got married, their first few years after college. For most people, those first five years of war and they were starting over or beginning a new phase of their lives wasn't necessarily an indicator, a successful indicator of what their life's trajectory was going to be. So we may see some undocumented illegal immigrants on government services, but that's not a reflection of the long-term trends. And second, obviously it's a contentious issue. People have very strong opinions on both sides. But just as a point of law, our government, our Congress made certain policy decisions. For example, the government decided with programs, for example, like the Children's Health Insurance or things like food stamps, that they were available to all children regardless of immigration status. So when we do see immigrants and undocumented people using these, they are entitled by law."

Maybe some of them actually will and that's fantastic, but overall we have to make some hard choices. We only have a limited budget.

She wants to ignore the history that got us to where we are today and walk all over the civil rights icons that allow her now to be able to say the things she does."

Kanye West can have an opinion that differs over time just like anybody else. And standing up for Candace, who said nothing -- nothing Candace said -- by the way, college campuses would never let me or Larry Elder or some of the people on.

And there is a lot of ifs, but for the president not to get even a modicum of praise or respect for the fact that we are at least taking a different approach to North Korea with all of the predictions of global unrest and he's going to start World War III, this is something. This is quite something."

It was the fact that he was willing to push hard that brought the Chinese to the table supporting U.S. driven Security Council resolutions and squeezing them on sanctions. That concerned the North Koreans, it got them to show up at the Olympics. It got them to be willing to engage with the South Koreans. The Chinese have summits that they have never had before, and also agreed to suspend missile testing and nuclear testing without offering anything from the United States. We have offered them a summit. They want that. It provides legitimacy. But if you ask who has done more bending so far, the North Koreans or United States, it's clearly the North Koreans. That's very far from saying we are going to get to denuclearization on the part of Pyongyang, but absolutely there's more of a chance that we see a breakthrough today than there was six months ago."

It's a politicized price. We have known that for a long time. I do believe that there's more of a chance we end up blowing each other up, but I also think there's more of a chance that we get to a real resolution. I think people need to understand that so far, on North Korea, the signs of been more positive."

Again, we've had both a Democratic and a Republican president over the course of the last decade that has allowed the North Korean situation to only get worse, more nuclear capabilities, more missile capabilities, more cyber capabilities. Finally we get the Chinese to the able, we get the North Koreans to the table.

There were no capitalists that I grew up with because they had no capital. And I think the reason why so many people are willing to vote against the establishment in the United States is because they feel like both on economics, on culture, on security, on technology, on every issue that the establishment left and right has been talking about that they have been left behind. And I have seen a lot of people over the last year, year and a half, been willing to blame Trump for the us versus them that we are facing right now with the country when in reality us versus them is responsible for Trump."

The latest target of campus censorship and the epidemic there is renowned professor emeritus Burt Folsom of Hillsdale College. An approval committee at Davidson College in North Carolina tried to ban him from delivering a lecture on campus. The committee's excuse, they claim the lecture would not be academic enough. Let's bring in Spencer Brown. He's a spokesman for the group that invited the professor to speak, Young Americans for Freedom. We have other stories to get to as well. They ultimately, Spencer, allowed him to speak on campus but not at that particular venue which is bigger and they put him off to the side somewhere. They said you can speak over here, the unwashed professor. What's going on?"

But what surprises us continually is the excuses that liberal administrators use in order to shut these speakers down. Here we have Davidson College telling that Burt Folsom who at one point had the number one bestselling history book in the country is not academic enough to speak on the main part of their campus, it's just ridiculous."

What is your take on the lack of basic understanding of whether it's the Constitution or basic, recent American history? It is a constant demonization of Trump or the propaganda machine on college campuses for like $50,000 a year a lot of these places."

And instead they're not learning critical thinking skills. They're not learning how to defend their ideas. They are just being fed this pabulum of leftist ideology. So what you see here is these students who don't know why they may support or oppose this policy. All they know that if Trump supports it must be bad. Whereas if you had asked it the other way around, if Obama had supported it, they would say was the greatest thing since sliced bread."

When he did it was necessary. It's classic. This is classic uninformed, God bless them, uninformed college students who learn it from the first time from some radical history professor. Then at G.W. University right nearby where we are, the Democrats, some of the college Democrats are not participating in some type of bipartisan discussion summit last week. They don't want to be bipartisan?"

They don't want the free and open exchange of ideas because they know when that happens the best ideas rise to the top and the flawed ideas, the left's ideas will fall off. And so what you see here is basically their goal is to allow a situation only where leftist ideas are heard, because they know when conservative policies and solutions are offered, those are going to be the ones that students pick."
