House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Doug Collins. They were stars today on the House floor. Exclusive reaction to Pelosi's impeachment circus today. We also have a response from the White House in just moments. Plus Senator Rick Scott tells us how he and his colleagues are going to proceed. Former senator and Attorney General Jeff sessions reveals the games that Chuck Schumer may try to play and Raymond Arroyo, he takes us through the bizarre theatrics, very strange, moments you didn't catch but we did from Pelosi and company from last night.  But first, A Tale of Two Leaders, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Today we saw a stark contrast play out before eyes in real time. The contract of two leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump. Now Pelosi is a leader in title only. Yes, she's a Speaker of the House but I think I'm right.  Last spring, she said impeachment should only be bipartisan. The same Speaker who couldn't get one Republican to join her lynch mob but that didn't stop her today from milking the conveyance of the articles of impeachment for all it was worth.",

We also have a response from the White House in just moments. Plus Senator Rick Scott tells us how he and his colleagues are going to proceed. Former senator and Attorney General Jeff sessions reveals the games that Chuck Schumer may try to play and Raymond Arroyo, he takes us through the bizarre theatrics, very strange, moments you didn't catch but we did from Pelosi and company from last night. But first, A Tale of Two Leaders, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Today we saw a stark contrast play out before eyes in real time. The contract of two leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump. Now Pelosi is a leader in title only. Yes, she's a Speaker of the House but I think I'm right. Last spring, she said impeachment should only be bipartisan.

Nadler campaigned in 2017 to be chair of this committee because he said he was best to impeach and Adam Schiff is the one who continued to lie. Remember, he had proof beyond circumstantial.

From the moment he came down that golden escalator, a lot of establishment Republicans, maybe even you Kevin and some - and some establishment Democrats, they wanted him out, they wanted him gone.

As if a trial were nothing more than extension of an open ended grand jury probe. A federal judge would tell prosecutors to go back to the grand jury, finish investigation, and then come back to the trial court when they have a case ready to be tried, not investigated.\" Robert, do you agree?

That, in and of itself indicates bad faith or just sheer incompetence or dementia. I don't know which one of those but I wouldn't take this seriously for one second.

The President's done nothing wrong and the reason Nancy Pelosi, after saying they had amassed overwhelming evidence during the House hearings saying, the President in one of the articles was a real clear and present danger to the country. The reason she held it for a month was because she knew, she panicked that her case was weak and you're an attorney. If you have a strong case, would you be saying after you've closed the investigation, wait a minute, we need more witnesses? Wait a minute, we need more documents? No matter what she thinks the qualifications of her managers are, the bottom line is they have a fundamentally flawed case and that's going to be exposed in the Senate trial, which we know is going to offer a much more fair process for our White House counsel's office with Pat Cipolonne and his team, being able to actually tell the President's side of the story in a fair, open and transparent way. And we feel very strongly in the strength of our case and we're going to make it in the Senate."

What they're doing is they are taking - it reminds me of my kids when they come home from college, they pack all the dirty laundry into a bag and then bring it home and say, mom, would you fix the laundry for us.

And yet we are supposed to go through this nonsense and waste everybody's time and money for another two weeks?

They've got nothing. Everything is a big nothing-burger. They've got the military aid delivered, the Ukrainian president saying there was no deal, and we've already read the transcript. This is blowing up in their faces. I think Ted Cruz may have had a point the other day on this network, maybe it was yesterday or this morning, when he said, listen, let's put this on trial.

Thomas Paine, these are the times that try men's souls, the times that found us. Again and again, even deep in our poets, Longfellow, remember, listen, my children, and you will hear the midnight ride of Paul Revere on the 18th of April in '75, hardly a man is now alive that remembers that famous day and year. It's always about marketing history, using time."

Nobody can make heads or tails of this. Longfellow and Paul Revere, the Pledge of Allegiance, and then all of a sudden, time, time, time. She is obsessed because she misused time. She thought time was on her side, and that holding these articles would give her an upper hand. It bombed. And now the polls are turning against her."

And imagine this up against Donald Trump. I watched them on split screen, Trump in Wisconsin last night, he owned the room. I don't how Joe Biden is going to stand up to him, should he make it. OK, CNN made a big deal last night, Laura, about Elizabeth Warren's story that Bernie told her a woman cannot win the presidency. He denied that charge. During the debate, this is how the evening ended for both of them."

What I love about this, what we are seeing here, Elizabeth Warren's credibility is in the can right now. She has lied about being fired while pregnant, she lied about her Indian heritage, she lied about her child going to public school, now caught in the fourth life. You are seeing the unraveling of this woman, and these narratives are crashing. This is going the way of Custer's Last Stand, and Elizabeth Warren is not the Indian, OK, once again."
