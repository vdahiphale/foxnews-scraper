That meant either Trump continued that old policy of catch and release, family units caught entering the country illegally, or parents were detained separately from their minor children, because the children had to be released. The administration chose the latter path which led to well -- mostly Democrat-led protests across America which ultimately drove the White House back to back down. It was a total mess. Congress had the chance to change the law, close the loopholes. And let's face it, they could've tightened the asylum process and expedited the deportation hearings. But they chose to do nada. How brave.    REP. PAUL RYAN, R—WISC., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We have a broken immigration system. It doesn't work for anybody. Least of which to control our border. And so when we get to the moment where we're actually solving this problem, which I would prefer sooner rather than later, I really think it's going to gravitate around these four pillars.",

Before running to the airport today for their working August recess, the House held a sneaky vote on a Homeland Security appropriations bill that will only end up adding to our problems at the border. The amendment basically codifies DACA and was the brainchild of Congressman David Price, a Democrat from North Carolina. But it wasn't just David Price. GOP Congressman Kevin Yoder, the all-important Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, was also in full support of the idea.  Especially this part that made it easier for illegal immigrants to claim asylum. If they credibly fear gang-related or domestic violence. Yoder claims he was moved to change his position on asylum due to the influence of his mother. He said today, \"As a son of a social worker, I have great compassion for the victims of domestic violence anywhere, especially as it concerns those nations that turn a blind eye of crimes of domestic violence.\"  Well, forgive me, congressman, and I appreciate your personal story, but your family history shouldn't be allowed to thwart the president's immigration agenda. And frankly, imperil the party's prospects in the midterms. Until 2016, asylum was traditionally reserved for those in fear of persecution for things like their religious, their political or their ethnic background. Not due to one's fear of crime or the threat of domestic abuse in his or her home, as horrible as that is. But as a new barometer for asylum status is whether a foreigner feels safe in his or her home country, we should -- might as well through the borders wide open. It doesn't matter if you have a wall or no wall. Hundreds of millions of asylum requests are going to come pouring in. Now, it's worth remembering the Center for Immigration Studies estimates if this House language, like that in the Gang of Eight Bill, were to prevail in the Senate, we could be looking at 32 million new voting-age adults living in the United States by the year 2036. Democrats want desperately to replace America's more conservative electorate with foreign, younger, usually more socially liberal voters.   What does that mean? I'll tell you one thing it means -- no more Donald Trumps. And big business will revel of course, in the glut of low-skilled workers in the midst of what they claim is a labor crunch. They also won't have to raise wages much, right? Which is what they are starting to do now, they're having to do it to fill these jobs. And that means more profit for themselves. But beyond the all the tears, the meltdowns and a lot of sad stories -- some sob stories -- it's critical for Republicans not to cave to the Democrats on immigration. This is just a desperate play by the resistance because Trump is beating them on the economy.",

By the way, games that are only reserved for non-citizens. It was President Trump's get tough approach on immigration, his relentless focus on the American worker, the American family, that helped him win the election against all odds. Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania. Giving into the melodrama of the moment is not the way to go.  In fact, that will end up further burdening the American taxpayer, who was already fed up with a political system that sometimes makes them feel like second-class citizens. I know, Mr. President, you will not let them down. And that is the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is immigration attorney Michael Wildes who is the author of the new book \"Safe Haven in America: Battles to Open the Golden Door.\" Our friend Alan Dershowitz wrote the forward. And Dinesh D'Souza, a filmmaker whose new movie, \"Death of a Nation\" is in theaters August 3, we're all looking forward to that. His accompanying book comes out on the same day. All right guys, a lot to unpack. Dinesh let's start with you. This is the kind of story I think Republicans always have a hard time with because nobody likes to see a child crying, because he or she misses his mother or his father. It tugs at everybody's heartstrings. Mine. I am a mom. You're a dad. It has hard stuff to see, but this problem was brought on by politicians who refused to do the work they were supposed to do. And now the American people, as usual, are supposed to pick up the tab. Your reaction to all of this?   DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMAKER, \"DEATH OF A NATION\": Well, I think on the one hand, there is grief, but there is also the manipulation of grief. The politics, if you could call it -- moist eyes. This isn't just the Democratic Party. It's also the media which frames these images. And so it's not that the Republicans are insensitive. The Republicans are scared of being portrayed as insensitive. And the Democrats are using that charge, even though at heart, they know it's fake. And what I mean by that is look, we live in a Hobbesian world in which a lot of these problems, gang violence, domestic violence, these are epidemic -- particularly you know the favelas in Brazil, the slums of Bombay, all over China. These are global problems. America has never taken the position that our doors are open worldwide to anybody who is suffering from these problems. We create very carefully carved out exceptions, for example, political persecution or as you said earlier, religious persecution. And that is it. But the Democrats are using the fact that they are able to dramatize these problems on our border to create a kind of emotional stampede. And then Republicans feel politically defensive, run for the exits, in the kind of familiar invertebrate fashion.",

Well that's interesting and I'm glad she was a social worker, but that has nothing to do with our U.S. Immigration policy. And for some reason, like Donald Trump had him on Air Force One last week. Like he's a great guy, he's giving me $5 billion for the wall. Five billion dollars for the wall is not going to matter if we have tens of millions of people all across the country, we have 45 countries, Michael Wilde, where domestic abuse generally not recognized as crime.  Forty-five countries. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar, Haiti, it goes on and on and on where women do not get the same rights as women here in the United States and other developed countries against men who abuse them. So does that mean all of them can apply under Kevin Yoder's, David Price's new idea about asylum? That is madness. MICHAEL WILDE, AUTHOR, \"SAFE HAVEN IN AMERICA: BATTLES TO OPEN THE GOLDEN DOOR: Thank you Laura for having me on. Forgive my personal attire. I am running for mayor in New Jersey and there was an event in my community and I came over here to join you. Look, I'm a law professor and adjunct at a law school. Political asylum is actually sacred law. And historically domestic violence has not yielded itself for a long time as the basis for political asylum.  There's an old battle cry between persecution and prosecution. If you are being persecuted, you apply for asylum at our door. If you are in fear of prosecution or you have issues with your home country, it's not America's business, and we have economic challenges for our own citizenry. So domestic violence is less of a case. But gang violence is a different predicate for asylum. Because there you have countries that enable narcos and all the drug traffickers and they take no action. And Muslim countries throughout the world where women are being abused in relationships where the government codifies it under Sharia law and so forth. So the real question is should America's golden doors be slammed shut when there are people that are trying to protect themselves?",

A group of people who have a common set of values and a common destiny. Almost in some senses like an extended family. If someone came banging on your door and said listen, I am in fear because I'm being chased by a gang, I would submit that the ordinary person would be a little skeptical before giving them \"asylum,\" before saying come in. You can move in because you have a credible fear. It's now become our responsibility. Most people would say wait a minute. I have a direct obligation to my own. As for others, coming in from the outside, I am sympathetic. But on the other hand, it's not necessarily my problem. At the very least, our democratic system has to go through the legislative process to decide what we do with such people. So ultimately the decision is with Congress, but this idea that somehow because the media dramatizes a hard-left story, that the idea that somehow the Republicans have to run for cover, this is just in a sense political theater.",

I think there is a blue edge, but it is way too early to say there's a blue wave. And you have to be very careful because these polls very rarely put the Trump messaging and for testing.

GOP Congressman Kevin Yoder, the all-important Chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, was also in full support of the idea. Especially this part that made it easier for illegal immigrants to claim asylum. If they credibly fear gang-related or domestic violence. Yoder claims he was moved to change his position on asylum due to the influence of his mother. He said today, \"As a son of a social worker, I have great compassion for the victims of domestic violence anywhere, especially as it concerns those nations that turn a blind eye of crimes of domestic violence.\" Well, forgive me, congressman, and I appreciate your personal story, but your family history shouldn't be allowed to thwart the president's immigration agenda. And frankly, imperil the party's prospects in the midterms. Until 2016, asylum was traditionally reserved for those in fear of persecution for things like their religious, their political or their ethnic background. Not due to one's fear of crime or the threat of domestic abuse in his or her home, as horrible as that is. But as a new barometer for asylum status is whether a foreigner feels safe in his or her home country, we should -- might as well through the borders wide open. It doesn't matter if you have a wall or no wall. Hundreds of millions of asylum requests are going to come pouring in. Now, it's worth remembering the Center for Immigration Studies estimates if this House language, like that in the Gang of Eight Bill, were to prevail in the Senate, we could be looking at 32 million new voting-age adults living in the United States by the year 2036. Democrats want desperately to replace America's more conservative electorate with foreign, younger, usually more socially liberal voters. What does that mean? I'll tell you one thing it means -- no more Donald Trumps. And big business will revel of course, in the glut of low-skilled workers in the midst of what they claim is a labor crunch. They also won't have to raise wages much, right? Which is what they are starting to do now, they're having to do it to fill these jobs. And that means more profit for themselves. But beyond the all the tears, the meltdowns and a lot of sad stories -- some sob stories -- it's critical for Republicans not to cave to the Democrats on immigration. This is just a desperate play by the resistance because Trump is beating them on the economy."

      "utterance": "Now is not the time for Republicans to give in on immigration enforcement or melt because of the cheap, emotional media games. By the way, games that are only reserved for non-citizens. It was President Trump's get tough approach on immigration, his relentless focus on the American worker, the American family, that helped him win the election against all odds. Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania. Giving into the melodrama of the moment is not the way to go. In fact, that will end up further burdening the American taxpayer, who was already fed up with a political system that sometimes makes them feel like second-class citizens. I know, Mr. President, you will not let them down. And that is the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is immigration attorney Michael Wildes who is the author of the new book \"Safe Haven in America: Battles to Open the Golden Door.\" Our friend Alan Dershowitz wrote the forward. And Dinesh D'Souza, a filmmaker whose new movie, \"Death of a Nation\" is in theaters August 3, we're all looking forward to that. His accompanying book comes out on the same day. All right guys, a lot to unpack. Dinesh let's start with you. This is the kind of story I think Republicans always have a hard time with because nobody likes to see a child crying, because he or she misses his mother or his father. It tugs at everybody's heartstrings. Mine. I am a mom. You're a dad. It has hard stuff to see, but this problem was brought on by politicians who refused to do the work they were supposed to do. And now the American people, as usual, are supposed to pick up the tab. Your reaction to all of this? DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMAKER, \"DEATH OF A NATION\": Well, I think on the one hand, there is grief, but there is also the manipulation of grief. The politics, if you could call it -- moist eyes. This isn't just the Democratic Party. It's also the media which frames these images. And so it's not that the Republicans are insensitive. The Republicans are scared of being portrayed as insensitive. And the Democrats are using that charge, even though at heart, they know it's fake. And what I mean by that is look, we live in a Hobbesian world in which a lot of these problems, gang violence, domestic violence, these are epidemic -- particularly you know the favelas in Brazil, the slums of Bombay, all over China. These are global problems. America has never taken the position that our doors are open worldwide to anybody who is suffering from these problems. We create very carefully carved out exceptions, for example, political persecution or as you said earlier, religious persecution. And that is it. But the Democrats are using the fact that they are able to dramatize these problems on our border to create a kind of emotional stampede. And then Republicans feel politically defensive, run for the exits, in the kind of familiar invertebrate fashion."

Well that's interesting and I'm glad she was a social worker, but that has nothing to do with our U.S. Immigration policy. And for some reason, like Donald Trump had him on Air Force One last week. Like he's a great guy, he's giving me $5 billion for the wall. Five billion dollars for the wall is not going to matter if we have tens of millions of people all across the country, we have 45 countries, Michael Wilde, where domestic abuse generally not recognized as crime. Forty-five countries. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar, Haiti, it goes on and on and on where women do not get the same rights as women here in the United States and other developed countries against men who abuse them. So does that mean all of them can apply under Kevin Yoder's, David Price's new idea about asylum? That is madness. MICHAEL WILDE, AUTHOR, \"SAFE HAVEN IN AMERICA: BATTLES TO OPEN THE GOLDEN DOOR: Thank you Laura for having me on. Forgive my personal attire. I am running for mayor in New Jersey and there was an event in my community and I came over here to join you. Look, I'm a law professor and adjunct at a law school. Political asylum is actually sacred law. And historically domestic violence has not yielded itself for a long time as the basis for political asylum. There's an old battle cry between persecution and prosecution. If you are being persecuted, you apply for asylum at our door. If you are in fear of prosecution or you have issues with your home country, it's not America's business, and we have economic challenges for our own citizenry. So domestic violence is less of a case. But gang violence is a different predicate for asylum. Because there you have countries that enable narcos and all the drug traffickers and they take no action. And Muslim countries throughout the world where women are being abused in relationships where the government codifies it under Sharia law and so forth. So the real question is should America's golden doors be slammed shut when there are people that are trying to protect themselves?"

If someone came banging on your door and said listen, I am in fear because I'm being chased by a gang, I would submit that the ordinary person would be a little skeptical before giving them \"asylum,\" before saying come in. You can move in because you have a credible fear. It's now become our responsibility. Most people would say wait a minute. I have a direct obligation to my own. As for others, coming in from the outside, I am sympathetic. But on the other hand, it's not necessarily my problem. At the very least, our democratic system has to go through the legislative process to decide what we do with such people. So ultimately the decision is with Congress, but this idea that somehow because the media dramatizes a hard-left story, that the idea that somehow the Republicans have to run for cover, this is just in a sense political theater."

I have always thought that if Mueller believes that Cohen was somehow the key to proving a collusion case against Trump, there is no way he lets fact case walk to the southern district of New York. I would be surprised if this links up to anything that is serious in the way of collusion, like an espionage conspiracy. But look, the Trump Tower meeting is bad.

Joining us now, someone with a warning to those folks, Democratic pollster Mark Penn, along with Tom Bevan, the publisher of Real Clear Politics. Gentlemen, great to see you tonight. Mark, let's start with you. It's commonly thought that most pollsters were wrong before the last election. However, on the popular vote, they were pretty close, where they not, with Hillary Clinton, two percent, three percent. But they missed it in key states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, which is kind of the whole shooting match.

So my point about these pools is, what happened in the election was the analysis was bad. And what I see now is the questions are bad. They are usually slanted, anti-Trump questions, so they don't see the narrative here, which this is a divided country. It's close. I think there is a blue edge, but it is way too early to say there's a blue wave. And you have to be very careful because these polls very rarely put the Trump messaging and for testing. They don't ask about sanctuary cities. They don't ask about using tariff as a wedge. They ask easy, layup questions designed to prove points they are making."

The NBC News/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll that came out after the Helsinki summit and voters disapproved of that, and that was a headline. But the actual story, the real headline was that Trump's approval rating had reached an all-time high for his presidency, 45 percent. It had actually ticked up. And so the framing around that was all negative despite the fact there was good news for Trump in there. In the last week or two, the Democratic lead advantage in the generic ballot has ticked actually in favor of Republicans by about a point. But I also agree with Mark. The problem in 2016 was not the polls. It was the pundits. And you would've thought that if we, the journalists --"

Over 50 percent in most polls, job approval rating on the economy, and it's the number one issue for voters."

But he won the presidency with an approval rating of 36 percent. So could it be they are not wild about some of the stuff he does personally but they like the results he gets for the American worker? Could that be may be where we end up if he ends up having a positive effect in some of these races?"

And so, are voters going to focus on what's going on with the economy or on what he does personally? That has always been the big question on Trump. Clearly on Election Day they focused a lot more on the issues. We don't know what's going to happen this time. That's what makes it so fascinating. That's why pundits have to be careful. When you look at these high approval ratings on the core issues, that means the president has got to be doing something right. There is a storyline here that you've got to see, because if you miss it and you are a Democrat, boy, you will miss the whole election again."

It's a really interesting cross-section of the country. I know liberals will laugh if they are watching this. Listen and then you will learn every now and then. Just listen. But people were saying we don't care about this Billy Bush tape. We don't care about Stormy Daniels. We don't care about -- they thought he might be kind of a bully but he is our bully. And we are tired of being bullied by the experts and the consultants and the corrupt class. He's going to fight for us. That's what they were telling us on the radio. And still to this day they are saying that. Now, maybe it won't add up to much in November. I don't know. But I can tell you, I do a daily focus group. And my listening audience, they are not listening to this. They don't care about this Mueller stuff. They don't care about any of this Cohen tape. They are like let's move on to the next topic. Let's talk about immigration. Tom, close it out."

His approval rating in that \"Wall Street Journal\" poll is 88 percent. On Election Day, he only got nine percent of Democrats, and nine percent of Democrats give him a favorable job approval rating. So we have been in a state of suspended political animation since the campaign. Despite all the controversy that surrounds the president, partisans on the other side have not budged. There's been some wiggle room by independents in the middle, and that might actually be what it comes down to on Election Day in November."

She said she was throwing up in her car. She said she was about to get on a plane to L.A. to the sober living house she was staying at. And then she said I had all the help in the world but I didn't want it. Then the story of course about her friends out there partying with her with the Narcan. They know that she is vulnerable. And presumably they are not totally dumb people, though they sound pretty dumb. They know she could end up dead. And this is who she is hanging out with.

So that people that abuse and people that would be a bad influence are people that are also under the influence of some sort of substance and don't have good judgment. A big part of addiction is ambivalence. So the new models of treatment really try to address that, things like harm reduction and motivational interviewing, which looks to basically help people reconcile or address or resolve some of that ambivalence. So whenever someone is abusing drugs, typically there is a lot of conflict within them about continuing the drug use or whatever substance, and --"

So anyone that is abusing is actually gaining a benefit from it, and the benefit might be escape, it might be numbing the pain. That's probably the reason that striving them to do it.
