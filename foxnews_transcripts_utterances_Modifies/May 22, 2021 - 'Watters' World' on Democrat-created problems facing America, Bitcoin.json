They're actually great at it. It's honestly all they do.  Instead of attacking problems, they just attack us because to them, we are the biggest problem. But the real problems are starting to pile up. The media doesn't cover them because we didn't cause them. Then once we point it out and try fixing it, we get attacked.  We try to get kids back in the classroom, and teachers tell us we are white supremacists.  Sacramento teacher Damian Harmony said he was disappointed to hear the quote, \" ... cynical pearl clutching foe urgency, ablest structurally white supremacist hysteria over returning to schools,\" and accused parents of bullying the School Board into making schools less safe for the teachers. Mr. Harmony wasn't punished. Why would he be? One student who returned vaccinated got screamed at by a mask maniac posing as a teacher.",

I'd rather go back to remote learning than have kids hear that poison. Now I'm over here saying: Biden, you blew up the border. They just nabbed the Middle Eastern guy and a convicted sex trafficker from Guatemala. That's racist, they say. You just hate immigrants.  But Mr. President, a half a million illegals came across already this year. That's two decades of records shattered. We're making progress, they tell us. Progress to where?   But Joe, more fentanyl got smuggled in the first few months of the year than all of 2020, a hundred thousand Americans OD'd. We've got to stop it. Trump's fault.

But Trump was tough on Germany as he should have been.  So now, the White House says we need to repair our alliance with Germany. Hey, guys, who are we allies against? Russia, remember.

As you mentioned, Ukraine, and many of our Eastern European allies have been very worried about this. And the one thing I can tell you, Jesse, having been with Mike Pompeo and the Russians many times over the past two years that he was Secretary of State, they are very tough and they know when people are bluffing. They know whenever your words are backed by actions. And there's just a lot of tough rhetoric from this administration. They seem to think that talking tough is the same thing as actually being tough, but whenever you cancel the Keystone pipeline, and do things that will lessen America's ability to be energy independent and lessen America's ability to export, yet you provide the Russians the ability to do so, I just don't see how from a geopolitical perspective that this is beneficial to our own national security or the national security of any of our allies.",

They're actually great at it. It's honestly all they do. Instead of attacking problems, they just attack us because to them, we are the biggest problem. But the real problems are starting to pile up. The media doesn't cover them because we didn't cause them. Then once we point it out and try fixing it, we get attacked. We try to get kids back in the classroom, and teachers tell us we are white supremacists. Sacramento teacher Damian Harmony said he was disappointed to hear the quote, \" ... cynical pearl clutching foe urgency, ablest structurally white supremacist hysteria over returning to schools,\" and accused parents of bullying the School Board into making schools less safe for the teachers. Mr. Harmony wasn't punished. Why would he be? One student who returned vaccinated got screamed at by a mask maniac posing as a teacher."

Elections created these problems by putting Democrats in power, and the only thing that fixes it is when at the next election, will give conservatives -- I didn't say Republicans, I said conservatives -- power, because there are some Republicans that need to go home, too.

We will seal the border, we will deregulate, we will cut taxes, not raise them. We won't pay people to sit at home and not work. We're going to make some really significant reforms in Congress. Here is one I'd throw out there. I've got a bunch in mind, but one that I would put out, if the government ever shuts down your business, that government official who shut it down doesn't get paid until your business opens back up.

The Obama administration, when Biden was Vice President was against this pipeline, and bipartisan Members of Congress, I mean, majority of Congress for a very long time had been opposed to this. And why is it? Because this pipeline would give Russia the ability to have control, to have leverage over Europe's energy resources and why don't you want our allies to be beholden to Russia?

There's also no need for it, right? Germany could import gas from America. So there's other resources. It is not that -- it's not like this is their only option. As you mentioned, Ukraine, and many of our Eastern European allies have been very worried about this. And the one thing I can tell you, Jesse, having been with Mike Pompeo and the Russians many times over the past two years that he was Secretary of State, they are very tough and they know when people are bluffing. They know whenever your words are backed by actions. And there's just a lot of tough rhetoric from this administration. They seem to think that talking tough is the same thing as actually being tough, but whenever you cancel the Keystone pipeline, and do things that will lessen America's ability to be energy independent and lessen America's ability to export, yet you provide the Russians the ability to do so, I just don't see how from a geopolitical perspective that this is beneficial to our own national security or the national security of any of our allies."

And so what we have done in this essay is pull the covers off of this exploitation, and begin to tell the real story of black America. One interesting -- in fact, there are 20 slaves who were born slaves who died millionaires, and two of them went back and purchased the plantation on which they were slaves, and one of them, Robert Smalls took in the destitute family of the slave owner in an act of what I call, radical grace."
