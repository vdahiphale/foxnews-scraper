Well, uh, if I was concerned about racism, I would've moved out of America a long time ago.   So why is that brave? Well, someone sacrifices their street cred and offers themselves up to ridicule from the cool kids so others might not be targeted, that's brave. The opposite, instead of facing the mob, you just grab a pitchfork like Matt Damon did playing Brett Kavanaugh on the same show.",

This is nuts.\"   Politicians, celebrities, media, so many have been accused of something. Want to bet they feel their pain was unjust? Matt should ask his friends: \"Hey, Ben, were you ever accused of something, and was it unjust?\" Imagine how many of them fight back tears and anger. It will be quite a performance. Maybe Matt can mock that, too.",
