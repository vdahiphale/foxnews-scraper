      "sentences": "Bingo. That was the key moment from today. And by the way, particularly when there was no criminal wrongdoing discovered by Mueller, zero. He couldn't do the interview with the President. He didn't want to go to court to try to get to sit down with the President because he knew he would lose.  So let's break this down for some of the armchair legal analysts out there. There is no disagreement about the central facts of Mueller's investigation. Fact one, there was no criminal conspiracy with Russia. Some people call that collusion, none. Fact two, while the Mueller report did find possible instances of obstructive behavior, it did not come to a conclusion to recommend prosecutions, a binary choice either or. The rest just window dressing.  The inconsequential rantings of fanatics who didn't get what they wanted and they're bitter and they're clinging to the old narrative that went nowhere. The criminal prosecution of the President's - President of the United States wasn't going to happen, it didn't happen. Now to unpack what we learned today and examine where we go from here, we're joined by Sol Wisenberg, former deputy Independent Counsel, Fox News Contributor. John Yoo, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Joe diGenova, former U.S. attorney.   All right, it's great to see all of you on a very important night tonight. Sol, after the Mueller letter to Barr leaked out last night, Democrats tonight are calling for Barr's resignation. Including by the way Joe Biden who just made the call for the resignation a half hour ago.  Now they claim that Barr lied on April 10 when he was before the Committee and he said, he didn't know if Mueller disagreed with those conclusions on obstruction. My question to you. Did Barr lie about that?",

If you actually read what was sad and look at it - look at everything that's been written on it, he was asked whether or not Mueller agreed or not with his conclusion, his legal conclusion which he made when Mueller dropped the ball and didn't do it. That there was no criminal obstruction. He didn't know at that time. What the Barr letter disagreed with was the failure of Mr. Barr's - Attorney General Barr's four-page announcement of the findings to have sufficient nuance.   He - Mueller felt that, it didn't have - show the proper ambience or nuance and then when he called him, when Barr called Mueller, it turned out that what Mueller was really upset about is the media coverage about him dropping the ball and not making a call on obstruction but on that really basic question, did Barr lie? Of course, he didn't lie because all he said was, I don't know if Mueller agrees with my legal conclusion that there's no criminal obstruction but you have to understand Laura. This isn't about substance, it's about this destroying Barr. Barr has to be destroyed because he's a man with credibility and gravitas who is doing a good job and supporting the President. And he's supporting the President because that's what an Attorney General should do. He's not supporting the President, right or wrong so he has to be destroyed. By the way, that's why Rod Rosenstein now has to be destroyed. They loved it when they thought he was protecting Mueller but now he's part of the Barr team so he has to be destroyed, that's what really this is all about.",

It's designed to cover their touches because they don't like the reaction to their report which was a sophomoric, adolescent 400 pages of very poorly written legal work. It's kind of first year law school writing in my opinion. Now Kamala Harris, she's running for President.  She does what she does, she's snooty, she did her little thing.

In fact the sad thing is the Democrats are so focused on something which history will never remember, won't even make a footnote in history, is they're ignoring a thing that Barr did do for which we should, I think praise him and but also understand which is Barr took the obstruction charges, took the evidence and he as the Chief Prosecutor in United States for the federal government decided to decline prosecution and effectively clear Trump. And that means not only is collusion over, there's no evidence of collusion but obstruction is over. As in the clip you played, Attorney General Barr, I think rightly said the Justice Department's job is over. The whole thing is over.

In other words, a witness interviews million pages of documents at the White House ended up by sending over there and he said no, I took the report at face value.

He accepted Mueller's theory for example, that the firing of the of the FBI Director could conceivably be obstruction under any circumstances, which is an absolutely ridiculous concept and bought - and Mueller's discussion of the law on that topic, not the constitutional part but just whether or not somebody can be convicted of obstruction for doing something, they are legally allowed to do and nothing else was a very brief and as Joe pointed out, unsatisfactory section of the report. So Barr accepted this ridiculous theory just for the premise of making his - just for the purposes of making his decision.

Well, at one key point in today's hearing the Attorney General testified, he's not going to back off his recent use of the word spying to describe what the Obama administration did to the Trump campaign. Particularly when such surveillance he said is, \"unauthorized and inadequately predicated.\" He took direct aim at former Obama era officials like John Brennan, James Comey, James Clapper. Barr noting that if the Intel community only had one confidential informant and FISA warrants for only one person, Carter Page, that raises questions about whether this was really a weak investigation or maybe was there more spying that we simply have not learned about. The surveillance that we do know about was based on the dossier of course by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, it contained salacious anti-Trump material paid for by the Democrats. Some of the mainstream media have suggested it was legit except even The New York Times reported last month, after Mueller's report was released that Intel officials fear the dossier was full of \"Russian disinformation.\" They added, \"while many Trump aides had welcomed contacts with the Russians, some of the most sensational claims in the dossier appeared to be false, others were impossible to prove.\" Now Republican Charles Grassley today debated on why Mueller did not investigate whether the dossier itself was part of Russian disinformation, watch.",

Or they're just spinning foolishness. And the media were not alone and their slanderous attacks on Barr of course. Having determined that there was no Trump-Russia collusion, Democrats have now moved on to a Trump-Barr collusion narrative."

The fully unredacted report, they can go, they can go to a special room of the Justice Department if they're so set about - you know, set on this idea of impeaching Trump. Go, look at the full report unredacted. You know, only two people have gone to see it both Republicans. These people are complete and utter frauds. If you think you have the evidence to impeach, roll the dice, let's see what you got, guys. Let's see what you have. See where it ends up.

That determines whether or not there's a crime. The report is now in the hands of the American people, everyone can decide for themselves. There's as an election in 18 months, that's very democratic process but we're out of it. And we have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon."

He couldn't do the interview with the President. He didn't want to go to court to try to get to sit down with the President because he knew he would lose. So let's break this down for some of the armchair legal analysts out there. There is no disagreement about the central facts of Mueller's investigation. Fact one, there was no criminal conspiracy with Russia. Some people call that collusion, none. Fact two, while the Mueller report did find possible instances of obstructive behavior, it did not come to a conclusion to recommend prosecutions, a binary choice either or. The rest just window dressing. The inconsequential rantings of fanatics who didn't get what they wanted and they're bitter and they're clinging to the old narrative that went nowhere. The criminal prosecution of the President's - President of the United States wasn't going to happen, it didn't happen. Now to unpack what we learned today and examine where we go from here, we're joined by Sol Wisenberg, former deputy Independent Counsel, Fox News Contributor. John Yoo, former Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Joe diGenova, former U.S. attorney. All right, it's great to see all of you on a very important night tonight. Sol, after the Mueller letter to Barr leaked out last night, Democrats tonight are calling for Barr's resignation. Including by the way Joe Biden who just made the call for the resignation a half hour ago. Now they claim that Barr lied on April 10 when he was before the Committee and he said, he didn't know if Mueller disagreed with those conclusions on obstruction. My question to you. Did Barr lie about that?"

      "utterance": "I don't think he did at all based upon what - what I was read - what I have read. If you actually read what was sad and look at it - look at everything that's been written on it, he was asked whether or not Mueller agreed or not with his conclusion, his legal conclusion which he made when Mueller dropped the ball and didn't do it. That there was no criminal obstruction. He didn't know at that time. What the Barr letter disagreed with was the failure of Mr. Barr's - Attorney General Barr's four-page announcement of the findings to have sufficient nuance. He - Mueller felt that, it didn't have - show the proper ambience or nuance and then when he called him, when Barr called Mueller, it turned out that what Mueller was really upset about is the media coverage about him dropping the ball and not making a call on obstruction but on that really basic question, did Barr lie? Of course, he didn't lie because all he said was, I don't know if Mueller agrees with my legal conclusion that there's no criminal obstruction but you have to understand Laura. This isn't about substance, it's about this destroying Barr. Barr has to be destroyed because he's a man with credibility and gravitas who is doing a good job and supporting the President. And he's supporting the President because that's what an Attorney General should do. He's not supporting the President, right or wrong so he has to be destroyed. By the way, that's why Rod Rosenstein now has to be destroyed. They loved it when they thought he was protecting Mueller but now he's part of the Barr team so he has to be destroyed, that's what really this is all about."

Mueller is stayed too long at the fair, he's not functioning anymore. It's Andrew Weissmann who wrote that letter. That letter was a legacy letter. It's designed to cover their touches because they don't like the reaction to their report which was a sophomoric, adolescent 400 pages of very poorly written legal work. It's kind of first year law school writing in my opinion. Now Kamala Harris, she's running for President. She does what she does, she's snooty, she did her little thing. I think quite frankly, they've embarrassed themselves and they're embarrassing the United States Senate and top Kamala Harris with Mazie Hirono and you really have the monsters.

I mean, all of us but the idea of these people one after the other trying to destroy a man's entire legacy based on Bob Mueller's team being upset about the tone as Sol said and the context not being fully flushed out in a brief summary of the ultimate conclusions in this report.

Everyone can see the report now. They can compare it to Barr's letter and see whether they agree with the summary. Now, Barr's letter doesn't matter anymore. In fact the sad thing is the Democrats are so focused on something which history will never remember, won't even make a footnote in history, is they're ignoring a thing that Barr did do for which we should, I think praise him and but also understand which is Barr took the obstruction charges, took the evidence and he as the Chief Prosecutor in United States for the federal government decided to decline prosecution and effectively clear Trump. And that means not only is collusion over, there's no evidence of collusion but obstruction is over. As in the clip you played, Attorney General Barr, I think rightly said the Justice Department's job is over. The whole thing is over. So if Mueller and Weissmann and people want to use this letter for some purpose, I think it fails, what they're really trying to do I think is create - put on a platter some evidence for Congress to start some kind of impeachment proceedings and that's the only avenue left."

In other words, a witness interviews million pages of documents at the White House ended up by sending over there and he said no, I took the report at face value. The fact, I'm not - I'm not a finder, an original finder of fact in this case so he actually took Mueller's conclusion or facts on obstruction at face value. And she just kind of rolled her eyes and they're like oh, she really scored points against him.

Barr did something that I think was very generous that he didn't have to do that I wouldn't have done. Barr accepted Mueller's analytical framework. He accepted Mueller's theory for example, that the firing of the of the FBI Director could conceivably be obstruction under any circumstances, which is an absolutely ridiculous concept and bought - and Mueller's discussion of the law on that topic, not the constitutional part but just whether or not somebody can be convicted of obstruction for doing something, they are legally allowed to do and nothing else was a very brief and as Joe pointed out, unsatisfactory section of the report. So Barr accepted this ridiculous theory just for the premise of making his - just for the purposes of making his decision. He didn't have to do that and it's ridiculous, the idea that by firing the FBI director, no matter what your motive was could ever be criminal obstruction of justice is a joke. It's absurd."

Now you have Democrats wondering why is Attorney General Bill Barr investigating possible Russian disinformation in that dossier when it was Democrats claiming the most important issue in the country maybe was Russian disinformation. Well, at one key point in today's hearing the Attorney General testified, he's not going to back off his recent use of the word spying to describe what the Obama administration did to the Trump campaign. Particularly when such surveillance he said is, \"unauthorized and inadequately predicated.\" He took direct aim at former Obama era officials like John Brennan, James Comey, James Clapper. Barr noting that if the Intel community only had one confidential informant and FISA warrants for only one person, Carter Page, that raises questions about whether this was really a weak investigation or maybe was there more spying that we simply have not learned about. The surveillance that we do know about was based on the dossier of course by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, it contained salacious anti-Trump material paid for by the Democrats. Some of the mainstream media have suggested it was legit except even The New York Times reported last month, after Mueller's report was released that Intel officials fear the dossier was full of \"Russian disinformation.\" They added, \"while many Trump aides had welcomed contacts with the Russians, some of the most sensational claims in the dossier appeared to be false, others were impossible to prove.\" Now Republican Charles Grassley today debated on why Mueller did not investigate whether the dossier itself was part of Russian disinformation, watch."

Now \"The New York Times\" is reporting that prosecutor are now pursuing and have notified a new set of parents, most of whom live right here in southern California, and seven southern California defense lawyers tell \"The Times\" that a lot more parents are very worried they too will be targeted to and are scrambling to get legal representation. We should note the ringleader of this cheating scam, Rick Singer, was a college consultant for a living and presumably had some legitimate clients, but even those parents have to wonder if they dotted the i's and crossed the t's. Separately, target letters from federal prosecutors have also reportedly been sent to some students, including at least one of Lori Loughlin's daughters, meaning the students themselves could be charged as willing participants. Meantime, we are also learning about the family of a Chinese student that allegedly paid $6.5 million to get their child into Stanford. Molly was admitting in the spring 2017. Her family, who lives in Beijing, not been charged, and it is unclear if they knew what Rick Singer was doing to facilitate her acceptance. It is not over yet, Laura."
