But also, President Obama goaded Trump into running at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. He singled him out from the dais. It was a very funny performance, but he really challenged him, and that's essentially when he got into the race.  Biden, this is interesting for Democrats because it says a lot about the party. It says, you know, there's a big split right now between moderates and progressives. He's polling at the top of the field right now. Sanders, actually, comes in third just next to Hillary. So, Biden is around 30 percent, Hillary is 18, Sanders is 16, and Warren is at 10 percent. But it says that they are going in a more moderate direction that they don't just want a bully and they don't just want a progressive, and they certainly don't want a progressive boy like Elizabeth Warren.",

And if you don't get there first and make the best, most -- most lethal ones, someone else will. See nukes. Bottom-line: The country who masters new weapons first runs the earth and, of course, the universe. It better be us, not China. Besides, no one wants autonomous weapons acting on their own anyway. It's a myth. Consider the modern drone, a more effective weapon in that it can pick off the bad guy and spare the innocent people. It works because dozens of humans are involved operating that drone. It creates jobs. And if a drone can tell the difference between an ISIS meeting and a wedding, then banning them is wrong and evil. Elon Musk signed this pledge against killer weapons, but he also makes driverless cars, which can be killer weapons when they screw up. But even if a driverless car screws up, it will screw up less than one driven by a mistake-prone, distracted human. 1.3 million people die in car crashes a year. Driverless cars, as scary as they sound, will make fatal car crashes as uncommon as airline disasters.

He never got more than 1 percent, and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap and everybody was shocked that he did. I'd love to have it be Biden. I think I'd like to have any one of those people that we're talking about. You know, there's probably -- the group of seven or eight right now, I'd really like to run against any one of them. But Biden, never by himself, could never do anything. President Obama took him, made him vice president and he was fine."

I think one of the big negatives for Vice President Biden, Senator Biden, however you want to say it, there's a lot of baggage there having to do with things like his stance on abortion in the Democratic Party. But also, remember, he was a big advocate in terms of questioning for Clarence Thomas in those hearings. And I think a lot of women might have questions about it.

I think Greg is absolutely right because not only did President Obama give us President Trump because it was just a counter reaction to a two-term presidency and that happens every time, and they're both pretty extreme when you take them apart. But also, President Obama goaded Trump into running at the White House Correspondents Association Dinner. He singled him out from the dais. It was a very funny performance, but he really challenged him, and that's essentially when he got into the race. Biden, this is interesting for Democrats because it says a lot about the party. It says, you know, there's a big split right now between moderates and progressives. He's polling at the top of the field right now. Sanders, actually, comes in third just next to Hillary. So, Biden is around 30 percent, Hillary is 18, Sanders is 16, and Warren is at 10 percent. But it says that they are going in a more moderate direction that they don't just want a bully and they don't just want a progressive, and they certainly don't want a progressive boy like Elizabeth Warren."

If he does decide to run, you can expect things to get really, really ugly. I don't know that's going to be good for this country. I think bigger picture is what is the Democratic Party going to stand for. Is Biden going to be the more moderate voice or is he going to appeal to the Elizabeth Warren crowd, because, ultimately, you've got to win the primary first. And a lot of them are talking about abolishing ICE. They want, you know, less border security. So what is the messaging going to be? I think that's going to be the question."

And I think that's why he's talking about having this summit. And I said it yesterday and I'll say it again, and I hope someone in the White House is listening, it is so -- everyone is transfixed when the president has open meetings that are televised and catches everyone off guard by going around the room and he should do the same thing with Vladimir Putin. They should absolutely have a televised conversation, not a press conference where people are asking him questions, where they are going back-and-forth with their translators and so he can knock him off his game a little bit.

You guys ran tail every time America was faced with any real threat. And so many other things affected Hillary's loss, the deplorable comment, the fainting.

Because if you offer a little bit of deference, as a salesman, as a real estate tycoon, you know a little bit of deference with a bad guy could get you cooperation on A, B, C, and D. A, North Korea, B, Iran, C, Middle East -- possibly Iran. Now, this is what going to be interesting to me, what happens if we get what we want? What happens if we get something out of this deal six months from now a year from now? Will CNN and MSNBC suddenly confessed that he was not in Putin's pocket, that he was in America's pocket the entire time? This is a guy that the media accuses of being a nationalist and a traitor at the same time. A warmonger and a collusioner which is impossible. Trump moving forward on the second meeting is brilliant because he's not hiding his motives. He's saying, you know what, I don't care if you think I'm in his pockets. I'm going ahead with this because I believe I can get prosperity and peace by dealing with a thug way better than you did for the past 20 years under this -- oh, he's evil. In the video game of life, saying Putin is evil is just level one. You've got to move up to the next level. You've got to deal with him. That's what he's doing.

I don't agree with him on much but he's a genuine person who once helped me for no other reason than to be nice. He doesn't bend the truth. His intentions are good. Ultimately, the left wing frenzy was too much for Duplass. He not only deleted the tweet, but actually apologized for the egregious act of reaching across the political aisle.

Elon Musk signed this pledge against killer weapons, but he also makes driverless cars, which can be killer weapons when they screw up.
