Now I want to show you Times Square, this too going by the crossroads of America, a cross-section of everyone and everything you can possibly imagine. You see a lot of people there? You're not imagining.  This has been sort of New York the last couple of days, and every day, fewer people, fewer and fewer cars. And this is St. Paddy's Day.

The treasury secretary basically said it's just there as a backdrop. And the last time we saw this was during 2008. So, it essentially is reassuring, if you like, ensuring the liquidity in the commercial paper market. Neil, what does that mean? All it means is that, if a business is having a difficult time meeting its obligations in the near term, they can go and get money and just keep the wheels running. This is essentially grease for the wheels of corporate America.

It deals, more specifically, even, with paid family leave and sick leave, making sure that both employers and employees have the right incentives in place to send people home or to stay home if you are sick, or if you have to take care of people, knowing that they're not going to lose their income, and they're not going to lose their business. So that's -- it's really more of a safety net than it is a stimulus, in my mind. It's this next package that -- where we get to the $850 billion to a trillion or probably more -- I think you're probably right -- where we're - - in my view, I think we're talking more about the fundamentals of our economy and the recovery that follows even this initial stimulus piece. Certainly, Secretary Mnuchin talked about just sending checks to people. And I think the president clearly wants to be able to do that, get some money into the -- into the marketplace quickly to people who need it the most. And he's talking about some pretty significant dollars. But I still think we have to deal with the fundamentals. And that is a banking system, not just the liquidity, but how does that -- how do those liquid assets get to a borrower? How do they get to a small business? How do they get to a homeowner in a way that's both swift and efficient, but also appropriate for appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars?",

And it would be -- it would be more of a rolling -- a rolling number, depending on what your particular needs are as a citizen. So that whatever the case might be, there's clearly a strong desire to get cash out there in an efficient way. But then there's, of course, a lot of debate and discussion about the existing government institutions, whether, for example, in this phase two package, whether you use the unemployment insurance system or whether you use the IRS, whether it goes to the employer or whether it goes to the employee.

We can't have a healthy economy without healthy people. So, I will add to what Governor DeWine was just talking about how critically important it is right now that people follow those flu prevention measures, like washing hands thoroughly and often, not keeping in contact with people who are sick, and social distancing being critically important. Stay home if you can. Keep your distance if you need to go out. And this isn't just about protecting oneself, obviously. It is very, very important that we don't inadvertently spread the virus to very vulnerable and fragile people. And it's very important that we slow the spread, so that we don't overwhelm our health care system and our hospitals. So, I will just start with echoing what Governor DeWine was just talking to you about, because it's so important. And the other thing I will say is that people are going to need to be patient, because since we haven't been testing as much as we should, even with this social distancing, as we do more and more testing, we're likely to see our numbers go up. So, people need to follow the advice of public health experts that say this social distancing is one of the critical ways we have right now to slow the spread. So, that's one thing we're all focused on in a bipartisan way.",

So, I'm pleased that we came together now two weeks ago to pass the first bipartisan package that really is designed to help get resources to the front lines to combat this epidemic. Then, the House passed the bipartisan package over the weekend, which I hope the Senate will take up very quickly, that looks at things like free coronavirus testing for all whose doctors recommend it, paid sick leave for many workers, boosting unemployment insurance, providing additional food security. That's all important, so that people know that, if they follow the public health advice to stay home when they feel sick or feel that they have been exposed to somebody who is, they won't suffer the kind of financial loss that might put their housing or food security at risk. So, that's an important part of whatever kind of economic stimulus we need to do, is to make sure that people will follow that public health advice, so that we can get healthy faster. And then, lastly, we know that this advice to stay home, the closing of restaurants and bars, the advice not to travel is having a major impact on our industries. So, we're going to have to address that as well.

I didn't have a cough. I didn't have any respiratory distress, tightness in my chest or shortness of breath. So, I actually thought that I had just contracted the flu. It wasn't until, a few days later, I was scrolling through Facebook, and I saw a post of someone who was at the party, and she posted that she was feeling sick, same symptoms as me. Several people commented who were also at the party. And they also had the same similar symptoms. And they also fell sick on the exact same day, on a Tuesday, three days after the party. Eventually, some of those people went to their doctors. Their doctors told them they had the flu. They tested negative. They were sent home .They were not tested for the coronavirus. All of these people, including myself, were a little suspicious of what we had. So we ended up finding out there was a research study going on in Seattle called the Seattle Flu Study. And they had started testing for the coronavirus just a few weeks prior to us falling sick because of the outbreak of the virus here in Seattle. So, we signed up to be volunteers and got an at home nasal swab test kit. And that's how, myself, I got a call from them telling me that my sample tested positive. And, as of a couple days ago, five other people from the party tested positive through the flu study.",

And the testing in humans began yesterday here in Seattle. This phase one trial has 45 volunteers, each earning $1,100. They're healthy adults who will get two different doses 28 days apart. The vaccine was developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna, a biotech company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In this hard-hit area of Seattle, it was pretty easy getting people to volunteer."

It does have a genetic code that will hopefully prompt a person's cells to make a protein found in the virus that will then fight off the flu -- the full coronavirus. If this phase is successful, they will go to a second phase with several hundred people. And if that one is successful, they will go to a third phase with several thousand people. And, Neil, if all goes perfectly, they could have this in the hands of the public about a year, year-and-a-half from now -- Neil."

Meanwhile, the Pentagon says it's ready to provide five million respirators, 2,000 ventilators, all part of a quick response to the coronavirus outbreak. This must be welcome news to my next guest, Dr. Elena George. Doctor, that's been the issue, right, I mean, the fear that there aren't enough of these types of equipment out there for the feared deluge to come on. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know what I worry about, Doctor? And you're the expert here, so that's why I'm asking you. What if think this does increase exponentially? We talked about the fact that, a little more than a week ago, we had 50 known cases in the United States. All of a sudden, we're up to 5,000-plus. It's been playing out that way in Italy and in Europe, much different situations, I grant you. But will we have to start rationing this care or access to ventilators and some of these other pieces of equipment if it gets sort of out of whack?"

      "speaker": "GEORGE",
      "utterance": "Well, hopefully, it won't get to that point. I think the fact that we're self-quarantining, that we're limiting the exposure for people communicable -- being in a communicable situation, then we're going to be able to lower the amount of people that get sick quickly. That's really what people were trying to avoid, where you had a catastrophic increase in number. But we have to remember they started testing. So the number is going to go up, because more people are being tested. And they're also reporting these tests."

So there has to be a real letting people know not just, do we have an increase in number, positive number, but what's the outcome? And I think that's really assuring that most people actually will recover."

By the way, on all of this shelter-in-place plan, which is another way of saying a quarantine or even a lockdown, the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, are on different sides on this, de Blasio hinting today that that might be the next thing they have to do in the Big Apple. Governor Cuomo not a fan of that right now. This shelter-in-place thing that you hear a lot about would accelerate to essentially a lockdown in the city. A lot of people say that that is not necessary. But, as you can see from the traffic in Times Square and outside our own building at Avenue of the Americas, these are two of the busiest roadways and crossroads, if you want to call it, in all of America, actually in all the world. No traffic. No activity, and, on this St. Paddy's Day, no one, period. And we do know, when it comes to stimulus in the past in Washington, it's always a moving target. And it always gets to be big and include more people and more businesses than was intended. And, again, these are not ordinary times, are they? To the Republican Senate Budget committee member, Kevin Cramer, on how all of this is being received. Senator, very good to have you. Thank you."

But would $850 billion, even a trillion dollars, cover it?"

    {
      "speaker": "CRAMER",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, I don't know whether it will or not, but I'm certain there's more need than that, than a trillion dollars. But we have to start somewhere. I think that Leader McConnell's got the right idea. Let's pass this first package that the House sent over to us. The Senate's here. It was negotiated between the president and Secretary Mnuchin and the House leadership. Let's get that done. And let's start working on this bigger package, which I think lends itself more to stimulus and more to a recovery than it does to the immediate safety net."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, in this initial package, what can you share with us?"

    {
      "speaker": "CRAMER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Who will it be targeted for? And, just generally, what are we looking at?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRAMER",
      "utterance": "So, this initial package that the House passed, finally passed late last night and sent over, really deals more with unemployment. It deals, more specifically, even, with paid family leave and sick leave, making sure that both employers and employees have the right incentives in place to send people home or to stay home if you are sick, or if you have to take care of people, knowing that they're not going to lose their income, and they're not going to lose their business. So that's -- it's really more of a safety net than it is a stimulus, in my mind. It's this next package that -- where we get to the $850 billion to a trillion or probably more -- I think you're probably right -- where we're - - in my view, I think we're talking more about the fundamentals of our economy and the recovery that follows even this initial stimulus piece. Certainly, Secretary Mnuchin talked about just sending checks to people. And I think the president clearly wants to be able to do that, get some money into the -- into the marketplace quickly to people who need it the most. And he's talking about some pretty significant dollars. But I still think we have to deal with the fundamentals. And that is a banking system, not just the liquidity, but how does that -- how do those liquid assets get to a borrower? How do they get to a small business? How do they get to a homeowner in a way that's both swift and efficient, but also appropriate for appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, the key would be swift, right, and getting to their hot hands quickly. And I'm wondering, and to that regard, your colleague Mitt Romney had talked about, just give everyone 1,000 bucks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRAMER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I have sort of a hard time with that, frankly. It seems a bit arbitrary to me. I think what Secretary Mnuchin was talking about today was significantly more than that. He cited how many people are on the payroll. I think there's something like $200 billion or so in payroll, $300 billion in payroll in the private sector. What would it take per week to shore that up? And it would be -- it would be more of a rolling -- a rolling number, depending on what your particular needs are as a citizen. So that whatever the case might be, there's clearly a strong desire to get cash out there in an efficient way. But then there's, of course, a lot of debate and discussion about the existing government institutions, whether, for example, in this phase two package, whether you use the unemployment insurance system or whether you use the IRS, whether it goes to the employer or whether it goes to the employee. Which system is best set up and the least complicated? And, of course, we all know that government is anything but efficient. So there's still a lot to work through, Neil."

The president said as much. New York Governor Cuomo has indicated, 45 days, he hopes, before the worst of it in New York. But he and the mayor of New York City, Governor, are differing over whether they have lockdown, tight measures in New York City. How do you feel about going to that next level, where not only are you sort of hibernating in your home, so to speak, but it extends to not even leaving your home, period?"

But what we're doing -- and I'm going to do it again right now -- all Ohioans who are watching this, if you can stay home, stay home. If you can not work in your business, but you can work from home, please do that. For anybody who's 65 years of age or older, do not have contact with very many people. Just try to confine that to a very, very small number of people, because the death rate goes up dramatically as people get older. So, it's not just what orders I make or my health director makes. What's really important is how everyone takes care of themselves, because, when you take care of yourself, you're taking care of your family, but you're also taking care of absolutely total -- total strangers. Be very, very careful. Keep that social distance away. We have to go about our lives, but we have to -- if we can, we need to hunker down. I mean, I know people who literally are in their home now, and they're doing everything they can. They will go out maybe to get groceries. But they're doing everything they can not to expose themselves to other people. And that's the way to get through this."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I think we continue to focus here in a bipartisan way on the importance of everybody following the recommendations of health professionals. We can't have a healthy economy without healthy people. So, I will add to what Governor DeWine was just talking about how critically important it is right now that people follow those flu prevention measures, like washing hands thoroughly and often, not keeping in contact with people who are sick, and social distancing being critically important. Stay home if you can. Keep your distance if you need to go out. And this isn't just about protecting oneself, obviously. It is very, very important that we don't inadvertently spread the virus to very vulnerable and fragile people. And it's very important that we slow the spread, so that we don't overwhelm our health care system and our hospitals. So, I will just start with echoing what Governor DeWine was just talking to you about, because it's so important. And the other thing I will say is that people are going to need to be patient, because since we haven't been testing as much as we should, even with this social distancing, as we do more and more testing, we're likely to see our numbers go up. So, people need to follow the advice of public health experts that say this social distancing is one of the critical ways we have right now to slow the spread. So, that's one thing we're all focused on in a bipartisan way."

      "speaker": "HASSAN",
      "utterance": "Well, so what I am concerned about is that we have an economic package that combines the need to provide direct cash and assistance to workers, to families, to small businesses, and incentivize them to follow the kind of public health protocols we're talking about. So, I'm pleased that we came together now two weeks ago to pass the first bipartisan package that really is designed to help get resources to the front lines to combat this epidemic. Then, the House passed the bipartisan package over the weekend, which I hope the Senate will take up very quickly, that looks at things like free coronavirus testing for all whose doctors recommend it, paid sick leave for many workers, boosting unemployment insurance, providing additional food security. That's all important, so that people know that, if they follow the public health advice to stay home when they feel sick or feel that they have been exposed to somebody who is, they won't suffer the kind of financial loss that might put their housing or food security at risk. So, that's an important part of whatever kind of economic stimulus we need to do, is to make sure that people will follow that public health advice, so that we can get healthy faster. And then, lastly, we know that this advice to stay home, the closing of restaurants and bars, the advice not to travel is having a major impact on our industries. So, we're going to have to address that as well. But at the end of the day, this has to start by providing financial stability to people whose lives have been completely upended by the advice to stay home..."

And if you have a loved one, for instance, who has a disability, and, usually, you have got a caregiver coming in, so you can go to work, now maybe that caregiver can't come in because their kids are home from school. So the ripple effect here is real. And we need to make sure that, after we pass this House package that they passed this weekend that had the provisions I just talked about, we need to turn our attention to the next package..."

And the regulations or the guidelines from our public health department are seven days from onset of symptoms or 72 hours after the subsiding of the fever. And so, at that point, I wasn't in quarantine anymore. And, actually, the interesting part of my story is, I didn't even really know that I had the coronavirus when I had it."

And it was just a typical house party. And we had friends that brought over food and we had drinks. And then, three days later, I felt sick. And I basically had all the symptoms of a flu. I didn't have a cough. I didn't have any respiratory distress, tightness in my chest or shortness of breath. So, I actually thought that I had just contracted the flu. It wasn't until, a few days later, I was scrolling through Facebook, and I saw a post of someone who was at the party, and she posted that she was feeling sick, same symptoms as me. Several people commented who were also at the party. And they also had the same similar symptoms. And they also fell sick on the exact same day, on a Tuesday, three days after the party. Eventually, some of those people went to their doctors. Their doctors told them they had the flu. They tested negative. They were sent home .They were not tested for the coronavirus. All of these people, including myself, were a little suspicious of what we had. So we ended up finding out there was a research study going on in Seattle called the Seattle Flu Study. And they had started testing for the coronavirus just a few weeks prior to us falling sick because of the outbreak of the virus here in Seattle. So, we signed up to be volunteers and got an at home nasal swab test kit. And that's how, myself, I got a call from them telling me that my sample tested positive. And, as of a couple days ago, five other people from the party tested positive through the flu study."
