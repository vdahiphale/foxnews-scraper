I hate to see anything that divides. I'm fine with whatever people want to do, but we have to get back to running this country really, really well. Believe me, there's no collusion. Russia is fine.

This question is interesting. Concerned that President Trump may be too friendly with Russia -- concerned a lot, 39 percent, not concerned, 45 percent. That is at the heart of all the allegations obviously about Russia. Let's bring in our panel: Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review; Karen Tumulty, national political correspondent for The Washington Post; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.

Assuming he's not actually guilty of any of these charges of collusion -- we'll leave out subordinates for another time -- this takes it out of the hands of Democrats. It takes it out of the hands of the press to a certain extent, and lets him actually focus on this trip in the short term, lets him focus back on his agenda. If anybody calls for impeachment, which I think is ridiculous at this point, the White House gets to say and the Republicans get to say we have to wait for Mueller to come back with his findings. And until then, there's really nothing for us to do. It slows down, as Lindsay Graham said today, it even slows down the congressional hearings. This is all good news for him.

But this morning, he was back tweeting about how it was a witch hunt and he was a victim. I think he can use a little bit more about quality that Bill Clinton had in a time like this. It was called compartmentalization.
