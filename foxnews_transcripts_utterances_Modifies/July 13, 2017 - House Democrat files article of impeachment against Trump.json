There were reporters gathered outside a courthouse here in Bucks County for a grand jury that was convening to consider charges against Cosmo, and we have just learned from one of our colleagues at FOX 29, this also now being reported by other news outlets, that Cosmo DiNardo has, in fact, confessed to all four murders of those four men who have been missing since last week. Cosmo DiNardo's attorney came out and spoke with some of those reporters and said that his client had confessed. And our colleague, Chris O'Connell, at Fox 29 is reporting that, in exchange for the confession, Cosmo would not face the death penalty in this case. Just to bring our viewers back up to speed here, this investigation began when these men went missing, one on Wednesday and the rest on Friday. And investigators went to that farm on Sunday, because apparently a telephone, cell phone ping. And they brought cadaver dogs, and those dogs hit on the site there where they began digging and were digging all week. And last night at midnight, authorities revealed that they had, in fact, found a mass grave on that property, about a mile from where I'm standing. And they had positively identified 19-year-old Dean Finocchiaro as being one of the victims in that mass grave. The only question was whether the other three missing men -- 19-year-old Jimi Tar Patrick, 22-year-old Mark Sturgis, and 21-year-old Tom Meo -- were also in that mass grave, 12 and a half feet below the ground. Investigators have been continuing to work at that site. Rain started falling here about an hour ago, making their job that much more difficult. But we've been waiting for an update from the district attorney in Bucks County, and we're now hearing from local media. And also, the D.A.'s office re-tweeting some of those reports that, in fact, the only person of interest in this case, Cosmo DiNardo, has now confessed. And I guess the other question, Eric, would be whether anyone else helped him, not just to murder those four men but also to bury them on his parents' property.",

As a young girl, I grew up in kind of the pageant world, but I always wanted to be a lawyer and took social justice and politics very seriously. And I had a hard time reconciling that, being both concerned with my appearance as a woman but also my substance and the seriousness and heaviness of the -- the issues that I cared about. And so this book -- and I interviewed some of our colleagues in it: Judge Jeanine Pirro, Monica Crowley, as well as Meghan McCain; Marcia Clark from the O.J. trial is in it.

Loretta Lynch, so she could help defend a Russian client in a federal court case in New York. So the plot thickens. Now Eboni, with that loose that's a little bit of a new revelation, I think Chuck Grassley, yesterday, hinted, alluded to that, like how did she get in when she was already turned down for a visa, and if she got in via Obama administration, isn't this on Obama, not Trump?"

    },

She's a political analyst, a nationally syndicated radio host, and a Fox News contributor, but she specializes in playing classical piano, Leslie Marshall is here. And he's a Republican strategist. In 2008, he served in the state finance leader in California for Rudy Giuliani's presidential bid, he's the chairman for the pro-Donald Trump Great America PAC, and he specializes in indoor cycling, Eric Beach is here. I'll start with you, Leslie. Your thoughts on this -- so you can ask the question, did Donald Trump, Jr. vet this meeting well enough or not? But the reason why this Russian lawyer was even in town was because of Loretta Lynch under Obama, let her in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESLIE MARSHALL, POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, Loretta Lynch, to Eboni's point, let her in because there was a client that she was the attorney for that needed representation. They allowed her to stay longer because they were waiting for the motion to come back from the judge, instead for her going back to Russia, then letting her in again. Then when she was here, she definitely met with different people regarding opening up adoption with Russia again. As a parent, as you guys know I've two kids, one is adopted, I'm totally in favor of anything that we can do to help people throughout the world adopt children that need homes. But she was not up front, not only with the department of justice, she went beyond when she was here. She also, allegedly, was not up front with Donald Trump, Jr. To Kat's point, though, when he saw who she was, where she came from, and what she wanted to meet about, that should have been the stop sign right there because she is from Russia. It does matter. Get dirt on your opponent, no question, but who you get it from, and who you meet with certainly, certainly matters."

      "utterance": "I think Loretta Lynch and the Obama justice department to get the keeps on giving, my opinion. They let her in. There seemed to be no problem with her. And, you know, at the end of the day, President Trump is right. I mean, as a political practitioner, you want to have as much opposition research as you possibly can. I ran one of the largest super PACs along with Ed Rollins in the country for President Trump, and we had people coming to us all the time talking to us about how to win the election. At the end of the day, Donald Trump was trying to win an election. And furthermore, I'm not convinced that there is anything that shapes this narrative of collusion. I mean, we've been hearing this. If this is all they have to point to an evidence of collusion, then, good luck."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEACH",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, first and foremost, I don't look at political giving as something as a status quo or something as a give back. I look at it as a form of patriotism because people have an opportunity to support a candidate that whether he or she runs on something. What Donald Trump did was he ran against the status quo and we see that with all of the issues. He didn't win because of celebrity. He won because he ran against a broken and failed system. We're seeing that a little bit in health care debate. I believe that's why most of the people give to a political campaign because they see."

But, you know, this is like the ninth or tenth bombshell revelation that the left, and the media, and also, Democrats on the hill are saying that they discovered. Russians hacking the election, Russians change the votes, Comey got fired, Comey's memos, Trump demanded Comey loyalty, Trump revealed classified info to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office. It goes on and on and on. And these things goes up like a ball of rock but they fizzles out once they get there."

But, however, I will agree with you, every time, you know, if we say Russian salad dressing, you know, the Democrats, you know, don't need to get crazy. But we do have an investigation and we need to let that play out. And then, perhaps, we will see collusion, obstruction of justice, you know, articles of impeachment recommended, and I think that -- no, no, I think that's what we need to do, Eric."

And our colleague, Chris O'Connell, at Fox 29 is reporting that, in exchange for the confession, Cosmo would not face the death penalty in this case. Just to bring our viewers back up to speed here, this investigation began when these men went missing, one on Wednesday and the rest on Friday. And investigators went to that farm on Sunday, because apparently a telephone, cell phone ping. And they brought cadaver dogs, and those dogs hit on the site there where they began digging and were digging all week. And last night at midnight, authorities revealed that they had, in fact, found a mass grave on that property, about a mile from where I'm standing. And they had positively identified 19-year-old Dean Finocchiaro as being one of the victims in that mass grave. The only question was whether the other three missing men -- 19-year-old Jimi Tar Patrick, 22-year-old Mark Sturgis, and 21-year-old Tom Meo -- were also in that mass grave, 12 and a half feet below the ground. Investigators have been continuing to work at that site. Rain started falling here about an hour ago, making their job that much more difficult. But we've been waiting for an update from the district attorney in Bucks County, and we're now hearing from local media. And also, the D.A.'s office re-tweeting some of those reports that, in fact, the only person of interest in this case, Cosmo DiNardo, has now confessed. And I guess the other question, Eric, would be whether anyone else helped him, not just to murder those four men but also to bury them on his parents' property."

      "utterance": "Rick, is there any indication, it looks like the demographic of these four victims -- first of all, he confessed to the four victims that we're talking about? Let me ask you that. And also, any indication of where he met them? They're all 19 to 23, young men. Where did he find these people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a good question. And that's a question we've been asking the D.A. and investigators all week. And they've been a bit elusive, saying they're still trying to piece together how these young men knew each other. We've heard a lot of rumors. We don't want to report on the rumors. We know that two of the four worked with each other and reportedly, DiNardo was seen with one of those men in his vehicle on Friday night. But the reason why they came together and the reason why he may have killed all of them is something for the investigation to reveal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Rick, two quick questions for you. First of all, with the suspect here, do we know about any prior criminal history? That's my first one to you, Rick."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Well, he was arrested on a weapons charge in February, because he had mental issues and had been involuntarily committed and was not allowed to possess a weapon. A judge had dismissed the charge, but they -- they recharged him earlier this week when they considered him a suspect in this case. And they put him in jail, and his dad bailed him out with $100,000 cashier's check, 10 percent of the $1 million bail. But then they rearrested him on a stolen vehicle charge yesterday, because they said he stole one of the vehicles belonging to one of the missing men, and then tried to sell it two days later, after the man went missing. So that's why he was locked up again on a $5 million cash bail. They didn't want him to get out, presumably because they knew he had something to do with these four murders."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And additionally, Rick, let me ask you this. I know you said that he confessed. His lawyer has said that publicly, but that's different from him actually pleading guilty. Because as you said just now, maybe some mental health concerns. So we possibly could be looking at not guilty by reason of insanity or something like that. That's still on the table."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Well, that would be a consideration, I guess. I'm not a lawyer. But I would say this: that if he's confessing in in exchange for no death penalty in this case, then presumably, they're drawing something up; and there won't be any need for a trial. And this thing could be adjudicated before that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "All right, Kat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Rick, is there -- is there any word at all on a motive, or we're not that far yet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a good question. It's what a lot of people are wondering: why he would do this. And again, we've heard rumors, but there's been nothing official about -- he wasn't even named a suspect before today, just a person of interest. So really, there's nothing firm from the D.A.'s office that we can report as to why he might be motivated to kill these four young men."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Very quickly, Rick. We've got to go, but the car that he was attempting to sell, was that -- the car owned, primarily owned by the one that they have confirmed, the same I.D., the one confirmed I.D.?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVENTHAL",
      "utterance": "No. The car they found belonged to a young man named Tom Meo, who was among the four missing. He was -- he went missing on Friday night, and apparently, DiNardo tried to sell that car a couple days later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Got to leave it right there. Rick, thank you very much. Up next, if you thought San Francisco couldn't get more any politically correct or incorrect, you are sadly mistaken. The insane reason why transit officials are now censoring crime surveillance videos, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "In our \"What is Even Happening?\" segment, apparently, crime surveillance video is no longer safe from the grip of political correctness. The public metro system in San Francisco has seen a series of brazen robberies in recent months, where teen mobs swarm and attack innocent passengers to steal their valuables. Surveillance videos of the robberies exist, which of course, could be used to get tips and help catch the criminals. but we can't show you. Transit officials are refusing to release them to the public. Why? Well, these teen mobs are reportedly made up primarily of minority youth, so transit officials say releasing the video would promote, quote, \"racially insensitive commentary\" and promote, quote, \"a racial bias in the riders.\""

This is an overreaction, that what you're describing, Eric. And that's horrible, but indeed, I think the consistency is the problem, where when you see the footage and the coverage; and it looks like person of color after person of color after person of color. That's when those phobias are happening."

    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Well, first thing I thought of, like you had said, is it because of their age? Because if somebody said, \"Because they're juveniles, we're not putting this out there,\" that would have been a different thing. When they said it was because of it being racially insensitive, going further, apparently BART received, once people found out that these were minority youth, there were just huge amounts of phone calls and emails that were extremely racist. Although I have to say, you know, as a liberal living in very diverse Southern California, having formerly lived in Northern California, the people can handle it. They want BART to be transparent. And remember that minorities are also victims of these crimes."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And BART has a history with this. They're looking at the Oscar Grant case, things of this nature, where they have been at fault and they have not been responsible. That's why I'm saying I think they're trying to kind of make up for some bad behavior on their part, possibly."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",

Yesterday, it heard very real arguments in a very real lawsuit involving Naruto, a monkey who gained fame back in 2011. After Naruto took a photographer's camera and he took us selfie, the picture went viral. The photographer later included the selfie in a book. But the photographer is being sued by an animal rights group for copyright protection on behalf of the monkey, arguing that the photographer violated the monkey's rights. Eboni, I'm not a lawyer."
