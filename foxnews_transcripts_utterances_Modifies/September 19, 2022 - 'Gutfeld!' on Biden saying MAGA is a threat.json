Oh, and they'll probably want some food, right? A glass of water. We don't want that.

And as far as an indelible impression, it's the people of the vineyard who left one and it's what phony racists they were. I've seen bird sanctuaries happier to take in cats. They enriched us, says the locals, after the migrants spent just 44 hours there. And I guess that's what you do when something enriches you, you tell it to leave.

Look, we're all in this together, right? Whether you're a struggling farmer on the Texas border or a struggling family like the Obamas. That 29-acre estate is not going to landscape itself. So why is everybody so outraged? They think they're better than you. They're exempt. They have no masks at parties, but you wear them. You can't have a gun, but they got private security. They love alternative energy, but that windmill better stay in your state. Everything they pretend to rail against, they embody. Oh, they love migrants with their leaf blowers.

It's the same media who love a good stunt when it nails Republicans and now finds this shameful. And they're right. It is shameful.

A restaurant in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- they have them there, Steve -- is threatening to sue a customer who left a $3,000 tip in June, but has since refuse to pay for it. You see, this is why I don't tip. The customer named Eric Smith left a massive three-grand tip on a bill for $13.25. He wrote tips for Jesus on the bill, a reference to a social media trend where anonymous patrons give huge tips to servers. But on the other hand, maybe it was meant for another employee named Jesus. Smith has since disputed the charge with his credit card company, but the restaurant had already given the cash to the waitress, quotes the manager, \"We're just out of money at this point, and he told us to sue him. So, that is what we're going to be, we're going to end up doing, I guess.\" You know, it sounds like the customer should have said don't sue me. Doesn't that make sense to people? Guess not. The restaurant gained notoriety for being on an episode of \"The Office.\" That's a new top-rated show on Comedy Central. It's a joke, because it's the only show on Comedy Central. No one knows why Smith thought he didn't have to pay what he promised. He asked for a stromboli not a student loan. Hey, all right, Terrence, who's wrong here?

Man, when it comes to reporting on liberal behavior, CNN could turn (BLEEP) into butter. Don't try that, Steve. I know you have a cookbook. And as far as an indelible impression, it's the people of the vineyard who left one and it's what phony racists they were. I've seen bird sanctuaries happier to take in cats. They enriched us, says the locals, after the migrants spent just 44 hours there. And I guess that's what you do when something enriches you, you tell it to leave.

But you can't blame that on a Republicans, so why report it? So finally, here's the solution to their lies. Spread the challenge around and include the states who brag about their sanctuary status. Look, we're all in this together, right? Whether you're a struggling farmer on the Texas border or a struggling family like the Obamas. That 29-acre estate is not going to landscape itself. So why is everybody so outraged? They think they're better than you. They're exempt. They have no masks at parties, but you wear them. You can't have a gun, but they got private security. They love alternative energy, but that windmill better stay in your state. Everything they pretend to rail against, they embody. Oh, they love migrants with their leaf blowers. Mainly because the tools they use are so loud, it gives them a perfect excuse not to talk to them. Former New York Governor David Paterson said it best.

It's the same media who love a good stunt when it nails Republicans and now finds this shameful. And they're right. It is shameful. The border states brought shame to those who expressed outrage now when they didn't seem to mind the death and suffering created by their own policies that protected their love for cheap labor. The hypocrites are more upset by being exposed than the real suffering they cause by their false virtue signaling.

You see, this is why I don't tip. The customer named Eric Smith left a massive three-grand tip on a bill for $13.25. He wrote tips for Jesus on the bill, a reference to a social media trend where anonymous patrons give huge tips to servers. But on the other hand, maybe it was meant for another employee named Jesus. Smith has since disputed the charge with his credit card company, but the restaurant had already given the cash to the waitress, quotes the manager, \"We're just out of money at this point, and he told us to sue him. So, that is what we're going to be, we're going to end up doing, I guess.\" You know, it sounds like the customer should have said don't sue me. Doesn't that make sense to people? Guess not. The restaurant gained notoriety for being on an episode of \"The Office.\" That's a new top-rated show on Comedy Central. It's a joke, because it's the only show on Comedy Central. No one knows why Smith thought he didn't have to pay what he promised. He asked for a stromboli not a student loan. Hey, all right, Terrence, who's wrong here?
