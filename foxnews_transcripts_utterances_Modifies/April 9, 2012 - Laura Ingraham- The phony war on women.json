And check this out… almost 40 percent of working wives out-earn their husbands. The next generation of women in America will make more than their male counterparts across all levels of employment.  In 49 of the last 50 months, unemployment was lower for women than men; this according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And women receive roughly three-fifth of both bachelors and masters degrees from American colleges and universities.   And get this… it gets better… the National Journal Heartland Monitor Group is reporting that three-fourths of women say they believe they can now advance as far as their talents will take them regardless of their gender. And nearly as many report that they have not experienced discrimination at all in the workplace. Now, I know the President would like to take credit for all of this, but the fact is these gains began long before his inauguration.
