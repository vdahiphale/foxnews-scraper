So is a brokered convention, one in which no one has the necessary delegates on the first ballot, looking more likely? We shall soon know.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. More on that in just a moment.  First, the Bloomberg campaign says its office in Knoxville, Tennessee, has been vandalized, and it is pointing the finger at Bernie Sanders supporters.  Peter Doocy in Las Vegas with more on that. Peter, what's going on here?",

And he's doing decidedly better than she is. So I think that if this were any other situation, I would say with absolutely no reservation that he's going to be the nominee, brokered convention not going to happen. But because it is Bernie Sanders specifically, and we already know how the DNC feels about Bernie Sanders, how establishment Democrats feel about Bernie Sanders, I wouldn't be surprised to see them sort of conspiring, trying to do things to take the nomination away from Bernie Sanders.

I think it's important, of course, though, to remember that we're in the first inning of a long primary process. I mean, I would expect, after Super Tuesday, the field will narrow significantly.

They felt like the last time around that was inappropriate, that you shouldn't have these superdelegates wielding so much influence. And so they really pushed for some changes where now you don't have any winner-take-all states. And so it's actually made the likelihood of a brokered convention more -- it's made it more likely, which in this case now actually hurts Bernie Sanders. It's hard to imagine anyone else running away with just enough delegates to get to the convention and have it not be contested, because Sanders has been doing so well so far. I suppose if Bloomberg really knocks it out of the park on Super Tuesday, he could do it, but nobody else seems poised to have the momentum to ride into the convention with enough delegates.   It will be ironic if all of these changes pushed for in part because of Bernie Sanders not winning the nomination last time actually leads to a brokered convention this time, which, again, keeps Bernie Sanders from the nomination.",

He's trying to provoke the president into making it seem like this is the general election, the Democratic primary has already been decided, it's me vs. Bloomberg.   And I just feel like it's a silly strategy on Bloomberg's part, because what it's doing is, if you have got any moderate voters, who they may love the president's economy, but they don't love his tone, they don't love the way he talks about his opponents, by doing the same thing, by taking these little petty shots, you bring yourself down. And I think it makes it potentially harder for him to be someone who, say, a suburban woman who may not love the president's tweets, but does love his economy, decide to go for Mike Bloomberg.

The jury at about 2:15 came into the court, and they alerted everyone that they had reached a unanimous decision on three of the five counts against Harvey Weinstein, count two, a criminal sex act charge, and counts four and five, which are rape charges.  These charges all have to do with the accusations directly involved in this case, one, the alleged accusation that Harvey Weinstein forced Mimi Haleyi to perform oral sex on him in 2006, and the other that he raped actress Jessica Mann in a New York hotel room in 2013. The jury, however, said they were deadlocked and could not come to unanimous decision on counts one and three. These are predatory sexual assault charges, the most serious charges again Weinstein, punishable by up to life in prison. The jury asked the judge whether a partial verdict was OK. The defense said they were willing to accept a partial verdict. The prosecution said no. At that point, the judge said the jury needed to come back with a unanimous decision on all five counts. They were sent back to deliberate, and they will be back here on Monday for a fifth day of deliberation. Now, in order for this jury to find Weinstein guilty of predatory sexual assault charges, counts one or three, prosecutors needed to prove that Weinstein had committed a prior sex crime. And in this case, they relied heavily on the testimony of their star witness, actress Annabella Sciorra of \"Sopranos\" fame. Now, Sciorra says that Weinstein raped her back in the early '90s. So in order for these -- this jury, Neil, to have come back with a decision those counts, one and three, the ones that they are a hung jury on, they needed to not only come up with a decision the two charges that they were facing, but they also needed to have believed Sciorra's account from the early '90s. And that's where it seems like they're having a tough time is on one and three. And we will see what happens -- Neil.",

Well, the entire world community immediately followed our lead and evacuated their citizens. And they're now gone to effective quarantine at home and whatnot.

Now, it's unclear how much of a role the Google form will have in tabulating the vote totals. But, of course, there's a lot of anxiety around the technology that the party and the state plan to use following the Iowa caucuses, the DNC trying to manage expectations, not committing to release any results on the day of the vote, saying accuracy is more important than speed. Now, the state party originally planned to use an app developed by the same company behind the bungled Iowa caucuses, but, after Iowa, they scrapped that app, with less than three weeks to put a new system in place, instead distributing 2,000 iPads to caucus sites pre-loaded with that Google software to send data to the cloud. As a safeguard, totals will also be called in over the phone and written down on paper. But there was some concern, of course, about the security of the iPad networks that they are using, as well as the tech-savviness of the volunteers, who have to use the Google forms with little training.

We don't know who is responsible for this vandalism, but we do know it echoes language from the Sanders campaign and its supporters.\" The Bloomberg campaign is also now spending money in cities President Trump is visiting like Las Vegas to troll him with billboards that say things like, \"Donald Trump eats burnt stake. Donald Trump cheats at golf\" and \"Donald Trump's wall fell over.\" And while that's going on, Bernie Sanders is doing things the old-fashioned way in California, trying to talk to registered independents and trying to talk them into switching parties so they can vote for him on Super Tuesday."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "He agreed. Anyway, so a brokered convention where, again, as I say, a candidate doesn't have the winning number of delegates, in this case, 1,991, to close the deal, does that mean it is more likely? Then you go into a second ballot, where you have better than 700 superdelegates playing a role. Messy. Let's go to Kat Timpf, the host of \"Sincerely Kat\" on FOX nation, FOX News contributor Kristen Soltis Anderson, Democratic strategist Shavar Jeffries. What do you think, Kat?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATHERINE TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's more likely now than it has been in recent years, even -- not even close, because I think that Bernie has a really good shot just because if you look at the way things are laid out, there for people sort of vying for this moderate lane, and then he's only competing with Elizabeth Warren for the more progressive voters. And he's doing decidedly better than she is. So I think that if this were any other situation, I would say with absolutely no reservation that he's going to be the nominee, brokered convention not going to happen. But because it is Bernie Sanders specifically, and we already know how the DNC feels about Bernie Sanders, how establishment Democrats feel about Bernie Sanders, I wouldn't be surprised to see them sort of conspiring, trying to do things to take the nomination away from Bernie Sanders. So I don't think that it is most likely. I think it is more likely than it ever has been in the past."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Shavar, maybe help me with this. There's another school of thought. And it's happened more often than it's not that whoever has the most delegates getting to the convention usually wins on the first ballot, because everyone sort of gloms toward that candidate. But, normally, that means that candidate has a substantial lead in those delegates. What do you think happens in that event?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAVAR JEFFRIES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you're exactly right. I think it depends, to the extent we get there, what percentage of delegates the front-runner has. I mean, if it's in the 40s, that's one set of conversations. If it's around one-third, that's a very different set of conversations, when two-thirds of the party have chosen another nominee. I think it's important, of course, though, to remember that we're in the first inning of a long primary process. I mean, I would expect, after Super Tuesday, the field will narrow significantly. And when we have fewer candidates, I think it dramatically reduces the likelihood we will have a brokered convention."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Kristen, another thing is, is this canard that started and maybe an urban legend that somehow Bernie Sanders was robbed of the nomination four years ago, when, in fact, the popular vote kind of did in the end mirror the delegate awards. We can go back in time and argue that nevertheless, but clearly you have a lot of Sanders folks who feel that they were burnt then, they feel they're about to be burnt now. And there's going to be holy hell at that convention in that event. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, the irony is that a lot of the changes to the Democratic nomination process this time around came as a result of Bernie Sanders supporters who were aggrieved. They felt like the last time around that was inappropriate, that you shouldn't have these superdelegates wielding so much influence. And so they really pushed for some changes where now you don't have any winner-take-all states. And so it's actually made the likelihood of a brokered convention more -- it's made it more likely, which in this case now actually hurts Bernie Sanders. It's hard to imagine anyone else running away with just enough delegates to get to the convention and have it not be contested, because Sanders has been doing so well so far. I suppose if Bloomberg really knocks it out of the park on Super Tuesday, he could do it, but nobody else seems poised to have the momentum to ride into the convention with enough delegates. It will be ironic if all of these changes pushed for in part because of Bernie Sanders not winning the nomination last time actually leads to a brokered convention this time, which, again, keeps Bernie Sanders from the nomination."

Ultimately, it wasn't required. But it was a close call. And the argument was always, Kat, in these circumstances, a brokered convention always means the party that's experiencing it loses it, when, in fact, back at the time of Abraham Lincoln, when he won in one, of course, he did OK, he won. So we're just not used to it these days, but it was much more common in the past."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",

People often talk about the progressive wing and then the more moderate wing. But when you hear a lot of Bernie supporters saying things like, I will never vote for a Mike Bloomberg, and then a lot of the more moderate people saying, I would never vote for Bernie Sanders, it's -- I don't even know if wings is the right way to talk about it. It's like we're talking about different birds."

I do remember too, Shavar, when a lot of people take a look at division within the Democratic Party, they were certainly talking that way about Republicans four years ago, when candidate Trump was supposed to lead Republicans to total disarray. We ultimately know what happened. Democrats are salivating at the prospect, yes, we can easily beat this guy. We know what happened. And I'm wondering if Republicans are doing the same thing in reverse now, assuming it gets to be Bernie Sanders, we are going to have a field day here. I always say be careful what you wish for, and not just because I'm an old fart. What do you think? Because you're a young man."

President Trump is the one kind of entity that unites Democrats. So, despite the other divisions we may have within the party, we're going to be united after Labor Day to defeat President Trump."

But I do think, for instance, some of these billboards, things like trying to make fun of Donald Trump for eating burnt steak, he's trying to provoke the president into tweeting about him. He's trying to provoke the president into making it seem like this is the general election, the Democratic primary has already been decided, it's me vs. Bloomberg. And I just feel like it's a silly strategy on Bloomberg's part, because what it's doing is, if you have got any moderate voters, who they may love the president's economy, but they don't love his tone, they don't love the way he talks about his opponents, by doing the same thing, by taking these little petty shots, you bring yourself down. And I think it makes it potentially harder for him to be someone who, say, a suburban woman who may not love the president's tweets, but does love his economy, decide to go for Mike Bloomberg. If he's just sort of playing this goofy game of, oh, Donald Trump cheats at golf, I mean, it's just silly. And it's so beneath running for president. And it just puts him on a lower level."

He will have to wait until Monday now, at the earliest, to hear his fate. The jury in that rape trial dismissed, after saying it was deadlocked on some of the morning serious charges. They will resume deliberations on Monday. Bryan Llenas is there right now with the latest. Hey, Bryan."

      "speaker": "BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Well, good afternoon. Look, this is a little bit complicated. So stay with me for a second. The jury at about 2:15 came into the court, and they alerted everyone that they had reached a unanimous decision on three of the five counts against Harvey Weinstein, count two, a criminal sex act charge, and counts four and five, which are rape charges. These charges all have to do with the accusations directly involved in this case, one, the alleged accusation that Harvey Weinstein forced Mimi Haleyi to perform oral sex on him in 2006, and the other that he raped actress Jessica Mann in a New York hotel room in 2013. The jury, however, said they were deadlocked and could not come to unanimous decision on counts one and three. These are predatory sexual assault charges, the most serious charges again Weinstein, punishable by up to life in prison. The jury asked the judge whether a partial verdict was OK. The defense said they were willing to accept a partial verdict. The prosecution said no. At that point, the judge said the jury needed to come back with a unanimous decision on all five counts. They were sent back to deliberate, and they will be back here on Monday for a fifth day of deliberation. Now, in order for this jury to find Weinstein guilty of predatory sexual assault charges, counts one or three, prosecutors needed to prove that Weinstein had committed a prior sex crime. And in this case, they relied heavily on the testimony of their star witness, actress Annabella Sciorra of \"Sopranos\" fame. Now, Sciorra says that Weinstein raped her back in the early '90s. So in order for these -- this jury, Neil, to have come back with a decision those counts, one and three, the ones that they are a hung jury on, they needed to not only come up with a decision the two charges that they were facing, but they also needed to have believed Sciorra's account from the early '90s. And that's where it seems like they're having a tough time is on one and three. And we will see what happens -- Neil."

That is how South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem sees it. And no amount of Bloomberg apologies are going to erase that image and that memory. The governor joins us right now.

When you plant corn, actually, it specifically has to be at a depth that matches up with where it will get optimum yield and growth. And so it's just extremely arrogant of him. And I think that's the difference between him and President Trump, is, Bloomberg is constantly belittling everyday people. And the president gets up every morning and is fighting for the everyday person, for the farmer, for the minor, for the worker that's out there trying to pay his bills.

It -- in the evening of that day, when I saw the plan for holding us in a quarantine on the ship, it was clearly a foolish plan. And so I immediately began trying to contact the U.S. government. It took five days to break through the logjam to get the communication through. And Dr. Phil Roe finally put me in touch with the HHS emergency response team leader, Dr. Kadlec. And they're American heroes who organized that first rescue flight, which was obviously successful, even though it was opposed by the CDC. Well, the entire world community immediately followed our lead and evacuated their citizens. And they're now gone to effective quarantine at home and whatnot. And now we're left with 100 Americans held hostage by a virus, rather than a terrorist group, but abroad. And they have been abandoned by the U.S. government.

And, as president, I will make sure that you do.\" But what to make of this latest wrinkle, development, whatever you want to call it? Former South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy.

They want us to spend years and years investigating one another. So I have the same reaction I did last night. I don't think Russia -- Russia wants Trump to beat Bernie Sanders. But in defense of the Sanders campaign, they won't whatever causes the most amount of discord in this country. And, quite frankly, Neil, they have had a good couple of years."

That's the way it's being played, but that everyone should double up and make sure, whatever they want, they don't get?"

It causes people to question the legitimacy of the 2016 election, and, therefore, Russia wins. They're not our friend. It's not like they like the Democrats more than Republicans or Republicans more than Democrats. They don't like America."

He's an autocratic thug who is attempting to destroy democracy and crush dissent in Russia. Let's be clear. The Russians want to undermine American democracy by dividing us up. Unlike the current president, I stand firmly against their efforts.\" Do you think that the president should personally get in front of this and stop those efforts?"

      "speaker": "GOWDY",

So the reason you and I are talking about this now is because a House Democrat leaked to The New York Times an assessment made by the intelligence community. So when I hear the word assessment, Neil, that's just a long way of saying opinion. That is their opinion. But he's the commander in chief. You need to go convince him. You go take Mike Pompeo and whoever else he has confidence in and convince him that Russia is trying to mess with this country, and I bet you will get a forceful response."

He might be passing the hat, because his campaign is, well, needing some dough, setting a $13 million fund-raising goal by Super Tuesday, as he and a lot of other Democrats are running short on cash. The Wall Street Journal's James Freeman, bestselling author as well, on that. It's an interesting piece in your fine paper talking about the irony being here that, even with the money issue and everything else, we could still see people drop off and still have kind of what is a traditional quadrennial event here, the field winnows down. What do you think?"

      "utterance": "Yes. Kudos to the reporters on our news site and for pointing out I think what a lot of people didn't realize, because this has been a campaign characterized by lots of candidates raising lots of money. But as of January, the one with a lot on hand still after spending for the various things in a campaign is Bernie Sanders. So he's got a big cash advantage as of the end of January. Now, this is very fluid. People raise money after good debate performance, but what they also point out is that Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Klobuchar have not reserved much television time for the Super Tuesday states, suggesting they are low on funds. Sanders and Bloomberg, of course, have been buying lots of airtime. So it suggests that, although it says that Bernie is financially strong, I think it may actually, counterintuitively, not be good for him, because it means some of his rivals could drop out more quickly than expected."

Now, it's unclear how much of a role the Google form will have in tabulating the vote totals. But, of course, there's a lot of anxiety around the technology that the party and the state plan to use following the Iowa caucuses, the DNC trying to manage expectations, not committing to release any results on the day of the vote, saying accuracy is more important than speed. Now, the state party originally planned to use an app developed by the same company behind the bungled Iowa caucuses, but, after Iowa, they scrapped that app, with less than three weeks to put a new system in place, instead distributing 2,000 iPads to caucus sites pre-loaded with that Google software to send data to the cloud. As a safeguard, totals will also be called in over the phone and written down on paper. But there was some concern, of course, about the security of the iPad networks that they are using, as well as the tech-savviness of the volunteers, who have to use the Google forms with little training. Nevada Democrats reportedly held a few sets of training, scrambling to get everyone up to speed. And they're saying that the most important thing here is accuracy, not speed, Neil."
