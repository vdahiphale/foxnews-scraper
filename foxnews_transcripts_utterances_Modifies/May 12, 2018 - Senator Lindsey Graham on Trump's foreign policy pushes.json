      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to a very special \"Justice\" from Israel. I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last Saturday night. Tonight, I join you from Jerusalem where history will be made in less than 48 hours when the new US Embassy opens, but it is also a volatile time of unprecedented clashes between Israel and Iran.  We have a stellar guest lineup here in Jerusalem, US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, Senator Lindsey Graham, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Pastor John Hagee and many others to here to discuss the new embassy, the latest conflict here on the ground and of course, President Trump's bold foreign policy move over the last week. But first, my opening statement.  We do join you tonight during a truly historic moment in Israel's history, one that is cause for great celebration. This week, not only has President Donald Trump chosen to withdraw from the disastrous Obama Iran nuclear deal, but we are here on the eve of the momentous opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, a move that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A move greatly appreciated by the people of Israel as evidenced on street corners everywhere we went.  President Trump's pullout from the Iran deal, although suspected became a virtual certainty when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proved through Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad that Iran had been lying to the world when it was continuing uranium enrichment and nuclear development. Iranian documents uncovered by that same intel agency are proof positive that Iran lied. Gee, what a shock.  On the day of the withdrawal from the Iran deal, bomb shelters opened up in the Golan Heights and the Israeli army was on high alert as Israel braced for imminent attack. As we proceeded from Haifa to the Golan Heights, there were no sirens, school buses and taxis continued to run, but that night in Tiberius, we heard the unequivocal sound of rockets and at breakfast, we found out that indeed, there was an Iranian rocket offensive towards Israel from inside Syria. Israel responded with strategic precision, targeting munitions, storage warehouses, logistics, headquarters and intel systems of Iran within its proxy Syria. Israel does what Israel needs to do.  And today, Iranians are marching against the United States, protesting President Trump's decision to withdraw from their nuclear deal. Maybe they ought to consider protesting that the $150 billion Obama gave them in cash was not used to benefit them, but instead it was used to support both its nuclear development, as well as its military budget, which has grown by almost 40%.   Now, Obama's Iran deal, make no mistake, destroyed 70 years of bipartisan US foreign policy in the Middle East. His delusional deal abandoned Israel and Egypt, the largest Arab country and alienated the Sunni Muslims, the moderate Arab states guaranteeing that they would face a nuclear Iran. Iran, of course, a leading state-sponsor of terror, exports dangerous missiles and supports terrorist proxies and militias like Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban. The idea that it seeks a successful nuclear energy program is absurd to even anyone with half a brain. And as Obama turned his back on the slaughter of Christians, and ignored his own red line in the Syria sand, he allowed Russia, through this vacuum to become a dominant regional player in the Middle East.   Donald Trump's withdrawal from that deal was the United States standing shoulder to shoulder with our ally, Israel against the rest of the world. It sent a huge signal to Iran and Shia Muslims that we stood with the more moderate Sunnis, and although Great Britain and France had joined the United States earlier in taking out Syrian weapons facility, they chose to stand with Iran against Israel and the United States. But Trump has reassured the world that his word is worth more than any former US presidents like Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Barack Obama, who all promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but didn't deliver. His word is worth more than any treaty, and stronger than any UN resolution. He promised, and he delivered.  Trump not only sent a message to Iran, but to Russia as well that the US back as a dominant regional player after the Obama years. He recognizes a reality that everyone else in the West willingly blinds themselves to and that is that Jerusalem is the one and only capital of Israel.   By Trump putting this in for (inaudible) and what has been history for the last 3000 years, and that is that Jerusalem has been the capital of one people's country or one kingdom, that people is the Jews, and that country is and was Israel. The empires that tried to destroy Israel and its capital, Jerusalem are long gone. Yet the Jews still speak the same language and practice the same religion, which is the foundation of our Judeo-Christian nation.  Donald Trump sent Iranians who are the descendants of Persia a message to reflect on their own history, and that it was the King of Persia, who thousand years before Mohammad was born that said Jerusalem was the capital of the Jewish people's country. There will be no Ottoman empires or Shia nations that will destroy Jerusalem any longer. Donald Trump recognize history. He, like King Cyrus before him fulfilled the biblical prophecy of the gods worshiped by Jews, Christians and yes, Muslims, that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state, and that the Jewish people finally deserve a righteous, free, and sovereign Israel. That's my open.  Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine.  Joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and of course to the historic embassy opening here in Jerusalem is US Ambassador to Israel, Ambassador David Friedman. All right, Ambassador, is there anything I said in my open that was not correct or that you didn't agree with?",

      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to a very special \"Justice\" from Israel. I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last Saturday night. Tonight, I join you from Jerusalem where history will be made in less than 48 hours when the new US Embassy opens, but it is also a volatile time of unprecedented clashes between Israel and Iran. We have a stellar guest lineup here in Jerusalem, US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, Senator Lindsey Graham, Congressman Ron DeSantis, Pastor John Hagee and many others to here to discuss the new embassy, the latest conflict here on the ground and of course, President Trump's bold foreign policy move over the last week. But first, my opening statement. We do join you tonight during a truly historic moment in Israel's history, one that is cause for great celebration. This week, not only has President Donald Trump chosen to withdraw from the disastrous Obama Iran nuclear deal, but we are here on the eve of the momentous opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, a move that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A move greatly appreciated by the people of Israel as evidenced on street corners everywhere we went. President Trump's pullout from the Iran deal, although suspected became a virtual certainty when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proved through Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad that Iran had been lying to the world when it was continuing uranium enrichment and nuclear development. Iranian documents uncovered by that same intel agency are proof positive that Iran lied. Gee, what a shock. On the day of the withdrawal from the Iran deal, bomb shelters opened up in the Golan Heights and the Israeli army was on high alert as Israel braced for imminent attack. As we proceeded from Haifa to the Golan Heights, there were no sirens, school buses and taxis continued to run, but that night in Tiberius, we heard the unequivocal sound of rockets and at breakfast, we found out that indeed, there was an Iranian rocket offensive towards Israel from inside Syria. Israel responded with strategic precision, targeting munitions, storage warehouses, logistics, headquarters and intel systems of Iran within its proxy Syria. Israel does what Israel needs to do. And today, Iranians are marching against the United States, protesting President Trump's decision to withdraw from their nuclear deal. Maybe they ought to consider protesting that the $150 billion Obama gave them in cash was not used to benefit them, but instead it was used to support both its nuclear development, as well as its military budget, which has grown by almost 40%. Now, Obama's Iran deal, make no mistake, destroyed 70 years of bipartisan US foreign policy in the Middle East. His delusional deal abandoned Israel and Egypt, the largest Arab country and alienated the Sunni Muslims, the moderate Arab states guaranteeing that they would face a nuclear Iran. Iran, of course, a leading state-sponsor of terror, exports dangerous missiles and supports terrorist proxies and militias like Hezbollah, Hamas and the Taliban. The idea that it seeks a successful nuclear energy program is absurd to even anyone with half a brain. And as Obama turned his back on the slaughter of Christians, and ignored his own red line in the Syria sand, he allowed Russia, through this vacuum to become a dominant regional player in the Middle East. Donald Trump's withdrawal from that deal was the United States standing shoulder to shoulder with our ally, Israel against the rest of the world. It sent a huge signal to Iran and Shia Muslims that we stood with the more moderate Sunnis, and although Great Britain and France had joined the United States earlier in taking out Syrian weapons facility, they chose to stand with Iran against Israel and the United States. But Trump has reassured the world that his word is worth more than any former US presidents like Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Barack Obama, who all promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but didn't deliver. His word is worth more than any treaty, and stronger than any UN resolution. He promised, and he delivered. Trump not only sent a message to Iran, but to Russia as well that the US back as a dominant regional player after the Obama years. He recognizes a reality that everyone else in the West willingly blinds themselves to and that is that Jerusalem is the one and only capital of Israel. By Trump putting this in for (inaudible) and what has been history for the last 3000 years, and that is that Jerusalem has been the capital of one people's country or one kingdom, that people is the Jews, and that country is and was Israel. The empires that tried to destroy Israel and its capital, Jerusalem are long gone. Yet the Jews still speak the same language and practice the same religion, which is the foundation of our Judeo-Christian nation. Donald Trump sent Iranians who are the descendants of Persia a message to reflect on their own history, and that it was the King of Persia, who thousand years before Mohammad was born that said Jerusalem was the capital of the Jewish people's country. There will be no Ottoman empires or Shia nations that will destroy Jerusalem any longer. Donald Trump recognize history. He, like King Cyrus before him fulfilled the biblical prophecy of the gods worshiped by Jews, Christians and yes, Muslims, that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish state, and that the Jewish people finally deserve a righteous, free, and sovereign Israel. That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram #judgejeanine. Joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and of course to the historic embassy opening here in Jerusalem is US Ambassador to Israel, Ambassador David Friedman. All right, Ambassador, is there anything I said in my open that was not correct or that you didn't agree with?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID FRIEDMAN, US AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL",
      "utterance": "Judge Jeanine, you hit the nail on the head. I am in violent agreement with everything that you said. In particular, I appreciate your connecting the decision on Iran with the President's decision to move the embassy. Because in both cases, they are really driven by a similar approach to foreign policy by the President and to commitment to the truth, the facts rather than hopeless fantasies, to courage and to again placing the United States in the central role in the world with regard to foreign policy especially with regard to malign activity that threatens the entire world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
      "utterance": "I think they harbored again this fantasy that somehow the line activity would somehow end with a handshake and some extension of friendship. Obama's view was that we will welcome Iran back into the community of nations and will somehow reform and we saw how they reformed. They reformed all the way through Yemen, they now control part of that. They have reformed in Iraq, and in Syria and Lebanon and they're are now, the primary risk to the stability of the entire Middle East region."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
      "utterance": "There is no basis to think it will work against the peace process, what the president did was - he said to the Palestinians, \"You do not have a veto on a historical fact. You don't have a veto on depriving our country from keeping a promise,\" which by the way, it's not just the Presidents promise, he kept it, but this is a law since 1995 that was overwhelmingly passed by both Houses of Congress. He said, \"This is an American interest and we're going to do it and we're not going to be held hostage by a rogue regime telling us what we can and can't do.\" And that's an important message in the peace process. People need to understand they cannot play these cards that have no basis in fact or reality."

      "utterance": "We're going to see a beautiful ceremony. I'm so excited about it. We are going to have an inspirational moving ceremony. I spoke to the president this morning, he was so excited about it. He'll be there on video, but we'll have great soaring rhetoric from some great speakers. The prime minister of Israel will speak, Jared Kushner will speak, the president of Israel will speak, and you're going to see, I think America really at its best in showing its great friendship to Israel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And you know, as you were speaking, they were showing on screen all of the signs that are going up in Jerusalem and saying that this is the US embassy in English, Arabic and Hebrew. And to so many people, and I'll talk about this later in Street Justice, it has created a great deal of pride for the Israelis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, the state of Israel is in love with President Trump. They have such admiration and gratitude towards him and to the entire United States and it's wonderful to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And how do you think - one last question, how do you think that the Palestinians are going to react to this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRIEDMAN",
      "utterance": "The Palestinians are not reacting well, but, they will change. They will change over time because they will understand that the United States continues to extend its hand in piece and people need to focus on what's important - quality-of-life, more infrastructure, more security, more education, better hospitals. The United States is there to help the Palestinians and I think we'll reach that point. There had been bumps in the road for 50 years, no one has managed to solve this rubik's cube in 50 years, I think we are going to make progress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

What you think brings us to the point in time where we can actually get this done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLERMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what President Trump has delivered is not just keeping a promise, which is quite unusual, but delivering leadership. We live in a world where there is very little leadership. There's very little leadership in Europe or elsewhere, and President Trump has delivered that leadership over and over again. He has done it by deciding to move the embassy to Jerusalem, by pulling out of the horrible, cynical deal with Iran, by next month's meeting the leader of North Korea - when you look at all of these achievements in a very relatively short period of time, I think he is not just keeping promises, but making history."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, let me ask you this, you were Israel's ambassador to the United Nation. Now, the United Nations will not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The question that I have right now is, is the United Nations even relevant anymore?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLERMAN",
      "utterance": "I think the United Nations is relevant only because it is the Parliament of the world and the only place when 193 countries gather and discuss the fate of the world, but as far as actually making a difference, I don't think the United Nations is making a difference, and as far as Israel is concerned, the United Nations is unfortunately a citadel of hypocrisy, and not just double standards, but triple standards. It is the standard for democracies, and standards for totalitarianism, and a special standard for Israel to which it devotes a lot of time in a very, very hostile way, and therefore, I think it cannot be an honest broker, and far as the world is concerned especially in our region, it is probably also very irrelevant at the moment."

There is a huge discrepancy between what the ambassadors of those countries tell you in private and what they say in public, but I think we can make inroads.

They use proxies, so they will fight until the last Hezbollah man, until the last Syria man, until the last Hamas and Islamic Jihad men. When they start confronting us directly, you see the results. They're getting beaten and beaten hard. So, I believe that at this point, they are not much to the idea in terms of intelligence, in terms of our capabilities from air and other ways, and they would use more proxies, but I think, the way to handle Iran is isolation. And I think more and more of them getting isolated in the region. You know, all the Sunni countries are against them because they know Iran is converting them."

That's why they are there in order to attack us. We are not going to let it happen. We are going to just - to let them come in and threaten our population.

Because the Jewish people are not accustomed to Christians doing acts of kindness for them. That event began to take off across America because of our national television program, and then in 2006, when Ahmadinejad started talking about destroying Israel and death to the Jews and so forth, I said, \"Israel needs a grassroots organization in the United States of America and a lobbying group in Washington, hooking those forces up together so that any time an issue comes to Washington that's detrimental to Israel and the Jewish people, we can stand up and speak up with united force.\""

It is a fact that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people. It is indivisible.

Maybe - could he just cut a deal to keep himself in power? I'm not sure he's at that point yet. But boy, two years ago, there would've been no chance you would have had any type of concessions out of North Korea, and this president has a good chance, and I think this president knows - he knows a bad deal and he will walk away if there's a bad deal. He's not going to just grant concessions like Obama did."

So, that may actually give the people of North Korea some hope that they could get some things done for their best, because this whole regime for decades has all been about the ruling elite and keeping them in power all the gains are given to a select few."
