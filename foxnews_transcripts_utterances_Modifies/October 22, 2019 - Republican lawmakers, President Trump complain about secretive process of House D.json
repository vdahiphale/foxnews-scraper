I think there are real concerns about that. So they want an X- factor. That's where impeachment comes in.  I do think that they are going to put this to the floor. I think they're going to impeach this president. I think they have been meaning to do that all along. And that's why this all looks like such a construct. They didn't get enough, they didn't have enough out of the Mueller investigation, and so now you have this effort, which looks like it's all been coordinated behind the scenes.

I will say at this point for the president, impeachment is a serious thing. You are overturning the results of an election, right? Chairman Nadler said a while ago that to do that you have to arrived at a point where the American people and even Trump supporters say this is the right thing to do. We are nowhere close to that. Most of the growth in the polls for impeachment has come from Democrats. I think at this point they are going to impeach him. For the president, the unfairness and sort of irregularity of the Pelosi impeachment, not following the rules and precedent, I think that's an advantage for him now going into the Senate, if you assume, as I do, that they are going to impeach him, because I think he can -- impeachment is partly a case to the American people and partly a case to the Senate. And I think that these measures, if they don't go to court first to enforce the subpoenas, a court could rule against this or could say we are not getting involved and then the president doesn't turn over his papers.

It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.\" Rudy Giuliani there. Let's bring in our panel, former CIA analyst Buck Sexton, Johanna Maska, former aide to president Barack Obama, and Bill McGurn, main street columnist for the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Bill, your take on what you read from the opening statement from the acting ambassador and where this stands now."

We have these selective leaks day in and day out. How can the American people even decide? And ultimately this is something that is a political question. They dress it up like it's a legal process, but what Pelosi and Democrats are doing is clearly intended to derail and destroy this president going in to an election year when this should be decided by the American people."

    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that there is a couple things coinciding. One, there's a little bit of panic. You have seen some articles this week about Democrats wondering if Joe Biden is not really the frontrunner, if Elizabeth Warren is perhaps a little too radical, can we really beat this guy. I think there are real concerns about that. So they want an X- factor. That's where impeachment comes in. I do think that they are going to put this to the floor. I think they're going to impeach this president. I think they have been meaning to do that all along. And that's why this all looks like such a construct. They didn't get enough, they didn't have enough out of the Mueller investigation, and so now you have this effort, which looks like it's all been coordinated behind the scenes. And, again, there is no good faith here at all. Trump is the middle of trench warfare politically. He understands that, and he is trying to fight his way out of it."

I will say at this point for the president, impeachment is a serious thing. You are overturning the results of an election, right? Chairman Nadler said a while ago that to do that you have to arrived at a point where the American people and even Trump supporters say this is the right thing to do. We are nowhere close to that. Most of the growth in the polls for impeachment has come from Democrats. I think at this point they are going to impeach him. For the president, the unfairness and sort of irregularity of the Pelosi impeachment, not following the rules and precedent, I think that's an advantage for him now going into the Senate, if you assume, as I do, that they are going to impeach him, because I think he can -- impeachment is partly a case to the American people and partly a case to the Senate. And I think that these measures, if they don't go to court first to enforce the subpoenas, a court could rule against this or could say we are not getting involved and then the president doesn't turn over his papers. So I think it could help him, the kind of unfairness and arbitrary way they are going about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "It seems like there is a dual track here, kind of a race to the finish line. One is the impeachment inquiry and the impeachment process. The other is this other investigation, the I.G. report that's coming out very soon, we're told, and the report by John Durham, which is expanded to include interviewing the former CIA Director Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

      "speaker": "MASKA",
      "utterance": "I think though that we are talking about dual tracks in two ways, right, because today Bill Taylor's opening statement talks about a dual track in national security. And I think there is a lot that are going to leave Republicans and Democrats wondering what's going on. I think what we have got, though, right now is that impeachment ultimately, it's not about polls. It's about the story. And so does the president have the trust of the American people, and those people in Congress, ultimately the senators, who are going to be voting on whether he should be impeached."

      "utterance": "Democrats, I think, understand that going on offense right now with this whole impeachment probe is essentially because it gets in advance of the inspector general report that's going to come out as well as this investigation by U.S. attorney out of Connecticut. There were irregularities. Everybody who has been following this process of the Russian collusion conspiracy understands that we never got good answers in the beginning. Some Democrats, some senior Democrats who served under the Obama administration, I think, are concerned and should be, people that were ad various senior levels in the government then. And they don't want this report that comes out and everything else to look like it has any legitimacy. And that's part of why they are running with this right now, because they are going to say how dare you talk to Ukraine about this investigation. Of course, they are going to talk to Ukraine about the investigation. The Justice Department is openly looking into this."
