      "sentences": "--another concern. Mr. President, thank you so much. I'm Laura Ingraham with a packed “Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight.   First, we have some breaking news. I just alluded to it. Hours ago the Department of Justice announced the arrest of a Syrian refugee in connection with an ISIS-inspired plan to carry out a terrorist attack on a Christian Church in Pittsburgh. Mustafa Mousab Alowemer, 21 years old was accused of planning to attack the Legacy International Worship Center to support the cause of ISIS and to inspire other ISIS supporters in the United States.  This was the very concern that Trump, of course, used to pause this type of immigration from countries like Syria in the first place. Now here with a quick update for us, by phone, is the former Congressman for this district, Keith Rothfus. Keith, tell us what you know tonight. We don't even have a picture of the suspect yet. This is how kind of tightly held this was. But details are trickling in moment-by-moment. We're going to keep everyone updated throughout the hour. Tell us what you know Keith.  KEITH ROTHFUS, FORMER PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN (via telephone): Yes. No picture yet. But great work by the FBI. This is exactly the kind of work that the FBI is supposed to do when you look at the controversies they've been in the last couple years. This is exactly what they should be doing, and they discovered this plot.  This is a 21-year-old who came to this country from Syria in August of 2016, just five months before President Trump came in, and announced extreme vetting measure. And it's interesting, because you look at the complaint against this suspect, he says that he was arrested in Jordan three times - probably was in Jordan. So you would have think that maybe extreme vetting could have picked that up. But great work by the FBI. This guy was plotting to kill Christians. And not just Christians, he wanted to kill Yazidis and Shia Muslims, because they did not fit in his worldview.",

We're a nation of immigrants. We love immigrants, and we love to care for true refugees. But this is ridiculous and this - thank god, this was stopped.

When Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney suggested Ocasio-Cortez learn her history, MSNBC Host, Chris Hayes stepped in for some what does the Left call it \"mansplaining\".   Telling Cheney, \"If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps. And have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis\".  To that the actual twitter account for the museum dedicated to Auschwitz and the memorial hit back at Hayes and recommended that he, \"Please consider following at Auschwitz Museum where every day we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of Auschwitz\". Now one might think being called out by one of the more solemn historical museums on the planet would have stopped him in his tracks. Yet, hours later on a show, Hayes invited a guest on to play defense for him.  ANDREA PITZER, AUTHOR, \"ONE LONG NIGHT: A GLOBAL HISTORY OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS\": I would say that for 40 years before Auschwitz we had concentration camps - things that were called concentration camps.

No.  Are we temporarily holding people who are coming over the border illegally or of their own volition? Yes, we are. Sadly, though, this is just part of a larger effort. We've documented this on the show. The President's enemies are trying to situate not just this policy, but his entire presidency somewhere near Berlin circa 1940.

Victor, during the financial crisis, the banks were labeled too big to fail. But watching the - I think the Left and the media rushed to her defense. Can the same be said for AOC?

I mean, never in the history of concentration camps has anybody crossed into territory where there was one. The 15 million - 15 million Soviet citizens POWs did not go over to German lines, because there were concentration camps. And you can diddle that with the Boers (ph), there were 30,000 parish (ph). The difference between a concentration camp and a death camp is a distinction without a difference. In fact, as horrible as Belsen and Treblinka and the Auschwitz, the death camps were, there were 15 million people in the Eastern Front - probably 10 million in China that died in so- called concentration camps. There's never been in the history of concentration camp treatment for transgendered people and counseling and for hormone therapy, as there is now in some of our detention camps.

Because she wants to demonize the President of the United States. And that's why so many in the Democrat Party have supported her, because they want the American people to believe that our good President is somehow no different - god forbid, from Adolf Hitler, and that he has Nazi aspirations for the immigrants, which is totally false. You know in the concentration camps, even the detention camps, prior to the death camps, Jews were deliberately starved. They were not even clothed. And during the winter, they would freeze to death.  Here we're trying to do everything that we can to make it comfortable for the children who temporarily have to be separated from their parents during the time that we interrogate the parents, to find out if they truly are the parents of these children or they might be molesters. This was deliberately done to tarnish the President who happens to be very Philo-Semitic. Adolf Hitler wrote a book called \"Mein Kampf\" where he already told the public that his intention was to eventually exterminate the Jewish race. Americans would never do this.

Anybody who ever compares with going on at our Southern border to \"Never Again\" or concentration camps, is encouraging holocaust denial. Because what they are saying is, if all of that happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany and Poland is happening in the Southern border, then there are no death camps, there were no killing squads, there was no final solution. So shame on them for being Holocaust deniers. Now as far as the current issue is concerned. Look, all three branches of government have privilege. You can't call a law clerk from the Supreme Court and ask the law clerk what did you discuss with the Justice. Imagine, if they try to call legislative assistants of Senators or Congressmen. The same Congressmen who are demanding that she speak, would be up in arms. Each branch of the government has a form of executive privilege. And the President is perfectly entitled to invoke executive privilege. If they think it goes too far. Let them take it to the courts. Let the courts decide. But the danger is that you can diminish executive privilege and legislative privilege and judicial privilege, not only for this administration, but for future administrations.

I just alluded to it. Hours ago the Department of Justice announced the arrest of a Syrian refugee in connection with an ISIS-inspired plan to carry out a terrorist attack on a Christian Church in Pittsburgh. Mustafa Mousab Alowemer, 21 years old was accused of planning to attack the Legacy International Worship Center to support the cause of ISIS and to inspire other ISIS supporters in the United States. This was the very concern that Trump, of course, used to pause this type of immigration from countries like Syria in the first place. Now here with a quick update for us, by phone, is the former Congressman for this district, Keith Rothfus. Keith, tell us what you know tonight. We don't even have a picture of the suspect yet. This is how kind of tightly held this was. But details are trickling in moment-by-moment. We're going to keep everyone updated throughout the hour. Tell us what you know Keith."

      "speaker": "KEITH ROTHFUS, FORMER PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSMAN (via telephone)",

This is exactly the kind of work that the FBI is supposed to do when you look at the controversies they've been in the last couple years. This is exactly what they should be doing, and they discovered this plot. This is a 21-year-old who came to this country from Syria in August of 2016, just five months before President Trump came in, and announced extreme vetting measure. And it's interesting, because you look at the complaint against this suspect, he says that he was arrested in Jordan three times - probably was in Jordan. So you would have think that maybe extreme vetting could have picked that up. But great work by the FBI. This guy was plotting to kill Christians. And not just Christians, he wanted to kill Yazidis and Shia Muslims, because they did not fit in his worldview."

There's been enormous amount of tragedies. And this reminds us, once again, that we have to be extremely careful, not just for fiduciary reasons or the money we spend, but because of our national security, of who we let in what country and why. We're a nation of immigrants. We love immigrants, and we love to care for true refugees. But this is ridiculous and this - thank god, this was stopped."

And I just want to remind everyone of that, and the people of Pittsburgh are sleeping a little easier tonight. But we all have to stay vigilant. And we have a lot more to get to. Mark Morgan's going to join us, we got Raymond Arroyo here tonight, a lot going on. And we have to tackle this issue as well, because it kind of dovetails into not understanding threats, not understanding history, and AOC flunking history, what can that mean?

When Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney suggested Ocasio-Cortez learn her history, MSNBC Host, Chris Hayes stepped in for some what does the Left call it \"mansplaining\". Telling Cheney, \"If you spend a few minutes learning some actual history, you will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps. And have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis\". To that the actual twitter account for the museum dedicated to Auschwitz and the memorial hit back at Hayes and recommended that he, \"Please consider following at Auschwitz Museum where every day we commemorate and educate about the tragic human history of Auschwitz\". Now one might think being called out by one of the more solemn historical museums on the planet would have stopped him in his tracks. Yet, hours later on a show, Hayes invited a guest on to play defense for him. ANDREA PITZER, AUTHOR, \"ONE LONG NIGHT: A GLOBAL HISTORY OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS\": I would say that for 40 years before Auschwitz we had concentration camps - things that were called concentration camps. What we're doing now fits very cleanly inside that tradition."

Is the United States indiscriminately rounding up just people based on color of their skin or ethnicity and sending them to these camps? No. Are we temporarily holding people who are coming over the border illegally or of their own volition? Yes, we are. Sadly, though, this is just part of a larger effort. We've documented this on the show. The President's enemies are trying to situate not just this policy, but his entire presidency somewhere near Berlin circa 1940.

Within 24 hours, just as the President announced 2020 relaunch, Democrats and their media allies are hurling attacks against this administration the conjure up some of the most horrible atrocities ever committed against humankind. So for the Left when you don't have an argument what do you do? Well, slander will always do. But invoking the Holocaust to score political points, they're really just - there are no words even for CNN there is no words. You have to be better than that.

Joining me now with reaction Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; Rabbi Ari Sparrow who's a, of course, the Spokesman for the National Conference of Jewish Affairs. Victor, during the financial crisis, the banks were labeled too big to fail. But watching the - I think the Left and the media rushed to her defense. Can the same be said for AOC?

I mean, never in the history of concentration camps has anybody crossed into territory where there was one. The 15 million - 15 million Soviet citizens POWs did not go over to German lines, because there were concentration camps. And you can diddle that with the Boers (ph), there were 30,000 parish (ph). The difference between a concentration camp and a death camp is a distinction without a difference. In fact, as horrible as Belsen and Treblinka and the Auschwitz, the death camps were, there were 15 million people in the Eastern Front - probably 10 million in China that died in so- called concentration camps. There's never been in the history of concentration camp treatment for transgendered people and counseling and for hormone therapy, as there is now in some of our detention camps. You know what, if she's really worried about the plight of the poor and the sick and the dispossessed, we have a half a million people - many of them U.S. citizens on our streets, and they're dealing with medieval refuse, needles, feces, urine. They're eating where they're defecating. There's fleas, there's lice, there's rats. And they're - most 90% of these places are under progressive leadership and governance, and she could really be activist. And finally, Laura, I have a modest proposal. There's about 12 million people in the United States that go to college dorms. They're empty now, and that's - these are progressive sanctuary cities that these universities are in. What better place than to contract out 500 or 600 detainees to empty our detention centers, put them in college dorms, maybe have access to university legal and medical schools.

She specifically used the term concentration camps so as to equate what we're doing at the Southern border to equate that with the Nazi extermination of the Jews. And why did she do that? Because she wants to demonize the President of the United States. And that's why so many in the Democrat Party have supported her, because they want the American people to believe that our good President is somehow no different - god forbid, from Adolf Hitler, and that he has Nazi aspirations for the immigrants, which is totally false. You know in the concentration camps, even the detention camps, prior to the death camps, Jews were deliberately starved. They were not even clothed. And during the winter, they would freeze to death. Here we're trying to do everything that we can to make it comfortable for the children who temporarily have to be separated from their parents during the time that we interrogate the parents, to find out if they truly are the parents of these children or they might be molesters. This was deliberately done to tarnish the President who happens to be very Philo-Semitic. Adolf Hitler wrote a book called \"Mein Kampf\" where he already told the public that his intention was to eventually exterminate the Jewish race. Americans would never do this. The President of the United States would never think of such a thing, and for Ocasio-Cortez to suggest that is malicious.

Like you said, I was there in 2014, 2016 and I'm here now. I've watched it. I was - I've been there as well as. I saw Border Patrol agents they cared for these kids as if they were their own, bringing in soccer balls to play soccer with them.

I mean there are all sorts of help people get. It's not perfect, it's not home. It's not where they ultimately want to be. But we are doing our best with a Congress who won't fund the beds for HHS.

Because I assume they don't want to release children onto the streets. This is what I don't understand or do they? Then maybe they should just say that. They just want to release some willy-nilly to whoever wants to pick them up. Or maybe they should all volunteer to take the kids into their homes and then maybe they will be better.

Anybody who ever compares with going on at our Southern border to \"Never Again\" or concentration camps, is encouraging holocaust denial. Because what they are saying is, if all of that happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany and Poland is happening in the Southern border, then there are no death camps, there were no killing squads, there was no final solution. So shame on them for being Holocaust deniers. Now as far as the current issue is concerned. Look, all three branches of government have privilege. You can't call a law clerk from the Supreme Court and ask the law clerk what did you discuss with the Justice. Imagine, if they try to call legislative assistants of Senators or Congressmen. The same Congressmen who are demanding that she speak, would be up in arms. Each branch of the government has a form of executive privilege. And the President is perfectly entitled to invoke executive privilege. If they think it goes too far. Let them take it to the courts. Let the courts decide. But the danger is that you can diminish executive privilege and legislative privilege and judicial privilege, not only for this administration, but for future administrations. And that would have a big structural impact on government and our civil liberties."

They try to get people to answer questions that are not subject appropriately to being asked. They want to impeach without the criteria for impeachment being satisfied. Congress is above the law. The President acts within Article II of the Constitution, that's not above the law. You know, Congressmen and Senators can't be prosecuted for what they say on the floor of Congress that doesn't mean they're above the law. That is the law. But there are different laws regulating Presidents, Congressman and members of the judiciary. They all have forms of immunity that doesn't put them above the law, that's what the law provides. If you don't like it, change the law."

But conversations behind closed doors with the President of the United States. I think, going back to the Clinton administration, the OLC opinion on this Sol Wisenberg tweeted this earlier tonight, is pretty clear that this kind of - this is classic executive privilege information - the classic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, first it is, number one. Number two, Presidents often invoke executive privilege in close cases and leave it to the courts. That's what our system of checks and balances is about. Congress seeks the information, the President says no. The courts decide. This system works when that happens. And I know of no President who has ever refused to accept the rulings of the court. When the court said to Nixon turn over the tapes, he did. When the courts told Clinton he had to make certain provisions, he did. And there's no evidence that Trump wouldn't do the same thing. So Congress has the right to the power to go to the courts. But they shouldn't be complaining about the invocation of privilege because they would be doing it themselves if their staff members were being called by prosecutors to testify."
