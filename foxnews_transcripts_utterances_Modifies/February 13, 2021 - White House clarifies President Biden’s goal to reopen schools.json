Oh, we take this seriously, but for more reasons than the media or the Dems think.   Isn't it weird how both groups are once again in unison, singing like cartoon canaries about the same damn thing?

It's weird to be able to bequeath your own power by voting for that power. That's like letting employees at The Lincoln Project choose their own interns. Google it.  And one of the retelling of the horrible events on January 6th, to what end is this miniseries intended? It's like watching 12 angry men over and over again until it's 48 angry men.   Legal scholar Jonathan Turley put it this way, it is more emotive than probative. It's like showing the remnants of a fire that does not materially show that the accused is guilty of the arson. What he said.   So why show the fire? Politics. Some fires are shown, others are not. Remember how the billions done in damages over the summer were ignored by the media as well as the violence. Remember how saying the word \"coup\" was considered extreme when the Dems did everything to oust Trump? Now it's all you hear about coup, coup, coup. But we know what a coup is. Does Jen?",

Well, you can't shout fire in a crowded theater, but the media and Dems can through narratives that divide and inflame a country. Here's the menu: all police are violent heathens. That narrative led to reduced law enforcement resulting in explosion in murders and felonies. All Trump supporters are stupid racist because their President is Hitler with a spray tan. Four years of labeling tens of millions of people as racist put targets on their backs. It's not shouting fire in a crowded theater. It is shouting hang them to an angry mob. An \"LA Times\" writer compared her Trump supporting neighbor to a Nazi. What did he do to deserve that? Burn a cross? Paint a swastika? No, he plowed her driveway. Yes, a good deed. And for that he was smeared as an angry nut from a neighbor who could easily qualify as an angry nut.  Meanwhile, \"Time\" Magazine online or whatever it is these days published a wrote post about Biden's election when detailing a conspiracy involving a well-funded cabal of powerful people, secretly working together to change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election. They were fortifying it. The writer called it an extraordinary shadow effort. We call it a confession. And yet to ask if the whole thing is rigged, that's treasonous. So sorry, not rigged, fortified.  So why was this shadow effort deemed heroic? Because the media and the Dems shouted fire for four years. They claimed the Trump presidency was an existential threat and was applauded and paid for it. Because not all freedoms of speech are equal, which is why they left these words out.",

We now know over 9,000 COVID patients were transferred to New York nursing homes since the pandemic started, a figure 40 percent higher than the initial stats from the State Health Department. Of course, Cuomo has refused to admit any wrongdoing. But DeRosa offered an apology not to the families, but to State Dems, saying, \"I do understand the position that you were put in. I know that is not fair. It was not our intention to put you in that political position with the Republicans.\" So welcome to the Democratic Party of New York where political fallout trumps your dead relatives.

Cops say some grifter convinced a 63-year-old woman on Instagram that he was Bruno Mars and was so in love with her he wanted to quit his tour to be with her. And also can you send me 10 grand for tour expenses. All told fake Bruno bilked her of $100,000.00. Who was this man? Yes, if you see him. Don't handle them on your own. Call the police. The F.T.C. says be wary of anyone who shows an interest in you, but refuses to meet you in person. Story of my life. And never ever send money to someone you've never met. But it seems they forget to mention the biggest scam of all happening this weekend, Valentine's Day. What a waste of paper and candy. Unless you're Sweet Tooth Tony.",

Oh, we take this seriously, but for more reasons than the media or the Dems think. Isn't it weird how both groups are once again in unison, singing like cartoon canaries about the same damn thing?

It's weird to be able to bequeath your own power by voting for that power. That's like letting employees at The Lincoln Project choose their own interns. Google it. And one of the retelling of the horrible events on January 6th, to what end is this miniseries intended? It's like watching 12 angry men over and over again until it's 48 angry men. Legal scholar Jonathan Turley put it this way, it is more emotive than probative. It's like showing the remnants of a fire that does not materially show that the accused is guilty of the arson. What he said. So why show the fire? Politics. Some fires are shown, others are not. Remember how the billions done in damages over the summer were ignored by the media as well as the violence. Remember how saying the word \"coup\" was considered extreme when the Dems did everything to oust Trump? Now it's all you hear about coup, coup, coup. But we know what a coup is. Does Jen?"

All Trump supporters are stupid racist because their President is Hitler with a spray tan. Four years of labeling tens of millions of people as racist put targets on their backs. It's not shouting fire in a crowded theater. It is shouting hang them to an angry mob. An \"LA Times\" writer compared her Trump supporting neighbor to a Nazi. What did he do to deserve that? Burn a cross? Paint a swastika? No, he plowed her driveway. Yes, a good deed. And for that he was smeared as an angry nut from a neighbor who could easily qualify as an angry nut. Meanwhile, \"Time\" Magazine online or whatever it is these days published a wrote post about Biden's election when detailing a conspiracy involving a well-funded cabal of powerful people, secretly working together to change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election. They were fortifying it. The writer called it an extraordinary shadow effort. We call it a confession. And yet to ask if the whole thing is rigged, that's treasonous. So sorry, not rigged, fortified. So why was this shadow effort deemed heroic? Because the media and the Dems shouted fire for four years. They claimed the Trump presidency was an existential threat and was applauded and paid for it. Because not all freedoms of speech are equal, which is why they left these words out."

You know, and then your arrogance is that if you let's say on a good day, you're a four and a half. But for some reason, a 12 with one post and eight pitchers, is telling you that they want to see you but their phone is broken. Is this broken?"

Last week in Michigan, an actual state, Dagen, one guy died from an exploding cannon use for a gender reveal at a baby shower. It is why I avoid baby showers. The bigger question of course is why are gender reveal parties even a thing? The woman who invented them says she now regrets it about as much as this lady regrets feeding that ostrich."

When you lose an argument horribly they go, ha-ha, mom was right. They -- kids are horrible. They're horrible. They love -- when you're in pain, they enjoy it. They laugh at -- they are evil.

I just shot it off with blue confetti so I can celebrate you and you're going to -- and you're not going to go to college. So he'll have that going for him, but that's a typical father thing. It was not our idea. We've got to put it together. It falls apart. It's our fault. Kids laugh at us. And then your wife gets on Facebook and plays the video to everyone and says, this is so great. But then she gets mad at you if you post a picture of them and she didn't put the filter on yet. Life is that."

I watch videos on YouTube of like people skateboarding and falling on a railing and I laugh when I read not even watch the video, but read \"The New York Post\" article about the video before I ever watched it. \"Ill-advisedly flips around the cannon causing it to blast blue confetti directly into his groin.\" The end of that video by the way, the daughter starts crying when she finds out it's a boy because that's what men do. They're so dumb, they blast confetti into their crotch."

You don't know if that kid's going to grow up to be someone who you know ends e-mails with \"ciao.\" You have no idea."
