I want to emphasize that, the president said several times this is about the quality of the deal, there's no timetable, there's no rush. He is comfortable where he is in any case. But I think coming back, we will resume the talks, the two teams will be getting together, tariffs will not be raised. There's no lifting of tariffs on the remaining $325 billion, that's an important concession by President Trump.  And we also expect the Chinese -- while the talks are going, we expect the Chinese to begin large-scale purchases, imports of the U.S. agriculture products and services. So, new talks, resume talks, no new tariffs and agriculture purchases, and the rest of it is going to go on for quite some time, frankly.",

Look, it's very important I know from the American side, the relationship with China has to be rebalanced. It has been very unbalanced in recent years. As you know, we have had tremendous problems with intellectual property theft, force transfers of technology, tariffs, nontariff barriers, various cyber hacking going on and other issues, OK? Those have to be remedied. I mean, that's a very important point of these talks, however long that may take, it is impossible to predict, but we would prefer to go back.

The president's announcement that these meetings in Osaka, he was very clear to say that American companies can supply Huawei with various products and services provided that there is no national security issues or problems. So, the Commerce Department as you may know already offered a number of general service licenses for some sales to Huawei. On the other hand, I think Commerce will probably go back after the president's decision and take another look at that, maybe open it up. You know, there's a lot of technology services, telecom-related services that really you can find on general markets and we don't think have any national security implications. So, I think there's a good chance the Commerce Department, Secretary Ross, will open the door on that and greatly licenses.",

But having said that, I think all this kind of happens is the Commerce Department will grant some temporary additional licenses where there was a general availability. I mean, for example, some of the chips, the chipmakers in the United States are selling products that are frankly widely available from other countries and we don't think there's any national security. So, we will look at this carefully. We will undoubtedly -- I think the president will be meeting with senators and others, our own principles are going to be meeting to take a look at this.

I think that is the banner headline from this and I think everybody's going to be pleased at that. There's no promises. There's no deal made. There's no timetable. I want to emphasize that, the president said several times this is about the quality of the deal, there's no timetable, there's no rush. He is comfortable where he is in any case. But I think coming back, we will resume the talks, the two teams will be getting together, tariffs will not be raised. There's no lifting of tariffs on the remaining $325 billion, that's an important concession by President Trump. And we also expect the Chinese -- while the talks are going, we expect the Chinese to begin large-scale purchases, imports of the U.S. agriculture products and services. So, new talks, resume talks, no new tariffs and agriculture purchases, and the rest of it is going to go on for quite some time, frankly."

I also want to ask you, you had said that the two nations were 90 percent of the way to a deal before the talks broke down. Have they agreed to keep the commitments they'd already made, or are we starting from scratch?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, the president himself mentioned a couple of times in his press conference and elsewhere that he would like to go back to where we left off in early May, whenever it was and yes, that 90 percent number is fair, although the last 10 percent could be the toughest and there's no guarantees that the deal will go through. Look, it's very important I know from the American side, the relationship with China has to be rebalanced. It has been very unbalanced in recent years. As you know, we have had tremendous problems with intellectual property theft, force transfers of technology, tariffs, nontariff barriers, various cyber hacking going on and other issues, OK? Those have to be remedied. I mean, that's a very important point of these talks, however long that may take, it is impossible to predict, but we would prefer to go back. I don't know what the Chinese side is going to say and we won't know until Ambassador Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin and so forth get back together with their Chinese counterparts."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, that very well may be. Now, let's be quite careful here. The president's announcement that these meetings in Osaka, he was very clear to say that American companies can supply Huawei with various products and services provided that there is no national security issues or problems. So, the Commerce Department as you may know already offered a number of general service licenses for some sales to Huawei. On the other hand, I think Commerce will probably go back after the president's decision and take another look at that, maybe open it up. You know, there's a lot of technology services, telecom-related services that really you can find on general markets and we don't think have any national security implications. So, I think there's a good chance the Commerce Department, Secretary Ross, will open the door on that and greatly licenses."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, I appreciate that and, by the way, I appreciate their national security concerns, and the president shares that point of view. This is not a general amnesty, if you will. Huawei will remain on the so- called entity list where they are serious export controls and any national security inferences or suggestions, there won't be any licenses. But having said that, I think all this kind of happens is the Commerce Department will grant some temporary additional licenses where there was a general availability. I mean, for example, some of the chips, the chipmakers in the United States are selling products that are frankly widely available from other countries and we don't think there's any national security. So, we will look at this carefully. We will undoubtedly -- I think the president will be meeting with senators and others, our own principles are going to be meeting to take a look at this. So, this is not general amnesty. They will remain on the so-called entity list and national security concerns will remain paramount."

On this business about bad distribution, the blue-collar workers, the nonsupervisory workers have done the best. They're the ones running wages at 3-1/2 percent. Their growth and incomes and wages is exceeding the growth of their supervisors. The unemployment rate is low. We just had the best June stock market, the Dow Jones, in over 80 years.

This becomes -- we'll be sitting at this table saying this is the masterstroke in the Trump doctrine. But waking up this morning, this is the biggest risk of his administration. It's the biggest possible overture he could make to the North Korean dictator. I hate to disappoint me with this answer but it is just too early to say.

Larry Kudlow made it clear that they don't know what's going to happen and how long it's going to take. But the question I do have for you is we do know the president has agreed to at least partially lift his band and that American companies sell some products to Chinese telecom Huawei.

Of course, selling information or selling services into, but you have to go through the Commerce Department in order to get that license as long as it's not national security, that's going to alleviate some concerns, but the president gave up a lot and doing that but I think overall, the market will appreciate what's going on here, and I do think the president is moving in the right direction. It's a great look between the combination of North Korea and the progress with China because if you're ultimately going to get a deal, in North Korea, it's also going to have to involve the Chinese.

But when you snicker with Putin about a free press and about a free election, I think you are -- I think it's damaging. I think it's a sad reminder of how Russia is once again poised to interfere in the 2020 election and not seeing any consequence in terms of a leader standing up and saying this is unacceptable. I think it's damaging to excuse behavior that's contradictory to American values. Putin this week said, you know, Democratic values are obsolete, outdated. And we don't have anybody to say, hey, you know what, we believe that elections and democracy are valuable. It's why America is a shining beacon to the world. Instead, he acts as if autocratic behavior -- I mean, Putin is a guy that kills his political opponent and we are sitting there playing footsie with him. To me, it's outrageous. It's definitely damaging."

It establish this so-called zero-tolerance. And the problem with this president is all is he wants to do is look tough. He doesn't want to be effective. This zero-tolerance policy, which sounds tough, had absolutely cataclysmic impact. That resulted in children being put in cages. If you had exercise the discretion properly, as prior presidents have done, this wouldn't happen. And so the reason we're having this discussion, 57 percent of all federal cases, criminal cases that have been filed in the last two years, have been for entering the country illegally. I welcome a discussion about priorities. That's what Democrats want to have. We believe that we can be a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We believe that we can provide effective due process to people. We believe the reason why this is happening is because in Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador, the countries are falling apart. The people coming to the border now are families with children. The warped priorities of this administration --"

I saw a handful -- a couple of hands full of candidates who really should be on that stage and the field is going to winnow out.

A lot of folks, my guess is, who didn't know Biden's record now do you know it. To what degree do you think that's going to hurt his standing in the black community?"

And so much of it is that he's running for president really almost as an extension of the fact that he was the first black president vice president. And so suddenly that puts a dent in that -- that particular appeal. And, remember, so much of Joe Biden's support right now in the polls, which has him, you know, still at 30 percent compared to -- I think it's more than 10 percent higher than Bernie Sanders, is based on black support and going into South Carolina, where you have a large black electorate in the Democratic Party side. Very important. But I will say this also, I think that it's so important that John Lewis, a civil rights icon, Jim Clyburn, the senior black person now in Congress, both said, making deals with segregation's was necessary to gradual civil rights advancement in that time. And it's not fair to necessarily go back and say, oh, no, we have a Black Lives Matter standard. Anybody playing around with racist is an unacceptable person. Older black leader in the country don't take that position, Chris."

He had a great time in North Korea and at the -- at the summit. The economy is doing well. They can try to throw out all the stats you want, but Larry Kudlow is going to come back with other stats.
