You know that because the school board ends up lying about whether or not someone was raped and sexually assaulted in a bathroom that all the parents are absolutely against the Democrats here. So the issue right now is whether or not this race presents an opportunity for parents, from both sides of the aisle, to come together to unify in a way that we haven't seen in this country in years. And this is a good thing about the race. I think that McAuliffe is over the top. He certainly has an advantage from the early voters. And Youngkin has to make sure that he gets a lot of voters out today.  But the bigger issue I think is the fact that McAuliffe has already made a decision that he is with the unions. He needs the unions to help him. That's why he's got Randi Weingarten out there. That's why he just promised he's going to give the teachers more money. I mean, that's the Democrat way.   And at the end of the way, if Youngkin wins, it's about the fact that people now are beyond party, beyond politics. It's about American coming together and hopefully it will be a model for going forward.",

The polling has been tight. We had a big poll that Fox News released showing that Youngkin had gained some points there at the end. But McAuliffe had held an early lead before that. So, we're going to have to wait and see. I'd say the third thing, I was surprised by Glenn Youngkin's closing. I thought his close would be more we're going to take the commonwealth to a new place, we're going to create more jobs, create more (inaudible). Here's a guy that comes from business. And to the way he injected race at the end -- look, it may work for him, but I was expecting something more from him there at the end.  Terry ended on his note saying, look, we're going to do -- we're going to make education even better. I'm going to pay teachers more.

And everything that he has done since then and now you know he meant it because he never learned from it. He told Chuck Todd two days ago that everyone clapped when he said that. He then -- he then said Virginia schools need to get rid of white teachers. Too many white teachers. Not bad lousy incompetent teachers, but white teachers. So you talk and injecting race into this? McAuliffe's on it. He, last week, said teachers are the true heroes of the COVID crisis. Well, that's smooching the rump of the unions. Not the moms who had to quit their jobs and give up their careers to sit at home and have their children educated on Zoom by said lousy teachers.   Then Randi Weingarten showed up at the McAuliffe rally, the wicked witch of unnecessary school closings. President Obama came to the state and then told dismissed belittled parents and told them that they're imagining what they're upset about in the schools.  So, this is all -- just sends the clear message to parents. He has proved over and over again that he does not care about what the voters care about in that state.

That's basically what the parents are. They may not -- they may not pull it off this time, but I think the Democrats and the media got caught by surprise by the real things that matter to American parents, right? You have for four years an outraged media, an outraged Democratic Party over Trump's personality, his tweets. The effects on their emotional state mattered more than dead bodies, right? Meanwhile, the real issues kind of slipped right by them. COVID mandates, CRT, crime. So while the media and the Democrats were focused on micro- aggressions, parents were experiencing macro-aggressions, you know, through the education. Politics is a tug of war, as you know, between the people who go too far and the people that don't go far enough.   Right now, it's the leftists that are realizing how far they've gone and they need -- somebody needs to pull them back in and you see that how that they have turned, you know, the police into defunding and demoralizing the police and now you have the CRT stuff and, you know, being white at birth is bad.

But I tell you, if we sit here tomorrow and you invite me back at some point, and the New Jersey race goes Democrat, the Virginia race goes Democrat. You get Eric Adams as mayor here in New York, which is likely to happen and he really ushers in a public safety platform and changes the construct and direction of the city and they pass something in the House and the Senate even next week or so, the numbers will probably go back up.  But I don't quarrel with you, but as you and I both know, you don't give all the credit to this, but the S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all closed at records today. The Dow closed above 36,000.

Democrats obviously want their agenda enacted and so far Joe Biden has not really been effective at enacting their agenda. And then lastly, Democrats want to be inspired. That's why Democrats usually vote for the guy that sends the thrill down their leg. You know, Bubba or Barack. Is Joe Biden inspiring Democrats? No. He can barely make it through a speech that's in a teleprompter. So, he's boring, he's ineffective, and he's threatening their hold on power.

That's the future, whether it's two years, five years, or ten years. I do think there is hypocrisy. There's hypocrisy on both sides. But I do think if you're going to preach as some of my party members do about how we got to abandon this platform, you have to tell America and tell the world how we're going to do it and how this transition will be. I think it was right to kill the pipeline. I would not have done it. I don't think you should build more pipelines going forward. But one of the great things that happened over the last 20 years is we became energy independent as a nation. We produce more --",

These were deals cut to bring these 13 colonies together. It was going to sunset and it never sunset after 1820. But then you see the struggle to get it right. But in the north, I was struck by how there was only one percent of the African American population was actually in the north. It was an issue they weren't dealing with on a regular basis. And when it became front and center is the Fugitive Slave Act and things were happening in our country. And then with the acquisition of Texas, and Missouri -- Kansas-Missouri Compromise, these things started coming together, forcing this issue front and center.

Virginia has emerged as ground zero in the fight over critical race theory and who should be in control over what is taught in the classroom.

You know that because the school board ends up lying about whether or not someone was raped and sexually assaulted in a bathroom that all the parents are absolutely against the Democrats here. So the issue right now is whether or not this race presents an opportunity for parents, from both sides of the aisle, to come together to unify in a way that we haven't seen in this country in years. And this is a good thing about the race. I think that McAuliffe is over the top. He certainly has an advantage from the early voters. And Youngkin has to make sure that he gets a lot of voters out today. But the bigger issue I think is the fact that McAuliffe has already made a decision that he is with the unions. He needs the unions to help him. That's why he's got Randi Weingarten out there. That's why he just promised he's going to give the teachers more money. I mean, that's the Democrat way. And at the end of the way, if Youngkin wins, it's about the fact that people now are beyond party, beyond politics. It's about American coming together and hopefully it will be a model for going forward."

The polling has been tight. We had a big poll that Fox News released showing that Youngkin had gained some points there at the end. But McAuliffe had held an early lead before that. So, we're going to have to wait and see. I'd say the third thing, I was surprised by Glenn Youngkin's closing. I thought his close would be more we're going to take the commonwealth to a new place, we're going to create more jobs, create more (inaudible). Here's a guy that comes from business. And to the way he injected race at the end -- look, it may work for him, but I was expecting something more from him there at the end. Terry ended on his note saying, look, we're going to do -- we're going to make education even better. I'm going to pay teachers more.

When Terry McAuliffe said I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach, he meant it. And everything that he has done since then and now you know he meant it because he never learned from it. He told Chuck Todd two days ago that everyone clapped when he said that. He then -- he then said Virginia schools need to get rid of white teachers. Too many white teachers. Not bad lousy incompetent teachers, but white teachers. So you talk and injecting race into this? McAuliffe's on it. He, last week, said teachers are the true heroes of the COVID crisis. Well, that's smooching the rump of the unions. Not the moms who had to quit their jobs and give up their careers to sit at home and have their children educated on Zoom by said lousy teachers. Then Randi Weingarten showed up at the McAuliffe rally, the wicked witch of unnecessary school closings. President Obama came to the state and then told dismissed belittled parents and told them that they're imagining what they're upset about in the schools. So, this is all -- just sends the clear message to parents. He has proved over and over again that he does not care about what the voters care about in that state. We'll see how many people woke up to his nonsense."

That's basically what the parents are. They may not -- they may not pull it off this time, but I think the Democrats and the media got caught by surprise by the real things that matter to American parents, right? You have for four years an outraged media, an outraged Democratic Party over Trump's personality, his tweets. The effects on their emotional state mattered more than dead bodies, right? Meanwhile, the real issues kind of slipped right by them. COVID mandates, CRT, crime. So while the media and the Democrats were focused on micro- aggressions, parents were experiencing macro-aggressions, you know, through the education. Politics is a tug of war, as you know, between the people who go too far and the people that don't go far enough. Right now, it's the leftists that are realizing how far they've gone and they need -- somebody needs to pull them back in and you see that how that they have turned, you know, the police into defunding and demoralizing the police and now you have the CRT stuff and, you know, being white at birth is bad. SO they're the one that have gone too far. It's now time for the Republicans to pull that back in and this might be a sign for that.

Democrats kind of lose their sense of humor about things. They're very reactive people. I'm one of them. They are frustrated right now with the fact that he can't seem to referee and reconcile differences between the moderates and progressives so, they're expressing themselves. But I tell you, if we sit here tomorrow and you invite me back at some point, and the New Jersey race goes Democrat, the Virginia race goes Democrat. You get Eric Adams as mayor here in New York, which is likely to happen and he really ushers in a public safety platform and changes the construct and direction of the city and they pass something in the House and the Senate even next week or so, the numbers will probably go back up. But I don't quarrel with you, but as you and I both know, you don't give all the credit to this, but the S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all closed at records today. The Dow closed above 36,000. You get on me a little bit, but I'm a capitalist Democrat and I think those things are important for the country to be able to grow and it's important even for this president. If you're a Republican president, I'd be celebrating these numbers, reason I think we ought to give him credit for being at least a part of the story."

So this is actually, I think for the Democrats, this is part of the plan, right? They never said we love Joe and we're going to stick with them till 2024. They just wanted him to get into the door and then replace him when he falls apart which could be in a year, it could be less than a year.

They don't think Joe Biden can win re-election and they think his presidency so far is costing them power in the House. Democrats obviously want their agenda enacted and so far Joe Biden has not really been effective at enacting their agenda. And then lastly, Democrats want to be inspired. That's why Democrats usually vote for the guy that sends the thrill down their leg. You know, Bubba or Barack. Is Joe Biden inspiring Democrats? No. He can barely make it through a speech that's in a teleprompter. So, he's boring, he's ineffective, and he's threatening their hold on power.

And Lincoln is taking his time, and he's saying this guy ran on false premises. He's going to free the slaves and make the south give up the slaves. Instead, Lincoln rose out and says, you guys, just come back. Seven states had left the union, come back. Keep the slaves. I'll even put it in the Constitution. Frederick Douglass is incensed. They think that they'll never going to get together. But when they finally meet, when the country comes together, when it's finally ready to emancipate the slaves and fight for the right reasons, that's when Lincoln makes his move. And when they actually meet, you see that this great friendship was there and how they just making eye contact. Lincoln's response to Douglass is chronicled in his biography. I found that. It sent shivers up my spine."

But to see the gains we have made. You see the struggles. Even in the introduction, I have quotes from Washington, Jefferson -- Washington, Jefferson, and Madison talked about how evil it was, but they couldn't get out of it. These were deals cut to bring these 13 colonies together. It was going to sunset and it never sunset after 1820. But then you see the struggle to get it right. But in the north, I was struck by how there was only one percent of the African American population was actually in the north. It was an issue they weren't dealing with on a regular basis. And when it became front and center is the Fugitive Slave Act and things were happening in our country. And then with the acquisition of Texas, and Missouri -- Kansas-Missouri Compromise, these things started coming together, forcing this issue front and center. And I think that if people understand what we went through and who died to fix our country and make it better, I think they'd have much more appreciation of the gains we made. Final point. Frederick Douglass is convinced that kids do not see black and white. And he writes about it because his best friends when he was growing up were white. They didn't know the difference between black and white. That's why CRT matters. Don't tell a second grader the color of their skin and that they were oppressors."

What you have done is added to the canon of knowledge in the body of work. Bret has done with the book on Grant revealing things and unearthing things, and you have too. The question was asked at the outset, how did you do it? What made you do it? You said, look, I studied, researched, I found things. I started with quotes, and I wanted to substantiate. I applaud you for this because you learned during this and we're going to learn from it as well. I think whenever anyone tries to not rewrite history, but to give us more history, if they do it from -- if they're motivated by trying to make the body, the canon better, that's a positive thing. There are going to be people who don't like the book, people are going to challenge you. People are going to say, well, I don't know why he's done this. I think is great you've done it. I hope we have more books around. It's because I don't think -- I think every American should know that relationship between those two.
