In moments, the attorney who spearheaded that lawsuit, he will join us live. He calls tomorrow a, quote-unquote, \"perfect storm\" of over-the-top disease transmission. The President, for his part, took to Twitter a short time ago to build momentum ahead of the rally and take a jab at Joe Biden, comparing tomorrow's rally with an expected 19,000 inside, tens of thousands more in the outside to Biden's latest foray outside the basement, which as you can see is not exactly packed. Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry in for Martha MacCallum, and this is The Story. So with about 100,000 people, in all, expected to convene on Tulsa tomorrow to both attend the rally and protest against it, today the country saw some other mass gatherings in the form of Juneteenth rallies and marches all across America.  The White House calling today a celebration of our nation's ability to triumph over darkness. While Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters they need some internal consistency in the way they cover large crowds.   But let's begin on the ground in Tulsa with Correspondent Casey Stegall.   Casey, good evening.",

Yes, we're about 24 hours or so until everything gets underway, and there has been a lot going on right here in downtown Tulsa, all around the box center where this is going to be happening. Right here, these giant barricades have gone up to close off a lot of streets. They're trying to seal off a big perimeter. And if you keep following me over this way, look at that Arby's restaurant there, it is all boarded up. A number of businesses and shops have decided to do that, not taking any chances in the event that there could be unrest here tonight - hopefully, that is not the case - or unrest tomorrow. But the city says that it does expect about 100,000 people to descend on this very area.  Trump supporters and counter-protesters, people celebrating Juneteenth. The curfew that the city had implemented has since been rescinded, but multiple local and federal law enforcement groups are on the ground, including the National Guard. Everyone telling us that safety is the number one priority.   From the outer perimeter, there'll only be a few ways to get in, so you can get into the event.  Meantime, health concerns here as well, as Oklahoma and Tulsa have seen recent record spikes in new COVID cases. The venues manager had asked the Trump campaign for a health plan. Masks and hand sanitizers are going to be given outgoing - for anyone going inside the BOK Center. Trump's team also says that each person will have their temperature checked upon entry.  And then earlier today, Ed, as you know, the Oklahoma Supreme Court striking down a measure. It was a lawsuit that was filed on behalf of some of the residents and businesses here trying to get this thing at least postponed or canceled altogether. The Supreme Court striking that down tonight. Back to you.",

What really concerns me most about what this lawsuit has surfaced and what's going on in our country today is that there is a lack of love and tolerance for people whose views we don't agree with. Let me give you an example. If I were to say that I'm grateful for President Trump for passing the criminal justice reform that he did, and all practitioners like me in the criminal justice system should be appreciative of the significant legislation, if I were to say that, which I just did, people on the far-left would maybe call me a racist or a Trump- lover. And if were to say that I think it's a good idea not to have this rally right now because of the pandemic concerns, people on the far-right are going to call me and have called me anti-American and I should go to hell.  I'm neither. Both of those things - being a racist and being anti-American are so far, far away from my heart. And let me give you a more personal example.

And this is part block party, part celebration, part protest, all happening here at the center of what is the Juneteenth celebration here in Washington, D.C. In fact, this is the yellow paint on the street that makes up black lives matter, the gigantic mural that's painted on the street here in !6th Street in Washington, D.C., that the mayor of D.C. authorized be put on. And again, you know, you said it, this is also the center of the protests. If you look here, this is 16th Street, we are just north of Lafayette Park which is just north of the White House. And so, the mood here has changed considerably in just the past week. There's events and celebrations and protests going on throughout Washington, D.C., today. Many of them have ended up winding through here but what you get is a, is a number of different celebrations that, you know, whether they be vigils for George Floyd in a number of different churches throughout the city, whether they be a go-go truck that's been driving around the city. A protest that's also been looking more to defund the police and to redirect a lot of money to social services. So, there's been a number of dish and different issues and protests and celebrations going on throughout D.C. here today. Now if you look, this is a pretty familiar spot, this is where just a few weeks ago, is the center of protest in Washington, D.C., this is where a number of different businesses, St. John's Church here to the left received a lot of damage. Over the last few weeks, you've had businesses and buildings that have all been boarded up, just the famous Hay-Adams Hotel, that's still boarded up. But over the last few weeks you've had a number of these businesses and a lot of these buildings begin to shed the plywood that they've had in front of them, you've had a number of these businesses they've removed the graffiti and slowly get back to life. This street itself, where it had been the center of very passionate protests and violence ongoing it turned more into a day long, a weeks' long celebration and protests ongoing throughout here. So, the vibe here has changed. You can walk through here through pretty much any time a day, people hanging out here, they're selling different black lives matter merchandise, they're writing notes and political messages all throughout here. You had celebration, you had music, people with different messages, different vibes ongoing here. And that's really what this area of Washington, D.C., in this area of the country has become, this sort of living protest but something that has a much more relaxed mood to it than we saw about a month ago. And any time of day you come here this is really the vibe that you got here. They've closed down 8th Street which is what we are crossing right now. Throughout the day, any time of day you come here the street is closed to traffic. And then you've got Lafayette Park and the White House which is right behind it. So that's really what's going on, Ed, for Washington, D.C., Juneteenth celebrations. There are different neighborhoods throughout Washington that are having their own individual celebrations and this is really the center of it with things evolving as the day goes on. So, Juneteenth in D.C., Ed. Back to you.",

In moments, the attorney who spearheaded that lawsuit, he will join us live. He calls tomorrow a, quote-unquote, \"perfect storm\" of over-the-top disease transmission. The President, for his part, took to Twitter a short time ago to build momentum ahead of the rally and take a jab at Joe Biden, comparing tomorrow's rally with an expected 19,000 inside, tens of thousands more in the outside to Biden's latest foray outside the basement, which as you can see is not exactly packed. Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry in for Martha MacCallum, and this is The Story. So with about 100,000 people, in all, expected to convene on Tulsa tomorrow to both attend the rally and protest against it, today the country saw some other mass gatherings in the form of Juneteenth rallies and marches all across America.

Right here, these giant barricades have gone up to close off a lot of streets. They're trying to seal off a big perimeter. And if you keep following me over this way, look at that Arby's restaurant there, it is all boarded up. A number of businesses and shops have decided to do that, not taking any chances in the event that there could be unrest here tonight - hopefully, that is not the case - or unrest tomorrow. But the city says that it does expect about 100,000 people to descend on this very area. Trump supporters and counter-protesters, people celebrating Juneteenth. The curfew that the city had implemented has since been rescinded, but multiple local and federal law enforcement groups are on the ground, including the National Guard. Everyone telling us that safety is the number one priority. From the outer perimeter, there'll only be a few ways to get in, so you can get into the event. Meantime, health concerns here as well, as Oklahoma and Tulsa have seen recent record spikes in new COVID cases. The venues manager had asked the Trump campaign for a health plan. Masks and hand sanitizers are going to be given outgoing - for anyone going inside the BOK Center. Trump's team also says that each person will have their temperature checked upon entry. And then earlier today, Ed, as you know, the Oklahoma Supreme Court striking down a measure.

Let me give you an example. If I were to say that I'm grateful for President Trump for passing the criminal justice reform that he did, and all practitioners like me in the criminal justice system should be appreciative of the significant legislation, if I were to say that, which I just did, people on the far-left would maybe call me a racist or a Trump- lover. And if were to say that I think it's a good idea not to have this rally right now because of the pandemic concerns, people on the far-right are going to call me and have called me anti-American and I should go to hell.

It's one of the news organizations. I'm sure you can find others. And they had all kinds of photos of protests in your city of Tulsa after George Floyd's death.

No one is forcing anyone to go to these rallies. The Trump campaign has gone above and beyond to make sure that they do this responsibly. At Turning Point Action in Phoenix, Arizona, we're actually hosting the President of the United States, President Trump, at an event to address young people. And I could tell you that there's huge enthusiasm to hear from the President. But America has been locked down for almost 100 days, different variations of lockdowns. And I think that now we know more about the virus than we did even a month ago. I think that informed citizens should be able to make decisions to be able to go see the President of the United States. And you can see the campaign. They've gone above and beyond. They're doing so responsibly. And I think that now that we're in this election season--"

A million people want to see President Trump. Guess what? 10, 20, 30 million people probably want to go see Beyonce, but she's not having a concert right now because it's irresponsible. The fact that the Trump campaign isn't mandating that people wear masks, when you see that astonishing number, that 80 percent, including a large majority of Republicans, are in favor of that protocol, shows how reckless this administration is being with this. Tulsa has seen almost a 60 percent spike in COVID cases. This is not the time to do it. Also, the President is going to win Oklahoma."

For the last couple of weeks, a lot of people express their First Amendment rights in Brooklyn, New York and Philadelphia.

Let's get back to Republican Senator James Lankford from Oklahoma. As I mentioned, there are some storms there. I think it knocked out your audio. Senator, thank you for your patience. You heard that debate there. You heard me with the lawyer at the top who filed this suit. I think part of what people are frustrated about is what they see as a double-standard. With the protests, the media and others were not calling people out quite as much and demanding masks and social distancing and the rest."

      "speaker": "LANKFORD",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think that's part of the issue that they're focusing on, but quite frankly, that's on the conservative side they're focused on the double-standard. On the left-wing side of all the media, they are focused on doing whatever they can to distract from policy issues, from the economy starting to bounce back, to distract from the fact that Joe Biden is still in his basement while the President is drawing a million people trying to line up. This is distract, distract, distract. Everyone gets the whole issue about COVID-19 and how important it is to be able to watch your own health and to be as responsible as you can. But everyone is losing track. In Oklahoma, we've been through all three phases already. Our restaurants, our retail is open. We're done on all those three phases on it. Now we're trying to be able to manage this as we go forward."

It was more just about the campaign itself and sort of restarting it. He basically said, the campaign hasn't even started for me, it starts Saturday. Given some of the tough poll numbers for him, given the fact that we've got 40 million people unemployed, maybe some people say it's not his fault, because of COVID, maybe others will hold him accountable, he's going to find that out from the voters. But do you think that tomorrow night is bigger picture, more about restarting this campaign?"

      "speaker": "LANKFORD",
      "utterance": "I do, actually. And I think this is reframing where we are and where we've been while we just walk through as a country. I literally think there'll be people all around the world that will pause to be able to watch this speech from the President. This is his moment on the world stage and certainly on the national stage to be able to talk about race relations obviously in this city, in this community, on this weekend. This is his moment to be able to talk about the economy, about trade, about what's happening with China, about what we're going to do for the future. So it's a big deal and it's a big speech, but it recaptures again the nation's attention to say, this November, we're going to decide as a country in which direction we're going to go. And so it's a good anchor moment for the President to be able to launch this, and the whole world is watching."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "I've got about 30 seconds. But something else happened this week, which is that the President's team came out and said they want more than the traditional three presidential debates. They want four, maybe even more. And we're already seeing resistance from the Biden campaign. Do you think that's beyond restarting the rallies, the President wants to get out there mano a mano and have a more direct battle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANKFORD",
      "utterance": "I do. I think the President wants to get out there in a conversation side-by-side with Joe Biden, where he doesn't have a script, where he doesn't have a teleprompter, and he has to be able to recall those things and to be able to talk about things on his feet. I think the President longs for that kind of moment to be able to have a side-by-side, allow the American people to choose with no teleprompters, no script, no structured audience on it, actually having to make their case."

I guess she feels one way but we totally disagree with her."

What we're seeing play out in the cities across the country culminating after weeks of protest and outcry over the death of George Floyd. Of course, he was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis 25 days ago. Rich Edson is standing by in Washington. But first, let's get to correspondent Matt Finn, he's live in Chicago where there are celebrations, marchers, and rallies all across the city. Matt, good evening."

      "utterance": "Good evening, Ed. And the governor here declared today as Juneteenth day in Illinois and also says he's going now going to work with state lawmakers to officially mark Juneteenth as a state holiday here in Illinois. And there were many celebrations and marches here in the city of Chicago for Juneteenth. Governor Pritzker and Senator Dick Durbin led a faith-based march in the heart of the city, lots of prayers and music. Two very large Juneteenth marches today, had fans and dancing, they were joyous and celebratory. There were also some anti-police sentiment and defund the police signs. And several Chicago-based corporations also tell us they gave thousands of employees the day off today including Grubhub, Lyft, and Kraft Heinz. And back live, we also want to briefly show you some of the businesses that are still recovering from the recent riots and looting. The city of Chicago is allowing takeout and outdoor dining, but some businesses really don't have that option as their storefronts are still boarded up. So, you can only imagine the hit these businesses continue to take from the pandemic and the recent riots and looting. Ed?"

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "They've been dealing with a lot. Matt Finn, thank you. Juneteenth demonstrations also underway in our nation's capital as we noted. Our correspondent Rich Edson live near Lafayette Park. Obviously, there was a lot of action there just a couple of weeks ago. Rich, good evening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, good evening, Ed. And this is part block party, part celebration, part protest, all happening here at the center of what is the Juneteenth celebration here in Washington, D.C. In fact, this is the yellow paint on the street that makes up black lives matter, the gigantic mural that's painted on the street here in !6th Street in Washington, D.C., that the mayor of D.C. authorized be put on. And again, you know, you said it, this is also the center of the protests. If you look here, this is 16th Street, we are just north of Lafayette Park which is just north of the White House. And so, the mood here has changed considerably in just the past week. There's events and celebrations and protests going on throughout Washington, D.C., today. Many of them have ended up winding through here but what you get is a, is a number of different celebrations that, you know, whether they be vigils for George Floyd in a number of different churches throughout the city, whether they be a go-go truck that's been driving around the city. A protest that's also been looking more to defund the police and to redirect a lot of money to social services. So, there's been a number of dish and different issues and protests and celebrations going on throughout D.C. here today. Now if you look, this is a pretty familiar spot, this is where just a few weeks ago, is the center of protest in Washington, D.C., this is where a number of different businesses, St. John's Church here to the left received a lot of damage. Over the last few weeks, you've had businesses and buildings that have all been boarded up, just the famous Hay-Adams Hotel, that's still boarded up. But over the last few weeks you've had a number of these businesses and a lot of these buildings begin to shed the plywood that they've had in front of them, you've had a number of these businesses they've removed the graffiti and slowly get back to life. This street itself, where it had been the center of very passionate protests and violence ongoing it turned more into a day long, a weeks' long celebration and protests ongoing throughout here. So, the vibe here has changed. You can walk through here through pretty much any time a day, people hanging out here, they're selling different black lives matter merchandise, they're writing notes and political messages all throughout here. You had celebration, you had music, people with different messages, different vibes ongoing here. And that's really what this area of Washington, D.C., in this area of the country has become, this sort of living protest but something that has a much more relaxed mood to it than we saw about a month ago. And any time of day you come here this is really the vibe that you got here. They've closed down 8th Street which is what we are crossing right now. Throughout the day, any time of day you come here the street is closed to traffic. And then you've got Lafayette Park and the White House which is right behind it. So that's really what's going on, Ed, for Washington, D.C., Juneteenth celebrations. There are different neighborhoods throughout Washington that are having their own individual celebrations and this is really the center of it with things evolving as the day goes on. So, Juneteenth in D.C., Ed. Back to you."

They're walking across the Brooklyn Bridge chanting Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. This day 155 years after the last slaves were freed in America. gaining more attention of course than ever in the wake of the black lives matter protest that's been sweeping the nation along with heightened awareness and massive rallies all across America. Companies across the U.S. are now honoring Juneteenth as an annual holiday. Here now with more insights is Jack Brewer. He is CEO and executive producer of the Brewer Group, a former NFL player for the Minnesota Vikings. Jack, welcome, and happy Juneteenth."

You know, all my life we celebrated Juneteenth and, you know, usually when I talk to African- Americans across the country a lot of people don't even understand or didn't before now understand the significance of this day. You know, my great-grandfather was a sharecropper. He was the first black man actually to come into my town, Grapevine, Texas, sharecropping. And so, this day always reminds me of that, it reminds me of my history. And so, you know, for a long time I've always hoped and dreamed that this would actually be a national holiday. And so, I'm pushing for that and it's just -- you know, it's a time that all Americans can reflect, right, not just reflect on the horrible institution of slavery --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, and the president said something similar in his statement today about the horrors of slavery but how far we have come. I know you're friends with the president, you just mentioned that you'd like to see Juneteenth be a federal holiday. What's your case to the president, why do you think this may help bring the country together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREWER",
      "utterance": "We need it, we need it right now, no more talking about it. This president has done so many amazing things for the African-American community with his policies, whether it's criminal justice reform, going against what everyone else did in the past. The same thing you just saw him do with police reform, the first president to actually use his executive powers to come in and reform the police departments. Now it's time to actually make this a national holiday. I remember growing up when MLK day, finally schools across the nation started being let out. It's time to do that same thing now. This holiday is meaningful for all Americans, we all know the horrible, horrific stories about slavery. But this a time to rejoice. It's the time to show the world where America stands, how America stands up against racism, against slavery, against oppression and really shows us where we're going for the future and that's celebrating the freedoms of all Americans, all colors, all shapes, sizes and colors."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, you are in Tulsa already, you're going to be at the president's rally tomorrow night, and as you know, there are some African-Americans who are having a protest tonight. I heard Al Sharpton was going to be giving a speech. They don't want the president in Tulsa. They are upset that he chose Tulsa as the location of this rally, as you know, because of that racial massacre in 1921. What's your pushback to other African-Americans who are saying the president shouldn't do this, and what do you think the president should say tomorrow night, maybe more important than that, to try to bring people together?"

    {
      "speaker": "BREWER",
      "utterance": "This is the time for reconciliation, we shouldn't be avoiding the things of our past, we should be talking about them and actually healing from them. This is the time to be joining hands as Christians, as believers, as a nation and given this to God. We're mean, all men make mistakes, all men do bad things and we are all sinners. But this is not a time to have more divisiveness. And so, having protests against people and standing up against men, that's not what this is about. It's not about identity. It's not about race. It's actually bringing us all together. You know, 99.9 percent of our DNA is all the same anyway and our bible teaches us that, and Jesus gave us direction in John 15 and 12 and he said that we must love each other like he loves us. And I think as a nation that's what we need to focus on right now, not trying to win political points. You cannot politicize oppression. It's just not right. Choose a different subject other than race and evilness --"

      "speaker": "BREWER",
      "utterance": "You know what? I always say reparations through education. We need to reform our education system so it doesn't leave these poor black kids out to dry. You know, 71 percent of our kids that drop out of high school are fatherless. We need to go in and systematically change our institutions that are pushing fathers out of their homes. We can go in and take care of these deeply-rooted racial disparities if we're willing to do it and put our politics aside. You know, we can't keep standing up for unions, we've got to stand up our people. We can't keep standing and talking about standing up --"

So, you know, we can't fight against those that agree with us and we have to keep our eye on the prize and that is going in and bringing God back into our country, bringing the -- bringing faith back into our institutions, not pushing them out. That's what's happening to the core of our kids. Our kids are losing the fear of God and we're watching it on our TV screens right before our eyes. And the way we get back to that is getting the faith groups like we're doing with this council for racial reconciliation. We're bringing faith groups together because the folks of faith have to have to fix ourselves first. We have to come together as one people and not be divided and show this nation that we are one nation under God."
