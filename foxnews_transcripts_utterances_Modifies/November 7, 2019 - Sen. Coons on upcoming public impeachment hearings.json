      "sentences": "Yes, that's pretty good. Thank you, Bret. So, good evening, everybody. Tonight on “The Story,” could this presidential race turn into a head-to-head between two wealthy businessmen from New York?  Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, reportedly about to enter the Democratic primary. He's got Judge Judy's backing. As we told you here first on “The Story.” But can he get Democrats across America onboard?  Plus, today, the Dow took off like a rocket in the early trading. Hopes of a China trade deal out there. All of that as John Bolton took a pass today on testifying and he got away with it for now.  Some Republican senators are pushing Secretary of State Pompeo to begin an investigation of their own at the State Department, looking into the Bidens and their dealings in Ukraine. All that as the president railed at the whistleblower's attorney who has been tweeting against him, it turns out, since day one. In moments, we are joined by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, Representative Devin Nunes, and Senator Chris Coons. But we begin tonight with chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel as the transcript that was unveiled today described as bombshell. Mike, tell us about it?",

More than 300 pages of George Kent's testimony behind closed doors was released late in the day. In it, Kent raises concerns about President Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani.  Kent testified about Giuliani, \"He attacked Mascha,\" Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. \"And he's tweeting that the new president needs to investigate Biden and the 2016 campaign. And Kurt's reaction,\" envoy Kurt Volker, \"or responds to me at that was, well, if there's nothing there, what does it matter? And there is something there, it should be investigated. My response to him was asking another country to investigate a prosecution for political reasons undermines our advocacy of the rule of law.\"   But Ken also acknowledged under questioning that he did not have direct information. Testifying, \"The initial readouts I got were, yes, secondhand from the three people. It was my understanding. \"In on the meeting?\" \"My understanding is again Fiona didn't give it directly to me. My understanding is that she may have gotten it from deputy, then deputy national security adviser Kupperman.   \"She sent you the readout?\" \"No. She had a conversation with Brad Fredon (ph), who was the acting deputy assistant secretary at the time. To the best of my knowledge, I received the readout from Brad once I came back from my vacation.\" There's also been testimony from Bill Taylor, the acting top diplomat to Ukraine about the desire to have Ukraine's president do an interview with CNN. Signaling a willingness to open up investigations the White House wanted. The hope was that would lead to an invitation to the White House for Ukraine's president and also free up that military assistance. Martha?",

You remember, Senator Dianne Feinstein got Democrats into deep trouble when she did -- when she challenged Amy Coney Barrett over a Catholic belief. She said, the dogma lives deeply with you. I'm very concerned about that. And you know, that was basically a bigoted comment because that's 150-year- old stereotype which says that Roman Catholics can't be trusted because they put the pope above the Constitution. And that is not what these justices do. There are tons of Conservative justices, Catholic -- in fact, I think there's a Catholic majority on the court, and you had people like a Catholic justice like Anthony Kennedy who was the deciding vote to create the right to same-sex marriage.

Tonight on “The Story,” could this presidential race turn into a head-to-head between two wealthy businessmen from New York? Billionaire Michael Bloomberg, reportedly about to enter the Democratic primary. He's got Judge Judy's backing. As we told you here first on “The Story.” But can he get Democrats across America onboard? Plus, today, the Dow took off like a rocket in the early trading. Hopes of a China trade deal out there. All of that as John Bolton took a pass today on testifying and he got away with it for now. Some Republican senators are pushing Secretary of State Pompeo to begin an investigation of their own at the State Department, looking into the Bidens and their dealings in Ukraine. All that as the president railed at the whistleblower's attorney who has been tweeting against him, it turns out, since day one. In moments, we are joined by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, Representative Devin Nunes, and Senator Chris Coons. But we begin tonight with chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel as the transcript that was unveiled today described as bombshell. Mike, tell us about it?"

More than 300 pages of George Kent's testimony behind closed doors was released late in the day. In it, Kent raises concerns about President Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani. Kent testified about Giuliani, \"He attacked Mascha,\" Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. \"And he's tweeting that the new president needs to investigate Biden and the 2016 campaign. And Kurt's reaction,\" envoy Kurt Volker, \"or responds to me at that was, well, if there's nothing there, what does it matter? And there is something there, it should be investigated. My response to him was asking another country to investigate a prosecution for political reasons undermines our advocacy of the rule of law.\" But Ken also acknowledged under questioning that he did not have direct information. Testifying, \"The initial readouts I got were, yes, secondhand from the three people. It was my understanding. \"In on the meeting?\" \"My understanding is again Fiona didn't give it directly to me. My understanding is that she may have gotten it from deputy, then deputy national security adviser Kupperman. \"She sent you the readout?\" \"No. She had a conversation with Brad Fredon (ph), who was the acting deputy assistant secretary at the time. To the best of my knowledge, I received the readout from Brad once I came back from my vacation.\" There's also been testimony from Bill Taylor, the acting top diplomat to Ukraine about the desire to have Ukraine's president do an interview with CNN. Signaling a willingness to open up investigations the White House wanted. The hope was that would lead to an invitation to the White House for Ukraine's president and also free up that military assistance. Martha?"

Now, take back the court is a liberal judicial activist group that is demanding in a letter, \"the credibility and impartiality of the current Supreme Court is in tatters, they write, posing for photographs with the president of an advocacy organization that has filed briefs in matters pending before the court makes a mockery of Justice Roberts' assertion that a judge's role is to impartially call balls and strikes.

Look, the fact is, this is a form of anti- Catholic bigotry that the guy has gotten Democrats in trouble earlier. You remember, Senator Dianne Feinstein got Democrats into deep trouble when she did -- when she challenged Amy Coney Barrett over a Catholic belief. She said, the dogma lives deeply with you. I'm very concerned about that. And you know, that was basically a bigoted comment because that's 150-year- old stereotype which says that Roman Catholics can't be trusted because they put the pope above the Constitution. And that is not what these justices do. There are tons of Conservative justices, Catholic -- in fact, I think there's a Catholic majority on the court, and you had people like a Catholic justice like Anthony Kennedy who was the deciding vote to create the right to same-sex marriage. You have Catholic justices -- the Pope has basically said that Catholics cannot support the death penalty, yet Catholic justices vote all the time to uphold capital cases. So the idea that these justices can't rule because they're Catholic is absurd."

So I mean, Robin, I think this idea that you can't stand with someone in a picture to assume that it represents a lack of the ability to have judgment and to perform your duties as a judge seems like a pretty big leap."

I mean, we're allowed to believe in this country if you're if you're a Catholic that marriage is between a man and a woman. But a judge -- a judge doesn't necessarily have to rule that way in the court case if the law requires -- if the Constitution requires otherwise. I'm not weighing in on whether it does or doesn't. But I mean, what's happening here is the left is projecting their judicial philosophy on conservatives. The Conservatives are judicial -- believe in judicial restraint, as Justice Gorsuch said that sometimes, if you're a good judge, you're going to have cases where you don't -- you don't agree with the decision you made. The left believes in outcome-based judicial philosophy. They believe in a living constitution which can be twisted to mean anything they want, and so it matters more, with the justice feels. And Conservatives don't care what the justice feels, they care what the law says. And I'm sure these justices will hold up the law."

Because we are finding what we offer already, for some, they're not ready to work in an apartment, live in an apartment, and to get ready for the job.

It is not the purpose of penalty or criminalization, it's the question of choice and providing service beds, training to get back in a life of great integrity, success and back with the loved ones that you share. So, shame on these candidates for making those kinds of blatant statements to get somebody to listen and hopefully a vote, but unfortunately, most of the homeless population doesn't vote. So we have had great response to this and more offers of contribution than help because in watching the entire thing, so many of them said, we were with you the entire time and we would like to contribute towards a porta- potty or some containers or help with the vet -- the veterinarian care that is going to be given to the pets that come in with the homeless.

We have to have this whistleblower come in and talk to us in person so that we can measure this person up. I would say though, when I read those quotes or read those tweets, I had flashbacks to the Strzok/Page text messages. You know, we're in the fall of 2016 as they're investigating President Trump or then candidate Trump and they're exonerating candidate Clinton and you have them testing things like Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero. I had flashbacks to that. I don't know why. It seems like it just reminded me that."

But Martha, let's not miss the core point. What the whistleblower alleged, which was that the president didn't have just one call with President Zelensky of Ukraine, there was an entire organized campaign to establish a quid pro quo to hold up $400 and badly needed military aid for a country that was under Russian assault. That's been confirmed by folks who were on the call like Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, or folks who are not career bureaucrats, not never-Trumpers, but in the case of E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, a strong supporter of President Trump. He's testified there was a quid pro quo here."

And he really saw his job as being truthful to what he believed in of not shaping things just to match some party or please anyone.
