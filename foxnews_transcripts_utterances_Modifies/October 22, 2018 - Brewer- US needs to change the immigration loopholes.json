Then the big question is what happens at that point.  The president is now warning at least three of the Central American countries involved that a lot of money in aid could be cut off or at the very least frozen because they have done little, he says, to contain this.

You will remember last week President Trump first threw out this threat that money could be pulled from three Central American companies (sic), Honduras, Guatemala, and he El Salvador. Well, today, he has followed through on that, saying because of this latest caravan that is now growing in size and making its way north, that he will either pull their funding or substantially reduce it.   When you actually look at the amendment of money here, it is a pretty substantial amount. The latest data that we have -- or at least the most complete recent data that we have goes back to 2016, in which Guatemala received $177 million in aid from the U.S. government, Honduras $152 million, El Salvador 490 million. That's about $420 million. However, that is scheduled to drop and to do so significantly in 2019. The numbers instead, Guatemala about $70 million, Honduras almost $66 million, El Salvador a little north of $45 million. But the president is now saying those three nations deserve little to none.",

We cannot continue to spend our resources and our time. And we have no facilities across the whole border to put these people.   And, of course, when they claim asylum, they get to go to court. They get their paperwork. And then it's catch and release and we never see them and they never show up for their final court. And in the meantime, they're getting married and have more babies.

He's an immigration attorney, author of \"Safe Haven in America.\" Michael, maybe you can help me with what our obligations are when someone files or claims asylum. There's a process to go through. Could you, you know, help me through that? MICHAEL WILDES, AUTHOR, \"SAFE HAVEN IN AMERICA\": It's been a while. Thank you for having me, Neil.  First, before we even talk about the assignment process, let's remind ourselves these souls are not in America. They're on the way to America in Mexico. Under asylum law, if they have resettled in a third country, they're not allowed to get asylum in the United States.  So understand this. If Mexico gives them safe haven, they are then prohibited from getting asylum in the United States. It's time for us to have a real conversation on political asylum law. We cannot be insensitive, like the governor who just spoke just now, as Lady Liberty and mercy should be a weapon that we hold dearly to those that are on our shores. I'm not talking about criminals and MS-13. But if an individual is now out of jeopardy from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and they're in Mexico, why isn't Mexico giving them asylum? And then if their trip to the United States is an economic trip and not a political asylee trip, it really begs the question that we need to have a new conversation post-World War II on what asylum law is, because not every humanitarian crisis is a state persecution.  Asylum law is relegated to five hallmark categories of persecution. And if individuals want a better life, we have to fix our broken system. There, I agree with the governor.

As you mentioned, listen, there's a concern out there that earnings have peaked, revenue is slowing down, and all the great profits we saw this year cannot be replicated next year. Then, Neil, on top of all of that, you have concerns, of course, about rising interest rates, the ongoing China-U.S. trade showdown. You also have a slowing global economy, and, yes, even the death of the Saudi journalist and the repercussions from that weighing on the market in some form or fashion. Bottom line, though it is a little bit of earnings anxiety. And October so far has been a bumpy month. Get this. The Dow is off nearly 4 percent this month. The S&P down more than 5 percent. The Nasdaq, despite some gains today, down 7 percent.  All of this so far, though, earnings have been pretty good; 82 percent of the S&P that has reported so far has beaten those earnings estimates. But this is going to be a huge week for earnings. This could perhaps settle those nerves or make them worse, depending on what we hear from some very big companies. The companies reporting this week, big tech companies, Amazon, Alphabet/Google, Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Twitter, McDonald's, Caterpillar, all sorts of industries. Very interested to see what these companies are reporting, but also, Neil, what they're saying looking into the future, the so-called guidance, which is always so, so important. No doubt October has been a volatile month. We didn't see the kind of heavy selling today that we have seen in recent weeks, but make no doubt about it. October's been bumpy. We still have nine days to go, but, as you said as throwing it to me, Neil, it's about the earnings and concerns that sales are slowing down, and perhaps the good times, well, they may be over, at least for now.",

There's a sense in which I worry very much now, even though I'm generally an optimist about all this -- I know we have been through worse times before - - but Teddy Roosevelt warned that if somehow people began to see each other as the other, rather than as common citizens, if they come from different regions or different parties or different religions or races, then that's when democracy would founder. And it's that hatred. And it's partly I think exampled by Congress for numbers of years ago who no longer feel friendships toward one another, call each other names that they never could have on the Senate floor.

I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And Fox on top of a caravan of migrants that just will not stop. We're told now better than 7,000-strong as it makes its way towards the United States. Then the big question is what happens at that point. The president is now warning at least three of the Central American countries involved that a lot of money in aid could be cut off or at the very least frozen because they have done little, he says, to contain this. Blake Burman at the White House with the latest. Hey, Blake."

      "utterance": "Hi there, Neil. You will remember last week President Trump first threw out this threat that money could be pulled from three Central American companies (sic), Honduras, Guatemala, and he El Salvador. Well, today, he has followed through on that, saying because of this latest caravan that is now growing in size and making its way north, that he will either pull their funding or substantially reduce it. When you actually look at the amendment of money here, it is a pretty substantial amount. The latest data that we have -- or at least the most complete recent data that we have goes back to 2016, in which Guatemala received $177 million in aid from the U.S. government, Honduras $152 million, El Salvador 490 million. That's about $420 million. However, that is scheduled to drop and to do so significantly in 2019. The numbers instead, Guatemala about $70 million, Honduras almost $66 million, El Salvador a little north of $45 million. But the president is now saying those three nations deserve little to none."

That money, that funding ends up coming from the State Department, from its budget, a budget that Congress would eventually have to vote on and approve and put together, and then it would get sent here to the White House for the president to sign off. Still remains to be seen if the president goes through with this threat how the State Department and how the folks up on Capitol Hill might receive it -- Neil."

I hope that the president puts the military on the border and keeps them outside of the United States, so that they cannot come across and claim asylum. We cannot continue to spend our resources and our time. And we have no facilities across the whole border to put these people. And, of course, when they claim asylum, they get to go to court. They get their paperwork. And then it's catch and release and we never see them and they never show up for their final court. And in the meantime, they're getting married and have more babies. Come on, I'm so glad that we have got a president finally that's going to step up and put his foot down. It's unfair. It's unfair to the people of the United States of America. And we need to change the loopholes."

What do you think of that, to cut aid, freeze aid, alter aid as a result?"

Those countries, their government, they need to work with us, not against us. I mean, if they are going export all these people and have organized caravans, moving them out of their countries and up to our country, why should would we be sending them money and then taking care of all the people at the same time? It's just outrageous. It's just totally unbelievable that we have let this situation get to the point of where it is at. And I heard earlier today a report that there could be possibly -- that the caravan has grown to 10,000 people. And they're not all walking."

      "speaker": "BREWER",

But the fact is that everybody, they get in there and they come, you know, as asylum seekers or married to somebody that they are not married to, or they're bringing somebody's kid with them, and we find out they are M-13 (sic), et cetera, et cetera. And there has been word that down in Guatemala at one point in time that they -- that someone caught 100 members of ISIS and returned them."

We need to get our Democratic Congress to step up and fix our immigration laws and make them right. I understand that there are certain people that are entitled to asylum, but, you know, not 90,000 of them. And they can -- and if they want to come to America, come the legal way. We take in more immigrants than any other country in the world. And there is only so many jobs and there's only so many resources. And with these things happening, it's taking the resources that we could be using for mental health, for, you know, foster children. We could be doing good in our own country."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Governor Brewer, thank you very, very much. We shall see as it makes its way here, around election time, by the way. All right, so, how should these migrants be treated legally? What our responsibilities, to the governor's point, once they arrive here? Let's get to read from Michael Wildes. He's an immigration attorney, author of \"Safe Haven in America.\" Michael, maybe you can help me with what our obligations are when someone files or claims asylum. There's a process to go through. Could you, you know, help me through that? MICHAEL WILDES, AUTHOR, \"SAFE HAVEN IN AMERICA\": It's been a while. Thank you for having me, Neil. First, before we even talk about the assignment process, let's remind ourselves these souls are not in America. They're on the way to America in Mexico. Under asylum law, if they have resettled in a third country, they're not allowed to get asylum in the United States. So understand this. If Mexico gives them safe haven, they are then prohibited from getting asylum in the United States. It's time for us to have a real conversation on political asylum law. We cannot be insensitive, like the governor who just spoke just now, as Lady Liberty and mercy should be a weapon that we hold dearly to those that are on our shores. I'm not talking about criminals and MS-13. But if an individual is now out of jeopardy from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and they're in Mexico, why isn't Mexico giving them asylum? And then if their trip to the United States is an economic trip and not a political asylee trip, it really begs the question that we need to have a new conversation post-World War II on what asylum law is, because not every humanitarian crisis is a state persecution. Asylum law is relegated to five hallmark categories of persecution. And if individuals want a better life, we have to fix our broken system. There, I agree with the governor. But this is not America's problem right now. And, mind you, the president..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it will be, right? I mean isn't, that the idea, that it will be, Michael?  What I want to know is, if they can't have asylum in the United States because traveling through in this case a third-party country like Mexico, can they wait on that asylum status or whatever the legal definition will be in Mexico, rather than the United States? You have heard the fear expressed among many that a court date is given to see a judge, they never show up, they're in the United States. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILDES",
      "utterance": "So if you're applying for asylum, it can only be done at our border or in America. If you're applying from abroad in Mexico, you have to go through the U.N.  And there, the U.N. can place you in other countries. So if this is a mad dash through Mexico, punishing the three countries by taking their biblical straw away isn't going to do anything to dissuade these individuals from coming."

      "speaker": "WILDES",

For those that would sneak into the United States and make it past 200 miles, they then, on their own leisure, can apply for asylum within a year.  And there is a process that will speed up, but then you're stuck in a court system that's backed up two, three years on some judge's calendars. Only 370 immigration judges with 12 million people, Neil, the efficiencies -- it's crazy."

Now, the real question is, if the drug cartels and the gangs are being allowed by the government to do this or not. Look, bottom line, Neil, is, the president trying to punish these three countries by taking away their money is not in any way going to stop people from coming here. It's time to have a new conversation on political asylum."

      "utterance": "All right, today, the markets were all over the map. Had very little to do with what's going on south of our border or eventually at our border and everything to do with confusion over earnings and this idea that the earnings are looking fine. The profits these companies are making, they're just doing fine. Something called top-line growth or sales, they're not as fine. Ashley Webster here to explain the difference. What's going on here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Just no pleasing those investors, Neil. I think there's a bit of earnings season anxiety right now. As you mentioned, listen, there's a concern out there that earnings have peaked, revenue is slowing down, and all the great profits we saw this year cannot be replicated next year. Then, Neil, on top of all of that, you have concerns, of course, about rising interest rates, the ongoing China-U.S. trade showdown. You also have a slowing global economy, and, yes, even the death of the Saudi journalist and the repercussions from that weighing on the market in some form or fashion. Bottom line, though it is a little bit of earnings anxiety. And October so far has been a bumpy month. Get this. The Dow is off nearly 4 percent this month. The S&P down more than 5 percent. The Nasdaq, despite some gains today, down 7 percent. All of this so far, though, earnings have been pretty good; 82 percent of the S&P that has reported so far has beaten those earnings estimates. But this is going to be a huge week for earnings. This could perhaps settle those nerves or make them worse, depending on what we hear from some very big companies. The companies reporting this week, big tech companies, Amazon, Alphabet/Google, Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Twitter, McDonald's, Caterpillar, all sorts of industries. Very interested to see what these companies are reporting, but also, Neil, what they're saying looking into the future, the so-called guidance, which is always so, so important. No doubt October has been a volatile month. We didn't see the kind of heavy selling today that we have seen in recent weeks, but make no doubt about it. October's been bumpy. We still have nine days to go, but, as you said as throwing it to me, Neil, it's about the earnings and concerns that sales are slowing down, and perhaps the good times, well, they may be over, at least for now."

Some of these people have been waiting since yesterday morning to get a shot at seeing the president. He's going to be there on behalf of Ted Cruz. A new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll showing the president's approval rating is on the rise, in fact, technically the highest of his presidency by conventional polls. So, what does that mean going into this race and this big endorsement today, where the president's approval rating is now higher than his predecessor's at roughly the same point? RealClearPolitics editor Tom Bevan. Tom, you have often reminded me it's not about the president, but it is about the president. So will this have an effect?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE EDITOR, REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM",
      "utterance": "Well, it's certainly -- it's better news for Republicans that Trump's job approval is trending up than trending down just two weeks before the election. And so, to your point, the fact that this NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll has him at his highest point in his presidency, the FOX News poll had him at about 47 percent just last week, a couple of other polls have him at 45.  So he's at the highest point in RealClearPolitics average he's been in six months. And, again, how much is that going to matter, if he's at 43 vs. 44? Not -- not terribly much. But, again, the trend -- trending upward is certainly better for Republicans, and especially in some of these swing districts, because he's not -- he's not trending up among Democrats. They hate him.  They have always hated him. They're not going to -- they're never going to change their approval of him. But that means he's getting more support from Republicans and also from independents. And in some of these key close competitive House districts, that could make a difference."

We have seen in other midterm elections -- '94 comes to mind -- when they were expecting Republicans to gain 25 to 30 seats, and in fact they gained in excess of 50, took control of the House, we know the Gingrich revolution and all. So you can be surprised. But that was a late-breaking development. Do you see anything like that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Well, the caravan is certainly driving that issue, the issue of illegal immigration, up the issue ladder. And we have seen that in other instances. After the Parkland shooting, for example, in Florida, gun control popped to the top of list, and then sort of settled back down to where it normally is. Immigration is typically low on the list. But, again, we're seeing that drive up the issue ladder. Health care's in the mix certainly, and the economy. The other good news for Republicans in that Wall Street Journal poll is that Republicans had the highest rating on the economy ever in the history that poll. Trump's job approval rating on the economy in particular is over 50 percent. It's at 51 percent in our RealClearPolitics average. So to the extent that that's motivating voters in this election, that's good news for Republicans as well."

      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Not exactly. I mean, Republicans certainly haven't been getting -- getting the lift out of their tax plan that they expected to. And we talked about the reasons for that before. Voters don't vote out of gratitude. They vote out of anger and frustration and fear. But certainly health care is -- we're seeing that playing across the spectrum in all these races, from the governor's races, Senate races, individual House races. We saw it in the Florida governor's debate last night. And Republicans are really trying to sort of thread the needle on that, saying that they want - - they're there for preexisting conditions, keeping that in the mix. So it's a different conversation than Republicans have been having before. And we will see how that how that plays out in November."

I think that in the 31 years since this treaty was signed between Gorbachev and our President Reagan that America has gotten farther and farther behind in terms of these intermediate-range missiles. And that puts us in a vulnerable position. And it's not just China. It's not just Russia. We need to recognize that China, North Korea and the Iranians have all been testing these kinds of weapons.

I think that what Mr. Trump is doing is, once again, he's showing leadership. He is showing leadership on a global scale. He's actually I think encouraging a different kind of behavior, not only by our adversaries, but also by our allies. I think he's encouraging the Europeans to start standing up for what threatens them, as well as what threatens the Americans. And I think the Europeans, many of them in fact behind closed doors are applauding his decisions on things like this, as well as the deal with the Iranians and so forth.

And we're at a point now where everything is so hyperpartisan, and everybody sticks to what they think and can't even have a conversation without saying something that could be degrading, demeaning, nasty. And this is happening on both sides. And the one thing that I do want to say here is, if we want to set a precedent as Americans that we are all human beings and that politics was originally designed to be helping the American people, what message are sending to future generations, other than, hey, you know what? Why don't we not get involved in this anymore? Because this type of stuff is exactly what people hate. This is why people vote against the government, vote against power, do all of this. And this is why Donald Trump won in 2016, because people see this type of stuff happening, and they're sickened by it. But, at the same time, Donald Trump as the leader of the United States should stand up and stop the name-calling, stop the tweeting, stop the bullying, and allow for civility and discourse in American politics to happen."

But then when people go out for dinner, people on both sides of the aisle have to be able to call out their own supporters from doing this. There's a sense in which I worry very much now, even though I'm generally an optimist about all this -- I know we have been through worse times before - - but Teddy Roosevelt warned that if somehow people began to see each other as the other, rather than as common citizens, if they come from different regions or different parties or different religions or races, then that's when democracy would founder. And it's that hatred. And it's partly I think exampled by Congress for numbers of years ago who no longer feel friendships toward one another, call each other names that they never could have on the Senate floor. They would have been censured if they said some of the things they say right now. But it's partly now among the citizenry.

Yet, before the mic, then they're resorting to calling the guy Lucifer or whatever. And I know they don't really mean it.

And so we may not see them hugging each other after it's over. What we see is that vitriol between them. And it just makes me worry, if we're feeling that our politics has let us down, that our public figures haven't been dealing with the problems that we need in these last years, how are young people going to want to go into public life? It's bad enough for their private lives to be exposed now, which they never were in the old days in the same way that they would be now. It's bad enough to have to spend four hours every day raising money, instead of doing the public's good. It's bad enough if you can't get along with your fellow colleagues.

Now a large percentage worry if their kid would marry outside of the party.  I mean, that's astonishing, to think that it's taken -- what makes no sense anymore is that parties don't even have the power they once had. They used to be able to nominate the candidate. They provided the money for the candidate. They were the one that sponsored everything that was going on. So you couldn't get out of being in one party or another. Now independents would have a huge power, if they exercised it, because you can primary a person.
