      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. Let's get right to my open.  I hate it when people lie to me. I even wrote a book, my seventh, titled \"Don't Lie to Me\" out in September.  The person who lies assumes you're too stupid to fathom the truth, so they just keep piling it on.  In their nomination of Bunker Joe Biden, the D.N.C. described an America that was dark, dreary and depressing. Everything wrong in America is President Trump's fault. But for Donald Trump, we'd all be happy, prosperous, frolicking along the hillside, picking daisies. They've forgotten that under Donald Trump, we have the greatest economy this nation has ever seen, the greatest employment of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and women that this nation has ever seen, more jobs than people to fill them.  A GDP brought back from the Obama one percent new normal. A half a million manufacturing jobs brought back after Obama said it couldn't be done. Under Donald Trump, the economy was soaring. The nation was optimistic because the rising tide indeed was lifting all boats.  Michelle Obama proclaimed, \"I'm here tonight because I love this country.\" I was happy to hear this because on March 12, 2008, she said for the first time in her adult life that she was, \" ... really proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\" She was 44 at the time.   Then former President Obama, in an unusual display of vituperative hostility relatively foreign in presidential politics said this.",

      "sentences": "Really, Barack? Aren't you the one who stood with Iran's Ayatollah, sending him love letters to come back to the negotiation table as Iranians chanted \"Death to America,\" as Christians were being beheaded, saying at a Prayer Breakfast that Christians should get off their high horses. You're the one who wouldn't stand with the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel, whose State Department actually gave money that was used in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Prime Minister Netanyahu.  You're the one who stood Iran and sent them $150 million in cash and $1.8 million on pallets as they lied to you, spinning their centrifuges that they have hidden for their nuclear facility.   And by the way, it was Donald Trump who has forged a historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE, to be followed by many Arab nations. Stand with dictators? You're the one who allowed China to continue to rob us blind in our trade deals and steal our intellectual property. You're the one too lazy to get rid of NAFTA and you want to talk about dictators.  You couldn't even figure out who his friend or foe. ISIS, a JV team. You didn't know if you should contain, dismantle or defeat them. None of what you did, all of which Donald Trump did. And you and Bunker Joe are going to restore our standing in the world. Now, how is that going to happen?  Does Joe start apologizing to everyone for being American? If America is so damn dark and dreary, why do people risk their lives to come here and fight like hell, when we want to send them back to their country?  Improve our standing in the world? If that means glad handing instead of receiving money owed, like NATO dollars for American troops and protection, then keep your standing. We'll stick with Donald Trump and get the money that's owed to us. And if the money isn't forthcoming, we'll take our troops out like he did in Germany. Now Joe Biden says our President refuses and blames -- or refuses to lead and blames others. Now, that's rich.  I can't remember a time when Biden and Barack didn't blame all of America's economic woes on George Bush. And how about all those shovel ready jobs, huh, Joe? They produced nothing but shovel ready crap. Did Hunter get any of those jobs?   Joe Biden says this is a life changing election that will determine America's future for a very long time. Hey, Joe, you were in Washington for 47 years. What the hell did you do to improve our lot during those 47 years? But you are right. If you like being told what to say, think and eat. If you like socialism, no police, a lockdown, no guns and being taxed to the nines, this crew is for you. You say character and democracy are on the ballot. No kidding. This is why after you and Barack left, we chose an outsider, an anti-establishment candidate and a populist as a President. Character and decency and democracy? You were the ones who broke the law. You were the ones who from the highest echelons of government lied over and over in sworn affidavits, and then lied over and over to a FISA Court to get warrants repeatedly to spy on Carter Page, so you could spy on a presidential candidate and then a President elect.  Aren't you the one Joe, who sat in the Oval Office with President Obama and disgraced F.B.I. Director Jim Comey on January 5, 2017, recommending that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn be charged with the Logan Act, so he wouldn't have the chance to take down the corruption in the Intel agencies?  You and your corrupt administration, with nothing for evidence, pulled the wool over a judge's eyes or maybe forum shopped to find a judge to bring down a President. You, Mr. Biden and your ilk dragged this country through two years of hell in this Russia collusion delusion, a division where you sowed the seed of hate, that you now claim to reject; and you, and top of the Obama administration officials played musical chairs with prosecutors and judges and F.B.I. agents, moving out Jeff Sessions, moving in Rod Rosenstein, moving Mueller -- Bob Mueller to Special Counsel when President Trump refused to reappoint him as F.B.I. Director.   Oh, yes, Mr. Biden, you and your own have created the very division that you protest and condemn. And pray tell, Mr. Biden, no mention of China in your little speech. A little too close to Hunter? A little too close to that $1.5 billion deal from the Chinese? Did you threaten anyone over there like you did in the Ukraine? No mention of the chaos and the anarchy that's going on in Democrat-run cities in the United States. No mention or support for the blue line of law enforcement that separates a civil from a barbaric society.  You speak of racial injustice, but you say nothing about rioting and looting and burning and shooting going on, on America's streets.  You and your ilk want to confiscate guns, don't lie about it. And when people use those guns to defend themselves, you're ilk arrest them. And Kamala doesn't even think the Constitution prevents her from confiscating those guns. One day, you say you're absolutely in favor of defunding police, and then your campaign says you're not. Which lie is it? Both Joe and Kamala are against fracking, but like defunding police, that answer changes. Now there's talk of grandfathering fracking as long as it's not dangerous. Which is it?   Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are on the line. So why not say you'll grandfather things in.  And it's so rich, while millions right now in California are sitting in the dark. These know-it-alls keep talking about the Green New Deal. And Joe, you forgot to mention at the convention that a huge percentage of Americans are going to see their taxes go up significantly. We can thank AOC and the Green New Deal for that one.  Look, Joe, you know, America changed after China unleashed the coronavirus. Wasn't it you and pals, Nancy Pelosi and Bill de Blasio who said, let's go to Chinatown after President Trump blocked flights from China and you called him a racist and a xenophobe?  And now you say you'd shut down the country. So you agree the President was right when he did so. So do you would now admit that you were wrong when you said this?",

You're right, Joe. There's too much anger and too much fear. You and your ilk have created it. You have seeded it, cultivated it. And now, you're using it as a sword. The American people see through it. Stop trying to ride both sides of every issue and stop trying to scare people as if you were the only good and decent person in the race.   Unlike you, Joe, Donald Trump made his own money and he hasn't asked the government for it and he doesn't cut deals while he is in the government for his son and his family. So stop with your sanctimonious, condescending, holier than thou nonsense and above all, stop lying to me, and get out of the bunker. That's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine.   If you like my opens, you're going to love my new book, \"Don't Lie to Me\" available for preorder right now on Amazon and everywhere you can preorder.  Joining me now with reaction to my open and much more, senior adviser to the Trump 2020 reelection campaign and President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Lara, thanks so much for being with us. I saw you this morning on -- I'd say that's about 7:05, so I know it's been a long day for you.  Tell us tell us about, you know, your perception of the D.N.C. and the convention that they had last week. LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISER TO THE TRUMP 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Yes, well, what a sad, dark, depressing depiction of America quite frankly. I don't know if you didn't want to live in the Democrats' America before the convention, Jeanine, you certainly don't want to live in it after seeing the convention.  There was really no talk as to how they would make this country better, any policy plans that they had. It was basically just dump on Donald Trump.  We got the picture, guys. We know you don't like Donald Trump, and what a good and decent man Joe Biden is. Unfortunately, that is not what this country needs -- just a good and decent man. There are a lot of those out there. We need somebody to get the job done and that is Donald Trump.  So I think this coming week, we're very excited, Jeanine, to showcase our convention from the Republican side, because it will be a 180-degree departure from what you saw last week. And I promise you won't need toothpicks to keep your eyelids open, because we're going to make it a little more exciting.",

Ours will be a convention of and for the American people. So you'll hear stories from people this coming week, many of whom did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016 who are now voting for him because they have felt the positive impact of Donald Trump as our President. They believed the fake news, Judge Jeanine previously and now they get it. They've seen the light. They want to vote for Donald Trump. They want to tell their story.  We'll have people who have lived through socialism and are going to warn against the Democrats because as we well know, this is the most far left radical socialist ticket in the history of American politics with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris now.  So it'll be a very clear vision of a positive, patriotic America that we can be proud of. And that's what we always want at the end. You want to have hope and inspiration. Unfortunately, the Democrats didn't present that. But again, ours will be real American people telling their stories, and I think it's going to be really great.",

He is inspirational.  I mean, he's the kind of guy who really -- he can excite crowds of 20,000 people. I mean, you know, Sleepy Joe is a little different character. But don't you think it was stunning the fact that there was no mention of the thing that people are going through in some of the big cities in Minneapolis and Detroit and Los Angeles and Portland and Seattle, all of the burning in the looting, there's no talk about New York City and crime going up.

These states are run by Democratic governors, and they're not doing their job. They are not doing what they promised and swore an oath to do for the people of their cities.   They're letting the mob run things. They are letting anarchy reign. And so yes, we didn't hear that from the Democrats. You will hear about how disappointed some people in our convention are about that. We're going to talk about how we support the police and unlike the Democrats, we don't want to defund the police. We want to defend the police.

But let's now explain to him what it means. It means when you don't speak out about something horrendous, you're thought to kind of agree with it, or certainly not object to it. Well, since the killing of Mr. Floyd, which was really unfortunate and terrible and unjustified, there have been hundreds of people killed and hundreds of lives kill, none of which Joe Biden has paid any attention to nor did Black Lives Matter. The 80 days of continuous riot in Portland, he paid no attention. The violence in the city of Seattle, he paid no attention. The 20 murders a weekend in Chicago. I'm talking about all Democrat cities now, he has paid no attention to this. A big party came to a big convention. Their cities are up in flames and they ignore it. What that says is they have no plan to fix it, which is why they should not be elected. We need someone who has a plan to fix it, and the President does and will very, very quickly, just like he fixed all of the other terrible mistakes made by a worst administration ever, the Obama- Biden administration.",

I even wrote a book, my seventh, titled \"Don't Lie to Me\" out in September. The person who lies assumes you're too stupid to fathom the truth, so they just keep piling it on. In their nomination of Bunker Joe Biden, the D.N.C. described an America that was dark, dreary and depressing. Everything wrong in America is President Trump's fault. But for Donald Trump, we'd all be happy, prosperous, frolicking along the hillside, picking daisies. They've forgotten that under Donald Trump, we have the greatest economy this nation has ever seen, the greatest employment of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and women that this nation has ever seen, more jobs than people to fill them. A GDP brought back from the Obama one percent new normal. A half a million manufacturing jobs brought back after Obama said it couldn't be done. Under Donald Trump, the economy was soaring. The nation was optimistic because the rising tide indeed was lifting all boats. Michelle Obama proclaimed, \"I'm here tonight because I love this country.\" I was happy to hear this because on March 12, 2008, she said for the first time in her adult life that she was, \" ... really proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback.\" She was 44 at the time. Then former President Obama, in an unusual display of vituperative hostility relatively foreign in presidential politics said this."

      "utterance": "Really, Barack? Aren't you the one who stood with Iran's Ayatollah, sending him love letters to come back to the negotiation table as Iranians chanted \"Death to America,\" as Christians were being beheaded, saying at a Prayer Breakfast that Christians should get off their high horses. You're the one who wouldn't stand with the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel, whose State Department actually gave money that was used in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat Prime Minister Netanyahu. You're the one who stood Iran and sent them $150 million in cash and $1.8 million on pallets as they lied to you, spinning their centrifuges that they have hidden for their nuclear facility. And by the way, it was Donald Trump who has forged a historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE, to be followed by many Arab nations. Stand with dictators? You're the one who allowed China to continue to rob us blind in our trade deals and steal our intellectual property. You're the one too lazy to get rid of NAFTA and you want to talk about dictators. You couldn't even figure out who his friend or foe. ISIS, a JV team. You didn't know if you should contain, dismantle or defeat them. None of what you did, all of which Donald Trump did. And you and Bunker Joe are going to restore our standing in the world. Now, how is that going to happen? Does Joe start apologizing to everyone for being American? If America is so damn dark and dreary, why do people risk their lives to come here and fight like hell, when we want to send them back to their country? Improve our standing in the world? If that means glad handing instead of receiving money owed, like NATO dollars for American troops and protection, then keep your standing. We'll stick with Donald Trump and get the money that's owed to us. And if the money isn't forthcoming, we'll take our troops out like he did in Germany. Now Joe Biden says our President refuses and blames -- or refuses to lead and blames others. Now, that's rich. I can't remember a time when Biden and Barack didn't blame all of America's economic woes on George Bush. And how about all those shovel ready jobs, huh, Joe? They produced nothing but shovel ready crap. Did Hunter get any of those jobs? Joe Biden says this is a life changing election that will determine America's future for a very long time. Hey, Joe, you were in Washington for 47 years. What the hell did you do to improve our lot during those 47 years? But you are right. If you like being told what to say, think and eat. If you like socialism, no police, a lockdown, no guns and being taxed to the nines, this crew is for you. You say character and democracy are on the ballot. No kidding. This is why after you and Barack left, we chose an outsider, an anti-establishment candidate and a populist as a President. Character and decency and democracy? You were the ones who broke the law. You were the ones who from the highest echelons of government lied over and over in sworn affidavits, and then lied over and over to a FISA Court to get warrants repeatedly to spy on Carter Page, so you could spy on a presidential candidate and then a President elect. Aren't you the one Joe, who sat in the Oval Office with President Obama and disgraced F.B.I. Director Jim Comey on January 5, 2017, recommending that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn be charged with the Logan Act, so he wouldn't have the chance to take down the corruption in the Intel agencies? You and your corrupt administration, with nothing for evidence, pulled the wool over a judge's eyes or maybe forum shopped to find a judge to bring down a President. You, Mr. Biden and your ilk dragged this country through two years of hell in this Russia collusion delusion, a division where you sowed the seed of hate, that you now claim to reject; and you, and top of the Obama administration officials played musical chairs with prosecutors and judges and F.B.I. agents, moving out Jeff Sessions, moving in Rod Rosenstein, moving Mueller -- Bob Mueller to Special Counsel when President Trump refused to reappoint him as F.B.I. Director. Oh, yes, Mr. Biden, you and your own have created the very division that you protest and condemn. And pray tell, Mr. Biden, no mention of China in your little speech. A little too close to Hunter? A little too close to that $1.5 billion deal from the Chinese? Did you threaten anyone over there like you did in the Ukraine? No mention of the chaos and the anarchy that's going on in Democrat-run cities in the United States. No mention or support for the blue line of law enforcement that separates a civil from a barbaric society. You speak of racial injustice, but you say nothing about rioting and looting and burning and shooting going on, on America's streets. You and your ilk want to confiscate guns, don't lie about it. And when people use those guns to defend themselves, you're ilk arrest them. And Kamala doesn't even think the Constitution prevents her from confiscating those guns. One day, you say you're absolutely in favor of defunding police, and then your campaign says you're not. Which lie is it? Both Joe and Kamala are against fracking, but like defunding police, that answer changes. Now there's talk of grandfathering fracking as long as it's not dangerous. Which is it? Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are on the line. So why not say you'll grandfather things in. And it's so rich, while millions right now in California are sitting in the dark. These know-it-alls keep talking about the Green New Deal. And Joe, you forgot to mention at the convention that a huge percentage of Americans are going to see their taxes go up significantly. We can thank AOC and the Green New Deal for that one. Look, Joe, you know, America changed after China unleashed the coronavirus. Wasn't it you and pals, Nancy Pelosi and Bill de Blasio who said, let's go to Chinatown after President Trump blocked flights from China and you called him a racist and a xenophobe? And now you say you'd shut down the country. So you agree the President was right when he did so. So do you would now admit that you were wrong when you said this?"

The American people see through it. Stop trying to ride both sides of every issue and stop trying to scare people as if you were the only good and decent person in the race. Unlike you, Joe, Donald Trump made his own money and he hasn't asked the government for it and he doesn't cut deals while he is in the government for his son and his family.

Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. If you like my opens, you're going to love my new book, \"Don't Lie to Me\" available for preorder right now on Amazon and everywhere you can preorder. Joining me now with reaction to my open and much more, senior adviser to the Trump 2020 reelection campaign and President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. Lara, thanks so much for being with us. I saw you this morning on -- I'd say that's about 7:05, so I know it's been a long day for you. Tell us tell us about, you know, your perception of the D.N.C. and the convention that they had last week. LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISER TO THE TRUMP 2020 REELECTION CAMPAIGN: Yes, well, what a sad, dark, depressing depiction of America quite frankly. I don't know if you didn't want to live in the Democrats' America before the convention, Jeanine, you certainly don't want to live in it after seeing the convention. There was really no talk as to how they would make this country better, any policy plans that they had. It was basically just dump on Donald Trump. We got the picture, guys. We know you don't like Donald Trump, and what a good and decent man Joe Biden is. Unfortunately, that is not what this country needs -- just a good and decent man. There are a lot of those out there. We need somebody to get the job done and that is Donald Trump. So I think this coming week, we're very excited, Jeanine, to showcase our convention from the Republican side, because it will be a 180-degree departure from what you saw last week. And I promise you won't need toothpicks to keep your eyelids open, because we're going to make it a little more exciting."

But who is going to be speaking? I guess, it's the usual. I mean, in terms of the family, but how will this be different? I mean, how will this not be as dark, dreary and depressing, which were words that were used over and over by them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, it will be very different from the Democrats where you saw them drag out of course, the Hollywood celebrities like they like to do and you know a bunch of politicians that man, we all thought were gone away and we wouldn't have to hear from again, but they dragged them all out. Ours will be a convention of and for the American people. So you'll hear stories from people this coming week, many of whom did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016 who are now voting for him because they have felt the positive impact of Donald Trump as our President. They believed the fake news, Judge Jeanine previously and now they get it. They've seen the light. They want to vote for Donald Trump. They want to tell their story. We'll have people who have lived through socialism and are going to warn against the Democrats because as we well know, this is the most far left radical socialist ticket in the history of American politics with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris now. So it'll be a very clear vision of a positive, patriotic America that we can be proud of. And that's what we always want at the end. You want to have hope and inspiration. Unfortunately, the Democrats didn't present that. But again, ours will be real American people telling their stories, and I think it's going to be really great."

He is inspirational. I mean, he's the kind of guy who really -- he can excite crowds of 20,000 people. I mean, you know, Sleepy Joe is a little different character. But don't you think it was stunning the fact that there was no mention of the thing that people are going through in some of the big cities in Minneapolis and Detroit and Los Angeles and Portland and Seattle, all of the burning in the looting, there's no talk about New York City and crime going up. How could they actually ignore that?"

      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I mean it is the one thing that we should be discussing because these are our great American cities that are being absolutely destroyed before our very eyes. But I think you didn't hear them mention it because they know what we know. They know that these cities are run solely by far left Democrat mayors. These states are run by Democratic governors, and they're not doing their job. They are not doing what they promised and swore an oath to do for the people of their cities. They're letting the mob run things. They are letting anarchy reign. And so yes, we didn't hear that from the Democrats. You will hear about how disappointed some people in our convention are about that. We're going to talk about how we support the police and unlike the Democrats, we don't want to defund the police. We want to defend the police. So shocking to you know, have them completely ignore it, but I guess it's not surprising, because they know that they would have to own that and maybe they don't bring that up for people and remind them about that."

I assume he can still read. But I think that they've made it very clear, they do not want to debate President Donald Trump. As we know, I think, I've talked about this many times, the fact that we have people that will start voting in this country well before a debate ever takes place, weeks before a debate ever takes place. It is so needed, but they know that they don't want to get that candidate of Joe Biden on stage with the best debater of them all, President Donald Trump, we'll see what happens."

All right, Mr. Mayor, thanks so much for being with us this evening. You heard the -- I'm sure, pretty much most of the Democratic Convention and certainly Biden's speech, his acceptance speech. What did you think of the fact that they literally ignored the violence that's going on, on our city streets?"

      "utterance": "Well, I thought it spoke volumes about what their philosophy is, which is, criminal anti- police philosophy that's been that way for quite some time now. I mean, Joe Biden in the speech referred to something else, used the words, silence is acceptance. I'm not sure if Joe really knows what that means, he probably read it. But let's now explain to him what it means. It means when you don't speak out about something horrendous, you're thought to kind of agree with it, or certainly not object to it. Well, since the killing of Mr. Floyd, which was really unfortunate and terrible and unjustified, there have been hundreds of people killed and hundreds of lives kill, none of which Joe Biden has paid any attention to nor did Black Lives Matter. The 80 days of continuous riot in Portland, he paid no attention. The violence in the city of Seattle, he paid no attention. The 20 murders a weekend in Chicago. I'm talking about all Democrat cities now, he has paid no attention to this. A big party came to a big convention. Their cities are up in flames and they ignore it. What that says is they have no plan to fix it, which is why they should not be elected. We need someone who has a plan to fix it, and the President does and will very, very quickly, just like he fixed all of the other terrible mistakes made by a worst administration ever, the Obama- Biden administration."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, Mr. Mayor, let me cut in right there. I mean, you know, we learned it in the law of contracts that silence is acceptance. And, you know, as he says, it is ascent, but at the same time, that you know, for them to then be of the mind that it's wrong to have guns. And you know, Joe Biden is going to put Beto O'Rourke in charge of gun policy, and Kamala Harris believes that the Constitution doesn't prevent her from confiscating guns. And people like the McCloskeys are being prosecuted and the DA in Los Angeles, her husband is being prosecuted for gun possession when Black Lives Matter protesters came up to their home. I mean, this is not this is not acceptable in a civilized society where people can't defend themselves. So how does America begin to understand what is going on? And what we need to do? I mean, when people lie, what does the average voter think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I think what the average voter should say is, if you take a good look at Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon, New York City, and Chicago, if you vote for Joe Biden, that's going to be you next year. I don't care if you're a city or suburb because the tendency of crime is when it starts and you don't control it and you enable it, it goes out of control. So in 1968, New York City went to a thousand murders and remained that way for 30 years. It's much easier to grow crime than to reduce it. I reduced crime, more than any mayor in history. I know how hard it is."

Look, we've got about 10 cities in which we have Democratic mayors who don't know how to protect their people or don't want to protect their people, because they're too afraid of what Black Lives Matter is going to say to them. Well, that's a perfect recipe for a crime wave that's going to go beyond Democrat cities if we elect a Democrat, and particularly, if we elect a weak-minded one, Joe Biden, who -- look, he got through the speech by reading it, I'm sure he didn't know where to start with that file or what he meant when he said silence is acceptance. He was not very smart before he became incapacitated. He was always kind of dumb. Now, he is clearly cognitively impaired. I have a podcast out right now with two eminent doctors that say it is clear that he has something beyond a mild case of either Alzheimer's or some other form of dementia.

We now understand that. Not fully, but enough. Locking it down now, you will bankrupt Americans, put fathers and mothers out of work and they already went through this before, Judge.

You know, Charlie, you had a bunch of tweets this week where you talked about Lori Lightfoot, and the fact that Lori Lightfoot apparently wants to make sure that her street is safe, and she wants to stop protesters, not from coming to her house like they did to the McCloskeys and not from coming to her house like they did to the DA Jackie Lacey in Los Angeles. She doesn't want them on her street. Is that correct?"

Yes, Lori Lightfoot seems to be okay with the widespread amount of crime that is happening in the beloved city that I grew up outside of in the suburbs of Chicago, just seeing the city burn while Lori Lightfoot says, no, I can use the police to make sure that the protesters don't come up against me. If the left did not have double standards, they would have no standards at all, Judge. And so what you have right here is a typical ruling class politician. While Chicago had its most murderous crime spree in 28 years last month, Lori Lightfoot is more concerned about making sure that she can sleep at night so that she doesn't have to hear the protests in opposition to what she is doing in the once great City of Chicago. Judge, right now, one of the number one issues in the country and I think Leo has said this so beautifully and the Democrats had no mention of this at all is the crime happening in urban America. It is unbelievably tragic what is happening to black America right now. The Democrats have decided to not mention it at all, and Lori Lightfoot is overseeing one of the worst, let's say cities in the country when it comes to crime and it comes to this kind of violence."

But let's talk about the fact that they're still protesting. I think it is 86 days now in in Portland, Leo. Do you know what the numbers are?"

Trump was right and the Portland Mayor, failure to accept help from President Trump is a disaster. It's not a question of the Federal government there. These are criminals. I don't think America -- the Democrats understand, these aren't protesters. They're criminals. They're thugs and they're burning down the City of Portland. And what's happening is that these democrats honestly believe, Judge that these people are their voters. They're not. This is a threat, not just to a Democratic city. This type of lawlessness is a threat to the entire country, to the entire U.S.A. and people need to wake up."

Crime going up, the fact that people are buying guns now to protect themselves, body armor sales are going through the roof. I mean, how could they deny the reality of what's going on in the world?"

Atlanta has not had a Republican mayor since the 1800s, Judge. They don't want to talk about it because they own it. I mean, they had a whole convention where they were trying to strawman the President, where they were trying to make a case to Middle America and try to get Republicans to defect away, but not one mention of hey, what do you guys actually control Democratic Party? Where can you show us where what you have done worked? Oh, the most murderous, dangerous, divisive cities in the country where it's least likely to succeed right now are all run by Democrats, and it's tragic because this is not the Democratic Party of the last 30 or 40 years. This is the Democratic Party that is embracing radical elements that is anti-police, almost embracing of crime and arson, and the country cannot continue to survive our beautiful cities in perpetual states of chaos. This is just another reason why we need to reelect the President this November."

But the thing that really bothers me the most is all the damage it did to so many other innocent Americans, you know, first and foremost, and really the main target of that entire sham was then candidate Donald J. Trump in 2016. So unfortunately, I know so many people, including the President have been pushing for serious reforms to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and our court system and our legal -- withstanding so much damage and, you know, I think it's really important that we think of important new steps and take start going down that pathway.

And, you know, to altering a document, denying that you were a source for the F.B.I. Now, you had sent the letter to Chris Wray as far back as a year and a half ago, and he never answered you about this. So Christopher Wray has had knowledge of this information, and it wasn't until John Durham and the Bill Barr investigation that we even heard that this was the case.
