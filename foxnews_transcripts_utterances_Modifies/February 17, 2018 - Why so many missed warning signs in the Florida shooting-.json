The president and first lady traveled to that community Friday night to meet with first responders and survivors of the massacre that left 17 people dead and more than a dozen injured. In the wake of the attack, new concerns over missed warning signs about the suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz. Police reportedly responded to his home more than three dozen times in recent years. And the FBI admitted Friday that a person close to Cruz contacted them in January to report concerns about him, including information about Cruz's gun ownership, erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts.

The 37-page indictment unveiled by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein contains no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign but, instead, documents a broad social media and propaganda effort operating out of Russia with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system. Rosenstein said Friday that there's no allegation that any American knowingly participated in the operation and no allegation that the defendant's actions affected the outcome of the election.   Let's bring in 'Wall Street Journal' columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and Columnist Kim Strassel. So, Dan, I think the value of this indictment is the level of detail about the extent of the Russian operation to sow discord?  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Tremendous amount of detail, Paul. Hundreds of Russian operatives in the United States using all of our social media Web sites and millions of dollars being spent.  Let's go through the timeline, though, because it's very telling. This began back in early 2014. And they got up and running and they are doing this through 2014, 2015, into the campaign, through the election, all right. At that time, who was president of the United States? Barack Obama. James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, John Brennan running the CIA, James Comey, director of the FBI. January 2017, after the election, the Clapper report comes out saying that we have evidence that there are Russian and cyber-attacks going on and we should be paying attention to this. After that, the narrative starts in the press that there was collusion -- the word collusion -- between the Trump campaign and the Russians. This proves incontrovertibly there was meddling, but no collusion.",

The questions were answered by November and the file was administratively closed in January 20 -- of 2018. What that means is that the White House knew as early as March and as late as July that there was a real problem with this one.

Florida, excuse me, Florida is a state that's notoriously under-resourced in terms of mental health care. I'm talking in general. There are very few beds. And also, sheriffs in Florida have the capacity to bring someone in for sort of a civil hearing and civil evaluation.

But we can't do any of that at expense of cutting programs for schools, which look like they maybe endangered.

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "The Justice Department on Friday indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russians companies for alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The 37-page indictment unveiled by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein contains no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign but, instead, documents a broad social media and propaganda effort operating out of Russia with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system. Rosenstein said Friday that there's no allegation that any American knowingly participated in the operation and no allegation that the defendant's actions affected the outcome of the election. Let's bring in 'Wall Street Journal' columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and Columnist Kim Strassel. So, Dan, I think the value of this indictment is the level of detail about the extent of the Russian operation to sow discord? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Tremendous amount of detail, Paul. Hundreds of Russian operatives in the United States using all of our social media Web sites and millions of dollars being spent. Let's go through the timeline, though, because it's very telling. This began back in early 2014. And they got up and running and they are doing this through 2014, 2015, into the campaign, through the election, all right. At that time, who was president of the United States? Barack Obama. James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, John Brennan running the CIA, James Comey, director of the FBI. January 2017, after the election, the Clapper report comes out saying that we have evidence that there are Russian and cyber-attacks going on and we should be paying attention to this. After that, the narrative starts in the press that there was collusion -- the word collusion -- between the Trump campaign and the Russians. This proves incontrovertibly there was meddling, but no collusion."

You have crime critics saying it does not exonerate him. The word 'unwitting,' that Russians did communicate with the Trump campaign, but officials were unwitting, and they did not know what was happening to them. So the question is, is there a different scheme out there and completely entirely different one that the Russians were engaged in that Mueller is following up that could deal with collusion? It's possible. But it seems as though this is the -- this is the deal, this is what the Clapper report was referencing.

And remember, too, that a lot of this effort went not to necessarily helping one campaign or hurting another, but on issues. They were trying to foment opposition.

Wray told Congress Tuesday that the agency had briefed the White House on several occasions about the status of Porter's investigation, submitted a completed background check in July, and closed the file last month without granting Porter permanent security clearance. Kelly had defended the White House handling of the matter earlier this week telling the 'Wall Street Journal,' quote, 'It was all done right.' Karl Rove is a 'Wall Street Journal' columnist and former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush. Welcome, Karl.

By March, they had preliminary analysis that they shared with the White House. By June, they had final report they submitted in July. There was one leak from the FBI that says they told the White House in June that he was unlikely to get a permanent clearance. The White House raised questions. The questions were answered by November and the file was administratively closed in January 20 -- of 2018. What that means is that the White House knew as early as March and as late as July that there was a real problem with this one. Somebody raised some questions, perhaps, about the underlying charges by the first two wives and the former girlfriend, and those were answered by the FBI no later than November.

Those are the people who are calling for his departure. Yes, ultimately somebody has to be held accountable for the failure of the system to look at this problem and raise the problem to -- and conclude by saying, Mr. Porter, no matter how worthy he was in his job, you need to leave the White House. But I don't see -- I don't think the responsibility lies with General Kelly. One, as you say, he came in July. Tis was known in March, known in June. The question is, was he briefed about it in July?

I had some conversation today with some senior Republicans on the Hill and, look, there are two avenues to movement here. The Senate seems to think that the conversations are going to continue. They were not helped by the president's veto. Absolutely did not help the process. The House, people on the House side, seem to think if they can pass a bill, even if it's more restrictionist than what the Senate will accept, this will keep the movement towards some kind of reform going forward. So I'm not certain where -- we are at the end of the drama, and not helped the president saying, you have to support Grassley and that's the only measure I will support.

But the South Koreans themselves, the \"Wall Street Journal\" had a good story of how South Koreans weren't fooled by Kim's sister. They feel they are on the brink of a very serious military confrontation with North Korea. Serious people weren't charmed by it, but the media gets caught up in these sorts of things and that's what they --"

Look, people know about this. It's meant to override the reality of North Korea. You know, it's very different. I was out in Asia to the '88 summer Olympics in South Korea, which were instrumental in promoting democracy in the country and so forth. And Pyongyang was a huge loser there because they boycotted. But at the same time, South Korea used the Olympics to improve relations with China, the Soviet Union. This time, they decided we are going to play the game rather than pout on the sidelines."

You had President Moon, of South Korea, inviting the sister to the opening ceremonies, inviting her to the Blue House, the equivalent of the White House over there. And she basically turned around and said, why don't you come visit the North. Moon said I will defer that, but nonetheless, it was -- it put him back on the spot."

You saw the photos of him sitting in the same box of a woman who is, let's be honest, the deputy director of propaganda, and blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury for human rights abuses. She's no pretty face. She's a brutal lady presiding with her brother over a brutal regime. So, you know, I think it was very awkward for the United States."

And I think he was very steady in trying to make it clear that the United States was not going to permit the North Koreans to get away with this propaganda offensive. And he talked about our goal is still denuclearization. And, I think, that once the Olympics are over, Paul, we will reboot to reality. The reality here is not the same as we've had in the past negotiating with North Korea. The new reality in the last year is this, they've created a long-range ballistic missile that can reach the United States, they've exploded a hydrogen-like atomic device, and everybody in the intelligence community understands that it's getting to a point to attach that device to missile, allow it to reenter the atmosphere without disintegrating. And that clock is ticking. We know it, the Japanese know it and the South Koreans know it. After the Olympics, we will get back to talking about that."

Remember, I think, almost two decades ago now, Paul, South Korea paid half a billion dollars to sit down with the North, so they are willing to go there. But remember, too, President Moon has his own domestic political constraints. I think he can only go so far with the North before he suffers politically at home. So that's another issue to watch."

This week, he ordered the owner of a factory building to play $6.7 million to people who defaced it with graffiti. The owner's crime was you can't get rid of graffiti on his own building. The artists sued under something called the Visual Artists Rights Act, which gives artists some rights. But the judge reminded people that the owner expressed no remorse. This is nuts. Right? And we know the property rights should be a lot more important. And who are the first people to their property rights when somebody wants to use something? Artists."
