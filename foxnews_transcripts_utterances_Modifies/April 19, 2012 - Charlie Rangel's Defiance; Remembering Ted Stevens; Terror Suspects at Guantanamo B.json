I mean, he gives 37-minute speech whining about his mistreatment? What about his mistreatment of the taxpayers? I mean, everything he did was corrupt. He's acting like he is being singled out for things that everybody else does. It's a bipartisan ethics committee. It's a Democratic Congress. He has been given lots and lots of rope by Nancy Pelosi. They've bent over backwards to do anything about this. It's amazing to me -- I've said it before and I'll say it again -- amazing to me that this process has taken as long as it has with the kind of evidence that we have -- uncovered by the right-wing news media outlets like The New York Times. It's amazing that we actually haven't. And the one point on which I'll agree with Charlie Rangel is this should be expedited. Let's go, have the vote. Kick him out. Kick him out."

So he lost his seat and thus, because he wasn't in the Senate, Obama-care passed. It never would have happened if that prosecutorial injustice hadn't happened. It's a footnote history but it's a very important one."

In fact, the president promised to close that and he criticized the military commissions, the trials by his predecessor. Now, there is a trial moving forward. Canadian citizen Omar Khadr is the first trial being tried for war crimes in the military commissions under President Obama. He was picked up on the battlefield by the U.S. military in Afghanistan at the age of 15 and has been in detention ever since. We're back with the panel. Let's talk about this case first, Steve, and what's behind it. What about the case the government has against Khadr?"

He was a known Al Qaeda operative. His family moved to be close to Usama bin Laden, he trained in an Al Qaeda camp. You showed earlier a video of him putting together IEDs. He's a bad guy. His defense lawyers claimed he was tortured, basically, but the only real evidence they produced isn't actually evidence at all, because it comes from him and it comes from the lawyers. And they are making all of the wild claims some of which have been actually dis-proven. They said he was tortured during his weigh-in. There is videotape of his weigh-in and he wasn't tortured during his weigh-in. In one case interrogator went too far and made suggestion, told him a story about another detainee."

But he is now up against the real need to do something with people who are held there who are a danger to America and I think to the world, in many cases. So the question is, how do you get these people out? In the sound bite that you played, he is asking his former White House counsel, do you have a way to determine how we deal with the folks? And he's told at the time yes, we have a process."

And one of the arguments being made here in the Khadr case is, he has been offered a deal -- 30 years in jail -- and we don't have to do this. His attorneys and others are saying the reason this is the first case is because this is a sure bet this will be a prosecution that succeeds and that could set down a model for what happens with the others. The idea is to empty out that prison. That's the best hope that President Obama has at this point."

As professor, as a senator, as a candidate he railed against Guantanamo and as we saw, even a couple days into office, he says, well, we've got a process. We will work it out. He is president now and he knows that Guantanamo is exactly what we needed. It fits all of our requirements. It's already established, it's humane. It works. We are now having the trials. I think there is not a chance that it's going to close. In the end it will remain open. Best place to be."
