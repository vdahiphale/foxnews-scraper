It's 9:00 in New York City and this \"The Five.\" We begin tonight with multiple major developing stories. First, President Trump is on Air Force One en route to Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief. But there is breaking news here on the home front. More bombshell reports about the Russia investigation. According to the New York Times in a meeting with Russian officials at the White House, President Trump called ousted FBI Director James Comey a quote, \"nut job.\"  And that has his firing relieved quote, \"great pressure on the president -- relieved great pressure on the president.\" Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee announced today that Mr. Comey has agreed to publicly testify sometime after Memorial Day. And then The Washington Post also out with a report saying senior White House adviser -- I'm sorry, a senior White House adviser is now a person of interest in the Russia probe.  Here to break all of this down for us is Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts who is already in Saudi Arabia. And before we get to that breaking news, John, since this is the first time we have had a chance to talk about it, I wonder if you could just sort of set up this trip for us and the expectations for the meeting in Saudi Arabia itself.",

He is going to be meeting with King Suleiman today, the crown prince, the deputy crown prince. One of the big days is going to be on Sunday where he will have lunch with some 50 leaders. Forty or 50 leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council. He will give a big address there on terrorism. And then he heads to Israel and if the schedule holds, Dana, it will be the very first time that he publicly announced flight has gone directly from Saudi Arabia to the Jewish state. From there he goes to Rome where he is going to meet the Pope at the Vatican and then he travels to Brussels for the NATO 7 and then he goes back to Sicily for the G7 summit.  So, he is doing five countries. Meeting about 20 leaders or chief dignitaries from a lot of different countries. So this is a very big and very ambitious first foreign trip. Most leaders, and you will remember this from George W. Bush, they either go south of the border to Mexico or they go north of the border to Canada. But the president has got a very ambitious trip for his first foray abroad -- Dana.",

But I will tell you something about Saudi Arabia. They are very happy with this president. Particularly in comparison to the last president. The reason why is because they think that he is on the same page not only with combating terrorism. But he also shares their view that Iran is an existential threat to our Arab allies in the region. So when you hear Adel al-Jubeir who is the Saudi foreign minister talk about President Trump, it is in glowing terms. And I know that our allies in Egypt and Jordan and other areas, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, they all talk about him in the same way. They are, to really put it bluntly, thrilled that he is the president and they are thrilled that he is coming here. If you go up and down the boulevards here in Riyadh, you see big posters of President Trump alongside King Suleiman. So, it's a real, red carpet welcome for the president here in Saudi Arabia -- Kimberly.",

And they want what's called the Thad missile system, it's the same one that we sent to South Korea, terminal high altitude area defense. And the necessity for it, we've shown earlier today when Houthi rebels in Yemen fired a ballistic missile towards Saudi Arabia. Anti-missiles systems here took it down about 120 miles southwest of Riyadh in the middle of unpopulated area of the desert. In terms of what it means for the United States, it's a lot of money for our defense corporations. But what Jared Kushner did was, when Saudi officials were at the White House for a meeting about this, they said that they wanted the THAAD system and he said, he was worried that they were worried about the price.  So, he called up the CEO of Lockheed right in front of them and said, hey, is there something we can do about the price here? We don't know what Lockheed is doing about the price. But we do know that Saudi Arabia wants the THAAD missile system. They want to really overhaul their entire armed forces the United States is going to help them do that with this $110 billion package -- Jesse.",

But do remember that during the transition Jared Kushner was sort of the point person for contacting foreign officials to try to build relationships so that when the inauguration happened and Donald Trump took over as president, you didn't have to start from scratch here. So, we do know that Jared Kushner talked with Russian officials. He had an in-person meeting with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States back in early December I believe it was and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was in that same meeting. So, there is nothing to say that it is Jared Kushner. There is nothing really other than this \"Washington Post\" report to say that investigators have identified a person of interest.  It's interesting though to me, Juan, that this little piece of information was dished to \"The Washington Post\" just as Robert Mueller is taking over the investigation and will kind of gobble up everything himself and he is well known for running a tight ship.

It's 9:00 in New York City and this \"The Five.\" We begin tonight with multiple major developing stories. First, President Trump is on Air Force One en route to Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip as commander-in-chief. But there is breaking news here on the home front. More bombshell reports about the Russia investigation. According to the New York Times in a meeting with Russian officials at the White House, President Trump called ousted FBI Director James Comey a quote, \"nut job.\" And that has his firing relieved quote, \"great pressure on the president -- relieved great pressure on the president.\" Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee announced today that Mr. Comey has agreed to publicly testify sometime after Memorial Day. And then The Washington Post also out with a report saying senior White House adviser -- I'm sorry, a senior White House adviser is now a person of interest in the Russia probe. Here to break all of this down for us is Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts who is already in Saudi Arabia. And before we get to that breaking news, John, since this is the first time we have had a chance to talk about it, I wonder if you could just sort of set up this trip for us and the expectations for the meeting in Saudi Arabia itself."

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "All right. So the president will arrive here at 9:50 local time. It is just 4:00 a.m. now. So, he is here about five hours and 50 minutes. He is going to be meeting with King Suleiman today, the crown prince, the deputy crown prince. One of the big days is going to be on Sunday where he will have lunch with some 50 leaders. Forty or 50 leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council. He will give a big address there on terrorism. And then he heads to Israel and if the schedule holds, Dana, it will be the very first time that he publicly announced flight has gone directly from Saudi Arabia to the Jewish state. From there he goes to Rome where he is going to meet the Pope at the Vatican and then he travels to Brussels for the NATO 7 and then he goes back to Sicily for the G7 summit. So, he is doing five countries. Meeting about 20 leaders or chief dignitaries from a lot of different countries. So this is a very big and very ambitious first foreign trip. Most leaders, and you will remember this from George W. Bush, they either go south of the border to Mexico or they go north of the border to Canada. But the president has got a very ambitious trip for his first foray abroad -- Dana."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And it's a very bold choice. And I love the concept for the trip in terms of combatting and tolerance. We're going to take it around the table here. Let's start with Kimberly Guilfoyle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "All right. Okay, John, I hope you enjoy that trip. And I'm sure it's going to be quite interesting. So, I wanted to know what level of, you know, preparation they have done with the president in light of, you know, some of the past things he said about Saudi Arabia and U.S. relationship and Clintons and Clinton Foundation to really streamline this trip so it's one that's very positive?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, the president has done a lot of research. He has had meetings for the past couple of weeks interspersed, of course, with the odd crisis here and there. But I will tell you something about Saudi Arabia. They are very happy with this president. Particularly in comparison to the last president. The reason why is because they think that he is on the same page not only with combating terrorism. But he also shares their view that Iran is an existential threat to our Arab allies in the region. So when you hear Adel al-Jubeir who is the Saudi foreign minister talk about President Trump, it is in glowing terms. And I know that our allies in Egypt and Jordan and other areas, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, they all talk about him in the same way. They are, to really put it bluntly, thrilled that he is the president and they are thrilled that he is coming here. If you go up and down the boulevards here in Riyadh, you see big posters of President Trump alongside King Suleiman. So, it's a real, red carpet welcome for the president here in Saudi Arabia -- Kimberly."

Apparently there were some controversy because Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law got involved last minute tried to knock the price down a little bit. What are the benefits for the arms deal for America and for Saudi Arabia?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "I don't necessarily think that that's controversial, Jesse. I think it really impressed Saudi leaders when they came to visit with him. And they want what's called the Thad missile system, it's the same one that we sent to South Korea, terminal high altitude area defense. And the necessity for it, we've shown earlier today when Houthi rebels in Yemen fired a ballistic missile towards Saudi Arabia. Anti-missiles systems here took it down about 120 miles southwest of Riyadh in the middle of unpopulated area of the desert. In terms of what it means for the United States, it's a lot of money for our defense corporations. But what Jared Kushner did was, when Saudi officials were at the White House for a meeting about this, they said that they wanted the THAAD system and he said, he was worried that they were worried about the price. So, he called up the CEO of Lockheed right in front of them and said, hey, is there something we can do about the price here? We don't know what Lockheed is doing about the price. But we do know that Saudi Arabia wants the THAAD missile system. They want to really overhaul their entire armed forces the United States is going to help them do that with this $110 billion package -- Jesse."

      "utterance": "Nobody knows in the United States. The Independent Newspaper and the Guardian Newspaper have identified that person as Jared Kushner. There is nothing to suggest that it is Jared Kushner. But do remember that during the transition Jared Kushner was sort of the point person for contacting foreign officials to try to build relationships so that when the inauguration happened and Donald Trump took over as president, you didn't have to start from scratch here. So, we do know that Jared Kushner talked with Russian officials. He had an in-person meeting with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States back in early December I believe it was and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was in that same meeting. So, there is nothing to say that it is Jared Kushner. There is nothing really other than this \"Washington Post\" report to say that investigators have identified a person of interest. It's interesting though to me, Juan, that this little piece of information was dished to \"The Washington Post\" just as Robert Mueller is taking over the investigation and will kind of gobble up everything himself and he is well known for running a tight ship. One that will probably be reasonably leak-proof I would think -- Juan."

This is one he should really seize especially in terms of this like, media storm around Russia and collusion and special counsel being appointed. This is an area where the president excels in terms of intrapersonal relationships. We have seen him have really great meetings with other foreign leaders thus far early in his presidency. And as John predicted, this should be when the forecast is sunny for his relationship with Saudi Arabia, which should be, you know, a key ally, especially in the fight against terror. I think it's important that his people get out, you know, the good press, the messaging on this. His communication team and those that are with him, you know, to kind of help bring back some stories to make sure they get positive, you know, play here that it's actually really covered by the press versus just some of the stuff that's going on kind of back home, domestically, you know, with the investigation. And if you noticed, there was like, as they said on the air earlier, document dump right on a Friday, a lot of information coming out just as they were leaving. And, of course, not with their phones and stuff with them but other devices, to try to get around this story. And just real quick, Dana, about Jared Kushner and, you know, the person of interest.

You want to see the president there as the commander-in-chief and, you know, putting forth the American vision to the world and selling a lot of arms to our friends. We want to make sure oil stays low. Obviously because high gas prices here in America could just shatter this guy's base. But it comes at a very troubling time. And I have been the first one to say, you know, there is a lot of smoke but I don't see any fire. But now I'm getting a little concerned. A lot of reports today out about targets and some things that were said to the Russians. And even I, myself, have gotten to the point where I'm like what is going on here with this situation? I'm a little worried about it. I still don't see any hard evidence yet. But, you know, the smoke keeps getting a little bit hotter.

Maybe it takes a guy who doesn't have a dog in this fight to deal with this. And the real issue in this whole trip is extremism. That's what this is about. And it's not Jews. And it's not Christians chopping the heads off people. So when he goes to the Saudi Arabia and he talks about extremism, it's about radical, Islamic extremism. He is a blunt salesman. Like I say he could talk a cat off a mice truck. He is -- his salesman like qualities have benefits in this regard. And that he can actually say these things and create a personal relationship. This is related to the Comey stuff. When you are a salesman, you -- the whole position is to be liked, is to create trust. And how do you create trust. You deal in these variables of gossip and tidbits of information."

This is the way a salesman talks. And a salesman has the flaw of talking too much. So Donald Trump's flaw, which is to talk too much and say these things casually and get them into some kind of superficial trouble, I believe superficial trouble which is what this Comey stuff is made, is the benefit and these situations abroad to Saudi Arabia. And the sense that he can talk to these people the way Obama didn't. Obama went and was conciliatory and didn't demand respect. But it was just so -- he came across as an academic. Trump is going over there with his head held high, as a salesman --"

Again, with a salesman, everything is a negotiation, which is why he says those things to the Russians, why he said those things to Comey about going easy on Flynn because these are what salesmen do.

And I mean that it's nice to like set it up right before the president's conversations with different religions in order to say, look, we are, we've got to fight extremism together and we can get more extreme that ISIS, the other thing, well, and al Qaeda. Which is al Qaeda 2.0 as ISIS. I think that we forget that the changes to operational procedure has given the Pentagon a lot more flexibility. So, during the Obama administration, the National Security Council like the White House really wanted to be able to sign off on every operation. And now what the Trump administration has done is said actually, no. We trust you. We're going to -- on the big stuff, yes, you will have to come to us. But in terms of these types of things, if you want to hit them hard, you have our permission to do what you feel like you need to do.

And I don't know if that's real. I don't know if that would be effective. But I would pay attention. The second thing to say is, President Trump has a history as candidate Trump of saying that Islam was a religion of violence and saying the worst things about Muslims.

We could never -- we might as well just disband the police. Because if we have the police, that will just make the criminals rob and murder and rape more because the police will upset them. If you are in a bar fight, the worst guy to be is the bouncer because you are often most restricted talking about change in procedure. America essentially is the earth's bouncer. And it's good to give us the freedom to bounce. And that means to go and to kill. And it is, it's not a short- term act. This is long-term. Terrorists are the termites of planet Earth. That means you have to go around and you have to exterminate them regularly and never forget about it. The good thing about Trump and why he is different than Obama is he is less handicapped by p.c. ideology and Islamaphobia. He doesn't conflate radical Islam hating, hating radical Islam with hating Islam. He makes a distinction which helps you to fight terror more effectively. It's called the -- I won't get into it.

But, anyway, the problem is that they don't want to cover the positive news because it doesn't fit their narrative and sort of this, you know, soldier march that they have towards this goal of impeachment. They want to just be able to focus on what it is they don't like about him because they still have this election hangover.

We talked about this on the show. It's fantastic, Greg. The left has tried to politicize the Vatican and the pontiff. And now with the Catholic church, there is a whole battle to try to do that because many feel like this is just eroding the main core values of the Catholic church. It's a fascinating read, Greg. In fact, I'm surprised you didn't write this book. But George did and he is fantastic author. So check this out."
