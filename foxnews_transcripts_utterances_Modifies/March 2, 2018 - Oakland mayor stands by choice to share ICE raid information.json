Liberals are reeling from a rave of calamities that could have serious legal consequences. Republicans are calling for a second special counsel to investigate the FBI's handling of the Clinton email probe. Congressman Devin Nunes continues to expose severe FISA abuses and former Obama officials are facing new scrutiny.  But, first, tonight, we start with the major battle raging between the Trump administration and the liberal state of California. The Department of Justice now looking into a possible obstruction of justice charge against the mayor of Oakland. This comes after the mayor alerted illegal immigrants in the California Bay Area that federal immigration authorities were preparing to conduct raids.  The acting ICE director is slamming that mayor of Oakland. Take a look.",

Being a law enforcement officer is already dangerous enough.

Now, according to ICE, 115 of the people arrested had, quote, prior felony convictions for serious or violent offenses. Now, despite these facts, the mayor of Oakland is actually defending her decision to protect and shield illegal immigrants. Here's what the mayor wrote on Twitter: I do not regret sharing this information. It is Oakland's legal right to be a sanctuary city and we have not broken any laws. We believe our community is safer when families say stay together.   President Trump also appears to be fed up with California sanctuary policies.

Congressman Devin Nunes continues to expose severe FISA abuses and former Obama officials are facing new scrutiny. But, first, tonight, we start with the major battle raging between the Trump administration and the liberal state of California. The Department of Justice now looking into a possible obstruction of justice charge against the mayor of Oakland. This comes after the mayor alerted illegal immigrants in the California Bay Area that federal immigration authorities were preparing to conduct raids.

This same IG report is also expected to get into the Clinton email investigation. This news comes on the same week that more than a dozen Republican lawmakers in the House sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions urging him to appoint a second special counsel to investigate both the FBI and the Department of Justice's handling of the Clinton and Trump-Russia probes. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz calling for a special counsel, a second special counsel. He joins us now. All right. Good evening, Congressman."

The FBI and the Department of Justice aren't going to be putting the handcuffs on themselves to lead a second special counsel just as Congressman Lee Zeldin has recommended so we can take the findings of the IG report, we can take the information we have learned in congressional hearings and actually have prosecutions because my fear is that if we don't have a second special counsel, this will turn out a lot like the Benghazi investigation where we learn a lot about facts but no one is really held accountable."

And to your point, Judge Jeanine, if we had not had congressional oversight and hearings and subpoenas, we wouldn't even know about the text messages between Pete Strzok and Lisa Page that demonstrate a substantial anti-Trump pro-Hillary bias. You mentioned Andrew McCabe earlier, his testimony before the judiciary committee in closed session showed me that Hillary Clinton was never really put in jeopardy as a result of her use of a private email server and the leaking of classified information because she had people that were running interference for her at the DOJ."

If people broke the law, they have to be held accountable, because if we just allow that to happen, then we invite that type of crime in the future. That's why the rule of law matters and now, the Clintons, they've got decades of ignoring the rule of law and never being held accountable.

Jeff Sessions is not going to do it. Jeff Sessions says, I'm getting an inspector general. Oh, we can spend another year and a half on inspector general coming up with a conclusion. The inspector general doesn't have the right to go to a grand jury and subpoena anybody. So, what is this guy doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, if Jeff Sessions does not appoint a second special counsel, then we need new attorney general, Judge, because you are absolutely right, even if we learn more horrifying things from the inspector general, we can't actually prosecute somebody for those things because we would need somebody to be able to bring that case and the Department of Justice and FBI obviously won't be bringing a case against themselves. So, Jeff Sessions needs to get rid of this mind set that dereliction of duty and he needs to do what Congress has called for and appoint a second special counsel to get to the bottom of this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

I don't know whether it was the email thing or the foundation, whatever it was. He kind of -- he gave us all hope a few months back. Nothing has happened from that either. The president doesn't appear that he is going to get rid of sessions, right? Because, you know, everybody I'm sure will have a conniption and all his senator friends will say it's a Saturday night massacre. So, I mean, does America just kind of keep moving as though it doesn't matter who violates the law?"

But because tens of thousands of Americans contacted their members of Congress and demanded transparency, we got it. And that's why the American people need to back up what Lee Zeldin and many other members of Congress are fighting for to get a second special counsel so that people are held accountable and thrown in jail for the crimes committed against the Trump administration during the transition."

And I was disappointed that the attorney general didn't seem to be very engaged on any of these issues regarding existential threats to the Trump administration. He was deferring to a team that answered to Rod Rosenstein for goodness sakes and it was Rosenstein's very signatures that reauthorized these wiretaps based on false information that the Department of Justice and FBI knew was false information. So, I think we need a more engaged attorney general."

Now, I am curious about seeing what is going to come out in this inspector general report by Michael Horowitz. He was the one who unearthed the text message exchange between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. And he does have a solid history of going after government agencies likely Fast and Furious in the ATF, which led to shakeup and leadership there, also going after the DEA and the Colombia prostitution scandal that they were involved with as well. So -- and I think depending on what he comes up with, that could be the impetus for maybe another special counsel investigation or further action there.

Wherever you look and at whomever you look, it's not only a level of corruption and collusion if you will, but blatant and sloppy and open. And we have to ask, one, this wasn't new. How long has this been going on? But then you have to ask how far through the government does it go?

But even with him trying to keep it tamped down, like with the McCabe situation, if you look to the left, you look to the right, you wake up in the morning, there is some new scandal in front of you because it's finally all coming out and can't keep it in the box."

In the James Rybicki, who was Comey's chief of staff says we found a lot of new emails. We did find new stuff but nothing that's going to change our view of the original collusion in July.

Now in a letter released yesterday, House Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes accused the FBI of violating not only its own protocol but possibly even the criminal statutes by using the Steele dossier to help obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Joining me now with more with Fox News contributor Sara Carter and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. All right, good evening. I must tell you, Gregg, and I'm going to start with you. The thing that I don't understand is why I haven't heard anything about a FISA judge, you know, calling the FBI, calling the Department of Justice into his or her chamber how dare you put this political garbage in front of me. How dare you basically obstruct real justice and commit a fraud in contempt of the court by alleging that this is a sufficient basis for surveillance."
    },

      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Maybe they did it. It is after all a secret court. But I suspect we would know about it by now if they had. And if they didn't do it, they should have done it and they are breeching their duty by failing to do it. Those judges should be demanding that the high officials at DOJ and the FBI appear before them and say, didn't -- you concealed evidence. You deceived me. You didn't tell me that this was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign. You didn't tell me that you knew that Christopher Steele was a liar. If you had told me those things, I would never have granted a warrant to surveil on an American citizen."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "So, when people say, you snow, that this is the kind of thing where the FISA court warrants are so difficult, they are 40, 50 pages and yet we hear nothing about a sanction or a lawyer is being brought up on contempt like James Comey, what in the last 90 days in addition to this dossier -- what reasonable cause have you developed that will allow me to continue on this issuing a surveillance warrant?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "They have to have probable cause. They didn't have it. And the bulk of their FISA application was based on a phony document which was unverified, which is against the law. Look, as I see it and I have studied the different felony statutes. They violated six of them, abuse of power, perjury, misleading statements, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and obstruction."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, Sara Carter, what are you hearing? I mean, you are giving us all these little tidbits and facts I should say --not little tidbits that lead us to the next discussion. What have you learned in the last 24 hours?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, two things, I want to go back to the courts, really quick. Remember that the presiding judge over the foreign intelligence surveillance court, this is the secret court, Rosemary Collyer, did send a letter to Devin Nunes and others saying, look, we don't object formerly or informally, we told you both times to releasing the applications on Carter Page. I think this is their response saying, look, we'll release those documents if the executive branch allows us and we'll get those documents out to the public. I think this is their way of objecting to what the FBI did. So we don't know what happened behind closed doors. But before the public, I think this letter was highly significant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Very significant. Sarah, hang on I want to jump to, Gregg, on this. So if the presiding judge of the FISA court says we have no objection to the release of this information, she still hedging and saying somebody else, the president..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Somebody else has to do..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "The executive branch would have to do it, that would mean essentially Jeff Sessions who is not really the attorney general. He just pretends to be one. It is Rod Rosenstein. He would never do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "How about the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Because he is trying to conceal all of the..."
    },

      "utterance": "How about the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "... illegal acts committed by the FBI and the Department of Justice. I agree. The president should instruct the attorney general to disclose this information. It is an utter myth and a canard that there is some fire wall between DOJ."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Gregg, hold on a second. If the president is agreeable, why do they just get it from the judge who is agreeable? Keep Sessions out of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Separation of powers. It would be a legal quagmire litigated for more than a year. The efficient way to do it is to get it from the source, Department of Justice and the FBI."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it is amazing that the presiding justice would say I'm ready to release this information at the FISA Court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Truly amazing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Or, Sara, the second point you were making."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "The second point is this, the Department of Justice arguing -- and I spoke to officials today. The Department of Justice is arguing one thing. They know everybody is coming down on Attorney General Jeff Sessions and what they are saying is, look, let Michael Horowitz do his job. This is his purview, this is his mandate. His mandate is over the DOJ and over the FBI. And his investigators can continue this investigation. They argue that if they bring in a special counsel, a special prosecutor, they would have to take more than likely, FBI agents to be investigators and they may be not -- they may not be able to do that because they may just be put out. They may have to reach out to the postmaster general to get investigators from there who aren't up to speed on this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "OK. So the argument is we have got to have the inspector general continue on this issue, when the inspector general has no grand jury, no ability to prosecute. We know that the inspector general has taken forever on what is he doing right now. We are still waiting. We can wait until the cows come home. But even more than that, you know, they don't have sufficient FBI agents to investigate. That's hogwash."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that they would be compromised out. That's what they are saying. That the agency, and the bureau itself..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Then go get new guys. Go get new guys."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Bring in a second special counsel has subpoena power to compel people to testify obtain documents from them with a grand jury. And can you do it very efficiently. You hire your own team of people. I know several former FBI agents who would be more than happy to return to the job to work for a new second special counsel. And get somebody in there like a Joe diGenova who is actually smart and competent, and experienced, and he would do it efficiently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what's amazing is the idea that, you know, all of these FBI agents would be compromised or conflicted and there are no other guys to do or women to do the job. Sara, last word."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "And I agree with you there, Judge. I mean, there are people within the bureau that are outstanding that are not compromised, that would be willing to do this and I think there is a lot more coming out in Michael Horowitz' I.G. report beyond what we are seeing on McCabe. I think there is going to be a lot of the eyes wide open once that report comes out and I think it will be very soon."
    },

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity. The Democrats are embroiled in several major scandals, but if you watch the mainstream media, you wouldn't know it. Instead the overwhelming focus of nearly every story from the destroy Trump press is something negative about this administration. For example, take a look at some of the coverage over just the past two days."

Chief of Staff John Kelly joked that God was punishing him by making him work at the White House. Jared Kushner has no longer has access to the top secret information. The president may be trying to push him and his wife who happens to be the president's daughter out of the White House. His closest confidante Hope Hicks is leaving. National security advisor H.R. McMaster may also be on the way out the door."

All right, do you know what I find interesting, Charlie, is the fact that on the one hand, I think it's Joe Scarborough. I think it was Scarborough he says Trump's loyalty extends only to his family and then Jake Tapper says Trump is just about ready to push out his son-in-law who happens to be the husband of his daughter. I mean, they can't even keep their stories straight as to what is going on with the president."

      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "Well, it's funny. There is an old expression, tell the truth, it's easier to remember. What's going on here is the media is almost cheering for this president to fail. Look, it just makes me so angry because this president is accomplishing over the last year is truly historic. I mean, imagine if a Democrat president had black unemployment at record low levels, black home ownership at the highest ever level, Latino unemployment lowest level, medium income is going up. The Dow hitting records every other week, the economy roaring, trillions of dollars coming back to the country, the media would be fawning over this Democrat president as the most accomplished, most stable, and wonderful president we ever had. Instead we are worrying about all of this palace intrigue that the American people don't care about. It's because the media wants him to fail. They would rather see America fail while Trump is in office than succeed. It's sick and it is wrong, and you see this nonsense happening with the media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, Gina, the truth is that, you know, here we have a president who is accomplishing so much and just what, Charlie, said is just a bit of it. To me, one of the biggest things is tax reform which is tax cuts which are reflected in people's paychecks. I mean, people can actually see this stuff. And, yet, they are so convinced that this man is the epitome of evil. Where does this come from? I mean, it's the same question we all ask over and over again. I can't comprehend it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINA LOUDON, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "You know, that's a great point, Judge. It does seem like other insanity. And every time they do this again, I think, you know what? I just want to tell them to keep it coming. Because whether or not they believe it, they are the real colluders with the Trump campaign, because every time the media goes after him again, the American public knows the more apoplectic the media, the more you know Trump is on the right path and doing great things to make America great again. And, Charlie, mentioned many of them but the strides he has made for women, the Supreme Court, there are so many things that are seeking. And even moving, I believe, voting blocks that have been traditionally Democrat. I think we are going to see some massive shifts there from the rust belt to the blue wall. You know, I think some union people are going to be and obviously multiple ethnicities are going to be taking a look at how this president has changed their lives. They may be reconsidering what the media is telling them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, Charlie, this conspiracy to influence the election, nothing has come up in the last 18 months. You know, all we here is that Donald Jr. had a meeting based on a friend asking him to meet with someone. It lasted 20 minutes and Donald Trump Jr. just, you know, said thanks so much, goodbye. And now it's like a federal offense. It is absurd. And I think the American people see this for what it is. And the American people are going to react. It's almost as though New York and California are the parentheses around middle America and they are like -- they are nuts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "That's right. I call it destination journalism. The media is trying to create a story that is not there. They are trying to write the story backwards with the headline on top and fill in the word and make up the facts. And what you are talking about what happened with Don Jr., he took a single meeting with zero follow-up that has triggered an absolute catastrophe of legal fees and hearings, and totally unnecessary behavior from Congress. I don't understand why the House Republicans are continuing with this. It doesn't make any sense. It's not constructive for the country. And final thing is this, you are right, the American people sick of this. They want results. They want tax cuts. They think keep them forward. They wanted infrastructure bill. They don't want the continuation of this political witch-hunt. And look, if anyone colluded with Russia, it was Hillary Clinton that sold our uranium to the Russians."
