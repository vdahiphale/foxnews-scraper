      "sentences": "The president is speaking in a rally right now in the State of Missouri. We're keeping a close eye on what he's saying. There's a lot of news going on. And if the President responds to any of it, of course, we'll bring that to you right away. Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One of the stories we're following, there is a new deadline for Brett Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Ford, to respond to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her attorneys, this, according to the Chairman of the committee, have less than two hours from right now to respond and explain when and where she will testify.  If they don't, the vote will be held on Monday. Obviously, we're monitoring that.  The other big story tonight, a blockbuster actually, the New York Times dropped a remarkable allegation today about the number two man in the Department of Justice, the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein.  According to the paper, in the spring of 2017, in the middle of a meeting, Rosenstein proposed secretly recording the President in an effort, apparently, to expose chaos for the Administration and to discredit it. The Times also says that Rosenstein talked about recruiting members of the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the President from office in a kind of internal coup. Rosenstein has denied this story. But almost nobody in Washington seems to believe him.  That's not surprising. Rosenstein is not a particularly popular person here. He's also a permanent federal bureaucrat, a group that has been working to undermine the President since the inauguration, so those are two strikes against him. But none of that means the story is true. Before you decide whether it is, consider where it came from and why it was published now. The piece seems to be based on notes that FBI employees Lisa Page and Andy McCabe typed up after meeting with Rosenstein.  Only McCabe's notes mention anything about the 25th Amendment. He is obviously the core source for this story. So, if it's a question of deciding between Rod Rosenstein and Andy McCabe, who are you going to believe? It's not a great choice admittedly. But it's also not a close call.   McCabe was fired from the FBI for leaking and then lying about it. Federal prosecutors are looking now at the evidence. McCabe could soon be indicted for that. He has every incentive to want to see the President impeached. How could he get the President impeached? Well he might start by leaking this story to a reporter called Adam Goldman at the New York Times, reporter whom his co-workers believe he's been leaking to for a long time. He'd do that knowing that the story might cause the President to fire Rod Rosenstein. Democrats have long argued that firing Rosenstein would constitute obstruction of justice. That's an impeachable offense.   Come November assuming - assuming they take the House, Democrats will be in a position to do that to file impeachment charges. Even if they don't impeach, the story would doubtless drive the President crazy, and so division within the White House. Perfect. A punji stick placed right in Trump's path. Is that what actually happened? We can't say for sure what happened. But if you were laying a trap for Donald Trump this might be exactly how you do it. Before moving forward, the President might ask himself, \"Why do Andy McCabe and the New York Times want me to fire Rod Rosenstein? And why do they want me to do it now rather than a year ago?\" When your enemies give you political advice, it's worth asking questions like that.  Fox Correspondent Kristin Fisher has been following all today's news and she joins us tonight in the studio.",

      "sentences": "--even for those of us that follow it. So just to bring all of you up to speed let's start at the very beginning because this all started with that New York Times report claiming that the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had contemplated secretly recording the President at a meeting with top DOJ officials in May of 2017.  Remember, that's right after President Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey. While citing anonymous sources, The Times also claims that Rosenstein discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office.  Well in response to all of this, Rosenstein put out a statement saying \"The New York Times' story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. But let me be clear about this. Based on my personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\" So, Rosenstein calls the story inaccurate but you'll note he doesn't categorically deny it. And that's likely or could be because according to our Justice producer, Jake Gibson, who spoke with a DOJ official who was in that room during the meeting, Rosenstein did say something like that but he was joking.  He was allegedly in the middle of a heated exchange with then acting FBI Director, Andrew McCabe. The source says and this is a direct quote. \"The statement about secretly recording the President was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the President.\"   As you might imagine, already some Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill are worried that this could lead to the Deputy Attorney General's firing. But so far tonight, at least publicly, the White House is not weighing in, Tucker.",

If that's true, and I think it is, then no one at DOJ could call Andy McCabe a liar without invalidating the case.

The main debate is over timing of the next Kavanaugh hearing. You know the basic facts about it. According to the schedule most of us assumed it was real two weeks ago, the Senate should have already voted on the nomination by now, and Kavanaugh almost certainly would have been confirmed. He had the numbers. And then the wrinkle, Democrats leaked the name of Christine Ford to the press. Ford alleges that sometime back in high school about 36 years ago, Kavanaugh jumped on her at a party and groped her over her clothes.   She's provided very few details including when and where it allegedly happened. Kavanaugh has indeed - denied the story entirely and so is the other person Ford said was present, a man named Mark Judge. That's pretty much what we know. In order to know more, we're going to need to hear from Christine Ford. Both sides once agreed on that because it's obvious. She should have a chance to speak. Everyone thought that was a good idea. It was a consensus view. Republicans in the Senate asked Ford to testify this week. She refused. They offered to send in a staffer to her house in California to take her testimony privately, and she refused that too. Finally, they asked her to testify this coming Monday. She has said she won't but she will not explain why she won't. Ford's lawyers are now saying she's willing to explain herself in the Senate next Thursday.  Thursday is a significant date in this story. Because of Senate rules, which are complex, if Ford testifies next Thursday, the vote on Kavanaugh will be pushed back at least another week. In this environment that very likely means forever. His nomination will be over, so will any Trump nomination to the court. There is a time before the mid-terms for the White House to introduce and vet a new candidate. Democrats will have prevented the Administration from filling this vacancy. We'll have just eight justices for the foreseeable future and probably until there's another Democratic president.  You may have voted for Trump in the hope you would put reasonable people on the Supreme Court but tough. If this testimony is delayed until Thursday, that's likely not going to happen. So, that's what's at stake over this timing question. What's amazing is that almost nobody on television is telling you that. They're still pretending this is all a matter of protecting Christine Ford's feelings or civil rights or something to that effect. Watch.",

This is about political power and how it is apportioned in Washington. In the process of trying to regain that power, one party is corroding our legal norms and threatening our system of impartial justice. In our system, individuals do not get to dictate the terms of investigations. You can't just say you don't feel like participating. Why don't you try that? Try it the next time you get someone for jury duty or told to appear on small claims court, blow off a speeding ticket and see what happens. You can't do that because the Justice Department isn't just about you. It's about all of us. In this case, Brett Kavanaugh could sit on the court that shapes the lives of 330 million other people. And so, the rest of us have a right to know exactly what Christine Ford is alleging here. Now, the operatives posing as her defenders claim that Ford was so traumatized by an event that supposedly happened in 1982 that rules cannot apply to her. That's many things. It's also patronizing. Democrats are treating a middle-aged woman like a child. Ford is not a child. She's an adult. She has a family, an advanced degree, a high-level job. She's accused a public figure of a sex crime, a felony and she's done it in vague terms. She's now part of an effort to destroy that public figure's life wittingly or not. She needs to explain herself or allow the country to move on. Now, if there's one good thing about this spectacle it's that it has drawn the usual cave dwellers from their holes and forced them to expose themselves in the light of day as the buffoons they are.  For example, here's Joe Biden explaining why Ford cannot be asked to explain her own allegations. Keep in mind that Biden was thinking about running for president next year.

I asked Google if there was any company-wide memo sent out to let employees know that brainstorming ways to alter the platform in favor of their own political biases was not OK, but Google says, \"They didn't.\" They also tell me they didn't reprimand any of the employees on the email chain that exposed an effort to use their roles at the company for their own political activism.

      "utterance": "The president is speaking in a rally right now in the State of Missouri. We're keeping a close eye on what he's saying. There's a lot of news going on. And if the President responds to any of it, of course, we'll bring that to you right away. Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One of the stories we're following, there is a new deadline for Brett Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Ford, to respond to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her attorneys, this, according to the Chairman of the committee, have less than two hours from right now to respond and explain when and where she will testify. If they don't, the vote will be held on Monday. Obviously, we're monitoring that. The other big story tonight, a blockbuster actually, the New York Times dropped a remarkable allegation today about the number two man in the Department of Justice, the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. According to the paper, in the spring of 2017, in the middle of a meeting, Rosenstein proposed secretly recording the President in an effort, apparently, to expose chaos for the Administration and to discredit it. The Times also says that Rosenstein talked about recruiting members of the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the President from office in a kind of internal coup. Rosenstein has denied this story. But almost nobody in Washington seems to believe him. That's not surprising. Rosenstein is not a particularly popular person here. He's also a permanent federal bureaucrat, a group that has been working to undermine the President since the inauguration, so those are two strikes against him. But none of that means the story is true. Before you decide whether it is, consider where it came from and why it was published now. The piece seems to be based on notes that FBI employees Lisa Page and Andy McCabe typed up after meeting with Rosenstein. Only McCabe's notes mention anything about the 25th Amendment. He is obviously the core source for this story. So, if it's a question of deciding between Rod Rosenstein and Andy McCabe, who are you going to believe? It's not a great choice admittedly. But it's also not a close call. McCabe was fired from the FBI for leaking and then lying about it. Federal prosecutors are looking now at the evidence. McCabe could soon be indicted for that. He has every incentive to want to see the President impeached. How could he get the President impeached? Well he might start by leaking this story to a reporter called Adam Goldman at the New York Times, reporter whom his co-workers believe he's been leaking to for a long time. He'd do that knowing that the story might cause the President to fire Rod Rosenstein. Democrats have long argued that firing Rosenstein would constitute obstruction of justice. That's an impeachable offense. Come November assuming - assuming they take the House, Democrats will be in a position to do that to file impeachment charges. Even if they don't impeach, the story would doubtless drive the President crazy, and so division within the White House. Perfect. A punji stick placed right in Trump's path. Is that what actually happened? We can't say for sure what happened. But if you were laying a trap for Donald Trump this might be exactly how you do it. Before moving forward, the President might ask himself, \"Why do Andy McCabe and the New York Times want me to fire Rod Rosenstein? And why do they want me to do it now rather than a year ago?\" When your enemies give you political advice, it's worth asking questions like that. Fox Correspondent Kristin Fisher has been following all today's news and she joins us tonight in the studio."

Remember, that's right after President Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey. While citing anonymous sources, The Times also claims that Rosenstein discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office. Well in response to all of this, Rosenstein put out a statement saying \"The New York Times' story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. But let me be clear about this. Based on my personal dealings with the President, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\" So, Rosenstein calls the story inaccurate but you'll note he doesn't categorically deny it. And that's likely or could be because according to our Justice producer, Jake Gibson, who spoke with a DOJ official who was in that room during the meeting, Rosenstein did say something like that but he was joking. He was allegedly in the middle of a heated exchange with then acting FBI Director, Andrew McCabe. The source says and this is a direct quote. \"The statement about secretly recording the President was sarcastic and was never discussed with any intention of recording a conversation with the President.\" As you might imagine, already some Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill are worried that this could lead to the Deputy Attorney General's firing. But so far tonight, at least publicly, the White House is not weighing in, Tucker."

The secret society didn't really exist. This is just sarcasm. When you're talking about taping the President and when they said we'll - no we'll stop him, they didn't mean they'd stop Donald Trump. They meant that America would rise to its greatest virtues. So, I guess we can either believe the lying Department of Justice or our lying eyes."

So, Andy McCabe apparently is under investigation by the U.S. Attorney in D.C. based on that IG report from DOJ that said that he leaked and lied about it, so he could be indicted. If that's true, and I think it is, then no one at DOJ could call Andy McCabe a liar without invalidating the case. In other words, the prosecutor can't call the person he's charging a liar before the case or a judge will throw it out, so maybe they can't actually deny this for that reason."

      "utterance": "That was the President, just moments ago, speaking at a rally in Missouri addressing the chaos around the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation. And there is, in fact, a lot of it. The main debate is over timing of the next Kavanaugh hearing. You know the basic facts about it. According to the schedule most of us assumed it was real two weeks ago, the Senate should have already voted on the nomination by now, and Kavanaugh almost certainly would have been confirmed. He had the numbers. And then the wrinkle, Democrats leaked the name of Christine Ford to the press. Ford alleges that sometime back in high school about 36 years ago, Kavanaugh jumped on her at a party and groped her over her clothes. She's provided very few details including when and where it allegedly happened. Kavanaugh has indeed - denied the story entirely and so is the other person Ford said was present, a man named Mark Judge. That's pretty much what we know. In order to know more, we're going to need to hear from Christine Ford. Both sides once agreed on that because it's obvious. She should have a chance to speak. Everyone thought that was a good idea. It was a consensus view. Republicans in the Senate asked Ford to testify this week. She refused. They offered to send in a staffer to her house in California to take her testimony privately, and she refused that too. Finally, they asked her to testify this coming Monday. She has said she won't but she will not explain why she won't. Ford's lawyers are now saying she's willing to explain herself in the Senate next Thursday. Thursday is a significant date in this story. Because of Senate rules, which are complex, if Ford testifies next Thursday, the vote on Kavanaugh will be pushed back at least another week. In this environment that very likely means forever. His nomination will be over, so will any Trump nomination to the court. There is a time before the mid-terms for the White House to introduce and vet a new candidate. Democrats will have prevented the Administration from filling this vacancy. We'll have just eight justices for the foreseeable future and probably until there's another Democratic president. You may have voted for Trump in the hope you would put reasonable people on the Supreme Court but tough. If this testimony is delayed until Thursday, that's likely not going to happen. So, that's what's at stake over this timing question. What's amazing is that almost nobody on television is telling you that. They're still pretending this is all a matter of protecting Christine Ford's feelings or civil rights or something to that effect. Watch."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Now, we mean no disrespect to Christine Ford here, and we have shown her none. This show has given her every benefit of every doubt. We have assumed and we still assume she believes everything she has said. But this is absurd. Whether she intended to be or not, Ford is now at the center of a partisan effort that has nothing to do with sexual abuse or protecting women or the details for that matter of a high school party close to 40 years ago. This is about political power and how it is apportioned in Washington. In the process of trying to regain that power, one party is corroding our legal norms and threatening our system of impartial justice. In our system, individuals do not get to dictate the terms of investigations. You can't just say you don't feel like participating. Why don't you try that? Try it the next time you get someone for jury duty or told to appear on small claims court, blow off a speeding ticket and see what happens. You can't do that because the Justice Department isn't just about you. It's about all of us. In this case, Brett Kavanaugh could sit on the court that shapes the lives of 330 million other people. And so, the rest of us have a right to know exactly what Christine Ford is alleging here. Now, the operatives posing as her defenders claim that Ford was so traumatized by an event that supposedly happened in 1982 that rules cannot apply to her. That's many things. It's also patronizing. Democrats are treating a middle-aged woman like a child. Ford is not a child. She's an adult. She has a family, an advanced degree, a high-level job. She's accused a public figure of a sex crime, a felony and she's done it in vague terms. She's now part of an effort to destroy that public figure's life wittingly or not. She needs to explain herself or allow the country to move on. Now, if there's one good thing about this spectacle it's that it has drawn the usual cave dwellers from their holes and forced them to expose themselves in the light of day as the buffoons they are. For example, here's Joe Biden explaining why Ford cannot be asked to explain her own allegations. Keep in mind that Biden was thinking about running for president next year.

We are not going to have a hearing and a vote on a nominee for the Supreme Court in a presidential election year. And he held to that. He was - well he was ridiculed by the Left. But think about how risky that was, Tucker, because President Trump was not a sure win. Most people thought Hillary Clinton was going to win. But because Mitch McConnell held strong, he was able to allow President Trump this opportunity not only to get Neil Gorsuch on this - on the bench but also to have this opportunity to nominate a second justice and that would be Brett Kavanaugh, if he's confirmed. This morning, Mitch McConnell said the Value Voters there, \"Don't worry. Don't get rattled. Judge Kavanaugh will be a Supreme Court Justice soon.\" And I do think that if we - if it does get down to just the raw politics of this then I think that the Republicans would be smart to go ahead and call the vote."

Meanwhile in Minnesota, a Star Tribune poll finds that only 5 percent of Democrats believe accusations against DNC Vice Chair Keith Ellison despite much greater and far more detailed evidence against him. Beverly Hallberg is President of media - District Media Group and she joins us tonight. Beverly, I'm confused.

But Google is saying they aren't taking any action because no changes were actually made to the platform, even though employees were caught crafting plans that, if enforced, would have violated Google's own standards. I asked Google if there was any company-wide memo sent out to let employees know that brainstorming ways to alter the platform in favor of their own political biases was not OK, but Google says, \"They didn't.\" They also tell me they didn't reprimand any of the employees on the email chain that exposed an effort to use their roles at the company for their own political activism. We're also learning more information about Mackenzie Thomas, the Search Product Marketing Manager that suggested that Google quote actively counter search results for words that she says are prejudiced and was Islamophobic like the words Muslim or Mexico.

It comes out October 12th. And nobody would put it out there. Nobody would distribute it. So, we finally found distribution. So, two years ago we finished the film. Now, we can tell the story. And it's - it's because it deals with abortion. We couldn't even buy ad time on NPR because we called him an abortion doctor. We had to call him just a doctor. So, nobody wants--"

I'm not worried about if it has rip up - repercussion on my - on my job or my hiring. It should never do that to tell stories. And we're telling a true story. This happened.

So much going on, at least two huge stories, both of which will bleed into next week, Rod Rosenstein accused of trying to foment a coup against his boss, the President of the United States, and Brett Kavanaugh, his nomination still hanging, we're not sure by a thread, by something. We'll be on it Monday. Have the best weekend. \"Hannity\" is next. See you then. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
