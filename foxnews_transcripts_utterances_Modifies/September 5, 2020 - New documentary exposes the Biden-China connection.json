There's a campaign to program you. You're being told not to trust what you see with your own eyes. If you hear something, you're told you didn't actually hear that. If you feel something, you're shamed into not trusting your instincts.  It's actually deeper than the typical lie. It's more sophisticated than that. Let me show you how it works and why it's happening.  For the entire summer, Joe Biden ignored the most destructive rioting the country has seen in 50 years. Biden and his pals in the Press counted on this energy to carry him to victory in November.  So besides FOX, national TV stations didn't show video of the rioting, looting and shooting. When they referenced it. They called it mostly peaceful. But local news showed it every night. It went viral on social media, and the people who live in the path of destruction experienced it firsthand.  Joe Biden didn't say a word about this until CNN told him it was hurting his chance of winning.",

Biden hadn't visited Wisconsin in two years and when he showed up, nobody was there to greet him.   They tell you that Biden is winning, but where are his voters? Biden spoke at a Church, but they were only about eight people there. Earlier in the week, he spoke in Pennsylvania, and there were zero voters there, just six members of the media, who agreed not to ask him questions. They're pretending something is out there that you can't see.  Back to Wisconsin. He was socially distanced, so why is he wearing a mask? Isn't Biden being tested? He's running on a pandemic that's fading, so he needs to keep up appearances, doesn't he?   If Biden wears a mask at all times, even when he doesn't have to, you would think the pandemic is worse than it is? Listen to what he told them mostly black audience.",

A few big chains got looted, but they can just write that off and don't bat an eye. So the large multinational corporation sponsored Black Lives Matter, put out statements of support and donated to their cause, while Black Lives Matter activists and Antifa burned their lone competitors to a crisp -- small businesses -- who Big Business have tried to put out of business for decades, and now, they have in many cities.   The Democrat mayors and governors didn't stop middle class small businesses from being torched. They pulled their police back and refused to let Trump send in the Guard. Something very sinister is going on here. Mister Middle Class Joe didn't tell anyone to knock it off until it was too late. Joe Biden from the State of Delaware where all of the multinational corporations are incorporated for tax purposes, obviously.

David Brooks in \"The New York Times\" is preparing the country for a Civil War. \"Trump says he won't let Democrats steal the election and declares himself reelected.

But this is not just rank and file corruption that we've gotten used to. This is not the Chinese takeout version of typical corruption because in addition to the Biden's making money, Jesse, what happened is, Hunter Biden entered into a business partnership. He was on the Board of Directors of a Chinese investment firm called BHR that was funded by the Chinese government and what did they do? They started acquiring companies that were beneficial to the Chinese military. They were an anchor investor in something called China General Nuclear, which ended up being charged by our F.B.I. for stealing nuclear secrets in the United States. They ended up buying part of an American dual-use technology company, meaning it produces technology that has civilian and military application. They ended up buying that for the benefit of the Chinese military. So this is not a corruption case of let's say victimless crime where it's just some politician's kid getting rich. This has very real national security implications, and the Bidens were prepared and willing to make money, even if it damaged our military posture vis-a-vis the Chinese who are our chief rivals on the global stage.",

There's a campaign to program you. You're being told not to trust what you see with your own eyes. If you hear something, you're told you didn't actually hear that. If you feel something, you're shamed into not trusting your instincts. It's actually deeper than the typical lie. It's more sophisticated than that. Let me show you how it works and why it's happening. For the entire summer, Joe Biden ignored the most destructive rioting the country has seen in 50 years. Biden and his pals in the Press counted on this energy to carry him to victory in November. So besides FOX, national TV stations didn't show video of the rioting, looting and shooting. When they referenced it. They called it mostly peaceful. But local news showed it every night. It went viral on social media, and the people who live in the path of destruction experienced it firsthand. Joe Biden didn't say a word about this until CNN told him it was hurting his chance of winning."

Trump had already visited Wisconsin to tour the damage, so Biden followed in the President's footsteps. Biden hadn't visited Wisconsin in two years and when he showed up, nobody was there to greet him. They tell you that Biden is winning, but where are his voters? Biden spoke at a Church, but they were only about eight people there. Earlier in the week, he spoke in Pennsylvania, and there were zero voters there, just six members of the media, who agreed not to ask him questions. They're pretending something is out there that you can't see. Back to Wisconsin. He was socially distanced, so why is he wearing a mask? Isn't Biden being tested? He's running on a pandemic that's fading, so he needs to keep up appearances, doesn't he? If Biden wears a mask at all times, even when he doesn't have to, you would think the pandemic is worse than it is? Listen to what he told them mostly black audience."

A few big chains got looted, but they can just write that off and don't bat an eye. So the large multinational corporation sponsored Black Lives Matter, put out statements of support and donated to their cause, while Black Lives Matter activists and Antifa burned their lone competitors to a crisp -- small businesses -- who Big Business have tried to put out of business for decades, and now, they have in many cities. The Democrat mayors and governors didn't stop middle class small businesses from being torched. They pulled their police back and refused to let Trump send in the Guard. Something very sinister is going on here. Mister Middle Class Joe didn't tell anyone to knock it off until it was too late.

Facebook is refusing to run political ads the last week of the election, and will censor Trump online if he declares victory on Election Night. Remember, Hillary told Joe not to concede, so Joe won't, because he is a puppet. David Brooks in \"The New York Times\" is preparing the country for a Civil War. \"Trump says he won't let Democrats steal the election and declares himself reelected. Who's going to stop him?\" If Trump claims a victory that is not rightly his, a few marches in the streets will not be an adequate response. It's time to start thinking about what you would do.

Twenty four Democrat city Councils have voted to defund the police. Joe Biden himself said he wanted to redirect funding. Kamala Harris praised the LA Mayor for defunding the police. Why are Biden and Harris for defunding the police and bailing out rioters? Why would they send cash to bail out rioters if these were Trump rioters? If Biden cares so much about Black Lives, why didn't he say a word about 50 people getting shot in Chicago last weekend? It doesn't make sense because it's just a naked power grab.

And then if you really don't like violent rhetoric, if you don't like it, play again what Cuomo said, that's not an insult to Donald Trump. That's an insult to himself that he cannot run a state where a democratically elected President would be safe.

When you look at past the election, you look at the night of November 3rd, and you see the President having enough states or having enough votes and making the call, even if the media doesn't call these states, he sees the numbers. They won't call these states for the President, they will say that we've got to count the ballots, they're coming in late. Every vote must be counted. They sue, they extend. And then when the rules kick in that says, you guys have to have a deadline here.

And if he is not elected, they don't need to worry about him adversely possessing the White House. It's a really tough job. I'm shocked at any people of good conscience want to pursue the presidency right now. It's a terrible job. If he doesn't win, he'll be gone.

We've been through some really tough times as a country. I think you put your finger on it, and I'm not even going to ruin it. It's a really smart election strategy to bang the media. I'm not ever running for office again, it's just fun for me. It's not an election strategy. It's just fun. Our society needs a referee. We need an arbiter. We need someone who is neutral. But you go look at Politico and \"The Hill\" and \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post,\" and 90 something percent of their coverage is not an insult to Donald Trump, it's an insult to the people that support him and they can't figure that out.

Joining me now Nancy Grace, the host of \"Crime Stories\" on Fox Nation. Nancy, I didn't know, but usually the people that abduct these children, not strangers, usually family members or extended family members. Tell us a little bit about this trafficking scene. NANCY GRACE, HOST \"CRIME STORIES,\" FOX NATION: Well, let me tell you this, the motivation is money. According to the International Labor Organization, 25 million trafficking victims right now across the world, and according to the Lichtenstein Initiative, there is about $150 billion profit. So that's the motivation. It's happening everywhere you look. Hey, Jesse, have you ever driven by and seen a big billboard for a massage parlor?"

And the jobs will keep them for instance at an apartment where there will be three, five, ten of them in there and they will be beaten brutally if they try to escape. They don't have cell phones, and they are tucked away as being a \"runaway.\" That's when I hear runaway, the hair on the back of my neck goes up because so many of them are not runaways. They're being child sex trafficked."

All right, Peter, this is based on corporate records, financial documents, legal briefings and court papers. This is not conjecture. This is what you found and you can substantiate. What are the main headlines from your research that you can see in this documentary?"

    {
      "speaker": "PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the main headlines, Jesse are these: that the Bidens made a lot of money, courtesy of the Chinese government. We're not talking about Chinese businesses -- the Chinese government. This happened while Joe Biden was the point person on Obama administration policy towards China. But this is not just rank and file corruption that we've gotten used to. This is not the Chinese takeout version of typical corruption because in addition to the Biden's making money, Jesse, what happened is, Hunter Biden entered into a business partnership. He was on the Board of Directors of a Chinese investment firm called BHR that was funded by the Chinese government and what did they do? They started acquiring companies that were beneficial to the Chinese military. They were an anchor investor in something called China General Nuclear, which ended up being charged by our F.B.I. for stealing nuclear secrets in the United States. They ended up buying part of an American dual-use technology company, meaning it produces technology that has civilian and military application. They ended up buying that for the benefit of the Chinese military. So this is not a corruption case of let's say victimless crime where it's just some politician's kid getting rich. This has very real national security implications, and the Bidens were prepared and willing to make money, even if it damaged our military posture vis-a-vis the Chinese who are our chief rivals on the global stage."
