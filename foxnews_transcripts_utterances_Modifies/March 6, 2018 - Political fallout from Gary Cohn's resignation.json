Here's part what it read \"It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform. I am grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the Administration great success in the future.\" On the heels of that we have a statement from the president as well that reads the following, \"Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again. He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.\"  All of that news breaking just about one hour again. Let's bring in our panel: Michael Needham, chief executive officer at Heritage Action for America; Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report, and Eli Lake, columnist for Bloomberg View. Good evening. We had a different topic prepared for you but this is the topic of the hour, let's say. Michael, your reaction?",

Gary Cohn has been someone who has assembled a fantastic team inside the White House. They've had tremendous accomplishments on behalf of the president. You look at the tax cut which was historic, the regulatory rollback. Today the Senate is moving forward with the rollback of Dodd-Frank, getting at that which attacks America's equity markets.  And so Gary Cohn has been there at the president's side with a remarkable record of economic success. It's important for the president to continue doing that and not roll that back with things like tariffs or some of the other policies that we've seen talked about in recent days.",

I had actually penned a letter of resignation but I'm going to stick with this administration. But I disagree with the way that the president reacted to it, saying there is violence on both sides. And now obviously we've known for a long time the tariff issue was one that divided the president's economic team. He has been on the side of arguing against more tariffs or any tariffs at all. So that's not particularly surprising to see that he is on the other side of it. I agree that it's surprising that it was today. But I think we all knew whoever won the war on tariffs was going to ultimately going to stay in and who lost was ultimately going to leave.",

A lot of their prices are going to go up. And Gary Cohn comes from Goldman Sachs. That is something that is in some ways both left and right and neither left nor right, and it represents the center of American politics. This is a significant blow. And in some way I think it does show a fracture of American politics in a deep way. And the fact that so many Republicans in Congress and a lot of Democrats too in Congress are really uncomfortable with the tariff policy, and we'll see how far it can go.

Congress, 535 people all of whom have different ambitions and different things that they are worried about needs an executive branch that is sitting there saying this is what the team is doing.

But a lot of people, that is not how they like to work. And it is also a very difficult way to push strategy. All Republicans on the Hill want to talk about right now, tax cuts and the economy, period. They don't want to talk about tariffs.
