He says he welcomes it being about him. But his actions show differently. He knows if he's out there and he's driving news media and his voters get engaged, that makes red state Democrats very nervous because it just -- it doesn't even have to be the majority of the Trump voters come out in those red states, then the senate Democrats that are up for reelection will lose.",

I do think that he's going negative on Ted Cruz very late. He has not been negative all along in this campaign. Had a very positive campaign, and then he decides late that he has to go negative. He's not running a lot of negative ads against Ted Cruz, and so I think that those polls are probably correct. Now, the Democrats have registered a lot of new voters in Texas. So it will probably be closer than people think and that might give the Democrats some hope that they can turn Texas more blue in the future. The other thing I would say is we are quickly moving from the persuasion phase of this campaign. People are locked in. Their opinions are there.

Spinney been behind Big Bird and Oscar since 1969, so it's almost 50 years, folks. And he was one of the original puppeteers on \"Sesame Street.\" He's been on almost -- he's been on most of the 4,400 episodes. Spinney stopped doing puppeteering in 2015, limiting himself to the voice of Big Bird and Oscar. So, you know, I was thinking about this, and I concluded, Carroll Spinney's not as well-known as Mr. Rogers.

I mean, I've been to Mexico as a guest of the state department to talk about threats again journalists. You see this in Turkey. You see this throughout much of the world. We know about Vladimir Putin's attitude.  But when the President of the United States who should be standing up for Democratic values, for press freedom, freedom of dissent, says that the press in his country is the enemy of the people, perpetrating fake news, I think it does empower the autocrats elsewhere to say, well, it's just like the United States.

The president loves the press, Morgan. I mean, he courts them like fanatically. He just did an interview with Bloomberg, A.P., Fox News, and \"60 Minutes\" within a week -- and FBN.  And he's feeding them all the time. He loves the press detail."

And, in fact, when the president first came out -- when this story first came out about Khashoggi, one of the first things the president said was he mentioned how it really was upsetting that he was a journalist and that this happened to him. I think what you're seeing going on here in this specific case with the Saudis is that there's a lot going on behind the scenes. The country team in these embassies and these consulates, they're working together. You know, we have legal attaches in all of these consulates and all of these embassies working with other three-letter agencies that are getting to the bottom of this. And I think the president is trying to give space to our government and to the Turkish and Saudi governments to figure out what actually goes on and hold people accountable."

So, you're saying -- basically what he's decided that he's going to flood the zone and nobody else can get on television unless they're talking about him and talking about him in some way that would be derogatory because that would actually get them headlines. So I think that is what's happening. He has said in one of those interviews he doesn't necessarily think the midterms are a referendum on him. He has said otherwise in the past. He says he welcomes it being about him. But his actions show differently. He knows if he's out there and he's driving news media and his voters get engaged, that makes red state Democrats very nervous because it just -- it doesn't even have to be the majority of the Trump voters come out in those red states, then the senate Democrats that are up for reelection will lose."

There's a million threads. You could pull any of them that you want to. My point is that he's just consuming all the oxygen and that by tomorrow morning, there will be another outrage that they can talk about."

It has the same faces doing the same thing. It's almost like it's scripted for another show. And Mika is really -- God love her, but she's the definition of stupidity because she's eternally shocked by something that the rest of America is used to and shrugs off. For example, it's like going to get Indian food and complaining that it's spicy. It'd be like going to see a Tarantino film and when you leave go, my God, that was violent.

There's a professor who brought up a really good way to describe this, the difference between the media and the people who voted for Trump. The media obsesses over the peripheral, that means words, manner, and style. The people that voted for Trump can tolerate all that because they focus on the substance which is jobs, economy, peace, you're looking at peace in the Koreas, the Supreme Court. You're looking at the world's most competitive economy this year. Beat out Singapore.  Meanwhile, you have Ben Rhodes."

His naive arrogance gave us Trump because they've created a foreign policy that sent, you know, our leaders around saying we're sorry, and then we have a leader that gets elected that says no, we're not. So there's direct linkage between that. Lastly, Lemon has no right to talk about anything given the fact that he basically snickered throughout the -- a segment mocking Kanye's mental health and calling him a bunch of disgusting names. And he said that Trump could use a mirror. I'm sure Lemon must have a hundred of them at home. He could loaned him."

So everyone is talking about Beto's race, $40 million in the last quarter, but what's interesting to me as I look today, and he actually has spent an unprecedented amount. So he's spent 29 million in the race. So he's spending about $3 to raise $4. So we know he's behind in the polls. When I'm looking at the numbers it looks like he's blowing through his money. It is an impressive amount raise but an impressive amount spent. Is this just a lot of pomp and circumstance for this guy to run as president or vice-president?"

      "speaker": "PERINO",

You've got an excited base around you. So he might say in the end, the last laugh might be on all of us because if he ends up figuring out a way to turn this into a national race. I do think that he's going negative on Ted Cruz very late. He has not been negative all along in this campaign. Had a very positive campaign, and then he decides late that he has to go negative. He's not running a lot of negative ads against Ted Cruz, and so I think that those polls are probably correct. Now, the Democrats have registered a lot of new voters in Texas. So it will probably be closer than people think and that might give the Democrats some hope that they can turn Texas more blue in the future. The other thing I would say is we are quickly moving from the persuasion phase of this campaign. People are locked in. Their opinions are there. These debates are coming a little bit late in the cycle. We're now moving to get out the vote phase. So all these extra money that they have, they have to spend on trying to get voters to the polls."

I have family in Texas who are watching The Five right now, and they are not happy about anyone saying that they want to demolish ICE."

But it's clearly it's a situation where Republicans have had to send in, not only additional money, but the president, you know, and suddenly all of the Republican senate campaign committee has been sending more people down to support Ted Cruz.  And in last night debate, well, you point to the fact that he called him lying Ted. I'm with Dana on this. I think that he has really withheld a lot of the negativity, the harsh attacks in this campaign. He's run a very, you know, I think quite right standing, diligent campaign. But last night when it came to something so big, I think the Republicans, which is the tax cut, boy, Cruz couldn't say a word. All Cruz could say was, I know we've blown up the deficit and I said way back that the deficit is terrible. But now, I think it's not because of the tax cuts. I think that they don't properly -- he was lost and I was surprised. I thought he would have a stronger position on something that has been so important that the Republicans thought would be something they could run on this campaign.  The question is what is Cruz running on except that he is a Republican at this point in Texas?"

Donald Trump is consuming so much media airtime and it's -- traditionally it has been kind of chaotic and a lot of gaffes and a lot of scrambling around, but it's all positive stuff.

But they're actually -- the fringe elements of the party are against it. And I think what we see now is the fringe elements of the Democrat Party, it's now become mainstream policy as it relates to immigration. And this is where I think it will be interesting to see if any deal does get done on the border wall. Lindsey Graham said on \"FOX & Friends\" a couple of days ago that he thinks there should just be a street DACA deal for wall funding. So potentially, you might see that after the midterms.

I read some of the stories today about some of the caravan people that have joined up. I don't doubt that they have a very desperate situation at home, but the fact that they are being whipped up into a frenzy by leftists who are trying to get them here and to try to make a political point, because I bet they're making some money on the side, it's disgusting what they're doing to those people. Getting into a caravan is a really dangerous thing. Several of the children have had to go to the hospital when they get to a checkpoint, because they are dehydrated; they're exhausted.

Perhaps what Pelosi would prefer is to refer to the wall, instead as a belt, a belt. And instead of immigration detention centers, that could be a migrant purse. It could be all about accessorizing, Nancy, because apparently that's all women understand, are belts and purses but not safety and security. You are a sexist. It's disgusting. As for the caravan, I've been watching the media describe this, and they keep saying, \"The caravan is on its way to America. It's heading to our border.\" They conveniently leave out something in between called Mexico, right? OK? The fact is, if you are desperately running from a killer, you don't run by one escape hatch to one that's further away. If you are truly desperate, you stop in the nearest safety zone.

And now comes news that the man behind Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, he's saying farewell too. You know those characters, but you may not know the puppeteer and voice behind them belongs to Carroll Spinney. Take a look at this video of Mr. Spinney bringing Big Bird to life. Spinney been behind Big Bird and Oscar since 1969, so it's almost 50 years, folks. And he was one of the original puppeteers on \"Sesame Street.\" He's been on almost -- he's been on most of the 4,400 episodes. Spinney stopped doing puppeteering in 2015, limiting himself to the voice of Big Bird and Oscar. So, you know, I was thinking about this, and I concluded, Carroll Spinney's not as well-known as Mr. Rogers. But for several generations of American children, he has Rogers' impact, teaching young people how to listen to each other with a big heart. So have a great retirement, Mr. Spinney."
