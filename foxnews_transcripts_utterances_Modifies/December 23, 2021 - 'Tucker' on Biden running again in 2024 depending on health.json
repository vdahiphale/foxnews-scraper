Joe Biden just raised the possibility of not running for re-election it was a truly bizarre answer more on that in a moment, but first. It didn't take long for Democrats across the country to join Joe Biden's crusade against unvaccinated Americans. Just days after the White House told unvaccinated Americans they were facing a winter of quote \"severe illness and death\" Democratic mayors across the country took steps to ban them from society. In Washington, D.C, Mayor Muriel Bowser just announced a city-wide vaccine mandate for indoor spaces. Muriel Bowser didn't explain how getting a Joe Biden approved vaccine would make D.C. residents safer or prevent them from getting COVID. Because Muriel Bowser like her fellow Democrats doesn't have to explain. They still think it is March 2020. They still pretend the vaccines present transmission and they can believe those things because they make the rules, you obey them. It also doesn't matter that Washington, D.C. is a city that is nearly 70 percent fully vaccinated or that city officials have acknowledged hospitals and deaths are not increasing along with new cases. Washington, D.C. residents will now have to be vaccinated if they want to live normally and participate in society, but the shot isn't enough, they'll have to wear masks, too.",

So why are Democrats insistent on punishing people who won't get the jab? Well according to his holiness, Anthony Fauci, it is because of the quote \"raging omicron variant.\" But thankfully, we have data from South Africa where omicron was first discovered, so we don't have to listen to Anthony Fauci. According to a brand new study from that country, omicron has an 80 percent lower risk of hospitalization than past COVID variants. South Africa's hospitalization rate even fell by 91 percent during the omicron wave and less than two percent of all COVID positive South Africans were hospitalized. That is compared to 19 percent of COVID positive South Africans who were hospitalized in the third delta variant wave. Health officials in South Africa also added that the low hospitalization number is also inflated because even mild COVID cases are now being admitted to hospitals since they have the capacity that they didn't have before.

I mean, you touched on it and this is just -- this is what it comes down to, I think, is that we know now that the vaccine does not stop the spread of COVID and even the people who were selling it one way are now basically admitting that. So, if it doesn't stop the spread of COVID, then these vaccine mandates make no rational sense at all, even leaving aside the constitutional and moral problems, if you can leave that aside which obviously the powers that be have, well it doesn't make any rational sense, because no matter if you're vaccinated or not, we are all a bunch of unclean super spreaders it turns out. So you know, they told us early in the pandemic they kept saying and they say now even that we're all in this together and we know that it is bogus in the way that they mean it, but it turns out that in a certain sense, it's true, we are all in this together and that we can all spread COVID and that's why, it just doesn't make any sense to be segregating people like this.

Look, I think that the deviation that we are witnessing from science by the Biden administration, by the F.D.A. and by the C.D.C. from the science is frankly on par with the Intelligence failure at Pearl Harbor, and I'll tell you why. Look, what's going on with this vaccine and with the virus is that we need immunity on an individual basis to fight it. Now, the pathway to that immunity could be vaccination. I mean, you know look, the vaccine that was developed by Operation Warp Speed is extremely effective at mounting IgG responses in prime T cells and in fact, it could be used as the dominant pathway by un-immune people. There's also natural immunity, which the Biden administration has completely ignored, but really, you know what they've ignored and this is frankly from a scientific perspective deplorable. They've ignored immunity and frankly, it's the gold standard for every other viral infection that we deal with to check for antibodies. We've known about this. You know, look, I've communicated directly with Dr. Woodcock and multiple different folks at the level of the companies and Pfizer, Dr. Bill Gruber, Dr. Albert Bourla, Dr. Woodcock herself. She has acknowledged this. You know, I think that it's absolutely -- it's a catastrophic failure in intelligence, the scientific intelligence for us not to have focused sufficiently on assessing immunity. These are quite simple tests. Right now, we have the Defense Production Act plugged into these screening tests, which I think are important obviously. You want to know if you're positive, but really the key is if the President of the United States wants to bring peace of mind to everyday Americans, we should have been and we should be focusing on checking immunity levels. This is not something that is out of this world. Again, I've repeated this with, Tucker, and I'll repeat it with you is that we put a Rover on Mars. We are a technologically sophisticated country, we are able to do quite sophisticated things and the fact that we're failing to actually provide everyday Americans with an understanding of how immune they are is again, it's a catastrophic intelligence failure that's being led at the present by the President of the United States. Really, what should be happening is that the Defense Production Act should be getting plugged into corporations like LabCorp and Quest. We have some very high level medical device companies that within the span of a week or several months could come up with these home tests for antibodies and we could really let people know what their level of susceptibility is. Look, these screening tests that we're wasting taxpayer dollars on right now with the Defense Production Act are frankly null and void in two seconds.

We never saw any of that. We know he has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to problems. We know that he had aneurysms clipped years -- surgically repaired years ago which can lead to problems. We know that he loses his train of thought. We know that he snaps at people, we've seen that occur. All of that has us nervous and I have to tell you, we don't need nervousness right now, right?

Joe Biden just raised the possibility of not running for re-election it was a truly bizarre answer more on that in a moment, but first. It didn't take long for Democrats across the country to join Joe Biden's crusade against unvaccinated Americans. Just days after the White House told unvaccinated Americans they were facing a winter of quote \"severe illness and death\" Democratic mayors across the country took steps to ban them from society. In Washington, D.C, Mayor Muriel Bowser just announced a city-wide vaccine mandate for indoor spaces. Muriel Bowser didn't explain how getting a Joe Biden approved vaccine would make D.C. residents safer or prevent them from getting COVID. Because Muriel Bowser like her fellow Democrats doesn't have to explain. They still think it is March 2020. They still pretend the vaccines present transmission and they can believe those things because they make the rules, you obey them. It also doesn't matter that Washington, D.C. is a city that is nearly 70 percent fully vaccinated or that city officials have acknowledged hospitals and deaths are not increasing along with new cases. Washington, D.C. residents will now have to be vaccinated if they want to live normally and participate in society, but the shot isn't enough, they'll have to wear masks, too."

To put it simply, if you have been living without having a vaccination, it's time for a change. If you wish to live life as normally as possible with the ease to do the things that you love, you must be vaccinated in the City of Chicago starting January 3rd. This Health Order may pose an inconvenience to the unvaccinated and in fact is, it is inconvenient by design."

She didn't explain how vaccine passports stopped the spread of COVID, but she did say that if you hold your breath while entering a coffee shop just to pick up your order, you don't have to show proof of vaccination, even if you touch the door or come within six feet of another person. However, if you try to take a bite out of your muffin, well, that's not allowed."

So why are Democrats insistent on punishing people who won't get the jab? Well according to his holiness, Anthony Fauci, it is because of the quote \"raging omicron variant.\" But thankfully, we have data from South Africa where omicron was first discovered, so we don't have to listen to Anthony Fauci. According to a brand new study from that country, omicron has an 80 percent lower risk of hospitalization than past COVID variants. South Africa's hospitalization rate even fell by 91 percent during the omicron wave and less than two percent of all COVID positive South Africans were hospitalized. That is compared to 19 percent of COVID positive South Africans who were hospitalized in the third delta variant wave. Health officials in South Africa also added that the low hospitalization number is also inflated because even mild COVID cases are now being admitted to hospitals since they have the capacity that they didn't have before. Here is one doctor explaining how mild the omicron variant is."

The people in charge refuse to recognize that COVID is here to stay, so instead, they double down, more masks, more vaccines. It is highly effective, you need to take it every three months for all of eternity. Fail to comply and they'll crush you. Matt Walsh is the host of \"The Matt Walsh Show\" and he joins us now. A muffin mandate, Matt in the windy city. What's going to happen next? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, well, that is what the science says that if you're eating a pastry, there is a greater probability of spreading COVID. I guess that is just science. I mean, you touched on it and this is just -- this is what it comes down to, I think, is that we know now that the vaccine does not stop the spread of COVID and even the people who were selling it one way are now basically admitting that. So, if it doesn't stop the spread of COVID, then these vaccine mandates make no rational sense at all, even leaving aside the constitutional and moral problems, if you can leave that aside which obviously the powers that be have, well it doesn't make any rational sense, because no matter if you're vaccinated or not, we are all a bunch of unclean super spreaders it turns out. So you know, they told us early in the pandemic they kept saying and they say now even that we're all in this together and we know that it is bogus in the way that they mean it, but it turns out that in a certain sense, it's true, we are all in this together and that we can all spread COVID and that's why, it just doesn't make any sense to be segregating people like this. The risk is basically the same for everyone it turns out."

I look at the numbers in New York, I look at them in Chicago, I look them at them in D.C. These are these are cities with a combined population of over 10 million people, and I can count on my hand maybe sometimes, some days I need to use my toes the number of COVID deaths combined in these cities. It's minuscule. I mean, more people are dying from heart disease and car accidents, yet they've turned all of our lives completely upside down to stop something that is honestly right now unstoppable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALSH",
      "utterance": "Yes, and this is good news like there are people who don't want the good news with COVID and I should probably tell you something, it's good news that this omicron variant is according to all the data is very, very mild. It is a cold is what it is, okay. Omicron is a cold. For all intents and purposes, it's a cold that the primary symptoms are like runny nose, night sweats, that sort of thing. It is unpleasant to have, we've all had colds, that's what it is, and that's - - If this is now the dominant strain in our country and it's going to become the dominant strain across the world, that's a good thing. I mean, sign me up, considering we're going to have COVID forever. COVID is always going to be with us as you point out. If this becomes a dominant strain, I'm like, sign me up for that one. If I have to get COVID. If I have to get some kind of COVID, which we all will get it if we haven't yet, then that's a good thing. This should be considered sort of like the endgame of the pandemic when it becomes just an endemic basically, you know a head cold. But the powers that be, of course, they don't want that because for them, this is all about control and they can't use it to control us anymore if it becomes this sort of mild situation."

Look, I think that the deviation that we are witnessing from science by the Biden administration, by the F.D.A. and by the C.D.C. from the science is frankly on par with the Intelligence failure at Pearl Harbor, and I'll tell you why. Look, what's going on with this vaccine and with the virus is that we need immunity on an individual basis to fight it. Now, the pathway to that immunity could be vaccination. I mean, you know look, the vaccine that was developed by Operation Warp Speed is extremely effective at mounting IgG responses in prime T cells and in fact, it could be used as the dominant pathway by un-immune people. There's also natural immunity, which the Biden administration has completely ignored, but really, you know what they've ignored and this is frankly from a scientific perspective deplorable. They've ignored immunity and frankly, it's the gold standard for every other viral infection that we deal with to check for antibodies. We've known about this. You know, look, I've communicated directly with Dr. Woodcock and multiple different folks at the level of the companies and Pfizer, Dr. Bill Gruber, Dr. Albert Bourla, Dr. Woodcock herself. She has acknowledged this. You know, I think that it's absolutely -- it's a catastrophic failure in intelligence, the scientific intelligence for us not to have focused sufficiently on assessing immunity. These are quite simple tests. Right now, we have the Defense Production Act plugged into these screening tests, which I think are important obviously. You want to know if you're positive, but really the key is if the President of the United States wants to bring peace of mind to everyday Americans, we should have been and we should be focusing on checking immunity levels. This is not something that is out of this world. Again, I've repeated this with, Tucker, and I'll repeat it with you is that we put a Rover on Mars. We are a technologically sophisticated country, we are able to do quite sophisticated things and the fact that we're failing to actually provide everyday Americans with an understanding of how immune they are is again, it's a catastrophic intelligence failure that's being led at the present by the President of the United States. Really, what should be happening is that the Defense Production Act should be getting plugged into corporations like LabCorp and Quest. We have some very high level medical device companies that within the span of a week or several months could come up with these home tests for antibodies and we could really let people know what their level of susceptibility is. Look, these screening tests that we're wasting taxpayer dollars on right now with the Defense Production Act are frankly null and void in two seconds. Literally you can get your test done at the super-spreader testing center and then go next door and get a cup of coffee and catch the virus."

And if the President of the United States really wants to bring peace and comfort to Americans instead of you know, shoving these draconian mandates down everyone's throats and you know cutting people out of society, what we should be doing on an individual level -- and we can do this, this is not out of this world, Jesse -- we should be checking for immunity."

You always hear the President or a candidate say of course, I'm in good health. Of course, I'm going to run. Now I'm not his physician, I've never examined him, but that is certainly eyebrow raising for a physician. Now we have seen a recent report from his physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, which was for the most part flying colors except for one thing. It showed a stiff gait that he didn't have a year ago and that is eyebrow raising and that led to a neurological evaluation, except for one thing, we never saw the MRI and we never saw the nerve conduction studies, and we never saw the cognitive testing. We never saw any of that. We know he has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to problems. We know that he had aneurysms clipped years -- surgically repaired years ago which can lead to problems. We know that he loses his train of thought. We know that he snaps at people, we've seen that occur. All of that has us nervous and I have to tell you, we don't need nervousness right now, right? We need strong leadership and courage in a time that we're going through right now, decisiveness."

Now, I don't know that he had an MRI of the brain or the spine, but he probably should have, and I don't know what the neurological test showed, but there are several conditions that he might have that could lead to that stiff gait. I want to know as a physician. I would be certain that they would have to fully disclose it to the patient, to the President, but we don't want to know -- what we don't want to know is if or maybe because he's going to be in his 80s as Kevin was saying. You know, he is already 79 years old. We've already had health scares going on right now with his coughing every time we see him coughing. I mean, granted, he tested negative for COVID-19 today, but sometimes he coughs with that mask off and he is standing there at the microphone thinking that he can talk into the microphone with the mask off then the mask goes on then it goes off again. I mean, you've been talking to me about that, Jesse. I think that we need a sense of good health. Now some of the good health was definitely seen in that physical exam he had, but not entirely and I don't want to say there was a smoke screen there, but I am curious about some of the tests I didn't see, not even a mental status examination, not a cognitive test in sight."

What is happening? And the reason you say what is happening is because you're saying, I've seen crazy stuff, but I've never seen anything on this level. It doesn't seem -- I can't account for it. This isn't your incompetence, right? If we had a President or a fake President who is just a total idiot, he wouldn't be able to push forward this level of chaos and insanity, so it can't just be incompetence. What is it? Are there -- is there a handful of billionaire, you know, cabalists who are leading this? What is happening? But most people know, clearly, this is unprecedented. Anybody who has been alive in America, I mean 1968 and the madness of that, that doesn't quite compare to this. So people are saying what is going on and at the bottom of it and this is what I was saying when I wrote the book, I wasn't thinking about this, but at the bottom of it ultimately, the book starts with a quote from Solzhenitsyn's famous quote. He said, when the horrors were unleashed by the Bolsheviks, old Russian people said that all these things that are happening now, how did they happen? They've happened because man has forgotten God. You realize that at the end of the day, there are two world views. If you're an American you get this better than anybody. One is that there is a God who loves us, who wants us to be free, who wants us to govern ourselves, to have the most limited government, the most freedom and you need God and you need virtue. You can't force virtue, so there's the conundrum at the heart of American self-government, but that's the best system for quote-unquote \"human flourishing.\" And at the other end of the spectrum, the most government power, whether it's -- you know Marxism of any kind, whether it's the CCP today or whether it's the Nazis or whatever, or whether it's North Korea, the only thing that threatens their power and their ability to crush people and treat them as slaves is people who believe in something beyond the state."

One of the ways they do this is by infiltrating American colleges and universities, and then paying professors who work at them. Just yesterday, a Harvard Professor named Charles Lieber was just found guilty on all counts for hiding his ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Gordon Chang is a Gatestone Institute senior fellow and he joins us now. So, how did this all go down?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GORDON CHANG, SENIOR FELLOW, GATESTONE INSTITUTE",

So they got him on pretty minor accounts, six of them, basically, income tax evasion, failing to report. Now, that's a good thing. But the problem is, he's not going to get very much time in Federal Prison, if anytime at all. So what we really need to do is have Congress increase the penalties for crimes that relate to China, because every time someone commits a crime for China, that's a stab on the heart of America."

      "utterance": "Well, Lieber wasn't, but they do target a lot of Chinese-Americans and they do that because they can pressure relatives back in China or they can appeal to patriotism. They've done that often. But you know, with someone like Charles Lieber, it could be sex, it could be money, and once they get the first time Charles Lieber takes money, then they've got him because then Lieber knows that he is vulnerable to being disclosed. So there's all sorts of things. You know, you look at, for instance, Fang Fang, the Ministry of State Security agent at the heart of the Swalwell matter. That is a very simple way to turn an American."

It just has to be a little bit of money because then what happens is, they know they've committed a crime. They know they're vulnerable to blackmail and extortion, and therefore, we start to see more and more information being leaked out. So it doesn't take very much, Jesse, to deter an American like this. And remember, Xiaodong Zhang (ph) that Harvard academic that Tucker talked about? That guy said, look, every American can be bought and Beijing is doing its best to prove that proposition."

      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "That's certainly right. And we've got to remember that China's National Intelligence law of 2017 requires every Chinese national to commit espionage if the authorities demand it. Also in the Communist Party's top down system, nobody can resist the demand from the party. So I think we have a legitimate interest in looking at Chinese nationals, because China has actually profiled them for us. It's not we're doing the profiling. It's Beijing doing it."

Well, when you eat just a plain cricket, well, it has a bit of an almond flavor, it really isn't very good. It's up to certain chefs to make those things taste good, and they really do taste good.

So eating these creepy crawlies is really good. You've got high protein, high calcium, high iron -- there's good things for it. It's this weird stigma of eating them and even myself as a wildlife biologist and explorer, I have a hard time shoving bugs in my mouth, believe it or not, but once you do get used to it, it's really a great way to get protein and it is good for the planet."

I'm -- I don't think it is the cure all and end all to world hunger or cure all to all our problems.
