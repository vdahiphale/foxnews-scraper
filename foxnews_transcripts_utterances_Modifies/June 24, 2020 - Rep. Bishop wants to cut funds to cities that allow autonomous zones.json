North Carolina Congressman Dan Bishop is one of them. He joins us now from Charlotte.  Congressman, even Seattle’s mayor now realizes that her so-called summer of love, which is the way she originally described this CHOP zone in Seattle, was a terrible way to describe it, and that they have to go now and somehow remove those occupiers of that section of the city.  So, it seems like even those who used to support these autonomous zones, or at least allow them to be, are pulling back from that stance. Am I wrong?",
