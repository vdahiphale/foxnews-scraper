When you have Senator Thune, you know, from South Dakota, he goes, you know, I never really knew him, but now I get a chance to knew him because you treat him so unfairly it makes people double down.

And ultimately you got Ambassador Sondland, I think probably the strongest witness the Democrats could put up, ultimately saying under cross-examination, I never heard the president link aid and investigations. I assume that I presume that I didn't hear it. So, again, where's the evidence of any wrongdoing, any criminality? In the absence of that, people are going to say, look, I don't see any reason he ought to be impeached. If that's the definition of a cult, I guess that's a cult."

Little by little, he lost, he's -- down 60 votes in the Senate. Then he lost the Senate. Then he lost the House. Then he wins reelection by smearing Mitt Romney, not by running on his record. Got great personal presence. You know that. He's got great charisma. Nobody doubts that, talented, wonderful story. But he never talked about that. Then he loses both chambers and he loses the White House. And people say, well, he left a hero. Not really. He left carnage."

And one thing with the media, I think they do themselves a lot of good and they maybe build up their credibility a little bit. If they weren't 100 percent negative or, according to Harvard, I think it's like 96 percent negative."

He apparently did not want older girls at all, which is interesting. He -- the way the girls were instructed is when they came to see him they had to say they were over 18, like that's going to matter. And you know, now we have a lot of the girls; they're grown up.

I think what they said was, one, Epstein has already taken care of some of these girls, so they're not going to talk. Secondly, you're not going to be able to prove some of them were ever in his house, and the ones you can prove, we feel we're going to eviscerate them on the witness stand."

I mean, this story is ama -- that's why I wrote the book, because the story is so incredible. And we had most of them and we had, you know, investigations of the president. We had Acosta, we had interviews, you know, police interviews with the girls. We had most of it there. Obviously, we didn't know that Epstein would supply the perfect ending by killing himself.

And I'm so big on trying to get kids reading and having the parents and grandparents interact. So we've got an Alex Cross. And in this book, one of the things that happens is that Alex has to try to save Ali, his son, who gets in some trouble. And Ali Cross, Ali, who's 11, 12 years old, who's watched his father and his stepmother as police people and one of his friends is missing, so he applies some of what he's learned from his father and goes out looking for this missing friend, which I -- and I love that idea and these books came out at the same time.

One person even climbed on one of the trains. And here in New York City they stopped traffic in the heart of Times Square; they tied themselves to a boat.
