Negotiations continue as the Republicans scramble to settle on a plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare. With the impatient President Trump tweeting Friday, \"If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date.\" What are the main obstacles of an agreement and what are the consequences for the GOP if they fail to pass a bill?  Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; editorial board member, Joe Rago; and columnist, Bill McGurn. Joe, you're fated to cover this for us.

Look, I think one of the issues, Medicaid is a great sort of crucible for this. And what's missing is the president on this. He has tweeted. I think he has done some good things. Had some Senators in. But what this really calls out for is like an Oval Office address where you address these myths. As this is happening, the Democrats are putting out that the Republicans are cutting Medicaid rather than cutting the growth and so forth. And it would be very helpful for the president to give an address on what the Republicans want to do, why they do, and explain it. That's supposed to be his strength."

In a unanimous decision, the justices also agreed to review a series of lower court rulings blocking the implementation of the March executive order, which temporarily bars entry to the U.S. by nationals of six Muslim-majority nations. Oral arguments in the case are set for the fall, setting up a Supreme Court showdown over presidential power. Attorney David Rifkin served in the White House and in the Justice Department under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Welcome, David. Good to see you. DAVID RIFKIN, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY & MEDIA COMMENTATOR: Good to be with you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "Because of the lower courts, district courts and two courts of appeal, the Fourth and the Ninth, have fundamentally deviated from the established Supreme Court case law that distinguishes between the extent of judicial engagement in domestic affairs, where the courts pay some deference to the executive but, basically, scrutinize, particularly, in situations where there's alleged violations of fundamental constitutional rights."

Judiciary doesn't have the expertise nor the ability to really do very much there. So this basically pushes the pendulum back to where the law should be. Let me emphasize, this is way beyond this executive order, Paul. The framework that those lower courts have adopted would fundamentally destroy the ability of the presidency to carry out foreign policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "I want to get -- OK, I want to get into that. But let's --this is a really interesting opinion because it was unanimous in order to reinstate the policy, at least until they can hear the merits in the autumn. Why do you think -- how much do you read in, how much significance do you read into the fact that it was unanimous?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "Quite a bit. Not too be too harsh, but what the courts of appeal have done is utterly aberrational. They have paid scant regard to the Supreme Court case. In a way, it was a challenge not only to the presidency, because, as you know, Paul, I believe there is a, quote, \"resistance\" portion of the federal judiciary, which is bad enough, politicized judicial making, but it also was an implicit challenge to the Supreme Court. Remember, Article III is a hierarchal entity. The Supreme Court sets the tune and the lower courts are supposed to follow the music, so to speak."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And you're saying that there are plenty of Supreme Court precedents that have said that on matters of national security, courts must defer to the political branches, in particular, when those political branches, the Congress and the president, are united behind a policy. And you are saying that the lower branches here, the Fourth and the Ninth Circuit, the lower courts, really just ran roughshod over this, in part, because they don't like this president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "They don't like this president. And they have done it in a way that was most disingenuous. As I said, they paid no attention to the Supreme Court precedent. And it's just not a matter of deference. What's important here is this, and this transcends immigration. The same logic could be applied to the decision to use drones, the decision to impose economic sanctions, frankly, decisions to use military force. Once the executive indicates clearly and it's legitimate, bona fide reason why it's doing something, this is it. The judiciary takes it on board. There is no balancing type of analysis that you invariably see in domestic affairs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. And you think that the lower courts were so out of line, that they should have reinstated -- the Supreme Court should have reinstated the whole injunction -- I mean, barred, rather, the whole injunction. Should have allowed it to proceed, the travel ban. Yet, they did say that the travel ban -- they did overrule the travel ban in certain narrow cases of individuals who have ties to American families, the families in America, or institutions, such as a college or university where you have been accepted for admission. And, yet, there was a dissent on that from three justices. What do you make of that disagreement?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "I, frankly, think, Paul, it's a slight disagreement. I think the chief justice has accepted this fairly narrow category of people who will come in. Again, this is not about policy equity, Paul. This is about the Constitution at the highest level."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "Getting nine justices on board is perfectly fine. As far as the exceptions the Supreme Court exercised own equitable discretion. What's important to underscore for the viewers, if the lower courts were right, nobody could be stopped under this executive order. The very fact that the vast majority of the people are going to be stopped now for a duration underscores how thoroughly they have taken this off the table. The legal theories. Again, what troubles me the most are not the policy consequences, frankly, of stopping this ban. But the legal consequences of eviscerating established case law, which says, again, in foreign affairs, political branches reign supreme."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "You don't want justices meddling, making -- second guessing decisions on the executive. They don't have the expertise or knowledge to do so. But I want to ask you about what to expect in the fall when the justices address this on the merits. You could go for a 9-0 decision. We know the chief justice likes those kinds of decisions. But would he have to make too many concessions to the get the liberals on board? And would you prefer a 5-4 split that makes a really thunderous ruling on behalf of presidential power?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "That latter, Paul. Because, again, the policy stakes here, in my opinion, are quite minor. I think speaking with a clear voice, some chastisement, in a measured fashion, and articulation of the proper paradigm for judicial engagement in this area is absolutely essential. This was a reasonable compromise to get nine on board for the stay. When we get to the merits, oral argument coming, I think the first week of October, look, I hope we're going to get nine perfect decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RIFKIN",
      "utterance": "But probably not. So, 6-3, 5-4 would be wonderful. This would not be the time to pull punches. And by the way, as you point out in your editorial, I have no doubt that the left is going to put serious pressure on the chief justice, the way they have done with ObamaCare, for example. So it's very important to keep up the countervailing pressure as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right. Thank you, David Rifkin. When we come back, the Supreme Court wraps up its term with a big victory for religious liberty. We'll take a closer look at this week's ruling and what it says about the court's newest justice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "The Supreme Court wrapped up its term this week with a big win for religious liberty. In a closely watched case, the justices ruled, 7-2, that Missouri acted improperly when it denied public funds to a Lutheran church seeking assistance from a state program providing grants for playground improvements. We're back with Dan Henninger. Wall Street Journal columnist, Bill McGurn; and editorial page features editor, James Taranto, also join us. Bill, so how big a victory was this for religious freedom?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "I think it's a big victory. I said before, in medieval times they debated angels on pinheads. Today, we debate whether a playground that's Lutheran can qualify for funds. I will say I don't think these are the biggest religious liberty cases, because it's about funding or the previous case in the Supreme Court that was 9-0 about running their own business. Where it's really going to clash are the cases that they are going to take, like the cake baker case from Colorado."

This is somebody who feels very comfortable with the text of statutes, knows that that that's how he interprets statutes. Goes to the text, and then is -- so it's not, I'm going to make it up as I go. You know -- he knows what he is doing in looking at these cases.

He aligned himself with Justice Thomas, on what Bill was talking about, a more forceful, vigorous defense of the free expression of religion.

And it's going to take a bit of thought and consideration to figure out which is which. So I do think the day-after problem is enormous. I think there are things that are -- there are aspects of a strategy, such as safe zones, or I call them protection zones. There are enclaves that have been in place really since 2012 that we can fortify. But we do not want to do to do, essentially, what we did in Iraq, which is, we take the country away from a terrible ruler, such as Saddam Hussain, and end up giving the -- having that rebound to the benefit of Iran, which is trying to establish a new empire, a Shia crescent in the Middle East."

And the Russians want an ally that they can say we helped survive, and you give us a couple of military bases and a port. But it isn't clear that any of that is in the United States' interest. And how do we stop that from happening. Because those forces on the ground are going to keep pressing that?

Because if they do, they will look for any champion, including a champion like ISIS. We haven't mentioned al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is very strong. It hasn't gotten media attention.

He is going to accelerate the creation of pipelines. He's going to have a re-think of nuclear policy, more permitting for new coal mines.

You've got this liquified natural gas, building these terminals. That gas is being produced through, you know, through the fracking revolution, this new way of tapping into -- horizontal drilling, tapping into natural gas reservoirs underneath the ground.

After the 1960s, after the switch in -- the shift in the strategy to gaining political clout, a lot of those trends stalled, slowed, even retrogressed.

      "utterance": "So was the break from a policy and intellectual point of view, in the 1960's, you had the great success of the civil rights movement. You had the smashing of Jim Crow. You had the Voting Rights Act. You had the Civil Rights Act. And the empowerment of millions, tens of millions of black Americans because of that. But then the focus shifted away from things where it should have shifted. The focus then become economic empowerment, economic growth, and things like education opportunities."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes. And that's what was happening before, and that's what was working before in closing these racial gaps. When that strategy was abandoned, or when the emphasis shifted, that is when - again, we talk a lot about the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, Paul. We don't talk a lot about the legacy of the welfare state."

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "It's been extremely destructive. And can you look at case studies in places like Atlanta where, in the 1970s and '80s, black mayors, like Maynard Jackson and Andrew Young, came in and they gave black city contractors special permissions and catered to affirmative action policies and set-asides for minority contractors and so forth. The black poor lost ground in this period. In this age of more black political empowerment, the black poor have lost ground economically, both in absolute terms and relative to the white poor. So the strategy is not working. We ought to revisit it."

      "utterance": "Paul, a miss this week to one of America's worst-governed states, Illinois. How bad is the tax-and-spend crisis? The state has $14.6 billion in unpaid bills. This is to hospitals, dentists, airports, universities. Governor Bruce Rauner and the Democratic legislator are locked in a battle over unfunded pension liabilities. But, boy, what a mess."

      "utterance": "This is a miss to the European Court of Human Rights, which this week order 10-month-old Charlie Gard to be taken off life support. Charlie was terminally ill, but this was not a question of resources. His parents had raised more than a million pounds, British pounds, to pay for experimental treatment in America. The court not only said that he couldn't go but they said his parents couldn't even take him home to die. The court said that's a decision for the government to make, not the parents."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Big hit for the Czech parliament. You know that, in Europe, gun control is an article of faith, never mind that it didn't stop these bloody attacks in Paris. The Czech parliament, the lower House, has passed a provision altering the constitution to allow for gun ownership. So they are going up against this. And it looks like it will pass their upper House. Good message to the terrorists: You attack someone in a Czech -- in Prague --"
