We see anger, some righteous, but a lot of it right now is frankly riotous and out-of-control. Lockdowns from COVID have put 40 million Americans now out of work and millions of others have been locked into their homes for weeks. You had a racially charged situation like the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, and sadly, you have all the ingredients for a combustible night or two or three. Now, we're covering this story throughout the hour from the law enforcement veterans that we trust, local Minnesota politicians, business owners to Raymond Arroyo, who we will break down the media's handling of all of this. But we begin tonight in Minneapolis, a city that finds itself under a very tenuous curfew at this moment.  Fox's Mike Tobin is on the ground in Minne (ph) tonight with the latest.

Riots have broken out tonight, including outside CNN's headquarters, which was just breached by a protester.

      "sentences": "Yes. Several blocks away from where all the mayhem is unfolding, this is something I've never seen in Atlanta. I've lived in this town on and off since the early 1980s. This is a city that prides itself on its civil rights legacy. After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, it was one of the few large cities that, instead of having riots, had a peaceful demonstration. Black people, white people locking arms and marching in solidarity. When incendiary things happen, the people protest. The police here generally give the - they have a tradition of giving the protesters some space, allowing a certain degree of civil disobedience. Then when it gets to be a little too much, they express what the limits are and the protesters get back in line and go where they're supposed to be. Clearly, that did not happen today.  This is something I have never seen in Atlanta. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is trying to appeal to that peaceful Atlanta tradition, that tradition of peaceful protest, calling on these demonstrators to stop doing damage, to stop vandalizing, because this is just not what we do in Atlanta, appealing to that.  She assembled a gathering of religious leaders, civil rights leaders, rap artists, members of the hip-hop community to appeal to the protesters to be peaceful, to get their point across in more effective ways than doing this violence. But how you get your point across by attacking CNN, by attacking a journalistic organization - I don't know what the strategy is - by tearing up your own city. I don't know what the strategy is or if there was no strategy. Lot of people trying to figure out why now, why is Atlanta erupting this way like it has not in the past while you did have that high-profile case down in South Georgia, a black man fatally shot and killed. Initially, the men involved were not charged until the tape of that went public, and then you have the situation in Minneapolis. And then, add that to COVID-19. Peopled cooped up in their houses wanting to get out. Perhaps it was a perfect storm. Talking about the civil rights legacy, one of those civil rights leaders - longtime civil rights leaders is Andrew Young, Former Atlanta Mayor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations. He tweeted this evening, \"Tonight and tomorrow night, we have to round up the reasonable young people who are part of that group and let them know that they have made their point and now they hurt their cause.\"   Back to you.",

We had explosions, we had glass shattered, we had projectiles thrown at the police, we had the police then throwing - sending teargases into the crowd. Again, for people who are just tuning in, we have a night of disturbance across the United States and a lot of people are very, very concerned about law and order throughout the country, and the peace of mind of those who are truly, truly worried about the civil rights movements, race relations, and on top of everything else, our health and our economy.  But now, I'm going to get on to how I was going to originally start the show. Courting chaos. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Heartache and anger over George Floyd's killing run deep. And it should, for his family, his community, and the entire country. And the pain was made even worse though last night when protest turned to horrendous violence in Minneapolis and then it spiraled across the United States. And of course, you're seeing that tonight. Now, George Floyd didn't deserve to die. And the innocent Americans around the very place where Floyd died, they didn't deserve to lose their dreams either.",

We all know that. But what we're seeing break out across America, it's only going to make everything worse. There is absolutely zero chance that rioting or looting or destroying the good people's businesses or homes or properties that's going to result in a better life for anyone, especially African Americans. Now, if history is any guide, rioting leads to what? It ends up leading to stronger law enforcement, longer jail sentences, and stricter rules for everybody. They end up devastating communities and driving out fearful residents and businesses. And the damage - the damage that's done can persist for decades. We heard a lot of faith leaders on the ground tonight saying that, some who were actually around in 1968.   A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research study on those riots in the '60s found that they had economically significant negative effects on blacks' income and unemployment. Further, those effects may have been larger in the long run, from 1960 to 1980, than in the short run, from 1960-1970. The riots significantly depressed the median value of black owned property between 1960 and 1970 with little or no rebound in the '70s.  That means for the Twin Cities area, these riots could potentially reverse all of the economic gains made by African Americans over the last four years. So why do people then in authority, at times, actually sound like they're bending over backwards to avoid calling out those people who are dishonoring the memory of victims like George Floyd? They're holding back from actually calling out new acts of crime that are trying to co-opt a peaceful civil rights movement. Why do people even try to excuse that?",

      "sentences": "We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.  Now, you'd think after this horrifying killing of Mr. Floyd and the violence that now has spawned, it's spawned all across the country, that elected officials would act swiftly to bring order to the situation, to protect locals from harm and actual peaceful protesters from harm. Well, instead, Minnesota's AG, Keith Ellison, tried to refrain the rioting into almost a noble undertaking. Now, I think the nation is paying attention. They're watching this closely. They're disgusted by Floyd's killing and thank the good lord that they are. And they're disgusted by those who seek to use that pain as a pretext to push an agenda where there is antifa or just random anarchists or people who just want to cause trouble. Violence against innocent persons or property.  During eight years of the Obama administration, we had major riots in cities like Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. And remember, in both cases, those police officers were cleared of wrongdoing, but not before entire blocks and already struggling neighborhoods were totally devastated. Barack Obama was the nation's first black President. He remains a global - a global superstar and one of the most respected men on the planet. But he wasn't able to stop the madness.  In fact, at the - I think it was the fall of his last year in office, it shocked many to know that race relations had not only not improved in those eight years, they had worsened, eroded trust between law enforcement and inner-city America, as, let's face it, it's been a problem in our country since the civil rights movement or before that. And we've had consent decrees and diversity training. We've had community policing events. We've had fairs and festivals to try to get people together, understand each other as human beings. And maybe some of it has helped around the edges. But more than anything, we see the images of what's happening tonight, we need a change of heart, we need a spiritual reawakening, all of us. And I mean all of us. We need to foster a greater sense of respect for each other as human beings. That sounds trite and clich,. But the human aspect of this - and I'm talking beyond race. I know people don't want to hear it, but - as human beings, beyond race, beyond political parties, beyond any of that, now, can that type of reawakening be legislated? Well, I think if it could have been, I'm sure former presidents, including President Obama, would have tried.  And that's the Angle. Joining me now is Mark Fuhrman, retired LAPD detective, Fox News Contributor. Also with me is Darrin Porcher, former NYPD officer and criminal justice professor. Darrin, I want to start with you. You see this unrest spreading. And the scenes are shocking to Americans who haven't seen anything like this before. Obviously, the arrest and charges against Chauvin didn't make much of a dent. Your thoughts. And we'll start with what you saw in Atlanta tonight. DR. DARRIN PORCHER, RETIRED NYPD LIEUTENANT & CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSOR: I was a lieutenant in the NYPD, and oftentimes, one of the focuses in the department was to assess what the intelligence in the community is. The importance of that is this riot basically started before what happened to Mr. Floyd.   The police department failed to assess the pulse of that community and it now became a combustible situation. And the void in leadership amounted to nothing being done. As a result of nothing being done, it became a more combustible situation. So now we need to coalesce with the federal troops, the state police and the local police, and they're going to triangulate and come up with a solution. But fortunately, we're trying to rebuild the dam after it's already broken as a result of the unfortunate incident that happened with Mr. Floyd.",

      "sentences": "Well, Mark - that's a very profound commentary that it doesn't happen on a night like this, it's been happening. And the Mayor today said we're used to giving protesters their space. And in some sense, that makes sense because you don't want to unnecessarily provoke people. But that strategy somehow did not work tonight. And again, just for the sake of focusing on one place, Atlanta, with what happened in front of CNN. Explosions, cars on fire, the building was breached, windows smashed, teargas, projectiles thrown at officers. Finally, they did have to put on their riot gear because I think a bunch of them got hurt.  MARK FUHRMAN, RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Laura, you certainly can't legislate leadership. And that's one of the biggest problems here. And just like the professor said, those are very wise words, but when you get down to the levels of Minneapolis Police Chief, he's going to be looking for a new job, so is the Mayor. This is something where leadership, you had to draw a line. And it was a trivial event that the police responded to that. They escalated into a slow-motion homicide. And this is what has inflamed this. It wasn't a Ferguson where you've got a quick movement of several seconds by two people that are engaged and an officer involved shooting occurs where you have two different points of view, two different levels of evidence and eyewitness testimony. This is on video, a slow and really painful thing to watch of somebody grinding somebody's face into the pavement until they're dead. Now, that being said, it is horrific. But you can't dilute the justice by more rioting because eventually you're going to run out of buildings and then you're going to go into an area that isn't so willing to abandon the buildings, and those people are going to fight back, and then you're going to have a real problem.",

And you think about 1968 and how it took Washington D.C., where I live, it took decades - Mark, you know, it took decades for it to come back in D.C., these neighborhoods.

And this is the way that they see to revolutionize how they should be treated by the police. Everyone deserves quintessential policing. I'm a strong proponent in policing should be proceeded upon in an effective way. But at the same token, when we amplify our unwillingness or our dissatisfaction with an action that was committed by police, then that's when we need to sit at the table and come up with a more apt and, let's just say, poised level of an engagement between the police and community because police are public servants. They're here to serve the public. But at the same token, the public is a part of that partnership as well. It's a symbiotic relationship. And when it becomes fractured, we see what's happening on the screen now.

But across in Brooklyn, we're seeing some big changes there. There is far more police officers in the area than we were seeing earlier on in the day. We were seeing crowd of maybe just a couple hundred people now growing into masses there, walking around. Of course, a lot of people are very angry, but some of that anger translating to larger energies, of course, that we're seeing in some of these crowds. So much so that police even had to bring in a bus to potentially put (ph) people onto those buses if they should get arrested. They also are calling a Level 4 mobilization. Basically that means, that's calling in any law enforcement that's in the surrounding area for some backup. A Level 5 would be the most and that essentially would be calling in all law enforcement altogether into the area. So, again, tonight, we're seeing a lot of crowds in New York marching there to Brooklyn. We're seeing even a car on fire, reports of shots fired. So a lot of tension. But again, a lot of anger and people saying that they can't stay home even because of COVID-19, they have to ignore those guidelines and they need to voice this injustice that they're seeing. Of course, the Mayor is telling people to still keep in mind that they need to practice social distancing. It's just not easy, Laura, with these crowds that we're seeing tonight.",

That's not a problem. But just down the street from us, I'm sure you can hear the sirens in the background, a much more aggressive crowd is starting to take their anger out on LAPD. I'm not sure if we have the video, but if we can pull it up, this happened within about the last 30 minutes or so. This is part of downtown LA called Pershing Square. You're going to see an LAPD officer goes in to make an arrest on somebody. He immediately gets swarmed by the crowd there, badly outnumbered. He continues trying to make that arrest. The crowd continues swarming around him and eventually some of the people in the crowd start punching him, kicking him. Some start hitting him with their sign. He continues trying to make that arrest, but eventually, a good Samaritan in that crowd is eventually able to try to protect that police officer, eventually drags him out from what was a very bad and a very dangerous situation. But what we've been seeing happening here in LA tonight so far is the marchers have been marching peacefully around the city streets in parts of the city. They've been trying to get on freeways. Police have blocked them in that area. They did that on Wednesday. They were able to successfully get on to the 101 Freeway, blocked traffic, where they swarmed some California Highway Patrol vehicles. But for the most part, up until about 30 minutes ago, things have been very calm, very peaceful other than that one incident over by Pershing Square where that LAPD officer was attacked.  This protest right behind us, very peaceful. Just some chanting, some yelling. But LAPD Police Chief Michel Moore, he put out a statement today essentially telling protesters, look, we hear your anger, we understand it, we understand why you're mad, we will protect your First Amendment right to free speech, however, we are getting concerned with some of the reports we're getting of our officers being attacked, of some buildings being vandalized. They said they're going to draw the line tonight when it comes to public safety with the officers and with the public. They're going to start kicking up their enforcement making more arrests. That might be what we saw happen in Pershing Square. But Laura, as the sun starts to go down here, we're going to have to see how this night plays out.",

They specialize in masking themselves behind genuine protesters, and exploiting these opportunities to agitate and destroy. These are professional antagonizers. They've been trained. They have manuals on how to do this with their tactics, their techniques, and their procedures. And if you look at them in the crowd, you can start to pick them out because they're very different to the rest of the protestors. They typically wear black, all dressed in black - not always. They have different levels in the hierarchical structure. But you will see the ones, especially that are in this subculture of real professional antagonists and instigators. And they wear all in black. They often have equipment on their backs. They'll have gas masks that aren't the typical gasmasks. Theirs are the expensive ones. They will have DSLR cameras which cost thousands and thousands of dollars that the average protester doesn't have. They'll have communications equipment, like radios with miniature grade antennas. You'll see they have earpieces in their ears. There are repeaters on top of vehicles.  And these people come from the outside. And this is something, I've spoken today to counterterrorism people, law enforcement, intelligence people, and what all of them complain about is the fact that law enforcement has not been doing anything about the proliferation of these cells all across this country for years now. They have existed for a long time, but in the age of social media, the word that was used was \"supercharged,\" right. They have become supercharged. And they are able to influence an extraordinary amount of people. So you don't need a lot of them. You have them, and you have these professional agitators, they use and exploit the people around them. And what has happened in Minneapolis that's really interesting to people who study these groups is the confluence of Black Lives Matter and Antifa, because ironically, they make it all about the racial divide and this terrible racial injustice, but Antifa is mostly white. And they don't really care. They don't care about uniting the U.S. They don't care about getting rid of racism. Their slogans are about abolishing the police. They use sayings like the only good cops are dead cops. So they're not looking to reform the system or fix the system or anything like that. You've got a black police chief in Minnesota, right. You've got many other black officials. They don't want to support those people. Those black people are not on their agenda. It's the people who can be exploited, because when Minneapolis is burned to the ground and any other city, like Ferguson, they move on. And who is left holding the baby? Who is left with the destruction? Who is poorer because their cities and their businesses have been burned down and destroyed? Yes, the citizens they say they care about, which they don't.",

They had set up a perimeter around the area of the third precinct that had been torched last night, and that was there all day. Things got out of hand after the law enforcement told the crowd that had gathered that within 10 minutes they were going to be in violation of that curfew order. They weren't too happy with that, and so they started throwing all sorts of stuff, bottles, rocks, at the National Guardsmen and the riot police. So of course, they were firing back with tear gas and, as I can attest to, other nonlethal rounds. But then they started pulling back, and they pulled back completely. Where we are right now, we're so many blocks away from where we originally started. And as you can see behind me, a lot of people are not obeying that curfew order.",

Horace, shouldn't voters be speaking out or thinking about what has happened, not just tonight or this week or last week, but really, let's just look at the last decade. Last decade we had eight years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and by the end of it, as we showed that Gallup poll, I believe it was a Gallup poll in 2016, race relations were worse. But Biden comes along now, and says we just need to sit down and listen to people and hear them and validate them and so forth. Does that work in connecting with worried America tonight? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: What former President Obama said, and the statement by Vice President Biden, it has demonstrated why after eight years with them having the pulpit, being able to stand up and explain to America what their objectives and their goals were, why we started off with such great hope and optimism on the basis of race in 2009, and then by the end of their term, America actually was more racially divided then we were before. It is these types of incidents. I'm not talking about what's happening in Minnesota. I'm talking about those who exploit these incidents for their political gain. The president, the former president often was willing to do that, and many of his supporters are. Tom Bevan, we had Steve Harrigan on the ground, and he was talking for a moment or two to a 16-year-old in Minnesota and Minneapolis, and he said, it's police brutality, and we are fed up, we are done with it. And so the young people, they see these images, and they think this system is rigged against them and America is a racist country. And you have to turn that around.

Voters don't like to see that either, to see shots and stores burning, that, as you said, first of all, it's harms the community that it happens in, but it also hurts the protesters cause. It doesn't advance the cause that everybody wants to see. So it's a tricky thing, and it's going to be interesting to see how the public views these two things the longer the riots go on.

This is a city that prides itself on its civil rights legacy. After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, it was one of the few large cities that, instead of having riots, had a peaceful demonstration. Black people, white people locking arms and marching in solidarity. When incendiary things happen, the people protest. The police here generally give the - they have a tradition of giving the protesters some space, allowing a certain degree of civil disobedience. Then when it gets to be a little too much, they express what the limits are and the protesters get back in line and go where they're supposed to be. Clearly, that did not happen today. This is something I have never seen in Atlanta. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is trying to appeal to that peaceful Atlanta tradition, that tradition of peaceful protest, calling on these demonstrators to stop doing damage, to stop vandalizing, because this is just not what we do in Atlanta, appealing to that. She assembled a gathering of religious leaders, civil rights leaders, rap artists, members of the hip-hop community to appeal to the protesters to be peaceful, to get their point across in more effective ways than doing this violence. But how you get your point across by attacking CNN, by attacking a journalistic organization - I don't know what the strategy is - by tearing up your own city. I don't know what the strategy is or if there was no strategy. Lot of people trying to figure out why now, why is Atlanta erupting this way like it has not in the past while you did have that high-profile case down in South Georgia, a black man fatally shot and killed. Initially, the men involved were not charged until the tape of that went public, and then you have the situation in Minneapolis. And then, add that to COVID-19. Peopled cooped up in their houses wanting to get out. Perhaps it was a perfect storm. Talking about the civil rights legacy, one of those civil rights leaders - longtime civil rights leaders is Andrew Young, Former Atlanta Mayor, Former Ambassador to the United Nations. He tweeted this evening, \"Tonight and tomorrow night, we have to round up the reasonable young people who are part of that group and let them know that they have made their point and now they hurt their cause.\" Back to you."

And again, appealing to everybody, make your voice heard, make your motions known, march, speak, rally, but what happened at CNN, if you're watching it earlier, it took your breath away. We had explosions, we had glass shattered, we had projectiles thrown at the police, we had the police then throwing - sending teargases into the crowd. Again, for people who are just tuning in, we have a night of disturbance across the United States and a lot of people are very, very concerned about law and order throughout the country, and the peace of mind of those who are truly, truly worried about the civil rights movements, race relations, and on top of everything else, our health and our economy. But now, I'm going to get on to how I was going to originally start the show. Courting chaos. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Heartache and anger over George Floyd's killing run deep. And it should, for his family, his community, and the entire country. And the pain was made even worse though last night when protest turned to horrendous violence in Minneapolis and then it spiraled across the United States. And of course, you're seeing that tonight. Now, George Floyd didn't deserve to die. And the innocent Americans around the very place where Floyd died, they didn't deserve to lose their dreams either."

We all know that. But what we're seeing break out across America, it's only going to make everything worse. There is absolutely zero chance that rioting or looting or destroying the good people's businesses or homes or properties that's going to result in a better life for anyone, especially African Americans. Now, if history is any guide, rioting leads to what? It ends up leading to stronger law enforcement, longer jail sentences, and stricter rules for everybody. They end up devastating communities and driving out fearful residents and businesses. And the damage - the damage that's done can persist for decades. We heard a lot of faith leaders on the ground tonight saying that, some who were actually around in 1968. A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research study on those riots in the '60s found that they had economically significant negative effects on blacks' income and unemployment. Further, those effects may have been larger in the long run, from 1960 to 1980, than in the short run, from 1960-1970. The riots significantly depressed the median value of black owned property between 1960 and 1970 with little or no rebound in the '70s. That means for the Twin Cities area, these riots could potentially reverse all of the economic gains made by African Americans over the last four years. So why do people then in authority, at times, actually sound like they're bending over backwards to avoid calling out those people who are dishonoring the memory of victims like George Floyd? They're holding back from actually calling out new acts of crime that are trying to co-opt a peaceful civil rights movement. Why do people even try to excuse that?"

      "utterance": "We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace. Now, you'd think after this horrifying killing of Mr. Floyd and the violence that now has spawned, it's spawned all across the country, that elected officials would act swiftly to bring order to the situation, to protect locals from harm and actual peaceful protesters from harm. Well, instead, Minnesota's AG, Keith Ellison, tried to refrain the rioting into almost a noble undertaking. Now, I think the nation is paying attention. They're watching this closely. They're disgusted by Floyd's killing and thank the good lord that they are. And they're disgusted by those who seek to use that pain as a pretext to push an agenda where there is antifa or just random anarchists or people who just want to cause trouble. Violence against innocent persons or property. During eight years of the Obama administration, we had major riots in cities like Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. And remember, in both cases, those police officers were cleared of wrongdoing, but not before entire blocks and already struggling neighborhoods were totally devastated. Barack Obama was the nation's first black President. He remains a global - a global superstar and one of the most respected men on the planet. But he wasn't able to stop the madness. In fact, at the - I think it was the fall of his last year in office, it shocked many to know that race relations had not only not improved in those eight years, they had worsened, eroded trust between law enforcement and inner-city America, as, let's face it, it's been a problem in our country since the civil rights movement or before that. And we've had consent decrees and diversity training. We've had community policing events. We've had fairs and festivals to try to get people together, understand each other as human beings. And maybe some of it has helped around the edges. But more than anything, we see the images of what's happening tonight, we need a change of heart, we need a spiritual reawakening, all of us. And I mean all of us. We need to foster a greater sense of respect for each other as human beings. That sounds trite and clich,. But the human aspect of this - and I'm talking beyond race. I know people don't want to hear it, but - as human beings, beyond race, beyond political parties, beyond any of that, now, can that type of reawakening be legislated? Well, I think if it could have been, I'm sure former presidents, including President Obama, would have tried. And that's the Angle. Joining me now is Mark Fuhrman, retired LAPD detective, Fox News Contributor. Also with me is Darrin Porcher, former NYPD officer and criminal justice professor. Darrin, I want to start with you. You see this unrest spreading. And the scenes are shocking to Americans who haven't seen anything like this before. Obviously, the arrest and charges against Chauvin didn't make much of a dent. Your thoughts. And we'll start with what you saw in Atlanta tonight. DR. DARRIN PORCHER, RETIRED NYPD LIEUTENANT & CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSOR: I was a lieutenant in the NYPD, and oftentimes, one of the focuses in the department was to assess what the intelligence in the community is. The importance of that is this riot basically started before what happened to Mr. Floyd. The police department failed to assess the pulse of that community and it now became a combustible situation. And the void in leadership amounted to nothing being done. As a result of nothing being done, it became a more combustible situation. So now we need to coalesce with the federal troops, the state police and the local police, and they're going to triangulate and come up with a solution. But fortunately, we're trying to rebuild the dam after it's already broken as a result of the unfortunate incident that happened with Mr. Floyd."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, Mark - that's a very profound commentary that it doesn't happen on a night like this, it's been happening. And the Mayor today said we're used to giving protesters their space. And in some sense, that makes sense because you don't want to unnecessarily provoke people. But that strategy somehow did not work tonight. And again, just for the sake of focusing on one place, Atlanta, with what happened in front of CNN. Explosions, cars on fire, the building was breached, windows smashed, teargas, projectiles thrown at officers. Finally, they did have to put on their riot gear because I think a bunch of them got hurt. MARK FUHRMAN, RETIRED LAPD DETECTIVE & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Laura, you certainly can't legislate leadership. And that's one of the biggest problems here. And just like the professor said, those are very wise words, but when you get down to the levels of Minneapolis Police Chief, he's going to be looking for a new job, so is the Mayor. This is something where leadership, you had to draw a line. And it was a trivial event that the police responded to that. They escalated into a slow-motion homicide. And this is what has inflamed this. It wasn't a Ferguson where you've got a quick movement of several seconds by two people that are engaged and an officer involved shooting occurs where you have two different points of view, two different levels of evidence and eyewitness testimony. This is on video, a slow and really painful thing to watch of somebody grinding somebody's face into the pavement until they're dead. Now, that being said, it is horrific. But you can't dilute the justice by more rioting because eventually you're going to run out of buildings and then you're going to go into an area that isn't so willing to abandon the buildings, and those people are going to fight back, and then you're going to have a real problem."

When you see the images of Mr. Floyd on the ground, there - I could only watch it a few times. It's heartbreaking and infuriating. And then you see the images of American cities in flames tonight. And you think about 1968 and how it took Washington D.C., where I live, it took decades - Mark, you know, it took decades for it to come back in D.C., these neighborhoods. So the sad thing is the neighborhoods that need the most revitalization or are just coming out of difficult economic times are then cast back down into despair because of what happens and the aftermath of a horrible criminal incident like this."

And resources have been depleted immensely as a result of that. And if we look at the African American community in general, they believe that they've been recipients of a miscarriage of justice. And this is the way that they see to revolutionize how they should be treated by the police. Everyone deserves quintessential policing. I'm a strong proponent in policing should be proceeded upon in an effective way. But at the same token, when we amplify our unwillingness or our dissatisfaction with an action that was committed by police, then that's when we need to sit at the table and come up with a more apt and, let's just say, poised level of an engagement between the police and community because police are public servants. They're here to serve the public. But at the same token, the public is a part of that partnership as well. It's a symbiotic relationship. And when it becomes fractured, we see what's happening on the screen now. So we need to coalesce and have cooler heads prevail, sit at the table and devise a solution so we can get back to where we need to because this COVID-19 pandemic is destroying America as a result."

But across in Brooklyn, we're seeing some big changes there. There is far more police officers in the area than we were seeing earlier on in the day. We were seeing crowd of maybe just a couple hundred people now growing into masses there, walking around. Of course, a lot of people are very angry, but some of that anger translating to larger energies, of course, that we're seeing in some of these crowds. So much so that police even had to bring in a bus to potentially put (ph) people onto those buses if they should get arrested. They also are calling a Level 4 mobilization. Basically that means, that's calling in any law enforcement that's in the surrounding area for some backup. A Level 5 would be the most and that essentially would be calling in all law enforcement altogether into the area. So, again, tonight, we're seeing a lot of crowds in New York marching there to Brooklyn. We're seeing even a car on fire, reports of shots fired. So a lot of tension. But again, a lot of anger and people saying that they can't stay home even because of COVID-19, they have to ignore those guidelines and they need to voice this injustice that they're seeing.

      "utterance": "Laura, things are unfortunately really starting to pick up and escalate here in Los Angeles. We have one very small protest behind us here at LAPD headquarters. That's peaceful. That's not a problem. But just down the street from us, I'm sure you can hear the sirens in the background, a much more aggressive crowd is starting to take their anger out on LAPD. I'm not sure if we have the video, but if we can pull it up, this happened within about the last 30 minutes or so. This is part of downtown LA called Pershing Square. You're going to see an LAPD officer goes in to make an arrest on somebody. He immediately gets swarmed by the crowd there, badly outnumbered. He continues trying to make that arrest. The crowd continues swarming around him and eventually some of the people in the crowd start punching him, kicking him. Some start hitting him with their sign. He continues trying to make that arrest, but eventually, a good Samaritan in that crowd is eventually able to try to protect that police officer, eventually drags him out from what was a very bad and a very dangerous situation. But what we've been seeing happening here in LA tonight so far is the marchers have been marching peacefully around the city streets in parts of the city. They've been trying to get on freeways. Police have blocked them in that area. They did that on Wednesday. They were able to successfully get on to the 101 Freeway, blocked traffic, where they swarmed some California Highway Patrol vehicles. But for the most part, up until about 30 minutes ago, things have been very calm, very peaceful other than that one incident over by Pershing Square where that LAPD officer was attacked. This protest right behind us, very peaceful. Just some chanting, some yelling. But LAPD Police Chief Michel Moore, he put out a statement today essentially telling protesters, look, we hear your anger, we understand it, we understand why you're mad, we will protect your First Amendment right to free speech, however, we are getting concerned with some of the reports we're getting of our officers being attacked, of some buildings being vandalized. They said they're going to draw the line tonight when it comes to public safety with the officers and with the public. They're going to start kicking up their enforcement making more arrests. That might be what we saw happen in Pershing Square. But Laura, as the sun starts to go down here, we're going to have to see how this night plays out."

They specialize in masking themselves behind genuine protesters, and exploiting these opportunities to agitate and destroy. These are professional antagonizers. They've been trained. They have manuals on how to do this with their tactics, their techniques, and their procedures. And if you look at them in the crowd, you can start to pick them out because they're very different to the rest of the protestors. They typically wear black, all dressed in black - not always. They have different levels in the hierarchical structure. But you will see the ones, especially that are in this subculture of real professional antagonists and instigators. And they wear all in black. They often have equipment on their backs. They'll have gas masks that aren't the typical gasmasks. Theirs are the expensive ones. They will have DSLR cameras which cost thousands and thousands of dollars that the average protester doesn't have. They'll have communications equipment, like radios with miniature grade antennas. You'll see they have earpieces in their ears. There are repeaters on top of vehicles. And these people come from the outside. And this is something, I've spoken today to counterterrorism people, law enforcement, intelligence people, and what all of them complain about is the fact that law enforcement has not been doing anything about the proliferation of these cells all across this country for years now. They have existed for a long time, but in the age of social media, the word that was used was \"supercharged,\" right. They have become supercharged. And they are able to influence an extraordinary amount of people. So you don't need a lot of them. You have them, and you have these professional agitators, they use and exploit the people around them. And what has happened in Minneapolis that's really interesting to people who study these groups is the confluence of Black Lives Matter and Antifa, because ironically, they make it all about the racial divide and this terrible racial injustice, but Antifa is mostly white. And they don't really care. They don't care about uniting the U.S. They don't care about getting rid of racism. Their slogans are about abolishing the police. They use sayings like the only good cops are dead cops. So they're not looking to reform the system or fix the system or anything like that. You've got a black police chief in Minnesota, right. You've got many other black officials. They don't want to support those people. Those black people are not on their agenda. It's the people who can be exploited, because when Minneapolis is burned to the ground and any other city, like Ferguson, they move on. And who is left holding the baby? Who is left with the destruction? Who is poorer because their cities and their businesses have been burned down and destroyed? Yes, the citizens they say they care about, which they don't."

They had set up a perimeter around the area of the third precinct that had been torched last night, and that was there all day. Things got out of hand after the law enforcement told the crowd that had gathered that within 10 minutes they were going to be in violation of that curfew order. They weren't too happy with that, and so they started throwing all sorts of stuff, bottles, rocks, at the National Guardsmen and the riot police. So of course, they were firing back with tear gas and, as I can attest to, other nonlethal rounds. But then they started pulling back, and they pulled back completely. Where we are right now, we're so many blocks away from where we originally started. And as you can see behind me, a lot of people are not obeying that curfew order."

And we were keeping the looters and those things from continuing to come in and breaking into places. And it is literally like a warzone here, Laura.

So when people who want to commit criminal mischief see a precinct as they saw in Minneapolis get overrun and destroyed, people feel like, hey, if they can do it, I can do it, and I can one-up them and I can do it better. Then you saw CNN's building attacked, and it goes on and on and on. And I feel sorry for people who just started their businesses. They had COVID to deal with, now they have this to deal with.

President Obama weighed in on the disaster unfolding in Minneapolis today, but instead of condemning any of the violence in the streets, he said this. For millions of Americans being treated differently on the account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly normal. This shouldn't be normal in 2020 America. It can't be normal. We can and must be better. It falls on all of us to work together to create a new normal in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts.\" Now, Obama's statement was clearly stalking horse for Joe Biden, who only offered up basically cliches."

Also with me is Horace Cooper, co-founder of Project 21, and Tom Bevan, co-founder and president of Real Clear Politics. Horace, shouldn't voters be speaking out or thinking about what has happened, not just tonight or this week or last week, but really, let's just look at the last decade. Last decade we had eight years of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and by the end of it, as we showed that Gallup poll, I believe it was a Gallup poll in 2016, race relations were worse. But Biden comes along now, and says we just need to sit down and listen to people and hear them and validate them and so forth. Does that work in connecting with worried America tonight? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: What former President Obama said, and the statement by Vice President Biden, it has demonstrated why after eight years with them having the pulpit, being able to stand up and explain to America what their objectives and their goals were, why we started off with such great hope and optimism on the basis of race in 2009, and then by the end of their term, America actually was more racially divided then we were before. It is these types of incidents. I'm not talking about what's happening in Minnesota. I'm talking about those who exploit these incidents for their political gain. The president, the former president often was willing to do that, and many of his supporters are. Tom Bevan, we had Steve Harrigan on the ground, and he was talking for a moment or two to a 16-year-old in Minnesota and Minneapolis, and he said, it's police brutality, and we are fed up, we are done with it. And so the young people, they see these images, and they think this system is rigged against them and America is a racist country. And you have to turn that around. But that has been cemented in the minds of young people for many years."

      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and look, people look at that video of George Floyd, and nobody likes that. Nobody condones that in any way. But the problem is we should be able to address that, but also be able to condemn the rioting and the looting that is going on. You can do both things at the same time. And that's where President Obama said these things, but didn't condemn the rioters. And that's the only way that you can establish a sort of balance. Voters don't like to see that either, to see shots and stores burning, that, as you said, first of all, it's harms the community that it happens in, but it also hurts the protesters cause. It doesn't advance the cause that everybody wants to see. So it's a tricky thing, and it's going to be interesting to see how the public views these two things the longer the riots go on. It could produce a backlash."

Kennedy and the Chicago riots during the Democratic Convention, Richard Nixon was able to lay a lot of fears across America and say there's got to be law in order, and Americans took that seriously.

And I've been hearing this quote about rioting is how the unheard are heard, and they attribute that to Dr. King. Dr. King also said violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral. He's right, and we're seeing it.
