      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to Washington. I’m Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, the new year will bring new rules about vaping and e-cigarettes. The Trump administration putting out official word today saying it will ban most flavors popular with underage teenagers but will allow others to remain. That decision, the last part of the decision, favors the multi-billion dollar vaping industry but, obviously, enrages anti-tobacco advocates. Correspondent Doug McKelway starts us off tonight with details of these new rules. Good evening, Doug."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doug McKelway",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Bret. The new Food and Drug Administration enforcement action announced today bans the sale of fruity or mint-flavored, cartridge-based e-cigarettes popular with teens. The action doesn't go as far as President Trump's original plan of an outright ban announced four months ago. HHS Secretary Alex Azar today acknowledged \"The United States has never seen an epidemic of substance use arise as quickly as our current epidemic of youth use of e-cigarettes.\" Yet, the president said yesterday vaping has helped many people kick the more dangerous habit of smoking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Donald Trump",
      "utterance": "Look, vaping can be good from the standpoint if you look at the e-cigarettes, you stop smoking. If you can stop smoking, that's a big advantage. So, we think we're going to get it back onto the market very, very quickly. But we have to protect the children.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doug McKelway",
      "utterance": "The new policy still permits the sale of closed vaping cartridges formulated to taste like tobacco or mentholized tobacco, nor does it restrict open tank vaping systems popular with adults in which users can mix their own flavorings. The administration has left itself open to criticism from both sides. Some say it should go further to restrict all forms of vaping; others believe it could be a rule of unintended consequences."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Female Speaker",
      "utterance": "So, the big risk when you eliminate access and choice, variability of products, is that people who got off deadly cigarettes and went onto much safer vaping may now return to those deadly cigarettes or buy flavored vaping products on the black market."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Doug McKelway",
      "utterance": "Indeed, black market vaping cartridges infused with THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, have now been linked to the deaths of 55 and more than 2,500 respiratory illnesses last year. Today's action is only a temporary step. Technically, no vaping products have yet been given full permanent FDA approval for use."

      "utterance": "We'll see if any of that goes to court. Doug, thank you. Another story here dealing with this: U-Haul says in 21 states it will not hire people who use nicotine products. The company saying the new policy, which begins February 1st, is an attempt to establish what it calls \"one of the healthiest corporate cultures in the U.S. and Canada.\" The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU, terms anti-nicotine hiring policies discriminatory and also a violation of worker privacy; however, advocates point out smokers are not a protected class under federal antidiscrimination laws. Now to the story that we've been following over the past couple of days: Defense Secretary Mark Esper says the U.S. may take preemptive action to prevent further violence against American interests by Iran-backed militants in the Middle East. This comes after an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. We have Fox team coverage tonight. Kevin Corke with the president in West Palm Beach, Florida with what the administration is saying and doing about the situation in Iraq and the provocation from Iran. First up, though, correspondent Trey Yingst in Amman, Jordan to tell us where things stand at this hour on the ground. Trey."

We are getting reports in just now that four rockets have been fired at Baghdad International Airport; meanwhile, across the city in the Green Zone, the dust has settled outside the U.S. Embassy. It is now under control of American forces, though the message that Iran left remains."

      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "Once a place of welcome, newly released photos show a blackened and charred reception room at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after Iran-backed militia and their supporters attempted to destroy the building. Iraqi troops are being criticized for allowing the mob to pass numerous checkpoints into Baghdad's Green Zone before storming the embassy. The protestors raised militia flags, clashed with U.S. security forces, and chanted \"Down, down USA,\" before retreating on Wednesday. And today, the Trump administration is doubling down on blaming Iran for orchestrating the assault."

    {
      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "As war drums beat, the U.S. and Iran appear to be preparing for the possibility of a direct military confrontation. Thursday, a top Iranian Revolutionary Guard general said his country isn't afraid of conflict and could break America into several pieces. Overnight, Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, reiterated his willingness to hold talks with the United States, though the talks would come with serious preconditions. American sanctions have crippled Iran's economy as the Islamic Republic continues to violate key terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement. The Trump administration, vowing to continue its maximum pressure campaign, is now locked in a political and military standoff with the Islamic Republic."

      "speaker": "Kevin Corke",
      "utterance": "It's often referred to as saber rattling when leaders of one country preemptively promise reprisals for any action by another. But in the case of the United States and Iran, seemingly teetering on the brink of a proxy war in Iraq, Defense Secretary Mark Esper's warning today seemed to carry particular heft and an almost haunting certainty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Esper",
      "utterance": "We need to stand up to Iran and we need them to behave like a normal country. That means ending their nuclear program, ending their long-range ballistic missile program, the stopping of hostage-taking, and then, of course, their malign behavior."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin Corke",
      "utterance": "Behavior, like the orchestrated protest at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which enabled the regimen to conflate domestic unrest in Iraq with Tehran's anti-American fervor. But with unrest percolating in Baghdad, some 6,000 miles away back in Washington a triumvirate of power has been coordinating crucial next steps in effort to simultaneously prepare for and, if at all possible, avoid an escalation of hostilities. Translation: More capability on land, sea, and air."

      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "President Trump really has no policy at all. He doesn't seem to know what he's doing. No end game. President Trump clearly has to begin at least some back-channel discussions with the Iranians. He has coddled every other thug in the world, why not talk with the Iranians?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "I think a proportional response like we've been seeing so far is exactly what Iran doesn't want to see because it doesn't turn the world against us, it really doesn't give ammo to the blame America crowd, and it does impact Iran's standing."

Kristina Kvien is the new chargée d'affaires, the highest-ranking official at the embassy. She introduced herself on social media this morning. Kvien's predecessor, of course, Bill Taylor was a witness in President Trump's impeachment hearings before House committees last year. Kvien is promising American support to Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity and reforms that will help Ukraine. Yesterday we reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has postponed his trip to Ukraine to deal with matters like Iraq and Iran throughout the Middle East.

In other words, pretty much any company anywhere with a website. The law requires the company to disclose whether they sell customer's personal data and give them an option – to opt out by creating and prominently displaying a do not sell my personal information button on their website."

No one else has this level of protection for its consumers when it comes to the use of the Internet.  Jonathan Hunt: But some tech experts warn that the legal statement's customers may be required to read and the buttons they may be required to press before they get to the shopping, posting or whatever they're doing on any given site may drive some of them away.   Male Speaker: It only takes a few seconds, maybe 10 to 15, before they get frustrated and they say, I don't like this, I'm moving on, I'm going to go to something else.

      "speaker": "Jonathan Hunt",

All three indices hitting record highs in this the first day of trading in 2020. We will talk to the secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, live about the economy and other topics coming up. Up next, we're learning new details about a man accused of using a machete to attack Jewish worshipers over the weekend, we'll tell you what we were learning. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox Alaska in Anchorage as the Coast Guard calls off the search for five crew members of a crab fishing vessel that sank New Year's Eve. The decision comes after 20 hours of searching the chilly waters about 170 miles southwest of Kodiak Island. Two other men who dawn survival suits and got into a life raft were rescued. Fox 5 in New York as the state begins enforcing a new bail reform law. The number of people held in jail awaiting trial will decrease. Supporters say the previous cash bail system would unfairly keep the poor in prison as the wealthy walked free. Critics contend the reforms go too far and already releasing suspects who pose a danger to others. And this is a live look at Las Vegas from our affiliate Fox 5 out there. The big story there tonight police arrest a suspect after a resident captured an in progress kidnaping on a home surveillance system. They say the woman was found safe. Darnell Rogers faces charges of kidnaping and domestic battery. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from special report. We'll be right back."

      "speaker": "Jacqui Heinrich",
      "utterance": "The suspect, Grafton Thomas, now faces federal hate crime and attempted murder charges after at least one prior run in with police. In 2018, Thomas was arrested for menacing a police officer with a knife, a felony carrying a mandatory minimum of two years in prison. There was apparently not enough evidence for that charge to stick. The judge opted for a conditional dismissal of the lesser charges, allowing the court to monitor him for six months. Investigators say after Saturday's attack, they found Thomas' journals referring to Adolf Hitler and Nazis. His defense claims he's not anti-Semitic, but developed mental illness after joining the Marines and recently stopped taking prescribed antipsychotics. Military officials confirm Grafton Thomas was removed from the Marines just a month after boot camp for fraudulent enlistment. But Saturday's rampage is just one of at least 13 anti-Semitic incidents around New York in the last two weeks. Yesterday, police arrested two women for allegedly shouting slurs at a Hasidic man in Brooklyn. One of them was charged for punching him in the throat. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo labeled the incidents domestic terrorism, prompting calls for increased security around orthodox communities and events like a religious gathering of 92,000 at MetLife Stadium. Tomorrow, a grand jury will hear the case and it's possible more charges will come down Bret."

First, beyond our borders tonight. Taiwan's top military official was among eight people killed today in an Air Force helicopter crash in mountainous terrain outside Taipei.  The Defense Ministry says five others survived. The general was responsible for overseeing the self-governing islands defense against China, which threatens to use military force if necessary to annex what it considers part of its territory.  Residents of Indonesia's capital, who had to be forced into shelters by heavy rain and widespread flooding are returning to their homes today. Floodwaters have started to recede, though the death toll from that disaster has jumped to 30.  Three women are under investigation, meantime, in Germany for launching paper sky lanterns for the new year that apparently ignited a devastating fire, killing more than 30 animals at a zoo there.

If you look over the past year, it's pretty stunning to see the graph of where the markets have been, where they've really accelerated. And then you look at the economy overall, the changes since the president took office, GDP growth currently at 2.1 percent. That's a little down, but unemployment 3.5 percent. Consumer confidence is up significantly as are average hourly earnings. We put that up often to talk about the economy. Whereas, commerce secretary, tonight, do you see the U.S. economy as you look towards this new year in 2020?"

The main argument that the naysayers have is that until 11 years into recovery, but I have news for them -- rallies, recoveries don't die of old age. Something has to kill them. The hyperinflation and oil crisis, something like that. And I don't see anything on the horizon. Instead, there are some real pluses coming in. The settlement of the arrangements with the USMCA. There's going to be a huge, powerful influence. The International Trade Commission estimates on average it to be some 370.000 jobs added as it gets rolling. The new agreement with China should be very, very powerful -- 100 billion a year for the next couple of years. That alone is a half a percentage point on the economy. Sooner or later, Boeing will hopefully get the 737 MAX back flying. That's probably been a quarter of a point drag on the economy. So, there's a whole lot of things that have to be coming in as a positive superimposed on the momentum that we already have. I feel very good."

Washington Post \"Major hole in initial U.S. China trade deal,\" suggesting it's not living up to everything it was promised. New York Times says, \"China injects $115 billion to stabilize its economy.\" What's the reality of this China deal?  Is it -- does it fall short significantly of what the administration hoped?  And what does it mean for China?  Are they in trouble, and they're in a negotiating mode?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Wilbur Ross",
      "utterance": "Well, in terms of the administration, this is not the final deal. This is phase one. The decision was made to get over the relatively easier parts first. We are getting very major concessions in terms of current trade. As I mentioned, 100 million, 100 billion a year for each to the next couple of years. That's a lot. That's a half a point in and of itself. But there's also changes in intellectual property, right, respect. Changes in technology transfer not letting that happen to the degree that it had been. Number of other things of that sort. Financial services, foreign exchange currency. So, considering that it's only first phase, I think it's a very monumental achievement. The real test, though, will come in the next phase because that's the really hard things that will require major structural reforms to the Chinese economy. But even before that, just the very fact that we have a very clear enforcement mechanism in this agreement is an enormous step forward. No trade agreement has ever had as powerful an enforcement mechanism as we have here."

The very fact of him coming, the very fact of him stating very clearly his position on a variety of issues made a very, very powerful impression on the people there.

It's going to ruin the world economy, and you'll never get success.\" Well, guess what? Assuming ratification of USMCA and assuming we have the signing on January 15 with China, that will be four important trade deals that he has completed within a 12-month period.

You have only one state so far that I can see, Nebraska, the first state agreeing to share driver's license records with your department, with the U.S. Census Bureau, falls under Commerce. Are there going to be challenges for you in 2020 for this census and where does it stand tonight?"

So, we're feeling very, very good about the increased flow of very reliable administrative records that we will have available. We also have found in the two experiments we've done that the addition of direct cell phone into the computer has greatly improve the efficiency of the enumerators. Enumerators are the people who go door to door to try to get the information verbally from those folks who didn't respond to the repeated mailings that were made to them. We're finding their efficiency is up more than 50 percent. That means we can make a lot more calls. More calls made means we'll have more success. I have every confidence this will be the most complete and most accurate census we've ever had."

Now, the U.S. government itself also has reservations about Google's health care ambitions with the Justice Department now taking a closer look at Google's $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker Fitbit. Early detection of breast cancer is just one disease that Google is working on better diagnosing. Accurately identifying lung cancer and preventing serious eye disease are two other initiatives that Google is hoping A.I. can also improve upon in the future. Bret."

President Trump, obviously not against anyone, but raising $46 million in the fourth quarter. Bernie Sanders with a jaw-dropping $34.5 million, and as he mentioned there, a lot of them from small donors; the average donor, $18. Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden there, and Andrew Yang with a significant quarter in the fourth quarter as well as fundraising. Meantime, The Washington Post has an article which it says, \"Ascendant Bernie Sanders turns his focus to Joe Biden.\" And there's a quote, \"It just, it's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into the campaign, which isn't going to create energy and excitement. He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump.\" So there, as we close in on the Iowa caucuses, February 3rd. Let's bring in our panel. Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio; and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of The Washington Free Beacon. Mara, it is true. The Washington Post says, \"Ascendant Bernie Sanders.\" He is ascendant."

He's had a heart attack and he's still doing really well in the polls, brought in tremendous amounts of money, and he's doing something now that he said he wasn't going to do. He doesn't like to attack other candidates. He said that's kind of his brand, but now he's going after Joe Biden. So, it tells you who he thinks is the biggest obstacle for him."

He's not, he's not pulling away from the pack because people are rightly concerned that he's too old, and fragile, and not ready to go up against Donald Trump. But they don't see an alternative because, I mean, the truth is that both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are so far to the left that they, that they spook the independents. And they -- if either Sanders or Warren got the nomination, it would be a Trump landslide, I think."

Look, the fundraising numbers are fascinating. The top fundraiser in your graph is a nationalist and the second fundraiser in your graph is a socialist. And what that says to me is the American people are continuing to reject establishment politicians. They're continuing to reject politics as usual. They're looking for candidates who are outside the mold and have brands that are distinctive from Washington. And if it's, if the Democrats end up nominating a typical politician -- in Joe Biden, say -- that is trouble for them in the general election."

Impeachment has to be done by Christmas, which there is no reason why impeachment had to be done by Christmas. They are the ones who said we can't wait for the courts to adjudicate. When the legislative branch and executive branch disagree, then you go to the courts and they decide, right?
