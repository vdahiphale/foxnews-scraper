      "sentences": "Good evening, Martha. This has been an aggressive and fast-moving investigation resulting in at least six arrests here in Manchester and two more in Tripoli, Libya - all triggered by a very quick identification of that bombing suspect, is 22-year-old, Salman Abedi. And as you mentioned, there are new images of him now taken last Friday at a Manchester shopping center- where he is seen holding a bag believed to be the one that carried the bomb to the arena on Monday night.  As you said, he is believed to have spent three weeks in Libya before the attack, before returning to England just days before the attack. Yesterday, Manchester police arrested his older brother and today in Libya they arrested his father, and also his younger brother. His 18-year-old brother, Hasheem Abedi, who authorities say confessed to knowledge of the plot and said that he and his brother both belong to ISIS. There have been a number of raids in the Manchester area. One, earlier today, were three people were taken into custody and then that one tonight that you referenced where a woman was seen being led away in handcuffs possibly because she might be part of a terror cell related to Abed. Meanwhile, more than 60 people remain hospitalized as you mention, 20 of them in critical condition with severe injuries. And here in Sabian Square tonight, a memorial continues to grow with flowers and candles and signs of support from the community determined to remain united, and Martha, this country now in the critical terror stage, they are very, very concerned here tonight about the possibility that there could be more attacks in large part because, as you said, the bomb maker is still on the loose.",

So, once that name is released then, of course, the others will either do one or two things: go underground and hide, or go out and try to get out of the country, or will detonate another explosive device very soon thereafter.

The signs don't necessarily have to be that, he's confessing to them exactly where or when he's planning an attack but the signs of radicalization are quite obvious and they involve a change not only in behavior but in psychology, an insistence for example, that western democracy is corrupt, that we must aspire to establish a caliphate - a very literalist take on the religion. I doubt very much that his father didn't sense any of this.

ISIS didn't radicalize any of them. ISIS merely plucked the low-hanging fruit. The sad truth, the scary truth, is that European Muslims have been radicalized for decades by Islamist organizations who have been working on the right side of the law within our communities preaching theocratic ideals.

This is something that goes along in internet backbone provider, a carrier, in which a so-called MCT takes place, multiple communications transactions. So think of it this way, somebody -- there's a great amount of information flowing out there and some American citizen who is not a subject of either a FISA court order or another kind of court order that allows them to be surveilled, somehow talks about or has terms in their emails that have something to do with that greater subject that they are already looking at and looking at legally. So it's incidental contact. The court held a very long opinion that they weren't living up to the rights because they weren't living up to their obligations because they didn't have the technology. They had to make a human decision to avoid touching that person's communication. So they were doing it sloppy. And they fessed up, but they fessed up five years after these new rules went in to place that the administration itself had imposed on itself, and yet is troubling that this went on for as long as it did and as often as it did.

Then there's Michelle Kiss, relatives say family was her life. Just hours before her death she posted a sweet image of her daughter ready for the concert.

This has been an aggressive and fast-moving investigation resulting in at least six arrests here in Manchester and two more in Tripoli, Libya - all triggered by a very quick identification of that bombing suspect, is 22-year-old, Salman Abedi. And as you mentioned, there are new images of him now taken last Friday at a Manchester shopping center- where he is seen holding a bag believed to be the one that carried the bomb to the arena on Monday night. As you said, he is believed to have spent three weeks in Libya before the attack, before returning to England just days before the attack. Yesterday, Manchester police arrested his older brother and today in Libya they arrested his father, and also his younger brother. His 18-year-old brother, Hasheem Abedi, who authorities say confessed to knowledge of the plot and said that he and his brother both belong to ISIS. There have been a number of raids in the Manchester area. One, earlier today, were three people were taken into custody and then that one tonight that you referenced where a woman was seen being led away in handcuffs possibly because she might be part of a terror cell related to Abed. Meanwhile, more than 60 people remain hospitalized as you mention, 20 of them in critical condition with severe injuries. And here in Sabian Square tonight, a memorial continues to grow with flowers and candles and signs of support from the community determined to remain united, and Martha, this country now in the critical terror stage, they are very, very concerned here tonight about the possibility that there could be more attacks in large part because, as you said, the bomb maker is still on the loose."

This is involving a militia foreign fighter type who traveled to Libya came back to the U.K. and then killed so many innocent children and teenager; my kids' age at a concert performance. It's a very soft target - very premeditated sophisticated attack using a very sophisticated explosive device. You know, in the process, I believe he's going back to Libya to provide more training. It is Ramadan on Friday- and the president's tour, let's forget was just to both the Saudi Kingdom, to Israel, and then to visit with the pope.

I knew Theresa May when she was what they call \"Home Secretary.\" I actually talked to a British official that works closely with her - they're very, I think, upset about the fact - I think most of all that the suspect's name was released. Because remember, when that's released, anybody connected - and I think, in this case, not being a lone wolf, you have other conspirators involved in a network; a cell, if you will, who were tied to this individual. So, once that name is released then, of course, the others will either do one or two things: go underground and hide, or go out and try to get out of the country, or will detonate another explosive device very soon thereafter.

I think above all, 10,000 foreign fighters from Europe went into the region: Iraq and Syria. As we squeeze the caliphate, these jihadists will leave and they already have into Europe.

The truth is that those of - his relatives and close friends who knew this man, this Jihadist terrorist, would've seen the signs a long, long way off. The signs don't necessarily have to be that, he's confessing to them exactly where or when he's planning an attack but the signs of radicalization are quite obvious and they involve a change not only in behavior but in psychology, an insistence for example, that western democracy is corrupt, that we must aspire to establish a caliphate - a very literalist take on the religion. I doubt very much that his father didn't sense any of this. In fact, I wonder how much of these ideas of the need for a modern-day theocracy in the name of Islam - that his father even rejects in the first place.

We're not as integrated as we should be in society, and mainstream society is also being somewhat negligent in attempting to have us integrate into the societies. And the simple truth is, Martha, ISIS didn't - this is going to sound counterintuitive, but ISIS did not radicalize the 6,000 European born and raised Muslims who went to join them. ISIS didn't radicalize any of them. ISIS merely plucked the low-hanging fruit. The sad truth, the scary truth, is that European Muslims have been radicalized for decades by Islamist organizations who have been working on the right side of the law within our communities preaching theocratic ideals. And so, these people are already primed and wanting a caliphate, along came ISIS and claimed they've established a caliphate. And as I said, it was merely plucking the low-hanging fruit."

There was a woman who asked for, you know, white men or western men, I think, is the way she phrased it to watch out for their wives and their children - that was determined to be hate speech.

They have Christians, they have Muslims, they have Jews, they have Bahai, and the way we deal with things in Israel when it comes to these types of - when it comes to terrorism directly, and these types of hate crimes, we don't so much see so much of it in Israel. Obviously, there's a divide with the Palestinian community, and the security measures are very strict because of Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, and terrorism organization who would literally try to jump over this wall and kill Israelis. But for the most part, the Israelis who are Muslim within the Israeli communities move and come and go very freely. Nazareth or Natharad is a primarily Muslim city, a very holy city inside of Israel, as east Jerusalem, and parts of the west bank that cross into Israel, there just isn't a lot of anti-Semitisms.

His career has been leading up to this point. But these Republicans need to think long and hard as they address Medicaid, which is basically a welfare program, it's health insurance - originally health insurance for poor people, now for the working poor too, under ObamaCare.

I think the greatest accomplishment so far is that unified Middle Eastern front against Iran. That is a sea change from Obama and very important. But this is very important too."

      "utterance": "Yes. You make an excellent point, as usual, Bill Bennett, and that is that NATO's reason for being is to protect those countries essentially from Russia. And you've got Poland, and Estonia, and Latvia, and Lithuania, all concerned that Russia may be looking at, you know, bringing them back into the warm embrace of the Soviet Union. This is designed to prevent that from happening, so if Donald Trump is strengthening NATO, he is doing exactly the opposite of cozying up with Russia."

Always taking on the chin whenever there's a war, but they are wonderful people. But he's getting these others embarrassing them into it, countries like Germany and so on. And one of the officials today said - NATO officials said, well, we're not going to use NATO to defend or fight ISIS. And Trump will challenge that as well - Secretary Tillerson did, and he's absolutely right. This is a mortal threat in case they haven't noticed, in Manchester at the throat of all of Europe.

They've lost an awful lot of ground, so we'll see. But ISIS is aimed at them. Let's hope we just don't get this indifference over this reluctance or this sense of resignation.

It approves 99 percent of the government's request to conduct surveillance on American citizens. Now, the classified documents first obtain by the news website Circus Show that the FISA court sharply rebuked the Obama administration when its lawyers quietly inform the court two weeks before Election Day that the national security agency had systematically violated countless Americans rights over a period of years. Specifically, the court found NSA and not complied with so-called minimization procedures, meaning the measures the government is supposed to take to keep to a minimum its infringements on Americans constitutional rights under the fourth amendment against unreasonable searches. With greater frequency than previously disclosed to the court, NSA analysts have used U.S. person identifiers to query the results of internet upstream collection even though NSA section 702 minimization procedures prohibited such queries. The judges added sternly this is a very serious fourth amendment issue."

Bush, and Juan Williams, Fox News political analyst and cohost of \"The Five.\" James lays it out very well. But the bottom line is that a couple of weeks before the Obama team left the White House, they sort of dump this apology of sorts and said, oh, by the way, we were preaching all of these rules over the course of most of the presidency and we were exposing people on upstream, which mean, you know, you just went on the internet and you queried something or you say something to somebody, not collected as part of any sort of international collection process, they went after it and got it, Karl. So what do you say?"

    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the administration, you're right, fessed up in October of last year that the new rules that it had put in place since 2011 were not being honored. We need to be a little bit careful in how we look at this because with all due respect to Senator Paul, he got it wrong. This is not telephone calls. This is something that goes along in internet backbone provider, a carrier, in which a so-called MCT takes place, multiple communications transactions. So think of it this way, somebody -- there's a great amount of information flowing out there and some American citizen who is not a subject of either a FISA court order or another kind of court order that allows them to be surveilled, somehow talks about or has terms in their emails that have something to do with that greater subject that they are already looking at and looking at legally. So it's incidental contact. The court held a very long opinion that they weren't living up to the rights because they weren't living up to their obligations because they didn't have the technology. They had to make a human decision to avoid touching that person's communication. So they were doing it sloppy. And they fessed up, but they fessed up five years after these new rules went in to place that the administration itself had imposed on itself, and yet is troubling that this went on for as long as it did and as often as it did. Even though in the total amount of information they collected it's a small amount, but it's problematic. They weren't living up to their own standards."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Juan, what do you think? JUAN WILLIAMS, \"THE FIVE\" COHOST: Well, I think -- by the way, Karl just gave a really wonderful description of what it is because this is about collecting information as it's flowing in and out of the country at times, and they're looking to connect the dots. People who may be in contact with terror suspects or somebody, and then they're looking to see who else they have in contact with as that data goes in and out. But, look, every American wants to be protected against terrorism, especially in the White House, I mention Karl might have felt this pressure in his days in the White House. And the intelligence community knows they're being measured on whether or not they prevent the next terror attack. They see this as a tool. They go to the FISA court. The FISA court said you've got to be careful. The constitution protects our privacy, our right to free expression. You can't do this. You get a lot of people on the left like Senator Paul, a libertarian. The ACLU, the nation magazine saying, hey, this is government run amok, but in fact, government is trying to protect us, and so at what point that they go overboard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Here's the problem, I mean, how much of this was for political reasons, Karl, is one of the questions that is raise here. And how much of it was for terrorism because we all know that unfortunately people like the-- brothers in Boston have all the privacy they needed. They have every reason to be caught up in something like this, and yet, they weren't. So who was -- and especially toward the end of the Obama administration, how much of this was politically driven and not terrorism driven, Karl?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, I would have to say this. I think we got to be very careful. I wouldn't trust the Obama White House, particularly in 2016, but I do tend to trust the national security agency. They got sloppy here. They self-reported this. They identified the weakness in their systems, way too late in my opinion. But they are the one who said we're collecting the incidental contact. And, look, it wasn't that we were surveilling -- if that guy abroad emailed somebody inside the United States. That's not the kind of contact were talking about here. They're not really clear in the opinion as to what it is, and I don't want to really have to be clear to us about it. Because I want them to protect the sources and means by which they collect this information. But what it looks like is, is that somebody inside the United States was talking about an email communication or searching somehow for information about something that was connected to something bad abroad, like maybe it was how you make a bomb, but they were just looking at it. They weren't self-radicalized. There wasn't some connection between a bad guy over there."

      "speaker": "MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I just think it's as moral high horse that Comey and his surrogates like to put out in display. I mean, it's not the first time that we've seen James Comey come out and basically create this political drama. You're going to see this probably in the next senate intelligence committee where he will be testifying publicly. You know, his surrogates also have in part of the ability to leak out information on what were in his memos. Of course, it's the memo specifically to Donald Trump and not the other one. This is about James Comey trying to salvage his reputation despite the fact that he's had significant high profile missteps being criticized by both parties, Democrats, Republicans, who have basically said that he should be gone, that he should be fired. So I think that this is nothing new. This is a political game that they're playing. This is to try to keep -- to protect James Comey and to try to destroy President Trump."

Maybe you could just see that as him trying to chum up Comey a little bit. And does not rise to the level of obstruction? I don't know. I think where the president is finding some challenge or the special prosecutors going to have to really dig in here is when you take all these different moments and string them together, when the president did that to Comey, we know that was inappropriate, maybe not illegal."

Look, here's the deal, in that conversation alone when you talk to legal experts, they basically say that there was no intent. When you look at it just based on what you're seeing, even in the New York Times had an opinion piece on it saying that that's not an obstruction of justice. This is why you have the special prosecutor. This is why the special counsel and the Democrats."

Thank you both, Mo and Mercedes, good to have you here today. So President Trump made the Vatican today's major stop on his tour that we've been watching.

And leave the Vatican more determined than ever to pursue peace in our world. Join me now, Pastor Robert Jeffress, has advised President Trump on matters of faith, and he is also a Fox News contributor. Pastor, good to have you with us this evening, thank you for being here.

I mean, the pope fired the first shot, questioning Trump's Christianity because of his proposal to build a wall. He didn't compare the president populism to Nazism. the president responded by calling the pope's words disgraceful. But today, the president and the pope decided to turn the other cheek and when they emerge from that room, they look like BFF's. And I really believe that was the right choice and a wise choice for both of these leaders."

      "speaker": "JEFFRESS",

I remember moderating a meeting between President Trump during the campaign and some never-Trump religious leaders, and they were already before the president came in to give him a piece of their mind. And by the time he came in, he listened politely to everyone. He didn't look at his watch once. And once he had listened to them, he explained his point of view. And at the end of the meeting, Martha, he had them eating out of his hand. And I'm sure today that the president was very disarming and listening to what the pope said. But remember, the pope is also a political animal, as he described himself, and he knew exactly how to disarm the president. So you had two pros at work here today."

Then there's Michelle Kiss, relatives say family was her life. Just hours before her death she posted a sweet image of her daughter ready for the concert. Her daughter, Millie Kiss, was pictured in the arms of a police officer. This image has touched the hearts of millions around the globe. Kelly Brewster died after using her own body to shield her niece from the blast. Marcin and Angelika Klis, both killed while waiting to pick up their two daughters from the concert. Olivia Campbell was 15. Her mom writes that she was taken far too soon, toasting with the angels and keep smiling, mommy loves you so much. That's \"The Story\" tonight. Tucker Carlson is next.
