I want it to be something that the country needs. It's not really an issue. It's something the country needs. It's common sense. The country needs it. We need protection. We need border security. We need security from drugs that are pouring into our country.  They're coming in right through that southern border. And we need a wall. We need border security, and part of border security is a wall. So I don't mind owning that issue.  Chuck's problem is that, you know, when the -- when we last closed down, that was his idea. And, honestly, he got killed. And so he doesn't want to own it, and I said, you know what, rather than us debating who is owning it, I will take it. I will take it. If we close down the country, I will take it, because we're closing it down for border security. And I think I win that every single time.  OK? Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.",

That's kind of how frank it was here. Now, something we have heard in just the past couple of hours is that Republicans in the House of Representatives have been chatting about maybe putting a bill on the floor that they would pass only with Republican votes that would provide $5 billion in wall money.  Now, one of the questions is, if they had the votes, why haven't they done that already? Nancy Pelosi indicated to the president that she said, you know, you guys don't have the votes. The president said, I do. This was something I engaged this morning with House Speaker Paul Ryan. There were two bills that failed earlier this year, different types of bills, mind you, but failed in the House of Representatives, which would have provided, you know, full wall funding. And that's why Democrats are the linchpin right now, Neil. Unless Republicans can put their money where their mouth is and move a bill like that, then they have to have Democratic votes. Now, if they do, then that's a rebuke to Nancy Pelosi, it shows they stand behind President Trump, and then this kick things over to the Senate. Remember that mantra the Schumer shutdown back this winter, when we had the short shutdown. Well, there's only 51 Republicans in the Senate right now. That means that Chuck Schumer would have to bring along nine Democrats. And that's where Republicans might be able to turn this back around on Democrats.   But, still, it remains to be seen if they can get there. It's always pretty dark like this around Christmastime here on Capitol Hill. We had a Christmas Eve morning vote on Obamacare in the Senate a few years ago. We have had the fiscal cliff. We have had other, you know, government shutdown tirades and things. So, a lot of times, they go right up to the precipice. There's a reason why this bill was designed for money to run out on the 21st at 11:59:59 p.m., and maybe get -- you know, get this all fighting out of their system. And then they come together right before Christmas, Neil.",

And, as you said, the Dow did close the day lower but two-tenths of a percent. I mean, we can almost call that unchanged. But this is the fifth day in a row that we have seen a 500- point range for the Dow. If you look at today's activity, of course, the threat of this partial shutdown was a big piece of the puzzle. As we know, by December 21, up to two seven federal agencies are at risk of being closed, are at risk of being furloughed, shut down. So you did have some of that weighing on the markets. And if you want to see the areas that were most affected on the downside, so our viewers can see this red part, you had financials. So Goldman Sachs was one of the bigger weights on the Dow, if you look, as far as industrials as well. That was another area that took a hit on the S&P 500. That showed up on the Dow as Boeing. Looking at some of the bright spots, where you see those green mountains, if you like, pretty defensive, so you had utilities, also consumer staples. These were the groups that really added to the push and pull, one group on one side, one group on the other.  I want to mention as well, as much as we're following this threat of the potential shutdown, there is also the headline of the former Canadian diplomat that was arrested in China. And that actually, for our viewers to see on that intraday chart, was the actual low point of the session, but lots going on for investors to monitor, Neil.",

And we may also for the first time get some insight into what kind of hardship the special counsel investigation has presented for Michael Flynn's family. A number of witnesses in the special counsel probe -- so these are people who aren't even targets -- have said to FOX News that they have spent upwards of $150,000 or $200,000 in legal fees. That is certainly the case for Flynn. Also today, a short time ago, the lawyers for Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, left the court here in Washington, D.C., had a status hearing with the judge there, Amy Berman Jackson. One of the important things that came out of that is that the federal judge wants more information before she decides whether she can side with the special counsel that Manafort has violated his plea agreement with the special counsel on a number of fronts, in particular his communications with the White House. So, Manafort's team will see that as a win. The special counsel will also need to provide more information, Neil.

      "utterance": "Well, when you see Chuck Schumer and President Trump going at it back and forth like that, it kind of reminds you of, you know, two guys on Atlantic Avenue, one guy from Queens, one guy from Brooklyn, arguing about the Yankees and the Mets. That's kind of how frank it was here. Now, something we have heard in just the past couple of hours is that Republicans in the House of Representatives have been chatting about maybe putting a bill on the floor that they would pass only with Republican votes that would provide $5 billion in wall money. Now, one of the questions is, if they had the votes, why haven't they done that already? Nancy Pelosi indicated to the president that she said, you know, you guys don't have the votes. The president said, I do. This was something I engaged this morning with House Speaker Paul Ryan. There were two bills that failed earlier this year, different types of bills, mind you, but failed in the House of Representatives, which would have provided, you know, full wall funding. And that's why Democrats are the linchpin right now, Neil. Unless Republicans can put their money where their mouth is and move a bill like that, then they have to have Democratic votes. Now, if they do, then that's a rebuke to Nancy Pelosi, it shows they stand behind President Trump, and then this kick things over to the Senate. Remember that mantra the Schumer shutdown back this winter, when we had the short shutdown. Well, there's only 51 Republicans in the Senate right now. That means that Chuck Schumer would have to bring along nine Democrats. And that's where Republicans might be able to turn this back around on Democrats. But, still, it remains to be seen if they can get there. It's always pretty dark like this around Christmastime here on Capitol Hill. We had a Christmas Eve morning vote on Obamacare in the Senate a few years ago. We have had the fiscal cliff. We have had other, you know, government shutdown tirades and things. So, a lot of times, they go right up to the precipice. There's a reason why this bill was designed for money to run out on the 21st at 11:59:59 p.m., and maybe get -- you know, get this all fighting out of their system. And then they come together right before Christmas, Neil."

And if there is a government shutdown, Chuck Schumer reminded people that Nancy Pelosi prospectively will have the gavel in early January, and then the House led by Democrats will pass a bill to just re-up all the money at the existing levels and punt it back over to the Senate. So if there is a government shutdown over Christmastime, it's probably going to be in the Senate's bailiwick."

And, as you said, the Dow did close the day lower but two-tenths of a percent. I mean, we can almost call that unchanged. But this is the fifth day in a row that we have seen a 500- point range for the Dow. If you look at today's activity, of course, the threat of this partial shutdown was a big piece of the puzzle. As we know, by December 21, up to two seven federal agencies are at risk of being closed, are at risk of being furloughed, shut down. So you did have some of that weighing on the markets. And if you want to see the areas that were most affected on the downside, so our viewers can see this red part, you had financials. So Goldman Sachs was one of the bigger weights on the Dow, if you look, as far as industrials as well. That was another area that took a hit on the S&P 500. That showed up on the Dow as Boeing. Looking at some of the bright spots, where you see those green mountains, if you like, pretty defensive, so you had utilities, also consumer staples. These were the groups that really added to the push and pull, one group on one side, one group on the other. I want to mention as well, as much as we're following this threat of the potential shutdown, there is also the headline of the former Canadian diplomat that was arrested in China. And that actually, for our viewers to see on that intraday chart, was the actual low point of the session, but lots going on for investors to monitor, Neil."

We're told that up to two people that have been killed, two official deaths reported, eight wounded. Several are in critical condition.

I'm no body language expert, but let's just say it was a little tense. A good deal of the time, Chuck Schumer wouldn't even look at the president. But my favorite of this had to be the vice president of the United States, a very stoic response. They have had some names and other comments to make on the Internet about that, but he's in an uncomfortable position, trying to at least be the ambassador, sort of helping with this process along, betwixt and between, and maybe, just taking a guess here, not wanting to be there at that exact time. But I could be missing that, because, as I said, I read a prompter. I don't read body language. All right, now let's get to read from Washington, Free Beacon's Liz Harrington, Democratic strategist Robert Patillo, and America Majority CEO Ned Ryun. Ned, what did you think of all that?"

I would argue that $5 billion, why are we talking about $5 billion, Neil, when, in fact, it should be about $25 billion? And I think he should shut it all down until he gets full funding. This is one of the reasons he was elected. And I'm staggered by the hypocrisy, Chuck Schumer sitting there -- 2006, he voted for the Yuma sector wall, and now he could barely even tolerate the thought of a billion dollars for our southern security. I hope that Democrats pushed too far on this, Neil, because you're seeing a rise in the poll numbers now. The majority of the American people, regardless of party affiliation, want a southern border wall. And the most interesting statistic I have seen recently..."

I mean, the $5 billion the president wants for this, by the way, which would be just the latest tranche in what would be $25 billion, to Ned's point, for a full-fledged wall along the entire border or something like it. But this is over $3 billion, really, the $1.5 billion or so Democrats have already agreed to, the $5 billion the president wants.

And this might be his last chance with a Republican-led House to get it done, at least a big down payment on the wall, which he has been promising since he went down that escalator. But, yes, I think it's really sad in a way, though, that the mainstream media finds it so remarkable and wild to see our political leaders actually engaging in discussion over policy, and they can't really quite handle it over on the other networks. They are so taken aback. They're much more comfortable, I think, on their shallow palace intrigue stories. But here we have a pretty straightforward debate, $5 billion, not that much, for something that Chuck Schumer himself has voted for.

As we said, it's a $25 billion wall, so what exactly is $5 billion coming from? Why aren't we using -- if we have $5 billion just sitting around, why don't we use that to pay for our homeless veterans? Why don't we use that for educational reform? Why don't we use that for infrastructure? What is this $5 billion going to?

I'm not an isolationist at all, Neil, but when we're spending $50 billion a year on foreign aid, we should start -- just you know what? Let's reduce it by half and build that southern wall. And coming back to what -- where are we going to get this money and the cost, if we're spending $116 billion to $134 billion a year already on illegal immigrants coming into the country, $25 billion seems to me to be a pretty small cost, a one-time cost, when over the next 10 years it could be a trillion dollars."

They were slip-sliding away on the view that, wait a minute, we're looking at a shutdown, all these unknowns, that's not good.

But what we anticipate is really more of an explanation as to why they also believe that he has fully cooperated and is not worthy of any jail time. And we may also for the first time get some insight into what kind of hardship the special counsel investigation has presented for Michael Flynn's family. A number of witnesses in the special counsel probe -- so these are people who aren't even targets -- have said to FOX News that they have spent upwards of $150,000 or $200,000 in legal fees. That is certainly the case for Flynn. Also today, a short time ago, the lawyers for Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, left the court here in Washington, D.C., had a status hearing with the judge there, Amy Berman Jackson. One of the important things that came out of that is that the federal judge wants more information before she decides whether she can side with the special counsel that Manafort has violated his plea agreement with the special counsel on a number of fronts, in particular his communications with the White House. So, Manafort's team will see that as a win. The special counsel will also need to provide more information, Neil.

      "utterance": "All right, let's get the read on all things Bob Mueller and what he's coming up with and all this stuff with that Manafort and Flynn. Former federal prosecutor John Lauro. John, on the Flynn stuff, now, Mueller has recommended no prison time. So he's obviously been deemed to be very, very cooperative with authorities and the Mueller probe. What do you read into that and where this is going, because it's just the opposite when it comes to Manafort?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN LAURO, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "It really is. And Mueller gave Flynn a gift. He basically said that Flynn has done everything I have asked of him, he's cooperated, he has been honest, he's been truthful. So what I would see for Flynn is almost a guaranteed probation sentence. He's not going to jail. His sentencing guidelines are very low, zero to six months. So Flynn is in a sweet spot. Manafort, on the other hand, is in deep, deep trouble. Mueller has said that he's not been honest, he's lied, he's said things that aren't true, he's not fully cooperated. And, as a result, Mueller has taken the position that Manafort has breached his plea agreement, which means that he's now looking at almost, I would say, a guaranteed 10-year sentence. That's what Manafort faces right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "There are a lot of people reading into this where it's going towards the president or if it's heading toward the president. I know these are sort of gut calls based on scant little snippets we get out on a day or days. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAURO",
      "utterance": "It's so hard to tell, because when you look at Mueller's filings, they have mostly black bands across them, so you can't read what they're saying. They're all filed in a way that really doesn't disclose too much. But one thing Mueller has done is kind of teased everyone by saying that Flynn has cooperated in a substantial way in matters relating to the investigation over collusion. So Mueller, for whatever reason, has really signaled that Flynn has provided information that could affect the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What's interesting in the discussions with Michael Cohen, his former personal lawyer, and drawing the president into this Moscow stuff, and building a Trump Tower there, and talking to the Russians, then the separate issue of paying off these -- these two women, is that the inference was that campaign funds were being used for that, which would of course be a big problem. But who's to say campaign funds were used? The president insists it's private money. What do you think of that? Because I think that many just leapt to a conclusion that might be faulty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAURO",
      "utterance": "Yes, the issue with Cohen is whether or not Trump Organization funds, corporate funds were used for these payments, and therefore they had to be disclosed as some kind of campaign contribution. It's a real technical campaign issue, very similar to the case that was brought against John Edwards years ago, you may remember, and that case went down in flames. So these kinds of technical issues, technical campaign issues, are usually handled on the civil side with a fine, rather than on the criminal side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "John Lauro follows this stuff very, very well. Per our Capitol Hill reporter, Mike Emanuel, we're learning now that House Republicans are saying that they're going to put the president's $5 billion border request as a bill on the floor. It's a way of showing, they say, according to Mike, support for the president. The sources are also telling Mike that they're saying it is under consideration. The leadership thinks that it can pass. A senior Republican aide telling FOX moments go, \"Our whips are confident we could pass the $5 billion.\" Now, the president has argued that. The argument against that was that, in the past, other attempts have failed and weren't even launched, for fear that there wasn't enough support between conservatives and Freedom Caucus members, who were leery of doubling down on the spending and the debt associated with this, and moderates who felt that this wasn't the way to go, period. But now, in a show his support for a president in the waning days of this particular Congress, they might take this under -- under issue and decide, well, here it is, Mr. President, our final gift to you, as we leave the majority of the United States House. More after this."

      "utterance": "All right, did you notice Chuck Schumer's little chuckle there as the president says, we have a lot of people who want this position? Well, the president, we're told, is looking at a number of options for that chief of staff post, as John Kelly, General John Kelly, looks to step down by the end of the year. So that was news to us to hear that General Kelly might stay on longer, potentially stay on longer, if that was the implication. So far, there no signs of that. Let's get the read on it from Axios political reporter Shannon Vavra. Shannon, what do you make of this? Where is this search going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHANNON VAVRA, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "President Trump can definitely say that he wants to throw cold water on this and that there's plenty of people interested, but as our reporting at Axios shows, and as my colleague Jonathan Swan scooped this weekend, one of the main folks whose was in the running for this, Nick Ayers, who used to be the chief of staff to Mike Pence, was really the top man for President Trump. And, normally, the way that President Trump deals with staff shakeups is, he has tons of irons in the fire. That's not the case this time, so this is really a different situation than many of the other staff shakeups that have happened. Upwards of 30 people have not departed this administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it could it, be in the case of Ayers, that the president wanted a commitment of two years -- he has 6-year-old triplets, I believe - - and he was in no sort of a mood for that, and that sort of turned things upside down, because the president thought it was a given that he was the guy, and then he pulled the rug out from under him? What are you hearing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAVRA",
      "utterance": "And a lot of folks are reporting that it was a surprise for the president. But, as our reporting shows, there were conversations behind the scenes between Nick Ayers and the president about how Nick Ayers wasn't really on board with a two-year commitment, he wanted to leave sometime in the spring instead. And we also know that the president, from our reporting, wasn't particularly happy with that. He didn't like the fact that Ayers wanting to announce a timeline for serving as chief of staff. And we also know that Nick Ayers was saying, you deserve someone to serve you for two years as chief of staff. So now we know that the president has been talking with confidants about the House Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows, and whether he should be chief of staff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, how serious is that? Obviously, Meadows is interested. He's made that clear. And now the president apparently is at least open to the idea. How real is that?"

      "speaker": "VAVRA",
      "utterance": "It's the only one that Axios has been able to confirm. We know there are three other folks in the running, based on our reporting. But, also, Mark Meadows, his public comments have been positive about it. He said he would be honored, he's honored to be in the running for it. But it's not necessarily him coming out and saying, I definitely want this job right now."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAVRA",
      "utterance": "And the big picture here is, a lot of folks are trying to scramble around and figure out who the president is going to have as chief of staff next. If really John Kelly is departing by the end of the year, that's less than, what, 20 days away now at this point? And the clock is ticking. And on the other hand, it just goes to show us that the president really was depending on Nick Ayers to be his chief of staff, and now everyone's scrambling around to figure out what's next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Now, we have a $4 trillion federal budget, not that it would all be sacrificed here, but is $3.5 billion worth tossing $4 trillion or shutting even some of the government down? After this. Apparently, Stormy has to come up with some money. A judge has ordered Stormy Daniels to pay President Trump $293,000 in attorney's fees for her rejected defamation lawsuit. We will keep you posted whether she has any comments on that -- or the president, for that matter. Let's go to Democratic Congressman from Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi on this shutdown talk.

Because whether it's $5 billion for a border wall, and whether it be perfectly valid for the president to push for that, or some of your Democratic colleagues and a number of other measures, but we're looking at a trillion-dollar deficit and maybe trillion-dollar deficits for a few years running, maybe longer. Who is watching the kitty here?"

      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "You know, I'm very concerned about this. Basically, my humble request would be, let's not spend any money -- any more money on a wall. Let's just do a continuing resolution, which means level-spend or go one more year, and we can hopefully hash things out in the next year. But let's not shut the government down. That's just a bad idea."

Members of the House Judiciary Committee came to this hearing today with their knives sharpened, knowing this might be their only bite at the Apple for a very long time. Their top agenda item? Political bias. Republicans roundly criticizing the search engine for having what they call an anti-conservative bent.

He acknowledged for the first time that, though Google had spent months custom-tailoring a search engine for China, they have got no plans to launch it.
