Plus, Paris is burning. There are riots in the streets. You may have seen something about that on the news. But most news outlets are lying, and they won't tell you why, what this is. Well, it turns out it's a backlash against the climate change agenda, which crushes the middle class of every country, including France. But first tonight, the Mueller probe continues to hurt people who clearly have no connection at all to Russian spying or Vladimir Putin. Writer, Jerome Corsi, for example, who'll join us in just a minute, says that Mueller's prosecutors entrapped him in perjury, and then threatened him with prison, all in an effort to make him compliant.  Corsi says he has rejected a plea deal from Mueller and will be fighting back. Plenty of others, though, on television are confident that this, the Jerome Corsi connection is finally the big breakthrough, not at all like the 10 or 20 other breakthroughs that went nowhere.",

Writer, Jerome Corsi, for example, who'll join us in just a minute, says that Mueller's prosecutors entrapped him in perjury, and then threatened him with prison, all in an effort to make him compliant. Corsi says he has rejected a plea deal from Mueller and will be fighting back.

In this episode, in the Russian-Ukrainian waters occur, it seems clear it was a provocation to disrupt the meeting between Trump and Putin, and it was successful.

      "utterance": "--work, the life that we live. And, Tucker, what's really disturbing to me is we just had the National Climate Assessment published by the Federal Government. And a key part of that report that was touted by The New York Times and CNN said that our economy would be 10 percent smaller by the year 2100, and that thousands of people would die because of climate change. What was not reported, however, is the people behind the study were Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, the two Left-wing billionaires that want to be our next president. They were the ones along with the Federal Government, unfortunately, who financed this study that had no new science, but use very questionable economic modeling to say that things are going to be really bad in 80 years."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "You want to bring home the bacon for your family this year? How about killing two birds with one stone by, I don't know, dropping your kids off at school on the way to work? Well, enjoy those idioms while you can. Vegans might try to banish them. A British Academic called Shareena Hamzah predicts that in a new paper as veganism grows in popularity, animal-based terms of speech could be banned for the sake of sensitivity. Hamzah suggests alternatives like feeding two birds with one scone. You may think vegans have bigger fish to fry than that. But if we've learned anything in recent years it's that, just because something sounds ludicrous doesn't mean it can't happen. Not to beat a dead horse, but this could happen. Well, that's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 P.M., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Hope you've had a great hour.
