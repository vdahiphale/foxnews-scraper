We've also seeing a habit of this administration of saying that they started from scratch when it came to vaccine distribution. They set expectations very low when it came to vaccinating 100 million Americans in the first 100 days when that was the speed that they were given when President Trump left office.

And then you at the election on the back end of that and it gets much, much smaller. And that clip that you played earlier where he is talking about the vaccines and he makes -- and I applaud that, reaching out to Trump supporters and Republicans by giving the credit that Trump deserves for the vaccines.  But you can only wonder how much damage has already been done to the credibility of the vaccines because he didn't say that earlier. But then there's a whole host of other issues where Biden is clearly not being bipartisan on, whether you're talking about the border or some of the language about police and things like that, that it sort of makes you wonder, is he really trying to be the dealmaker that he claims to be?

On the student loan peace, that is a tragic one. That's a hard one, because if you clear the student loans of all the students, I'm not sure you narrow the racial wealth gap because many, many white families, including many who are quite upper income would be included in that. And furthermore, what about future students and the money that they would borrow just to start the whole problem over again? But I think it does, apart from the policy side, it does illustrate that there is unrest or unhappiness or dissatisfaction in various elements of President Biden's progressive coalition.

Seven-day rolling average of deaths currently stands at 588, 71 percent down from three months ago. And the seven average of hospitalizations admissions per day, 2,743, across the country, down 51 percent from the beginning of March. Katie, those stats indicate that a lot of places are changing quickly."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "The stats are wonderful and they can be attributed to Operation Warp Speed, and we are happy that the Biden administration has been able to get these vaccines out to people who want them. However, the president was pretty dishonest today when he started at the January 20th mark when it came to the overall decline in hospitalizations and vaccines when we started seeing that number on January 9th. We've also seeing a habit of this administration of saying that they started from scratch when it came to vaccine distribution. They set expectations very low when it came to vaccinating 100 million Americans in the first 100 days when that was the speed that they were given when President Trump left office. And so I'm glad he gave President Trump at least a little bit of credit today if not by name. But without Operation Warp Speed, we wouldn't be anywhere close to where we are with the numbers that you had up on the screen."

      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "I sure hope so. I think the country badly needs to return to normal. I think -- to my understanding, at least -- many of the most reticent states are moving in that direction. Look, this is unfortunate. Like everything else it got caught up in politics. It got caught up in people's partisan prior beliefs. But I think as the president was trying to indicate today, if that was ever a problem, it's time to move past it. It's time to stop thinking -- that was directed at his own people, too, I think. It's time to stop thinking of this in terms of red and blue and to get these vaccines and to get the country back moving, which is by and large what is happening right now."

Well, because Biden only has the majority of effectively four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Specifically calling out yesterday the Senators Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin from West Virginia, both Democrats, but both, guess what, vote 100 percent of the time with President Joe Biden. Not 90, 85 -- 100 percent of the time they voted with the Biden administration and President Biden. Meantime, today, President Biden met with Republican senator from West Virginia Capito, Shelley Moore Capito, and we don't have a real read out of exactly what happened other than it was constructive and frank, according to the White House. Charlie, that usually doesn't mean big things as far as breakthroughs, \"frank\"."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, \"frank\" is usually not a buzzword for a lovefest in Washington. There is no doubt that Biden is feeling pressure right now. He is feeling pressure not only by the slim majorities that he has, but he also knows that he is probably at best got have a full, complete two year window, which is we already six months in that. And then you at the election on the back end of that and it gets much, much smaller. And that clip that you played earlier where he is talking about the vaccines and he makes -- and I applaud that, reaching out to Trump supporters and Republicans by giving the credit that Trump deserves for the vaccines. But you can only wonder how much damage has already been done to the credibility of the vaccines because he didn't say that earlier. But then there's a whole host of other issues where Biden is clearly not being bipartisan on, whether you're talking about the border or some of the language about police and things like that, that it sort of makes you wonder, is he really trying to be the dealmaker that he claims to be? Or is he just paying lip service to that?"

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Chuck, the White House calling for a month of action. But you look at the possibilities here, you wonder what kind of action is going to happen. In the meantime, the NAACP has a problem with the president not pushing for bigger efforts to clear student loans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's going to be very difficult. Chuck Schumer has said he wants to get this infrastructure bill moving by July. It's going to be very difficult to cut a deal between now and then. And I agree with you guys, constructive and frank is another way of saying we are nowhere near each other. On the student loan peace, that is a tragic one. That's a hard one, because if you clear the student loans of all the students, I'm not sure you narrow the racial wealth gap because many, many white families, including many who are quite upper income would be included in that. And furthermore, what about future students and the money that they would borrow just to start the whole problem over again? But I think it does, apart from the policy side, it does illustrate that there is unrest or unhappiness or dissatisfaction in various elements of President Biden's progressive coalition. And they are the ones I think he is mostly responding to as this goes along."
