So, whenever there was like something awful that would happen and beheading or a terror attack, the Fox would -- the Fox -- the Fox. Fox News would cover it but other cable channels would be obsessed with Islamophobia. So, the phobic response, Dana, it would be actualized attacks which is why they always often denied the signs of organic terror of converted Islamic radicals. So, I don't know. Maybe when -- if Al Qaeda decides to attack, they will identify as white supremacist, which by the way is cultural appropriation.

These are not overdoses. These are poisonings. These victims are not overdosing on Fentanyl. They are doing a different drug that is spike by fentanyl. This is very important that you understand that so you separate it from the drug user or the junkie. Fentanyl is made in China, it has killed everybody from Tom Petty to Prince, to Mac Miller and now Michael Williams, a great actor. And these deaths, you know, these deaths could be prevented but I'll get to that. This was much like what happened with prohibition when alcohol was illegal people were dying from poorly made booze mixed with bad chemicals. The solution was they legalized it and that went away. The big story here is that it's spreading from heroin to coc. So now, if you're a parent with kids in college you can say to yourself, Buffy and Steve (Ph), don't do coc. You don't know that. A lot of kids in college try it once, they try it once in a party, a friend says try it. All it takes is one and Buffy (Ph) is not coming back. So, this is -- this is a -- I mean, all it takes is one line of Fentanyl and you're dead. And this is a -- this is China sponsored terror that's killing tens of thousands of Americans a year. Its street substance is doing the killing, it's not prescription drugs. Yet we're punishing the patients, the cancer patients and the fen patients by telling them they can't get the oxy that they need, they give them tramadol. Give me a break. It's kind of like going after gun control going after law-abiding gun owners instead of the gangs. So, the solution is, identify the problem, it's Fentanyl poisoning imported by China, stateside terror. Two, take out the producers of it as if they are a terror cell. China can help do that, but we could just do it independently. And lay off prescribers and doctors and patients who are not abusing the drug and leave them alone. That's my solution.",

It's not only to keep us safe, their jobs, it's to make us feel safe. And if you look at what happened in Afghanistan clearly but it's also how they have not stood up to China on the Wuhan virus. Tony Blinken met with a Chinese official in March and sat there and let that official lambaste him about the sins of America and he was like, didn't do anything, didn't say anything. So, when is Biden going to stand up to China on the Wuhan virus? And by the way, you can connect the two because Al Qaeda was running bioweapons labs 20 years ago. They probably learned something from the what, four and a half million people who've died worldwide because of a single virus that spread around, it's more than 650,000 Americans?

I think you have to stay on offense. And I wonder if the American people it just feels like right now that they feel like we are on defense and that doesn't feel good. I don't think that's necessarily true. But again, it is also how you feel. Congressman Michael Waltz today said that Afghanistan under the Taliban is now a terrorist super state. And Josh Kraushaar of the National Journal, I highly recommend his column today about the politics about all of this.

So, you wonder, why is it that when the Democrats enter power, we instinctively feel less safe? It's that reason because we'd met the enemy and to them is always going to be us. You know? We've had terror under both parties, but we feel like the Dems are always more concerned about our phobic response to it, right? So, whenever there was like something awful that would happen and beheading or a terror attack, the Fox would -- the Fox -- the Fox. Fox News would cover it but other cable channels would be obsessed with Islamophobia. So, the phobic response, Dana, it would be actualized attacks which is why they always often denied the signs of organic terror of converted Islamic radicals. So, I don't know. Maybe when -- if Al Qaeda decides to attack, they will identify as white supremacist, which by the way is cultural appropriation. Which would be probably the most offensive thing about it to the hard-left progressives. You got to worry about bioterror, cyber terror and what was the last one, attacks on our grid."

In terms of the drop of feelings of security from 64 percent a decade ago down to 49 percent today. Around 9/11 things do get a little antsier for people. You just can't help but be reminded of what's going on. It's obviously across -- every paper you open, any channel you turn to. But now, we have 9/11 plus. Right? We have these images of what's going on actually in a hub of Islamic extremist terror. And that's really compounding things for people. And Greg has mentioned a few times that this was a story that people could largely turn away from over the past few years. I mean, foreign policy and that's obviously thinking about it all the time and it certainly mattered. But now, there is no escaping, basically our worst national nightmare which is what 9/11 was. And I think that that's a very tough thing for a lot of people especially heading into the 20th anniversary. And it's informing how Secretary Mayorkas who, maybe likes Majorca is talking about what's going on, see of the domestic threat which has been huge and prevalent the past few years compounded now with a new foreign threat that we hadn't thought in a long time."

The big story here is that it's spreading from heroin to coc. So now, if you're a parent with kids in college you can say to yourself, Buffy and Steve (Ph), don't do coc. You don't know that. A lot of kids in college try it once, they try it once in a party, a friend says try it. All it takes is one and Buffy (Ph) is not coming back. So, this is -- this is a -- I mean, all it takes is one line of Fentanyl and you're dead. And this is a -- this is China sponsored terror that's killing tens of thousands of Americans a year. Its street substance is doing the killing, it's not prescription drugs. Yet we're punishing the patients, the cancer patients and the fen patients by telling them they can't get the oxy that they need, they give them tramadol. Give me a break. It's kind of like going after gun control going after law-abiding gun owners instead of the gangs. So, the solution is, identify the problem, it's Fentanyl poisoning imported by China, stateside terror. Two, take out the producers of it as if they are a terror cell. China can help do that, but we could just do it independently. And lay off prescribers and doctors and patients who are not abusing the drug and leave them alone. That's my solution."

You can get it basically on Uber Eats or whatever. Door -- it comes right to the door. The first time he ever tried. It was laced with Fentanyl. He died. And they had no hope -- it wasn't like getting him to rehab and helping him. Like, it was just over. But it's amazing how many of these issues actually come back to the border because this is another political albatross that the administration seems to just not -- either not know what to do with or don't care, because one of the things that they keep finding is that while they're produced in China, they're coming across borders -- the port border as well as maybe ports of entry.

That's something that we know about because the feds were able to confiscate it. But this transformation from it becoming something that's used for people who can't get their hands on opioids because they have real pain problems to party drug time is a really tremendous problem in this. And it was interesting, I was reading some accounts from people would actually interview drug dealers about what's going on, and they were saying that there's a supply chain problem in the drug world, just the same way that you can't get lumber to build your houses, that we had gas shortages, etcetera. So, COVID-19 has clamped down on everything. And I thought that that was really interesting. So, they're turning to less expensive alternatives which they're liking.

And Joe Biden has got to do something about this because he is in a unique position because his son was an addict, but he doesn't talk about it. And he actually just reduced sentencing guidelines for illicit Fentanyl traffickers here in the United States. That was his proposal. And he was asked about it on a CNN Town Hall. What are you going to do? And his answer was, we're going to hire more lawyers at the Department of Justice. That's not a strategy. That's patronage. Then he says, oh, yes, it's about China. They got to do something. Well, Joe has to make China do something. And a lot of people are asking questions because Hunter has got a stake worth millions in these Chinese concerns. Is that why Biden hasn't been tough? He had a perfect opportunity to take that lab leak intel report and turn the screws to the Chinese. Instead, they whitewashed it. If that had come out honestly, they could have said, this is on you. You killed 600,000 Americans. We want money. We want accountability. What are you going to do? One of the things Chinese could have done is crackdown on these manufacturers, the drug chemists, and all the shipments that go out. But Biden doesn't use leverage like that. He's not smart enough. So, we still just get washed in through these cartels that bring it through Mexico into the border and we're getting killed. And he's -- it's because of his donors don't want to make waves with the Chinese. He wants to get reelected more than he wants to fight these Chinese drug warriors."

And everybody was like, where did that come from? It turns out this teacher's unions were agitating and giving pressure, and that's when the CDC changes guidance. So, if I were a college student, and I'm looking at European Soccer League, because I know a lot of them do, but I have to watch a lot of it in my house.

It's exactly the opposite of you know, keep calm and carry on. Now, it's keep screaming and carry three masks. But we predicted this when this whole thing started. We said this is going to be a battle between adults who understand benefits and risk analysis, and politicians in media who are too cowardly to deal with risk and do not want to accept risk because they don't want to be blamed.

It's the first apparel sponsorship program that rewards college athletes with real cash payments for their hard work both on and off the field. It has over 1000 athletes participating. So, if you are an athlete in college, and you know a college athlete, and if they want to participate, you have one more week to apply to Rhoback. So, go to rhoback.com and see if you can get a sponsorship deal. And also, THE FIVE, we just hit half a million on Instagram thanks to Greg. Congrats, everybody."
