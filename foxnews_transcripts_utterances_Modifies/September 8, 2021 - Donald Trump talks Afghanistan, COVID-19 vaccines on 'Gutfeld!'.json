When Willie Nelson was told this, he said I'll be 89 next April, jackass. American Crime Story produced by Monica Lewinsky airs on F.X. this week, which I guess answers the age old question, who do I have to sleep with to get my project on T.V.? Yes, 23 years after their affair, Lewinsky says she's still waiting for an apology from Bill Clinton. The differences Bill Clinton is 75 now and these days he honestly can't remember if he had sex with that woman or not. So 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has been behind bars at Guantanamo for over 20 years and still doesn't have a trial date. The good news is prison officials have finally approved his request for a sex change. That would happen. On a similar note, some of the Afghan women considered attacking their new Taliban government with car bombs. But then they remembered that none of them are allowed to drive. Somber. Ruthful. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel is back on the air after taking the summer off. He's missed a lot. Kimmel says if you're not vaccinated, you shouldn't get a hospital ICU bed. But I'm not sure if Jimmy was being sincere because he wasn't crying. Anyway, it's just funny hearing someone say I see you who nobody actually sees. I don't want to suggest that Kimmel show has become boring and predictable. But last night during the taping people in the studio audience were changing the channel. And that's your seven jokes. All right. And now, part one with Donald Trump.",

He was arrested before in a domestic assault case, domestic assault but sprung from jail a couple of weeks prior with money from the Minnesota Freedom Fund. The same group Kamala Harris urged her Twitter followers to donate to during the 2020 campaign. You know, so they could free more mostly peaceful protesters who go on to commit mostly peaceful assaults and murders. Speaking of lefty policies that boosts crime bail reform allowed this guy to allegedly punch out a deaf woman on the New York subway just days after a similar attack. Violent crime has literally become rinse and repeat. Thanks to liberal policies and get used to it, New Yorkers. It's all thanks to the Human Easter Island statue.

When Willie Nelson was told this, he said I'll be 89 next April, jackass. American Crime Story produced by Monica Lewinsky airs on F.X. this week, which I guess answers the age old question, who do I have to sleep with to get my project on T.V.? Yes, 23 years after their affair, Lewinsky says she's still waiting for an apology from Bill Clinton. The differences Bill Clinton is 75 now and these days he honestly can't remember if he had sex with that woman or not. So 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has been behind bars at Guantanamo for over 20 years and still doesn't have a trial date. The good news is prison officials have finally approved his request for a sex change. That would happen. On a similar note, some of the Afghan women considered attacking their new Taliban government with car bombs. But then they remembered that none of them are allowed to drive. Somber. Ruthful. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel is back on the air after taking the summer off. He's missed a lot. Kimmel says if you're not vaccinated, you shouldn't get a hospital ICU bed. But I'm not sure if Jimmy was being sincere because he wasn't crying. Anyway, it's just funny hearing someone say I see you who nobody actually sees. I don't want to suggest that Kimmel show has become boring and predictable. But last night during the taping people in the studio audience were changing the channel. And that's your seven jokes.

He was arrested before in a domestic assault case, domestic assault but sprung from jail a couple of weeks prior with money from the Minnesota Freedom Fund. The same group Kamala Harris urged her Twitter followers to donate to during the 2020 campaign. You know, so they could free more mostly peaceful protesters who go on to commit mostly peaceful assaults and murders. Speaking of lefty policies that boosts crime bail reform allowed this guy to allegedly punch out a deaf woman on the New York subway just days after a similar attack. Violent crime has literally become rinse and repeat. Thanks to liberal policies and get used to it, New Yorkers. It's all thanks to the Human Easter Island statue. Bill de Blasio who replaced if you see something say something with your on your own nobody's listening.

Store employees are helpless to stop them bringing new meaning to the work to the phrase do it yourself. Apparently jails aren't booking shoplifting offenders to cut back on inmate population during COVID. The good news because brazen broad daylight deaths have become so common.

So, all of these people are saying my hands are tied, whereas in Jersey and other places, a judge could step in and say absolutely this guy participated in a hate crime. And in contrary to the classifications that fall under these bail reform, which include horrible things like assault, including some sexual assaults as well involving children, minors and hate crimes. Then they could say this guy needs to be off the street. But this is why -- this is the problem with these overbroad decisions. One size fits all criminal justice reform decisions, when you take away that individualized discretion, then there are hideous consequences, unjust consequences on both sides, right? Unjust attention and unjust release.

They're shocked that Taliban 2.0 doesn't look like that faculty at bass -- basser? Whatever. But with less armpit hair. Perhaps, it's their wokeness that makes them so clueless. For added insult, the new Afghan cabinet includes four Taliban big shots Obama released in 2014, in exchange for Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. That's right.

This is despite the fact that 60 percent of people who did try something new said it made them happier, boohoo. But hey, it can be hard to find the time especially considering how a new study from a cable company found that the average British person will spend 112 days of their lives deciding what to watch on T.V., losers. I guess people just have too many options. That's why I only watch out \"Alf\" re-runs. Clips of life, liberty and living and home videos of myself working out. Tyrus, what are your thoughts?
