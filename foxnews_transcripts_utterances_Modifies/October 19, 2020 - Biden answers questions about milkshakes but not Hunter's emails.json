Hunter Biden's former business associate is sitting in federal prison tonight and he thinks the American public has a right to know about the Biden family corruption. Well, that former business partner, Bevan Cooney, has given written authorization to conservative journalist, Matthew Tyrmand, to publish any and all of the 26,000 emails that, well, they see fit. Tonight, Tyrmand is here with us to share exclusive emails reveling how Hunter and his associates use the Biden name to line their own pockets, of course. Plus, how did Hunter build that relationship with the former mayor of Moscow's wife? The answer ahead.  But first, goodbye, Mr. Nice Guy. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".  So old Joe called a lid early this morning, meaning he is not making any public appearances until the debate on Thursday night. But come on, it doesn't really matter. There is simply no enthusiasm anyway for Biden out there. Well, unless you call this that grounds well.",

Those running the Joe show have always hated Middle America, that's why he was their perfect candidate, kind of like a Trojan horse from the old, slightly more moderate party to push through the new far more radical policies. The marketing of Biden as this nice, normal guy was funded and promoted by some of the most ruthless, the richest people in business, the media and entertainment. And once they get past the election, it's payback time.  Former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich and other liberals are pushing for something called a truth and reconciliation commission. \"When this nightmare is over, it would erase Trump's lies, comfort those who have been harmed by his hatefulness, and name every official, politician, executive, and media mogul whose greed and cowardice enabled this catastrophe.\" Well, the more recent inspiration for all of this goes back to the post- apartheid air in South Africa. In other words, if you voted for or ever supported Trump, you are little better than the same people who threw Nelson Mandela in prison. Their pre-election intimidation squads have also been hard at work in recent days.  Check out what happened at a free speech rally in San Francisco.",

They are the so-called champions of diversity who want to cancel you, frighten you, and even scare your children from holding different views. Of course, on policy Biden will oversee an unending series of these types of punishments, but a lot worse. They intend to pack the courts, make D.C. a state, raise your taxes, outlaw your guns, flood the country with illegal immigrants, just to name a few moves. And of course, using COVID as cover, they will institute draconian lockdowns and other rules nationwide, and that will end up throwing millions out of work. All so they can reset things here in the United States and take power back for themselves.  So I wonder, Joe Biden, this isn't going to be a government of by and for the people. No way. It's going to be a government of, by and for the people who behave, who don't rock the boat, who don't question our trade policy, our health care policy, government-funded abortions, our military expenditures overseas, and our open borders.  Oh, by the way, if you gather to protest the coming lockdowns that destroy your business, they will punish you as well. They might even put you in jail. The Biden puppeteers want the entire country to be like New York and California. They have the people in those states so well-trained, they didn't protest in any large numbers, even after all those people died needlessly in retirement homes after all of those rolling blackouts. The billionaires levitating Biden to Election Day and the elites in the United States media, they always view Trump's America first movement as sort of a Peasants' Revolt, even though it was run by billionaire Trump. And these titans of Wall Street and Silicon Valley, they certainly don't want to have to raise this much money every four years. The punishments both carried out and threatened are also designed to scare off any other rich guy or gal from ever trying to do what Trump tried again. No other first family has endured what the Trump family has; all the lies, the insinuation, the accusations, and the defamation.   How dare they enable a man who ran on exposing and reversing the failed policies of not just the Democrats like Obama and the Clintons, but the Bushes as well? How dare all of you for enabling that? And the closer we get to the election, we will hear a lot from their allies, like something I heard today.

It has been a very bad year for the debate commission and how they have handled things.

They are not going to ask Joe Biden a tough question. They've been singling this quite dramatically for months now. And so it's incumbent upon President Trump to ask and hopefully get answers from Joe Biden. The more constrained the debate is, the more difficult that is.  The other major issue is, this was supposed to be a foreign policy debate. In foreign policy, which is the area where the establishment hates Trump more than any other area, is something that Trump wants to focus on because he's had such a successful, such a really unimaginably successful first- term in terms of foreign policy. And so he would like to focus on that. That's what this debate was supposed to focus on.

And she wanted a JPMorgan bank account, and a brokerage account. And to transact business with their partner's security's firm, Burnham Securities, she needed to get JPMorgan's approval, and she was on a watch list. Over fact the office of foreign asset control run by the treasury in conjunction with state department, watches all of these crony oligarchs and potential criminals around the world and her company, or construction company. She was the wife of the Moscow mayor and she made her money in construction. And the state department was well aware of her Russian mob ties. So she was on unassociated entity watch list, because her company had a huge stake owned by Putin's bank, SberBank, known as the bank of Putin in the Kremlin. So it actually took them a few more weeks than they thought to get this J.P. Morgan account open, and they even talked about going to Morgan Stanley, to bank of California. They eventually got it open, and for them that was a big coup. And there's a lot of traffic about partying and look how we snuck in the backdoor on this one. So they knew what they were doing.",

And Hunter Biden is not the story here. It's Joe Biden that has potential corruptions with Ukraine, and he has repeatedly denied that he's ever met with Ukrainian oligarchs, and yet these emails suggest that he has. And then the next day, \"The New York post\" broke a second story about what appears to be the potential for direct corruption between Joe Biden and communist China, and in particular, an offer from communist China to pay Joe Biden personally millions of dollars. These emails referred to Joe Biden as, quote, the big guy.  And we are two weeks out from an election. When this evidence of potential corruption comes out, what happened next was stunning, because big tech, Twitter and Facebook, decided they didn't want the American people to hear this. And so if any American across the country tried to tweet these stories out, tried to post these stories, big tech blocked the stories. And in fact, they went so far as to block \"The New York Post,\" a major media company, from posting their own stories. As bad as big tech censorship and bias has been, last week marked a major threshold. It's the first time they have directly stepped in and said to the media we are going to censor you, and if we don't like what you are saying, the American people don't get to hear it and you don't get to say it.",

This is King County prosecutor's office, the King County libraries, and the Veterans Administration at Puget Sound.

The marketing of Biden as this nice, normal guy was funded and promoted by some of the most ruthless, the richest people in business, the media and entertainment. And once they get past the election, it's payback time. Former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich and other liberals are pushing for something called a truth and reconciliation commission. \"When this nightmare is over, it would erase Trump's lies, comfort those who have been harmed by his hatefulness, and name every official, politician, executive, and media mogul whose greed and cowardice enabled this catastrophe.\" Well, the more recent inspiration for all of this goes back to the post- apartheid air in South Africa.

They intend to pack the courts, make D.C. a state, raise your taxes, outlaw your guns, flood the country with illegal immigrants, just to name a few moves. And of course, using COVID as cover, they will institute draconian lockdowns and other rules nationwide, and that will end up throwing millions out of work. All so they can reset things here in the United States and take power back for themselves. So I wonder, Joe Biden, this isn't going to be a government of by and for the people. No way. It's going to be a government of, by and for the people who behave, who don't rock the boat, who don't question our trade policy, our health care policy, government-funded abortions, our military expenditures overseas, and our open borders. Oh, by the way, if you gather to protest the coming lockdowns that destroy your business, they will punish you as well. They might even put you in jail. The Biden puppeteers want the entire country to be like New York and California. They have the people in those states so well-trained, they didn't protest in any large numbers, even after all those people died needlessly in retirement homes after all of those rolling blackouts. The billionaires levitating Biden to Election Day and the elites in the United States media, they always view Trump's America first movement as sort of a Peasants' Revolt, even though it was run by billionaire Trump. And these titans of Wall Street and Silicon Valley, they certainly don't want to have to raise this much money every four years. The punishments both carried out and threatened are also designed to scare off any other rich guy or gal from ever trying to do what Trump tried again. No other first family has endured what the Trump family has; all the lies, the insinuation, the accusations, and the defamation. How dare they enable a man who ran on exposing and reversing the failed policies of not just the Democrats like Obama and the Clintons, but the Bushes as well? How dare all of you for enabling that? And the closer we get to the election, we will hear a lot from their allies, like something I heard today.

That is an issue of decency. Whether we have a media that can cover major scandals such as the one that's embroiling the Biden family with how they benefited personally through Hunter Biden's selling of access to his father.

They are not going to ask Joe Biden a tough question. They've been singling this quite dramatically for months now. And so it's incumbent upon President Trump to ask and hopefully get answers from Joe Biden. The more constrained the debate is, the more difficult that is. The other major issue is, this was supposed to be a foreign policy debate. In foreign policy, which is the area where the establishment hates Trump more than any other area, is something that Trump wants to focus on because he's had such a successful, such a really unimaginably successful first- term in terms of foreign policy. And so he would like to focus on that. That's what this debate was supposed to focus on. And having a retread of some previous issues that people didn't really care about that much the first time around is not appropriate when the commander-in-chief is such an important role for our foreign policy and it's something that Americans very much want to hear from their candidates, Laura."

Archer writes \"It won't make a difference on economics other than we bring Hunter into the mix a little but without a commitment. I want to leverage Hunter more and he is a good guy for us to include\". Well, Matthew, from all you've had access to, did Hunter object to being used in this way? Was that his value?"

One of the glaring things that Peter and I saw in these email strings is Hunter CCed a lot, but he doesn't engage very actively, he doesn't have a lot of strategic vision, business acumen. He networks and then brings them clients and partners and investors. And he brought them, apparently, what looks to be a very big one with a Russian oligarch, and it was obviously Hunter that made that happen."

Now, the email - this email was sent by the chairman of a brokerage company to Devon Archer in 2014. \"They said that she, Yelena Baturina is on their watch list, but the fact that there have been no convictions, et cetera, they have approved her.\" But then Jason Galanis made it clear that this approval was unethical at best. He writes \"Leave the back door open, and we will sneak right in\". \"We weaseled a JPMorgan account for the woman's USSR shot put champion.\" Matthew, what is this? And what is Hunter's connection?"

And at that time, the third richest woman in the world would utilize to get her banked in the U.S. So amidst what was going on, you saw instability in Ukraine and there was a lot of Russian money trying to get out of Europe, Central Europe, especially Russia and Ukraine. And she wanted a JPMorgan bank account, and a brokerage account. And to transact business with their partner's security's firm, Burnham Securities, she needed to get JPMorgan's approval, and she was on a watch list. Over fact the office of foreign asset control run by the treasury in conjunction with state department, watches all of these crony oligarchs and potential criminals around the world and her company, or construction company. She was the wife of the Moscow mayor and she made her money in construction. And the state department was well aware of her Russian mob ties. So she was on unassociated entity watch list, because her company had a huge stake owned by Putin's bank, SberBank, known as the bank of Putin in the Kremlin. So it actually took them a few more weeks than they thought to get this J.P. Morgan account open, and they even talked about going to Morgan Stanley, to bank of California. They eventually got it open, and for them that was a big coup. And there's a lot of traffic about partying and look how we snuck in the backdoor on this one. So they knew what they were doing."

And Hunter Biden is not the story here. It's Joe Biden that has potential corruptions with Ukraine, and he has repeatedly denied that he's ever met with Ukrainian oligarchs, and yet these emails suggest that he has. And then the next day, \"The New York post\" broke a second story about what appears to be the potential for direct corruption between Joe Biden and communist China, and in particular, an offer from communist China to pay Joe Biden personally millions of dollars. These emails referred to Joe Biden as, quote, the big guy. And we are two weeks out from an election. When this evidence of potential corruption comes out, what happened next was stunning, because big tech, Twitter and Facebook, decided they didn't want the American people to hear this. And so if any American across the country tried to tweet these stories out, tried to post these stories, big tech blocked the stories. And in fact, they went so far as to block \"The New York Post,\" a major media company, from posting their own stories. As bad as big tech censorship and bias has been, last week marked a major threshold. It's the first time they have directly stepped in and said to the media we are going to censor you, and if we don't like what you are saying, the American people don't get to hear it and you don't get to say it."

And Lindsay said, I'll tell you what, let's go out to the TV cameras right now and let's announce that we are going to vote next week, which is now this current week, on subpoenas for Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, to come testify before the election and explain what the hell he's doing, why they are interfering with the election, why they are trying to censor the press. And we are going to get Twitter and I believe Facebook both, Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg, to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we need more answers before the election, because this is dangerous.

Chris Rufo, \"City Journal\" contributing editor joins us now. Chris, what have you found now, pray tell? CHRIS RUFO, \"CITY JOURNAL\" CONTRIBUTING EDITOR:  What I found is that at least three Seattle area government agencies are racially segregating employees as part of their human resources programs. This is King County prosecutor's office, the King County libraries, and the Veterans Administration at Puget Sound. They are now conducting these courses that they are taking, white employees, black employees, and mixed people of color employees, and actually segregating them by race, which is not only extreme and insane, but it's also likely a violation of the Civil Rights Act."

One source told me these sessions felt like a firing squad. Another said that she was disgusted and that we're going backwards. And it's especially egregious that the King County prosecutor's office, which is filled with attorneys, would brazenly violate the Civil Rights Act.

And a couple of months ago, students at NYU reportedly made similar demands. This mindset is filtering down to college kids. There are black fraternities and, Alpha Phi Alpha, and black sororities.
