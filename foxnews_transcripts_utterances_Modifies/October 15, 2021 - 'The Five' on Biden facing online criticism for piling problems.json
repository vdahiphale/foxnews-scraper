We can't afford to let people go wondering where they're going to get their  next meal. And so right now, hungry today and about scarce, it's about massive failure in leadership.",

But I did a little bit more research on this  problem with the port in California specifically having all of these shipping containers not being unloaded.  Well, leave it to leftist policies in California to compound problems that Democrats have put on the federal level. Remember that California passed   AB-5 which eliminates private contractors essentially because they have to  be classified as employees. Well, it turns out there's a lot of private contractors who drive trucks and in California there's 75,000 of them. So there's this problem now where   these companies are trying to off-load stuff to get it across the country, can't find workers and drivers who have trucks because California reclassifies them as full-time employees even though they're private   contractors.  The White House this week actually has taken the idea that they want to unionize these guys. They're arguing that workers are being mistreated,  that they need to be in a union. But these contractors are saying no we just want to work for the people we want to work for and a lot of us have  trucks and we're unable to do that as a result of your policies.  So, that is one of the main reasons why you're also seeing a lack of this  stock across the country. One more thing. I mean, Joe Biden said this week that people are going to work throughout the night on the highways, right,  they're going to clear out highways, to hire truck drivers? Where are you going to find the workers if you have all these independent contractors who can't work as a result of this law that California passed two years ago.",

The ruling class in this country and all over the world, they don't want this generation that educated. They want them educated enough so they can do menial jobs and kind of entry level management. But they don't want them intelligent so they start asking questions like, where are all the hundreds of billions of dollars that are going into these public-school systems that keep failing? Why don't they teach economics in school? Why do they keep failing students and then graduating them to the next class? And you wonder why people can't do math, and then you realize that they're teaching you that math is racist. So there are powerful people in this country that don't care about education. They want indoctrination. They want people mad at the other race. And they want them kind of divided so they're distracted and dumb so they're not seeing what the ruling class is doing, raiding the treasury, opening the boarders and sending all the jobs to China.",

And there are a lot of Democrats who are pro charter school, I would mind you to even look at Michelle Rhee's work, obviously it's a great example of that. They're definitely failing in the public-school system.

And Eric Adams came out and said, a, I don't think you can do that, and b, I would never do that.

When you look at these numbers, it's like, how are these kids ever going to be able to get that time back? How are they ever going to catch up, especially when you have unions who repeatedly, over the past year, whenever there was a compromise made for them to get back to the class room they threw up another roadblock, we want more money, we want more vaccines, we want this, we want that. And then parents who dared to say, well, we would really like our schools to be open and we think some of these COVID restrictions are pretty ridiculous considering that you guys were vaccinated and put in front of the line, and then they were doxed, and then they were shut out of school board meetings. And then when parents found out what they were actually teaching their children because of the Zoom calls, the Zoom learning, they were then called racist and bigoted. And so, you know, one silver lining of this may be that there is a new school choice revolution that is happening. You had a school board member today in Louden County resigned as a result of parent --parental involvement.

When it comes to these kinds of decisions, you see that there is a marked difference between the people who serve President Obama and what they think about these things versus the people who are serving in the Biden administration. And I know that that's something that really consumes them interpersonally as well for those who are carryovers.",

The president getting ridiculed online as hash tag empty shelves Joe over the supply chain crisis he waited too long to fix. And as if that wasn't bad enough gas prices are up 10 percent in just the past month, the highest level in seven years.

But I did a little bit more research on this problem with the port in California specifically having all of these shipping containers not being unloaded. Well, leave it to leftist policies in California to compound problems that Democrats have put on the federal level. Remember that California passed AB-5 which eliminates private contractors essentially because they have to be classified as employees. Well, it turns out there's a lot of private contractors who drive trucks and in California there's 75,000 of them. So there's this problem now where these companies are trying to off-load stuff to get it across the country, can't find workers and drivers who have trucks because California reclassifies them as full-time employees even though they're private contractors. The White House this week actually has taken the idea that they want to unionize these guys. They're arguing that workers are being mistreated, that they need to be in a union. But these contractors are saying no we just want to work for the people we want to work for and a lot of us have trucks and we're unable to do that as a result of your policies. So, that is one of the main reasons why you're also seeing a lack of this stock across the country. One more thing. I mean, Joe Biden said this week that people are going to work throughout the night on the highways, right, they're going to clear out highways, to hire truck drivers? Where are you going to find the workers if you have all these independent contractors who can't work as a result of this law that California passed two years ago."

The ruling class in this country and all over the world, they don't want this generation that educated. They want them educated enough so they can do menial jobs and kind of entry level management. But they don't want them intelligent so they start asking questions like, where are all the hundreds of billions of dollars that are going into these public-school systems that keep failing? Why don't they teach economics in school? Why do they keep failing students and then graduating them to the next class? And you wonder why people can't do math, and then you realize that they're teaching you that math is racist. So there are powerful people in this country that don't care about education.

And there are a lot of Democrats who are pro charter school, I would mind you to even look at Michelle Rhee's work, obviously it's a great example of that. They're definitely failing in the public-school system. The impact of not only Zoom school but the mental health strain of the last 18 months on young people, I'm sure, is going to continue to factor into these testing results. And living here I've been following closely, obviously what Eric Adams who will be our mayor come election day here in New York City has been saying and Mayor de Blasio has talked about eliminating our gifted and talented programs. And Eric Adams came out and said, a, I don't think you can do that, and b, I would never do that. And I think that keeping the standards makes such a difference, especially in helping along the kids who are succeeding in these systems and also identifying the kids who may need a little bit of extra help.

Because if you look at the consequences and all the data whether it's mental health or test scores, this was obvious in summer of 2020. You had Senator Rand Paul have an exchange with Dr. Fauci in May of 2020 saying hey, we really need schools to be open in the fall because there will be consequences, especially for minority students if we don't do that, whether it's mental health or their education, falling behind and they'll never going to be able to make it up. When you look at these numbers, it's like, how are these kids ever going to be able to get that time back? How are they ever going to catch up, especially when you have unions who repeatedly, over the past year, whenever there was a compromise made for them to get back to the class room they threw up another roadblock, we want more money, we want more vaccines, we want this, we want that. And then parents who dared to say, well, we would really like our schools to be open and we think some of these COVID restrictions are pretty ridiculous considering that you guys were vaccinated and put in front of the line, and then they were doxed, and then they were shut out of school board meetings. And then when parents found out what they were actually teaching their children because of the Zoom calls, the Zoom learning, they were then called racist and bigoted. And so, you know, one silver lining of this may be that there is a new school choice revolution that is happening. You had a school board member today in Louden County resigned as a result of parent --parental involvement. And so again, just generally, you can apply the standard of did we see this coming a year ago? We did. And because everybody listened to Anthony Fauci, this is the consequence that was warned about."

I thought there was much more homework. They work, and everybody I talk to, I can't believe how much homework these kids had. I don't think they had it easy, and I don't -- I have to see where these targeted scores are and why they're not producing results. But I think you have -- there's a -- what you're saying is correct, too, is that, we're putting a lot of money into these schools and it's not necessarily Democrat or Republican, Jessica, that talks about charter schools.

There were contradictions of what those conversations out of the White House had been saying. And I would add to what Bob Gates said. I'd offer up also Leon Panetta who looked almost tearful in a conversation with Neil Cavuto here on our network talking about what's gone on. And you know, he's someone who's been talking about these issues obviously for a long time. And as a Democrat, one thing that I notice especially when it comes to foreign policy is this fissure between the Obama administration and the Biden administration. Usually, it's the Obama-Biden administration, right, eight years together, bros, et cetera. When it comes to these kinds of decisions, you see that there is a marked difference between the people who serve President Obama and what they think about these things versus the people who are serving in the Biden administration.

And there is a bipartisan push to try to get answers on that because we have 13 people that a lot of folks think their lives absolutely did not need to be put in that position, that they were risked and that they were lost. So, there are people that are still there. We have all talked with people who are working over there. And I still get texts today from special ops veterans who are still working.

University of Florida -- I'm a Seminole, these are Gators, but hey they have good information. And they said they've been tracking these trends. They say the chief epidemiologist there tracking these big football games because they have big football games in Florida. He says, not seeing any COVID ramifications.

But then they screw it up and they go too far, especially Democrats, and implement all these things that people say are -- you know, we could have done a year ago, they're not applicable now. And when you go from 15 days to slow the spread to a year and a half later of take a vaccine or lose your livelihood in your job and the ability to feed your children, I think people probably think you're going too far. But it also goes to the fact that just this week, the Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Joe Biden is taking advantage of this crisis to try and implement his $3.5 trillion agenda because they still think that people are in crisis mode and they want the government to handle things and take care of them. But they've proven on a lot of these things that they've screwed up, they've missed the mark, and they're going way too far when it comes to controlling people's lives a year and a half a half after this happened."

So, would you -- do you want less government in your life, yes or no? But if you go to the individual issues, there are a lot of places where Americans, the overwhelming majorities actually do want government in their lives. Like, you have polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation that even show a majority of Republicans want a public option for instance. They want expansion of Medicare. You have majorities of Americans that are for vaccine mandates. You have people who are pro-masking, et cetera. So, you have to be careful about just saying this means you know Joe Biden has had a terribly, you know, six months in office and they're turning against the idea of big government. It's the individual policies that count. Regulation has always been a place where people want the red tape cut.
