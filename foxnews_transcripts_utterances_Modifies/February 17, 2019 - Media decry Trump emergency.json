The fact is we do have a national emergency at the border. And the fact is that that's sustained by the coverage of the humanitarian crisis that has been going on there for a long time. On the very evening that President Trump gave his remarks in El Paso, we had 1,800 different family units who were coming to border patrol along the border including 316 in one border patrol location west of El Paso where you had an enormous group of family people to the point that the border patrol had to move ATVs out of a garage to find a place for them to sleep at night. It is a humanitarian crisis.  That being said, these national emergency declarations are not things that should happen. The 1976 National Emergency Act should be something that Congress should address because presidents shouldn't have the power to do this kind of thing.

Bezos's team cooperated with a sympathetic story about the couple in another AMI publication, Us Weekly, providing codes to (ph) unnamed sources and arranging paparazzi photos of Sanchez. The intermediary was Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother, who despite initial rumors has not been found to have leaked the intimate photos of Bezos to the Enquirer. He called that 100 percent false, saying he has been trying to protect Jeff and Lauren's relationship. And the suspect now includes several girlfriends with whom Lauren shared the pictures and texts. As a sign of trust, Bezos wanted the Enquire to stop this steady drip of texts and photos about him and Lauren Sanchez. To prove they weren't planning a second straight cover on the affair, an AMI executive provided the Bezos team with an advance image of the next week's cover which was about George Clooney's marriage. The breach of security was so unusual that the Bezos intermediary asked AMI whether it was real or fake. The gesture led to steady stream of calls and messages between the two sides. I've had access to evidence that these were essentially settlement talks although the Bezos side says it was simply responding to extortion. Bezos also ordered his team to stay quiet, stop feeding the coverage. Stop responding to journalists' questions, he said. Stop engaging with the media even if you're trying to correct a bad story. During this period, my sources say Bezos mused about buying American media perhaps for $1 billion or more, shutting down the Enquirer and beating up other magazines but decided this was too risky. Both sides made legal threats. The Bezos team demanded that no more of his photos and texts be published and that AMI stop smearing Gavin de Becker, his longtime security chief. AMI wanted Bezos and his Washington Post to stop saying that the Enquirer owned by David Pecker, the close friend of President Trump who as we know can't stand Jeff Bezos, had a politically-motivated hit job in the piece. The billionaire never planned to agree to that. After the Bezos team asked AMI to make a settlement proposal, according to my sources, AMI sent a letter that included the infamous description of below the belt selfies and other X-rated pictures of Bezos. AMI views that this was simply putting what it had on the table. But the problem is it read like a threatening letter, allowing Bezos to blow up the talks by accusing the company of blackmail. AMI executives denied that. But people on both sides believe that Bezos shrewdly led them into a trap. American Media would like the story to fade but there is one complication, federal prosecutors are now looking into the matter. You can read my full report right now at FoxNews.com.

      "utterance": "Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Ben Domenech, the founder and publisher of The Federalist; Beverly Hallberg, president of District Media and a former television producer; and Philippe Reines, former State Department official under Hillary Clinton. Ben, the media is covering this emergency declaration as a shocking and outrageous abuse of power that shatters constitutional norms. Fair or unfair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEN DOMENECH, FOUNDER AND PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "No, that's very unfair. I mean, the fact is that we have a number of national emergencies going on for a number of different reasons. President Obama didn't have to declare a national emergency when he waved his hands to find funding that was never allocated by the Congress when it came to the Obamacare exchanges which is going to dwarf the funding that is involved in this situation. The fact is we do have a national emergency at the border. And the fact is that that's sustained by the coverage of the humanitarian crisis that has been going on there for a long time. On the very evening that President Trump gave his remarks in El Paso, we had 1,800 different family units who were coming to border patrol along the border including 316 in one border patrol location west of El Paso where you had an enormous group of family people to the point that the border patrol had to move ATVs out of a garage to find a place for them to sleep at night. It is a humanitarian crisis. That being said, these national emergency declarations are not things that should happen. The 1976 National Emergency Act should be something that Congress should address because presidents shouldn't have the power to do this kind of thing. But under the law, what the president did is constitutional and is legal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Of course it will be tested in court. We will come back to you. Beverly, the press is accurate of the reporting that some prominent Republicans, Chuck Grassley, Rand Paul, Susan Collins and others, are opposed to this declaration and felt blindsided. So, that is not just punditry. I mean, that's reporting that people are saying on the record."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVERLY HALLBERG, PRESIDENT, DISTRICT MEDIA GROUP",
      "utterance": "I don't think they are necessarily blindsided. We know that this was a possibility from Trump even when the shutdown happened. But I would agree Republicans look at this and say we don't like it when Obama did it, we didn't like when he sometimes would use executive authority. And by the way, the media never covered it the same way as we are seeing this coverage now. I think one of the problems with the coverage for President Trump is that actually he changed the news cycle that was very favorable to him. You had what happened in Virginia with the scandals there. You also have the New Green Deal which is very positive when it came to Republicans and Trump because it out the (ph) Democrats in what they really thought --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, he had no choice he had a deadline. The government was going to shut down. They're going to find some funding. Philippe, on that point, the press constantly points out that Republican made the very same charge against Barack Obaman when he had the executive order protecting the dreamers, going too far in running Congress. Doesn't that limit the ability of liberals now to criticize this president?"

    {
      "speaker": "PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL UNDER HILLARY CLINTON",
      "utterance": "No, not at all, and I think, you know, Ben did a better job of conveying why there should be an emergency than Trump at all if he missed the sing (ph) song recital of it. The problem here has been what has been for two years now, that immigration is the third rail in Republican politics and Trump keeps touching it. And a number of the pundits who showed whether it was Sean Hannity or Ann Coulter, they are the ones being most vicious about him. They are the ones who are driving. You can't say that the left or mainstream media is over- covering or being overly critical when all they have to do is show a tweet from Ann Coulter saying that he's --"

      "utterance": "Seriously, President Obama didn't declare a national emergency when he did what he did with the dreamers. He just did the same thing that he did in so many other areas, pen and phone leadership, that totally washed away the -- the problem here is that for decades, the Congress has been derelict in dealing with the immigration issue because they do not agree with what their base wants to do on this issue. That is something that President Trump exploited when he was candidate Trump. It was one of the reasons that he is in the White House today and it is the reason that he have to do this again. Because for two years, congressional Republicans didn't want to go along with what he wanted to do, a big priority for him. They didn't want to actually consent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Beverly, the storyline in the days before the emergency declaration was Trump got rolled. He is only getting $1.3 billion from the Democrats. It is less than he could have gotten before the 35-day shutdown. And yet he was sort of saying, well, you know, acting like it's a victory. And this is not just on the left. Laura Ingraham on Fox called the measure that the president ultimately signed a total scam. So, are the media right at least on that part that the president put himself in a box and ended up settling for very little money?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "I think many people when he decided to end the shutdown said this is a lost for him, so I think there is accuracy with that. But going back to what Ben said, I think that he is actually dealing with an issue that Democrats want a border security, Republicans have wanted this as well, and he is in a tough position. But there is a double standard. Let's not go forget that the media did report that Obama did build 97 miles of border fencing. And also in 2014, he came out and actually asked for funding for the humanitarian crisis at the border. His word of crisis is never critiqued by the mainstream media. So, when it is Obama wanting to do this, everything seems fine but not with this president --"
    },
    {

      "utterance": "After the National Enquirer revealed the affair between Jeff Bezos and television personality Lauren Sanchez, the Amazon founder secretly arranged a ceasefire with parent company, American Media, Inc., according to my sources. Bezos's team cooperated with a sympathetic story about the couple in another AMI publication, Us Weekly, providing codes to (ph) unnamed sources and arranging paparazzi photos of Sanchez. The intermediary was Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother, who despite initial rumors has not been found to have leaked the intimate photos of Bezos to the Enquirer. He called that 100 percent false, saying he has been trying to protect Jeff and Lauren's relationship. And the suspect now includes several girlfriends with whom Lauren shared the pictures and texts. As a sign of trust, Bezos wanted the Enquire to stop this steady drip of texts and photos about him and Lauren Sanchez. To prove they weren't planning a second straight cover on the affair, an AMI executive provided the Bezos team with an advance image of the next week's cover which was about George Clooney's marriage. The breach of security was so unusual that the Bezos intermediary asked AMI whether it was real or fake. The gesture led to steady stream of calls and messages between the two sides. I've had access to evidence that these were essentially settlement talks although the Bezos side says it was simply responding to extortion. Bezos also ordered his team to stay quiet, stop feeding the coverage. Stop responding to journalists' questions, he said. Stop engaging with the media even if you're trying to correct a bad story. During this period, my sources say Bezos mused about buying American media perhaps for $1 billion or more, shutting down the Enquirer and beating up other magazines but decided this was too risky. Both sides made legal threats. The Bezos team demanded that no more of his photos and texts be published and that AMI stop smearing Gavin de Becker, his longtime security chief. AMI wanted Bezos and his Washington Post to stop saying that the Enquirer owned by David Pecker, the close friend of President Trump who as we know can't stand Jeff Bezos, had a politically-motivated hit job in the piece. The billionaire never planned to agree to that. After the Bezos team asked AMI to make a settlement proposal, according to my sources, AMI sent a letter that included the infamous description of below the belt selfies and other X-rated pictures of Bezos. AMI views that this was simply putting what it had on the table. But the problem is it read like a threatening letter, allowing Bezos to blow up the talks by accusing the company of blackmail. AMI executives denied that. But people on both sides believe that Bezos shrewdly led them into a trap. American Media would like the story to fade but there is one complication, federal prosecutors are now looking into the matter. You can read my full report right now at FoxNews.com. Next on \"Media Buzz,\" Andrew McCabe gets a \"60 Minutes\" platform to talk about Donald Trump and the 25th Amendment. How sceptical is the coverage?

And we're back with the panel. Ben Domenech, so McCabe has got this book out. He goes to Scott Pelley. And he says look, the cabinet actually had discussions about evoking the 25th Amendment against President Trump in early 2017.

And he is a guy, I think, that we have to take everything that he says with a grain of salt. But keep in mind, what he's really doing in this context, which is he's engaging in public spin to try to boost his image knowing that you know frankly these charges were referred to prosecutors to look for potential indictments.

When the New York Times, Philippe Reines, reported that Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, had offered to wear a wire and secretly record the president during the same period, early 2017, Rosenstein kind of dismissed this sarcastically, I wasn't really serious.

And I've seen the same conversation on other networks about he has said this, should we believe him. I would hope Scott Pelley would have straight out said, Andy, why should we believe you, given that you were fired. Now, that doesn't mean that the next answer just because you're saying is credible, the answer is no. The answer is let's just look at all the facts. And I think when we have all the facts, Rosenstein might have been trying to get himself out of trouble."

So it's going to -- I think there's going to be more tell-all books. And I think the mainstream media is always happy for someone who is critical of Trump to have them on their show, maybe The View, maybe Good Morning America.

Remember, he has already been convicted twice about a meeting, when he was still running the campaign in 2016 with a Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian operative. He's going to prison for a long time. In fact, Mueller's office just recommended a sentence of 19 to 24 years. But it still leaves open the question about whether Donald Trump knew any of this."

    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",

But I think we have to keep in mind the larger context of this, which is that the public was sold a story about President Trump and his relationship with Russia that we know at this point as simply hasn't been held up by the facts. It does not exist in the format it was sold to the American people. Now, I do think that Paul Manafort was a bad guy, was engaged in a lot of shady characters, and did a lot of shady things. Frankly, that's not news to anyone who has been in Washington over the past couple of decades about Manafort. And I'm not surprised that we continue to see that he engaged in behavior that you know frankly runs afoul of the deals that he has negotiated, et cetera."

Here's the tweet, nothing funny about SNL on fake news NBC. The question is, how did the network get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution like other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. It's a comedy show."

      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "It is a comedy show, though the comedy has largely been absent in the recent years, unlike when you bring it back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, there's no question that Alec Baldwin is a liberal who wants to drive President Trump from office, but, you know, again, it's a comedy show."

    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "He should take a note from Representative Dan Crenshaw, who did go on. And I even think he may have won this race because of the popularity, self-deprecating humor goes a long way."

    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "He did. He wasn't funny. I think whoever is in office gets the wrong end of the SNL stick, whether it is a Democrat or Republicans. Bill Clinton was running around eating hamburgers. That's one of the funniest stuffs they ever did."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I don't know about that. Philippe Reines, Beverly Hallberg, Ben Domenech, great to see you all this Sunday. After the break, a really strange press conference on the border emergency, the president was going at it with Jim Acosta and others, and the president of his conservative media allies. And later, Bob Costas takes on NBC."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "When President Trump took to the Rose Garden Friday, it took him more than 10 minutes, at least, to get to his announcement of a border emergency. And then came the inevitable clash with reporters including CNN Jim Acosta."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you're concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "Ask the angel moms. What do you think? Because your question is a very political question. Because you have an agenda. You are CNN, you're fake news, you have an agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now here in Washington, Emily Jashinsky, culture editor at The Federalist, and in Florida, Cathy Areu, a contributor to Romper.com and a former Washington Post magazine editor. I think the president knows what happens when he calls on Jim Acosta. He is going to get some kind of confrontation. He has done this in the past. But it gives him something to push back on because he knew he had a difficult argument to sell with the emergency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST CULTURE EDITOR",
      "utterance": "So, there is a reason that President Trump routinely calls on Jim Acosta. And you're exactly right, it's because there's always going to be a clash, no matter what. Because Acosta -- the president is right, absolutely has an agenda. And the agenda is trying to get a clip that he can put on social media, that will be played, and everyone will be talking about it. We'll be talking about Jim Acosta. With that being said, he is of course right to push the president to come up with a factual basis for his claims. Absolutely. But there's a reason that for both parties, for CNN and for Donald Trump, these press conferences where those clashes happen are good on ends. They both like it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's a certain degree of synergy. The same thing happened moments later, Cathy, with CNN contributor Brian Karem who got into a testy exchange. And he said, where do you base your facts on? The president said look, I get my facts from a number of places like Homeland Security. And the numbers I get from Homeland Security are a disaster. So, he did get a kind of an admission that the president -- that he doesn't buy the government statistics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CATHY AREU, ROMPER.COM CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Exactly. But the reporters in this case were respecting I think the situation. It wasn't like there was a clash. This wasn't typical Acosta, this wasn't typical reporters attacking the president. He was asking for a national emergency, making quite a big deal on words we haven't heard since 9/11. So reporters have a right to ask tough questions. And he had to answer those tough questions. And his answers didn't even respect the establishment, the press itself. He didn't respect the press with appropriate answers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Emily."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "He gave no answers. I'm sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "I would say that was typical Acosta. It may have not been that Acosta. The president -- you know, they are both within their rights. The press should be asking the president tough questions and a lot of people in the country want to see is the president calling him out, when they do come out with an agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me jump in and show you this. NBC's Kelly O'Donnell asked the president about how influential his conservative media supporters. Here's part of what he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do. Not of me. If I changed my views, he wouldn't be with me. Rush Limbaugh, I think is a great guy. He said I could speak for three hours without a phone call. Try doing that some time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The president answered the question by praising two of the people who are most often on his side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "I thought what was really interesting is how eager the president was to answer this question, because it's one of these like talking points that's conventional wisdom here in Washington. People say this is the Coulter presidency -- if this Coulter presidency, the Hannity presidency, the Drudge presidency, this man would have been governing dramatically differently for the past two years. And so, that's I think why the president is eager to tackle that. Because it's just not true. He consults with them, sure, absolutely. He's happy to admit that. But he's not governing based on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "By the way, Hannity said it was stupid and inaccurate, that notion, that people on other channels are saying that he tells the president what to do. They talk. I mean, obviously, they do. All right. So, Ann Coulter, who was a big supporter on immigration, now, she has turned critical on him. So, the president was asked about Ms. Coulter as well. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Ann Coulter, I don't know her. I hardly know her. I haven't spoken to her in way over a year. But the press loves saying Ann Coulter. Probably, if I did speak to her, she would be very nice. I just don't have the time to speak to her. So I like her. But she is off the reservation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And to underscore that point, here is a brief clip of Ann Coulter responding in a radio interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANN COULTER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Forget the fact that he's digging his own grade. Look, the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, Cathy, is the president right that the press loves to quote Ann Coulter, especially now that she's being so critical of Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Yes But He did her a huge favor. She is not affiliated with any news organization. She is not affiliated with Fox, CNN. She's an entrepreneur. She is an author and she needs publicity. So for the President of the United States to go on and on about Ann Coulter, and giving her an opportunity to reply and call him an idiot, what a favor, what a wonderful gift to an entrepreneur like Ann Coulter. He did -- he did something so nice for her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So that similar to Emily's response, when the clashes come, they both get something out of it. The pundits, the commentators get something. The president I think sometimes gets the foil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He loves to counter punch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "He does know that. But this narrative that Ann Coulter has suddenly switched and is now anti-Trump. This has been happening for more than a year. She has been displeased with him for more than a year. And so, anybody who believes that this is the Coulter presidency is not paying any attention to Ann Coulter. And that's why again, I think the president was eager to tackle this head on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Cathy, I have to praise you for your restrain and embracing the Ann Coulter insult, but instead giving a high-minded answer to Ann Coulter's response."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "I did not call him an idiot. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. You can't do better than that. Cathy Areu, Emily Jashinsky, thanks so much for cramming a lot into this segment. Still to come, I spoke to veteran sportscaster, Bob Costas, about his revelation that NBC benched him of last year's Super Bowl because of his criticism of football's damaging effects. That's next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Bob Costas who spent four decades with NBC Sports has now revealed why he wasn't in the booth during last year's Super Bowl. Costas have told ESPN's Outside the Lines that NBC benched him because of his public criticism of the NFL and the damage many players have suffered from concussions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOB COSTAS, AMERICAN SPORTSCASTER",
      "utterance": "I think the words were, you've crossed the line. My thought was, what line have I crossed? And I remember reminding them of things going back to the 90s of what I had done, what credibility I would have to comment about these things. And their reaction to that was, you're right, you're right. But this puts us in a position that's untenable for us. So you can't do the Super Bowl."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Costas told me he was relieved by the decision. And he had given up football a year earlier. And he agreed he wasn't the right guy to preside over a day-long celebration of football. Joining us now, Britt McHenry, co-host of un-PC on Fox Nation and a former ESPN reporter. So Costas who has since departed company with NBC, I will be a little consolatory, I think. But NBC has a million-dollar contract with the National Football League."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRITT MCHNENRY, UN-PC CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And didn't like that one of its stars says football destroys people's brains."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I tend to side a little bit with NBC here because it's no different than the political world. You have your reporters, you have the pundits, and hosts. And as you know, there are different lanes that you stay in. And I just want -- I don't know who all was dying from this revelation from Bob Costas. I think he's an exceptional broadcaster. And I do think he has a point. A researcher at Boston University just years ago, examines the brains of diseased football players, found 110 out of 111 had CTE instances. So I do agree with the revelations he is trying to make about the sport. But when you're the TV partner, those networks broadcast the games."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But that suggests that being the TV partner means that you're not really the resident journalism. You're just there to make football look good. And that to me, if you asked NBC Sports, that wouldn't be our job. Now, NBC told the New York Times that the cross the line comment expressed to Costas was because he had promised not to talk about football and concussions again in interviews without prior permission from the network. But that says to me the networks were trying to muzzle this guy, talking about a really important societal problem in sports."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's interesting because I was reading some of those comments. And one was the buyer here has less control than the seller. The commissioner of the NFL is really dictating what they can and they can't talk about, when you are part of the actual game broadcast, which he was doing pregame commentary. He wasn't calling the game. So they handcuffed him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I'm interested in you being so sympathetic to NBC's position. I understand it wasn't like he was going on during the Super Bowl and do 10 minutes on concussion. ESPN certainly takes an adversary approach."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "They do, but those reporters aren't on Monday Night Football. You know, that same power play dynamics go on there as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Bob Costas have been doing this for 40 years. And he has been mixing other issues that come up like domestic abuse, for example, he would talk about. People would expect that from Costas. And suddenly, they will go like, just stay home. Let me read you another one that goes to the point. He says, as great a job as network TV does at capturing the beauty, drama, and humanity of sports, it comes up way short in the category of journalism and acknowledging uncomfortable but undeniable truths. Agree or disagree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "I do agree. I just don't know if that's the platform. And you can say that about any of broadcasting. So you want to hear that when you are watching the actual game? Troy Ackerman starts talking about it while we're just watching the next tackle. I think we all know football is a very dangerous sport. So is hockey. Both are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What platform if we're talking about the anthem protest, doesn't that come up during the actual telecast?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "It does. And ESPN at one point had refused to air the anthem because of all the controversy a year ago. They said that they weren't going to do that on Monday Night Football."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You are fine with the reporting, but you feel it should take place somewhere other than the game coverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, feel like that you have investigative journalists."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. I think we butted head here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, for the first time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "On the game coverage, you can separate it. Britt McHenry, great to see you."
    },
