      "sentences": "This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Major breaking news tonight in the Manchester terror attack. Newt Gingrich, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Dr. Gina Loudon, Maria Bartiromo, Austan Goolsbee, Herman Cain all here with reaction. The destroy Trump media, continues to breathlessly push this bizarre tinfoil hat conspiracy -- Russia, collusion. No evidence do they have whatsoever. This has now become the biggest scandal in the history of the media and in this country. It's time to get to the truth. We've got to set the record straight. Nobody else in the media will do it, and that is tonight's unique -- in terms of media -- 'Opening Monologue.'  The destroy Trump media absolutely refuses to follow the facts when it comes to the baseless claims of President Trump colluding with the Russians. That's because these very radical, very rigid left-wing ideologues -- it's clear they do not care about telling you, the American people, the truth. Their main objective is to smear, slander, besmirch President Trump no matter what actual evidence exists or doesn't exist or what it shows.  These purveyors of very fake news are perfectly happy peddling their lies as long as it inflicts damage on President Trump or those close to him. They are willing to hyperventilate, breathlessly report, create a feeding frenzy, feeding frenzy after feeding frenzy, and push manufactured scandal after manufactured scandal because the end goal and what this country is now up against is very, very simple here. The propaganda destroy Trump media -- they want President Trump to fail and they want him out. They want him gone. They want him out of office. They want him impeached.  This Russia conspiracy theory narrative is a perfect example. The media has been running with this lie with no evidence for months and months and months. They have nothing! The media won't tell you that because they are hoping upon hope that their endless lies may eventually come to some smidgen of truth, or they'll just make it up. As we've been showing you, this narrative has been crumbling right in front of their faces, but they refuse to let it go. So tonight, it is time for a reality check, and I hope you share it with your friends. We will do the media's job for them and lay out truth and facts.  Let's start with former Obama CIA director John Brennan testifying yesterday on Capitol Hill and admitting no evidence of collusion. Watch this.",

To your point, if you aren't talking about jobs and you're not talking about health reform and you're not talking about infrastructure, you're not talking about a better tax system, why are you saying it?

      "utterance": "This is a \"Fox News Alert.\" Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Major breaking news tonight in the Manchester terror attack. Newt Gingrich, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Dr. Gina Loudon, Maria Bartiromo, Austan Goolsbee, Herman Cain all here with reaction. The destroy Trump media, continues to breathlessly push this bizarre tinfoil hat conspiracy -- Russia, collusion. No evidence do they have whatsoever. This has now become the biggest scandal in the history of the media and in this country. It's time to get to the truth. We've got to set the record straight. Nobody else in the media will do it, and that is tonight's unique -- in terms of media -- 'Opening Monologue.' The destroy Trump media absolutely refuses to follow the facts when it comes to the baseless claims of President Trump colluding with the Russians. That's because these very radical, very rigid left-wing ideologues -- it's clear they do not care about telling you, the American people, the truth. Their main objective is to smear, slander, besmirch President Trump no matter what actual evidence exists or doesn't exist or what it shows. These purveyors of very fake news are perfectly happy peddling their lies as long as it inflicts damage on President Trump or those close to him. They are willing to hyperventilate, breathlessly report, create a feeding frenzy, feeding frenzy after feeding frenzy, and push manufactured scandal after manufactured scandal because the end goal and what this country is now up against is very, very simple here. The propaganda destroy Trump media -- they want President Trump to fail and they want him out. They want him gone. They want him out of office. They want him impeached. This Russia conspiracy theory narrative is a perfect example. The media has been running with this lie with no evidence for months and months and months. They have nothing! The media won't tell you that because they are hoping upon hope that their endless lies may eventually come to some smidgen of truth, or they'll just make it up. As we've been showing you, this narrative has been crumbling right in front of their faces, but they refuse to let it go. So tonight, it is time for a reality check, and I hope you share it with your friends. We will do the media's job for them and lay out truth and facts. Let's start with former Obama CIA director John Brennan testifying yesterday on Capitol Hill and admitting no evidence of collusion. Watch this."

And it raised questions in my mind, again, whether or not the Russians were able to gain the cooperation of those individuals. I don't know whether or not such collusion -- that's your term -- such collusion existed. I don't know. But I know that there was a sufficient basis of information and intelligence that required further investigation by the Bureau to determine whether or not U.S. persons were actively conspiring, colluding with Russian officials."

It doesn't mean that it becomes unclassified. It means that it retains the classification, but is releasable then to Russia or to other partners. So that in and of itself is not unprecedented. And I don't know what was shared or said in the Oval Office, but if the reports in the press are true that Mr. Trump decided to spontaneously share some intelligence with the Russians, I think he would have basically violated two protocols..."

This is what's so alarming about all this and why I am now calling this the biggest media scandal in the history of our republic. All of the facts that we just laid out for you have been completely ignored by the destroy Trump media. These people are impervious to the truth. They avoid it like the plague. They'd rather push a total, complete fabrication made-up conspiracy theory, and that's what's going on in the country right now. It's sort of like a version of insanity has broken out.

And they're willing to go so off the deep end and push these ridiculous theories that, again, we have no evidence for and so far have been proven false. This is the question I want to ask tonight. President Obama and the Democrats are so concerned about Russian meddling. Well, then why did they wait until after President Trump was elected to make such a big deal about it? And by the way, if it was so alarming and so egregious and posed such a major threat to our democracy, well, don't you think they should have said something before the election? Accordin to the former CIA director Mike Morell, it turns out that President Obama did nothing to stop Russian interference. And remember, there were also testimony out there that said they did it in previous elections and they'll do it in future elections. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE MORELL, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "So what struck me, Charlie, is that the U.S. government was concerned enough last summer about Russian interference in the election that they had the CIA director make contact with his Russian counterpart and tell them to stop. And the Russians clearly didn't. So my question is, what did the Obama administration do after that, after they learned that the warning had fallen on deaf ears?"

If it turns out that someone from inside the DNC, for example, somebody that supported Bernie Sanders or was frustrated there was collusion and corruption and a denial of a free and open election process as it relates to the primary with Hillary Clinton -- if something like that happened, wouldn't that blow the entire Russian collusion theory out the window? And isn't that something they may be afraid of? Joining us now, the author of the new and best-selling book, \"Understanding Trump,\" former speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich. Sorry about the long introduction. I just want your general thoughts here. And if there's ever evidence, I'm willing to look at it. But when everyone says no evidence, no evidence and it's gone on for thousands of TV hours, what am I to think of it? What do you think about it?"

      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, R, FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think, first of all. This is an attack media, not a news media. This is a group of people who get up in the morning and know that Trump has done something horrible. They're just not sure what it is yet. Anything which could hurt Trump gets exaggerated and it becomes somebody talked to somebody who might someday know something. If you looked at the number of New York Times and Washington Post stories that begin with, unnamed sources told us -- and I thought Trump one day had a great line when he said, I challenge you to only print the ones that have named sources. They'll all dry up."

Well, there's this great line -- and I don't know the name of the young Republican who asked the question of -- yesterday of Brennan, but he said to Brennan, You're concerned about people of significance having conversations with the Russians that might lead to a relationship. You then quoted the Obama conversation with Medvedev where he said, After the election, I'll really be available to do better things. And Medvedev says, That's great, I'm going to tell Vladimir."

If Trump were to say something to the foreign minister, that would be bad. But if, in effect, Obama promises to sell out after the election to the Russian president, that's OK?"
    },
    {

And the question is, do they ever get in Trump Tower? I mean, did Trump ever know who they were? I mean, you have a huge campaign. Now, let me take the contrast, which I keep coming back to because I cannot understand the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. I'm perfectly happy to have an investigation of Russian influence in American government. But then I want to see the former campaign chairman's brother, who's a registered agent for a Russian bank. I want to see Bill Clinton's $500,000 speech paid by a Russian bank."

I mean, let's talk about relationships. And what you discover suddenly is there's this giant mountain of Clinton relationships with the Russians. And we may or may not have some smoke over here, but for some reason, the Republicans -- I mean, look, if it was the Democratic Congress, I'd go, I got it. They're going to after Trump because they're partisan. Why would the Republicans step past all this other information? And let's apply the same terms. What does collusion mean?

That means you got to fix the health system so it's not killing jobs. You got to fix the tax code so it's not killing jobs. And you need an infrastructure bill. Those would be my -- if they asked my advice, that would be the three goals. But let's start with the trip. This is phenomenal! I was told yesterday he will probably have seen 85 leaders by the time the trip's over. He had 58 in Riyadh alone, biggest gathering I know of Sunni leadership. No American president's every done that. The speech was so powerful, it's clearly the equivalent of Reagan's Westminster speech back in 1982 in Great Britain, where he explained why communism would lose. And I think people will look back on this and say, What a historic turning point. And then to go -- first president ever to go straight from Riyadh to Jerusalem, Tel Aviv.

You mentioned some other things. I think regulation and energy -- regulation reform, opening up energy independence is key. But for the president, it's so important to keep his promises. But there's this distraction that I talked about in the last segment. How do you get back to focus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, first of all, the most interesting thing about the Trump presidency this year is going to be to look at the extraordinary discipline, the organization, the planning that gave him this nine-day tour that's unbelievable, and compared to the chaos in Washington. And I hope he's going to come back here with a determination to start running the domestic operation with the same seriousness that he runs the foreign operation. To your point, if you aren't talking about jobs and you're not talking about health reform and you're not talking about infrastructure, you're not talking about a better tax system, why are you saying it? And this is a whole different approach, and I'm hoping that the president is looking at this extraordinary historic achievement and drawing some conclusions about how he's going to change the whole operation here at home. Second, all of their messaging should be positive and should be on the things that they're trying to get done. And now, the positive comes with sort of an edge to it. For example, we just have 105 percent increase in \"Obama care\" premiums came out today. He ought to be going right at the Democrats. Every Republican should go right at the Democrats and say to them, The program you voted for has failed. It had 105 percent increase in premiums. What's your solution? You don't like ours, fine. What's yours?"

But if you guys continue to fill -- to block them, the president is just going to fill them. And I thought for Lamar Alexander, who's a very senior, very thoughtful guy to give that speech is a real signal to the Democrats.

It killed over 20 people and injured over 100 others. Now we're now learning the terrorist responsible for this masker spent three weeks in Libya just days before the attack, and according to reports also likely visited Syria. The U.K. home security said today that she believes the terrorist likely did not act alone. Now, this is why we and the Trump administration have talked a lot about implementing the idea of extreme vetting. Joining us now, the host of the top rated weekend show \"Justice with Judge Jeanine Pirro,\" and psychology expert, radio talk show host, Dr. Gina Loudon. Good to see you both. OK, I don't understand. I'll as you both. How is it that if somebody comes from a country with what I call a clash of cultures where they literally believe men should tell women how to dress and men should tell women if they can go on an airplane and travel or leave the house without a male relative, where gays and lesbians are killed, where Christians and Jews are persecuted, I'm trying to fully and completely understand why if you come from that country, we need to know, do you believe that? Do you want to proselytize us or do you want to join our family? JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, \"JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE\" HOST: You know, Sean, that is exactly the issue. Do you believe in Sharia law, and if you believe in that, that means it is inconsistent with the constitution. You do not believe in free speech, you do now believe in women's rights. You do now believe in gay rights. All the things that they would trash you or me for if, God forbid, we didn't believe in those right, we are willing to allow people that we know are individuals -- actually, we don't know who they are, to come here, stick to their own rules, and then say, gee, if they kill us, well, we have to make sure that nobody commits a crime of hate.

What's wrong with asking people to learn English?

Obama once said their plan is to dirty air and water. Now children are going to die. Is that true, Maria? MARIA BARTIROMO, \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" HOST: No, it is not true. It is so dramatic the response, what we're hearing on the left. And what really gets me angry is that there's no acknowledgment whatsoever that Obamacare is imploding. Just today, Sean, we heard from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City pulling out of ObamaCare. So now you have Blue Cross and Blue Shield, United Health, you've got Aetna, you've got Anthem, all pulling out because they are losing hundreds of millions of dollars on this plan. So Obamacare is imploding. In terms of the budget, everybody knows the right and left -- these entitlement programs, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, are going broke.

Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter. That is all the time we have left this evening. Thank you for being with us. By the way, my Memorial Day weekend begins right now. I will see you back here Tuesday. And thank you to all of you and your families and the loved ones that gave their lives for our liberty and freedom to barbecue and drink beer. I'll see you Tuesday. Have a good weekend."
