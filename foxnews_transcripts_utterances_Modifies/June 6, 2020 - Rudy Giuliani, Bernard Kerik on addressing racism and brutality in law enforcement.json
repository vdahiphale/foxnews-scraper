And if you concentrate just on police brutality, you are going to get nowhere. If you were to solve all the police brutality, and you had none next year, 99-percent-plus, reasons for the murder of black men would continue. It constitutes less than one percent. The rest of it is violence within the community.  You have to remove all police brutality. But you can't fool yourself into thinking that you're really solving the problem just by doing that. The problem will remain.   And some of the police brutality is a result of the enormous amount of contact that doesn't excuse what happens, which just means, it is going to happen more in that community than somewhere else. So, you have to get to the underlying cause here and you have to make certain that police officers who act in an illegal way are punished, like you just suggested, in a way that deters it. A first-degree murder charge here would be entirely justifiable, particularly since he was warned about three or four times that he was murdering the man.

You know, people say, you know, I've heard people especially over the last week, cops are going out there targeting black men. They're assaulting black men. There's all this misconduct. Cops don't go to work looking for black targets. Cops go to work looking for a crime. And if you look at what CompStat did, what Mayor Giuliani started in 1994 in the NYPD, basically, we started pin-mapping crime throughout the city. So, we would know where it is, where the high priorities are, where the most violence is, where is the highest murder rate? That's where you're sending the cops.  And unfortunately, especially back in the `90s, when you had 2,200 homicides a year, a lot of that crime, 75 to 80 percent of that violent crime and murder was in the communities of color.   Where are the cops going? They're going to those communities. They're going to those communities to reduce crime, and over the eight-year period that Giuliani was in office, we dropped the violent crime by 63 percent, dropped the murder by 70 overall in the city. But those communities of color had more substantial reductions, 70 percent,  75 percent reduction in violent crime and close to an 80 percent reduction in murder, because that's where the crime was really happening.",
