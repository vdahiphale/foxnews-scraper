President Biden losing touch with reality with just 27 days to go until the midterms. After decimating American energy, letting inflation ramp up to record highs, allowing a historic flow of migrants to cross the border and unleashing a violent crime surge under his watch. Biden is delusional enough to think America loves what he's doing.",

I thought the best part of what he said there was, look, you may not agree with everything I've done, but the Inflation Reduction Act had a lot of energy incentives. We should do more in energy. We should be drilling more here to increase our domestic supply, not only for ourselves, but even for allies around the globe. The CHIPS Act which is going to allow us to make Javelins here and the conduct -- the semiconductors that go into that. That's a national security issue. Gun reform. Who would've thought a Democrat with working with the Republicans in the House and the Senate could get a gun reform bill as he's been able to do an infrastructure. Some of the Republicans who voted against the infrastructure bill are now applying for money to have the infrastructure money brought to their district, which I think is a good thing. Even if you didn't vote for it, you ought to be able to help your constituents and help your districts. Finally, I think he's right in one regard about what the Republicans are for. You look at what Rick Scott has released. He released a plan I think called renewal -- the renewal plan for America that McCarthy has the commitment to America. When Newt Gingrich did this in '94 they all ran on a contract with America. If you look at some of the differences between the two, one raises taxes, one raises prescription drug prices. So, I do think, you know, Republicans have some explaining to do is you would say preferably in politics and we'll see if they're able to do it. I think the best thing about all of this is Republicans, whether it's one or two things they're standing for, they at least have a moniker out there. And they have to defend that moniker if that's what they want to do. And Democrats have a moniker. Where, you're right, Jesse, is that they're not probably half the Democrats want Biden there campaigning with them. They all want him to raise money, but not everyone wants him with them campaigning. We'll see how it works out in the next -- next three or four weeks. But I know this. This race is tight in the Senate, 50 seats where what Republicans were supposed to win eight, 10 weeks ago. There's no doubt abortion and reproductive rights have narrowed that. I still think Republicans have an advantage in the House, but I think it's a jump ball in the Senate and we'll see what happens.",

However, the other -- the other thing that's happening here is that a midterm election when you have one party rule, that means it's a check on one party rule, and it's a referendum on Biden. It's not a choice between Biden and Trump or whoever else. So, people are going to say, well, what can the Republicans do? The number one thing the Republicans want to do if they take back the majority, is to stop bad things from happening. That's the number one job, and then they can start to talk about what they are for. The House, if the Republicans take over, they're going to pass so many bills and Biden is going to ignore them.

President Biden losing touch with reality with just 27 days to go until the midterms. After decimating American energy, letting inflation ramp up to record highs, allowing a historic flow of migrants to cross the border and unleashing a violent crime surge under his watch. Biden is delusional enough to think America loves what he's doing."

You may not like what I got done, but the vast majority of American people do like what I got done. And so, I just, it's, it's a matter of can you do the job? And I believe I can do the job. I've been able to do the job. I've got more done."

      "utterance": "I agree. I think I'm going to agree with a lot of where the table is going to go, but I do think, I do think that Biden -- Biden has done some things. I thought the best part of what he said there was, look, you may not agree with everything I've done, but the Inflation Reduction Act had a lot of energy incentives. We should do more in energy. We should be drilling more here to increase our domestic supply, not only for ourselves, but even for allies around the globe. The CHIPS Act which is going to allow us to make Javelins here and the conduct -- the semiconductors that go into that. That's a national security issue. Gun reform. Who would've thought a Democrat with working with the Republicans in the House and the Senate could get a gun reform bill as he's been able to do an infrastructure. Some of the Republicans who voted against the infrastructure bill are now applying for money to have the infrastructure money brought to their district, which I think is a good thing. Even if you didn't vote for it, you ought to be able to help your constituents and help your districts. Finally, I think he's right in one regard about what the Republicans are for. You look at what Rick Scott has released. He released a plan I think called renewal -- the renewal plan for America that McCarthy has the commitment to America. When Newt Gingrich did this in '94 they all ran on a contract with America. If you look at some of the differences between the two, one raises taxes, one raises prescription drug prices. So, I do think, you know, Republicans have some explaining to do is you would say preferably in politics and we'll see if they're able to do it. I think the best thing about all of this is Republicans, whether it's one or two things they're standing for, they at least have a moniker out there. And they have to defend that moniker if that's what they want to do. And Democrats have a moniker. Where, you're right, Jesse, is that they're not probably half the Democrats want Biden there campaigning with them. They all want him to raise money, but not everyone wants him with them campaigning. We'll see how it works out in the next -- next three or four weeks. But I know this. This race is tight in the Senate, 50 seats where what Republicans were supposed to win eight, 10 weeks ago. There's no doubt abortion and reproductive rights have narrowed that. I still think Republicans have an advantage in the House, but I think it's a jump ball in the Senate and we'll see what happens."

But the boyfriend keeps saying she loves me. She loves me. She only says good things about me. She still loves me. No, she doesn't.

And every day I just see it and I just say it can't get any worse. It can't get any worse, but every day it does get worse.

And I think when he gets his clips, because you used to call them clips, you know, like all the newspaper articles, they give him a folder in the morning. It seems like they just put all the good stuff. Like the five articles that they can find that make things look really good. However, the other -- the other thing that's happening here is that a midterm election when you have one party rule, that means it's a check on one party rule, and it's a referendum on Biden. It's not a choice between Biden and Trump or whoever else. So, people are going to say, well, what can the Republicans do? The number one thing the Republicans want to do if they take back the majority, is to stop bad things from happening. That's the number one job, and then they can start to talk about what they are for. The House, if the Republicans take over, they're going to pass so many bills and Biden is going to ignore them. And you know what happens that night as soon as it's called, who has the majority in the Senate and who has the majority in the House, the first thing that happens is we're onto the 2024 election."

And none of them are political. There are actually real personal family economic problems. We don't look at our problems politically the way you do. That's the problem. That's why I think Democrats are better on the outside and Republicans are better on the inside.

I -- if I were the president, I would call in Mayorkas and say, excuse me, you had this e-mail and you let us walk around here and say all this, or, like, is it worse than that? Did they all know and they decided to do it anyway? And they let those guys out there twist in the wind. The other thing that really bothers me about this is Bill Melugin gave the Department of Homeland Security two days to respond to a media inquiry, and they never responded until afterwards, and then they tried to clean it up. That's not how this works. These public information officers, I stress public for a reason. You get paid by the taxpayer. Your job is to respond to the press. Even if you respond to say, I have no comments, or I'm not able to talk to you about this. Or go, you know what yourself. You could say anything you want, but to not call is not -- is not right. And this administration does this constantly, all across the board. And Bill Melugin and our reporters who call and try to like just get some answers on it, they deserve a lot better. But these horse patrols that got pulled off of the job because -- and how many illegal immigrants came across during that time because of this? I think that the president owes these horse patrol an apology. He should -- he should go -- he should go to the border and visit them, or he should invite them to the White House and actually apologize on camera. And Mayorkas to ought to have to answer from this. And if the Republicans take over in January, he will be up there and he will have to answer for it under oath."

I mean, they have certain things that they're required to do. But the scary part is it's all about ideology. It's not about facts anymore. It's about whether it's in schools, it's about race, whether it's about us, the border, it's about race. It's everything is, you know, we've got white supremacists are the biggest problem in this country. And then they said those numbers were inflated. Whistleblowers told us that. It's an agenda that they have that is totally separate from the truth and reality. And that's why people don't trust politics anymore. They can't. When they see this, they cannot."

He vouched for her, said she had integrity, said we needed government speech police in the United States of America. It turns out she believed the Hunter laptop was Russia disinformation, and then he had to yank her. Come on, this guy Mayorkas, I know how he got ahead because I did a deep dive into his background. So, he is not what you think he is. He grew up in Beverly Hills who went to Greg's alma mater, Berkeley, and then his wealthy father paid for him to go to law school. And then he played the in and out game for a while where you go to private practice, you go to government, in and out, in and out, and you build up your network, you build up your nest egg and he worked the patronage mill really effectively. So, Diane Feinstein was his sponsor, then Bill Clinton nominated him. Then Barack Obama. Then Joe Biden appointed him and he gets in there and he totally blows it. Because he was at a hearing. You remember Ted Cruz asked him, and you guys got weeks to prepare for the hearing. That's all they do is prepare for hearings. And he goes, do you know how many people that cross the border? No. Do you have any kids that are in your cages? No. Do you even know if Joe Biden or Kamala Harris went to the border in 2021? No. He couldn't answer. He couldn't answer anything. Now he was probably nominated the least. That's the -- what they tout us because he was Hispanic. He was born in Cuba. His parents are Jewish, which was confusing to me. But you know, I don't know a lot about, about that stuff. But I'm not as confused as he is because he is very, very confused. But lying idiots rise to the top in Washington."

I mean, if the doc -- if doctors believed that he is fit to serve, then voters have every right to either vote for him against him. He had nothing -- and he didn't confuse his position on reproductive rights, his position on infrastructure spending. He didn't confuse his position on the environment. He didn't confuse his position on the economy. He was speaking and giving answers to questions that the reporter didn't ask. And I take little issue with reporters saying, well, he didn't he didn't -- he didn't engage in a small talk with me. I didn't know if he comprehended the small talk. I didn't see the small talk. Maybe he didn't want to engage in small talk with her. At the end of the day, he had a stroke. And I don't -- I think, you know, four to five months after he had a stroke -- I know people have had strokes. It's taken him nine months to 12 months to recover, and they fully recovered. He's trying to run a campaign. I would imagine that voters in Pennsylvania are going to vote for whether or not -- whether or not they like his position on issues.

Now, the media used to say this guy is great. Everything was fine. And now they're saying you can't attack him because he's disabled? Like, this isn't like he's in a wheelchair on crutches. No, like, he can't hear what people are saying. Could you ever sit in a Senate hearing and listen to important testimony and not be able to comprehend it?

They're denying everything from inflation to crime, and they're denying that there's something wrong here. If Fetterman gets eaten by a shark, they bring in the shark and they go, see he's fine.

I think that Dr. Oz has been skillful in trying to press on the issues of inflation and the economy, energy workers, especially in Pennsylvania who lost their jobs and have no prospect of getting a job back under this administration. Crime in particular, fentanyl is a big issue. And Dr. Oz has been out there talking about all of those issues.
