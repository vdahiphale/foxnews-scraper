The whole point was that our United States president was invited for only the third time in history to the state dinner by the royal family. Right?

Now she is polling way lower than he is. There is no need for him to punch down at her. Secondly, he is asked by Chris Matthews, can you name one publican that you respect?

He takes his extreme positions when he is with women supporters or if it's a moderate person that he will have a more nuanced debate. Climate change becomes a big issue for him when he is with the green people. That is not going to work. And because the press hasn't pushed him on this policy, but said, you know, you've changed your position as you gone to different town halls that's why he's been getting away with it. By the way, since he focused on climate change, that's not going to win you the election. Sorry. The people that he is targeting are living paycheck to paycheck. They are trying to survive the next 10 years. They are trying to make it to the next week.

He is president of the United States but he's elevating the mayor by engaging the mayor then he gives the mayor a platform. The mayor is doing interviews about his fight with President Trump.

The whole point was that our United States president was invited for only the third time in history to the state dinner by the royal family. Right? The whole point was kind of this larger relationship and situation happening and this is certainly not either the monarchs or the prime minister's first rodeo. The Office of the Prime Minister, and so for everyone to kind of reduce it to just again that salacious nature, I think misses the whole point that it's about something so much larger.

Bernie bashed three of Biden's stances that he stared with Hillary, that he voted for NAFTA and permanent normalize trade relations with China and the war in Iraq. These positions say Bernie won't rally young people, working people or people of color. So, Bernie is saying that the winning candidate should be against NAFTA, be against normalize trade with China, and the war in Iraq. If that's the case Bernie just endorsed Trump for a second term.

The establishment is the pact of left-wing libs worshipping at the feet of AOC and the New York Times editorial board. The real outsider right now is already in the White House. It's kind of obvious. What's next for Bernie? Maybe terrorizing the Brits, laughing off the E.U. and making fun of Jeremy Corbyn. I have a plan that should save him some time, money, and effort.

Or he would be the one to beat Trump and he is not willing however to sacrifice his ideas, as far left ideas to get there. So those in the middle won't necessarily back him and Biden's biggest challenge at this point is convincing voters that he is not just Hillary 2.0 although he has come a little bit farther than she in that regard. And so, basically both of them are trying to convince voters they are like the whole package but I think Biden is in it for the long con and Bernie is only focused on the primary at this point.

You are not even asking him any specific questions. You just love his life story and he does have an amazing life story. What I'm surprised is that he made this many uncharacteristic errors in one town hall to me. For example, the question about Franken. I think what he was trying to do here was -- well, I don't, I think that he believes what he believes, but I also think he was trying to take a shot at Kirsten Gillibrand, the senator from New York because there's a lot of Democrats who say they will not give to her campaign because she forced his resignation. Now she is polling way lower than he is. There is no need for him to punch down at her. Secondly, he is asked by Chris Matthews, can you name one publican that you respect? And he like has this thing like, no. OK. Not really? Because his whole shtick was that he was the post-partisan, that he was the one that could bring people together and also here's from Indiana. You don't have to name George W. Bush as the republican that admire, but is there nobody in South Bend, Indiana, that is a Republican that you could point to that you could say that you admire? maybe his name is John Doe and he lives -- you see him at the diner on Saturday.

      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, his hope message is not going to work because he is a chameleon and I hate chameleons in politics. Obama what made him so successful at these town halls and talking to people who gave the same speech every single night. If you look at Mayor Pete, he changes that based on the crowd. Right? He takes his extreme positions when he is with women supporters or if it's a moderate person that he will have a more nuanced debate. Climate change becomes a big issue for him when he is with the green people. That is not going to work. And because the press hasn't pushed him on this policy, but said, you know, you've changed your position as you gone to different town halls that's why he's been getting away with it. By the way, since he focused on climate change, that's not going to win you the election. Sorry. The people that he is targeting are living paycheck to paycheck. They are trying to survive the next 10 years. They are trying to make it to the next week. And so, making that a highlight one of the top three issues of your campaign, I don't think it is a winning strategy. Also the I.C.E. officials, we shouldn't really be demonizing them based on laws that Congress make, they're just doing their job. A lot of these people, especially when it comes to I.C.E. officials and Border Patrol, not Latino people -- they're trying to get -- if you've ever been to the border or going on these -- gone on these ride-alongs, you see them trying to nurture these kids, because their parents have put them -- and I'm sorry -- in tough situations. So the blame and the buck really stops with the parents, not the I.C.E. agents, and the Border Patrol agents. They have to go there and repair for their mistakes."

He sees Town Halls is the best way to reach the American people and to pump up his numbers, his status, his profile, if you will. So he wants to raise the profile. He wants to knock the establishment to go back to the previous block where Sanders was saying Biden is the establishment. Here is Mayor Pete saying, \"Hey, I am speaking real loud and clear about Democratic priorities and Democratic values.\" You know, other people on this panel may disagree, but they are Republicans."

But let me just finish up, I think Warren is raising her numbers by pressing the flesh; Sanders, as we said, by going to the left and saying that Biden is the establishment. And of course, what you get with Biden is he is going at Trump, so we see separate lanes for all these candidates. Buttigieg at the moment, pretty much he was the small town mayor guy, the gay guy who is coming up, he is the new shiny object for the media, but I think it hasn't raised his profile.

We all saw that. The picture exists. I know Leeann, he mocked molesting her, and he also shoved his tongue down to women's throats -- two women that I know -- down their throats. So there was a reason why he left. I don't know any of his achievements as mayor. I don't know a single one. It's not my fault. But it's because the media focus solely on his identity. And I would like to use an analogy, or is it a metaphor? The media is like a mirror facing another mirror. And when you place an item in front of it, it becomes endlessly mesmerizing and in this case, for the last couple of months, it was Mayor Pete. You put Mayor Pete between the two mirrors, that's how we see. Everything inside that mirror is all we see and it's endless. Meanwhile, you step outside, nobody else sees it. Sixty percent of the population has never heard of him. If you brought up his name anywhere outside of the media centers, people are like, \"Mayor who? What? What? I don't have no idea who that is.\" So the thing is, we created it, and we'll probably end it."

I think that you have to go out there and the people that truly need help, you have to get them help either it's mental health and whatever. People who are truly down on their luck, get them help and then the other people, you kick out that. Because they're just young -- there are young, healthy people that are there. I think it's something like 40 percent, I know, it's 60 percent are mentally ill, they need to be treated. They need to -- you need to dismantle the cities there, provide help to the people that actually need it.

Today, I just read that Jeff Bezos, one of the richest people in the world is moving to New York City, you know, rich people like these big cities.

I don't want to be cruel to people. I do not. Some people say, \"Erase it, knock them out.\" We've tried these things before.

No one's getting past basically like the immediate triage because no one can agree on how best it will be fixed, and because they're run by liberals and Democrats, all the money is being wasted. And to your point about crime, however, for example, in Seattle, police officers are discouraged from making arrests for homeless-related crimes. Obviously, DA's won't prosecute. But note that property crimes in Seattle are four times the rate of New York City. In La 1.5 or Seattle is 1.5 times LA. And so this -- what starts as a homeless issue touches so many different parts of the population when it starts affecting constituents, including not just crime, but also typhoid, and et cetera and the plague coming around the corner. So it is all of our issues, it is a bilateral bipartisan issue to get involved."
