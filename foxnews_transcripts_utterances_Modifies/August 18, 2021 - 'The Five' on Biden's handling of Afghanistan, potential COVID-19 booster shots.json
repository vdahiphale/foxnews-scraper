He has done this interview with George Stephanopoulos. Well, we have more of that for you. It's, you know, the CNN poll. But really, I don't think that he changed anything that he said from Sunday. And also, when he said that the horrific images from the airport were four or five days ago, man. Come on, man. It was like two days ago and actually it was up until recently it was still happening. There's also this big disconnect. So, he is saying that nothing could helecave been different. But then you look in the media. And what do you see? Well, it is without sourcing, the anonymous sources, but it's clear that General Milley wants to make clear that he advocated for keeping 2,500 troops. Secretary Austin he told the president that full withdrawal could lead to instability. yet the intelligence community told -- had they been warning Biden for months. And actually, that wasn't even classified. You could have read that on the front page of any national newspaper. We all read it. We all knew. And then you have the secretary of state and the national security adviser making it clear that they warned about potential Taliban attacks on U.S. diplomats and allies. So, I thought it was discordant. It is not enough. Now the general and the secretary of defense today they indicated that they have better control over it. But it was strange, is that I watch the State Department briefing right before that. And it sounded like the Taliban was not allowing people through and then we just have our own reporting. And that as people that actually now they have cell phones and they can call and they're telling their people that they know in the United States saying I can't get out.",

I think he's a nice person. What the hell that COVID speech had to do with the price of beans in America, I don't know. And he delivered it as if someone said here's a good idea. Why don't you speak about the COVID booster and take their minds off of what they're seeing on the TV news. It was really, so what the hell did some adviser tell him? And then he was blinking and missing words and -- I thought it was really, really, really discordant. In terms of what General Milley and Secretary Austin were saying, I think that they understand now that they are at the fulcrum of history. They were in charge when something happened, a debacle occurred that will resonate for generations. And they were the people there in charge. For them, I think it's a lot of cover your ass going on right now. I think there's a lot of scrambling going on in D.C. I think there's an understanding of the monumental nature of this screw-up. Me, I look back. I go back to the Bagram thing. You know, I spent so much time there. Quick story. I remember being in Bagram where a G.I., a big strapping 6 foot 5 G.I. had all of these tubes in him at the Bagram hospital, which was state of the art, one of the best in the world, and he had no head. They were keeping him alive. I know Bagram. Bagram had a Wendy's and McDonalds, and this and that. Why in the world they did not keep Bagram air field with its two landing strips, with its secure perimeter, with its track record of being impregnable from the Soviet times Because it was the Russians that built it and to trade that for Kabul International Airport which is chaotic and a mess in the best of times. And now, this whole idea of the Taliban not letting people through to the airport, that's where the rubber meets the road. If the Taliban expects to be a member of the family of nations, if they expect credit and international aid, if they expect membership in any of these international organizations, they better damn let these people free. They should let -- they have to let these people get to the airport where our logistical army and so forth is now up to muster and can evacuate 5,000 to 9,000 a day.",

He's a failure in both deed and now word to get up in front of the American people and say nothing about the Americans and allies stranded in Afghanistan and the disaster that unfolds in front of our faces. There's a reason why the people who knew Joe Biden best kept him in arm's length. Obama and all of the big D cronies, they didn't want him to run in 2016. They didn't endorse him initially in 2020. They knew that they didn't want their image sullied quite frankly, and they didn't want to hitch their wagon to this, again disaster. So, they are -- he's completely incompetent.

And they're going to lose their power because they're in huge trouble right now. He's -- he might be immortally wounded president from this. So given this massive breaking news, this came off as a wholly desperate tactic. It's almost like during the rise of a pandemic deciding you're going to initiate an impeachment against Trump or during a crime epidemic or a crime wave you focus on white supremacy. It's all for -- it's all about distracting. I am relieved though that the U.N. issued a strongly worded letter to the Taliban. You know, that's something that the Taliban would respect. I would have wished a singing telegram or a stripper gram. But it does reveal how arrogant and idiotic these people are.

That comes as we get new horrific images of the terror group's brutality. Viewer warning, what we're about to show you is tough to look at. People being beaten and bloodied in the streets including women and children and people fleeing after gunshots broke out when the Taliban just shot into a crowd trying to break up a protest. So, I was shocked, Dana, that he didn't take questions. Instead went to a former Clinton guy, George Stephanopoulos and then he said he couldn't have done it any better."

He has done this interview with George Stephanopoulos. Well, we have more of that for you. It's, you know, the CNN poll. But really, I don't think that he changed anything that he said from Sunday. And also, when he said that the horrific images from the airport were four or five days ago, man. Come on, man. It was like two days ago and actually it was up until recently it was still happening. There's also this big disconnect. So, he is saying that nothing could helecave been different. But then you look in the media. And what do you see? Well, it is without sourcing, the anonymous sources, but it's clear that General Milley wants to make clear that he advocated for keeping 2,500 troops. Secretary Austin he told the president that full withdrawal could lead to instability. yet the intelligence community told -- had they been warning Biden for months. And actually, that wasn't even classified. You could have read that on the front page of any national newspaper. We all read it. We all knew. And then you have the secretary of state and the national security adviser making it clear that they warned about potential Taliban attacks on U.S. diplomats and allies. So, I thought it was discordant. It is not enough. Now the general and the secretary of defense today they indicated that they have better control over it. But it was strange, is that I watch the State Department briefing right before that. And it sounded like the Taliban was not allowing people through and then we just have our own reporting. And that as people that actually now they have cell phones and they can call and they're telling their people that they know in the United States saying I can't get out."

I think he's a nice person. What the hell that COVID speech had to do with the price of beans in America, I don't know. And he delivered it as if someone said here's a good idea. Why don't you speak about the COVID booster and take their minds off of what they're seeing on the TV news. It was really, so what the hell did some adviser tell him? And then he was blinking and missing words and -- I thought it was really, really, really discordant. In terms of what General Milley and Secretary Austin were saying, I think that they understand now that they are at the fulcrum of history. They were in charge when something happened, a debacle occurred that will resonate for generations. And they were the people there in charge. For them, I think it's a lot of cover your ass going on right now. I think there's a lot of scrambling going on in D.C. I think there's an understanding of the monumental nature of this screw-up. Me, I look back. I go back to the Bagram thing. You know, I spent so much time there. Quick story. I remember being in Bagram where a G.I., a big strapping 6 foot 5 G.I. had all of these tubes in him at the Bagram hospital, which was state of the art, one of the best in the world, and he had no head. They were keeping him alive. I know Bagram. Bagram had a Wendy's and McDonalds, and this and that. Why in the world they did not keep Bagram air field with its two landing strips, with its secure perimeter, with its track record of being impregnable from the Soviet times Because it was the Russians that built it and to trade that for Kabul International Airport which is chaotic and a mess in the best of times. And now, this whole idea of the Taliban not letting people through to the airport, that's where the rubber meets the road. If the Taliban expects to be a member of the family of nations, if they expect credit and international aid, if they expect membership in any of these international organizations, they better damn let these people free. They should let -- they have to let these people get to the airport where our logistical army and so forth is now up to muster and can evacuate 5,000 to 9,000 a day."

He's a failure in both deed and now word to get up in front of the American people and say nothing about the Americans and allies stranded in Afghanistan and the disaster that unfolds in front of our faces. There's a reason why the people who knew Joe Biden best kept him in arm's length. Obama and all of the big D cronies, they didn't want him to run in 2016. They didn't endorse him initially in 2020. They knew that they didn't want their image sullied quite frankly, and they didn't want to hitch their wagon to this, again disaster. So, they are -- he's completely incompetent.

And they're going to lose their power because they're in huge trouble right now. He's -- he might be immortally wounded president from this. So given this massive breaking news, this came off as a wholly desperate tactic. It's almost like during the rise of a pandemic deciding you're going to initiate an impeachment against Trump or during a crime epidemic or a crime wave you focus on white supremacy. It's all for -- it's all about distracting. I am relieved though that the U.N. issued a strongly worded letter to the Taliban. You know, that's something that the Taliban would respect. I would have wished a singing telegram or a stripper gram. But it does reveal how arrogant and idiotic these people are.

Like this is obviously going to be one of the questions. But one very dangerous thing for any president is to get in a fight with the intelligence community or to call them liars or to question their work because any president really needs the intelligence community to be on their side and to be working for them, not against them."

The other thing I was going to mention is that, yes, President Biden did call a world leader but only after the press briefing that Jake Sullivan, the National Security Adviser did yesterday at the White House when he was asked, has the President talk to any other world leader, and there's -- no. Well, then it was on this show during a commercial break between the A and the B block that we find that oh, he actually -- he called Boris Johnson at 10:00 p.m. U.K. time. And so, the last thing on this part, I don't know if anybody had a chance to see one of the members of parliament who served in Afghanistan who spoke up today on the -- in the house comments. He was furious, but he was quietly furious. And he might -- these people in Britain, or even in Europe, they might not have liked the way President Trump talked, or the way he acted, or that he's brash, whatever, but they never questioned his courage or his resolve.

And I bet you, I'm probably like a lot of people who let this thing drag out because our lives weren't affected by it. So, I think -- I mean, that's what it was. When this first happened, I felt like I couldn't really get angry because that would be performative. And I hate to use that word, because I had pretty much lost track of this. However, it's on Joe as well, because he said that America is back, that America is back on the world stage. That was -- but unfortunately, that show opened and closed in one night last week. And it's no surprise because he spent a year claiming the other side, Republicans were fronted by buffoons, so it would be up to him to deliver the goods and he couldn't. We have no evidence that it could have been worse. I mean, it pulled up better. But I don't think it could get any worse than this.

All these smart people at the State Department, they have graduate degrees from Yale, and they -- undersecretary of policy for Near East affairs, they didn't have clue of the culture they were dealing with in this tribal nation, that they could just pass a bribe and they'll go back to the warlord that they're allied to. This didn't -- this didn't take anybody by surprise. If anybody was watching what was really going on on the ground, they could have seen this coming. This line from Milley that this happened in 11 days, that is spin. This happened the minute Joe Biden says we're getting out on September 11 with no preconditions. That's when the Taliban advanced happened. And it went day by day and they briefed Biden as it happened, and he didn't want to do anything about it. He didn't want to tell the American people that he might have to pivot. He stuck to the deadline and he even preposition people there in case this went to hell. It went to hell.
