      "utterance": "Welcome to Watters' World, I'm Jesse Watters. Hatred and revenge, that's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. The Democrats have their two articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction. The articles might as well be, \"We hate you, and we can't beat you.\" They've been trying to impeach Trump since before he was the Republican nominee. In March 2016, the New York Daily News wrote this, \"Impeach Trump. It's not too early to start.\" Then right after Trump was elected president, the media starts salivating."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Male Speaker",
      "utterance": "My prediction is based on my gut, that there's a very good chance that Donald Trump could face impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Then the day of Trump's inauguration, The Washington Post announces, \"The campaign to impeach the President has begun.\" The whistleblower's attorney was tweeting about impeachment years ago, and the FBI agents were texting about impeachment and the insurance policy way, way back. The FBI used intelligence briefings to spy him. They wiretapped his staff. They leaked, and they hatched stings. Trump caught wind of it, and fired Comey. So Comey leaked and triggered a special counsel, a two year witch hunt when Mueller already knew there was no collusion. What was he doing that whole time? He was just building an obstruction case against the president. And that dark cloud cost Republicans the House. Bill Barr finally got there and called their bluff. No collusion, no obstruction. And then the same week the Mueller hearing bombed; Adam Schiff hatched the whistleblower plot. So Trump called their bluff again and releases the transcript. No bribe on the call, no pressure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "President Trump",
      "utterance": "Here are the facts on shifty Schiff, dishonest guy, makes up my statements. He said, \"The president of Ukraine repeatedly declared that there was no pressure, but he didn't want to say that.\" We said, \"Say it. Say it, you crooked bastard, say it.\" Do you remember? \"Bribery and this and that.\" I go, \"Where are they?\" They send these two things, they're not even a crime. This is the lightest, weakest impeachment. This is impeachment lite."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "[laughs] Impeachment lite. Later we find out Schiff lied, and the whistleblower lied on the forum. The hearings didn't produce a shred of evidence of any crime. You're smart, you get it. That's why the polls started flipping. Two fresh surveys now show Americans against impeachment. Impeachment underwater in the battleground states as well. And Trump trouncing the Democrats their head to head, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. This impeachment deal's like watching the Democrats commit political suicide in slow motion. Nancy is going to lose the gavel over this. And Republicans hit hard this week."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "The whole deal is backwards. The left abused power by spying, lying, and leaking. Trump didn't obstruct justice. He released the transcript and only said, \"I'll see you in court.\" You can't impeach for kicking it to the judicial branch. Every president's done that. The Democrats are abusive, all because they hate the president, and they hate you for putting him in the oval. They cooked up the schemes to steal your vote, rig another election, and crack the base. But the base won't crack. This just made your support for Trump stronger. The left got too bloodthirsty, and it backfired on them. It all boils down to performance. The Democrats have done nothing except lie, cheat, and impeach. But look at what the president's accomplished while they've waged war on him. Decimated ISIS, new North American and Chinese trade deals, two Supreme Court justices, tax cuts, jobs, energy pipelines and independents, low gas prices, stock market records smashed, Obamacare. Mandate gone, money for military and vets, and CBS reports that by next year, a hundred and seventy miles of new border wall will have been built. So one thing is crystal clear. Democrats are trying to take Trump out, not because he failed, but because he's succeeded. Here with reaction, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. All right, Kellyanne, have at it."

Because independents call themselves that because they don't particularly like Democrats or Republicans. They like to fancy themselves independent and nonpartisan, and they have witnessed the most partisan exercise in the last several years against this president. Let me tell you what wasn't in the call. Any mention of 2020? Any mention of Biden as some scary, spooky political opponent? Any mention of aid to Ukraine? The word \"demand\" was nowhere in there, even though you had these Democrats just this week with their phony articles of impeachment -- which is light bathroom reading -- they parade around saying he demanded, demanded. He never said the word demand in the call. And what's not in the articles of impeachment? Extortion met extinction. Bribery was a big bust. Quid pro quo. Did the cat get your Latin speaking tongue? I haven't heard a quid pro quo in two weeks. It's all I heard for two months."

Finally, the Democrats, at the very least, agree with the rest of us that the Mueller report -- the Mueller investigation of two and a half years and 35 million taxpayer dollars and the Mueller testimony itself -- is irrelevant. They didn't even have the nerve or the verve to include anything. Mueller in the articles of impeachment. Think about that, ladies and gentlemen, it's abuse of power, which is going on by the Democrats. And it's something called obstruction of Congress, which, of course, is the wrong preposition. It's obstruction by Congress."

You know, if I were a Democrat, you know what I would have done this week, a Democrat in the House or Senate -- particularly in the House? I would've come to the Congressional Ball, and it's hosted by the President and the First Lady, where they held forth for two hours. They shook hands, mingled with the crowd for two hours. If I were a Democrat, I would have come to Congressional Ball, and I would have said, \"Mr. President, we just passed the USMCA together. We just passed prescription drug coverage together. Will, you come to my district and cut a ribbon or stand with me so people in my district -- a Trump-Pence district -- can see that I work across the aisles? But they can't. They're scared to death of these freshman Democrats who are pushing the Democratic Party you and I grew up around so far to the left you can't even see it from the middle."

      "speaker": "Kellyanne Conway",
      "utterance": "There is one more statistic I'd like to share with you and your audience. Go back to August 1st. Why is that date important? Well, the media did a really good thing this summer. They were keeping tabs on how many Democrats had committed to an impeachment inquiry that they would vote for that. By August 1st, one half of all the Democrats in the House had committed. August 1st, Jesse is six weeks before the so-called whistleblower complaint, the so-called -- it's -- and so nobody even knew about that. And they had already committed to impeachment inquiry. So let's stop pretending that this has to do with the Ukrainian call.  September 22nd was the first time any Democrat publicly stated that the reason he or she would vote for the impeachment inquiry was because of the president’s call with Ukraine; September 22nd, about the same time President Trump was meeting with President Zelensky up in [unintelligible]. He got his meeting. So, let’s think about that. September 22nd, long past August 1st, when 50 percent of the Democrats were for impeachment, you have the first Democrat saying it’s because of the Ukraine call. This is just foolish, and it’s going to cost them.  It’s definitely -- you’re right, it’s going to cost her her gavel. More likely, it’s going to cost them a lot of precious political currency because they will have to go home, and they’ll say, “What have you done for me lately?” and they’re going to have to say, “Well, I impeached the president, but he’s still the president, and will be for five more years.” If I were a 2020 Democrat running for president, I’d be hopping mad. They can’t get a word in edgewise. Nobody even pays attention to them --"

So many of them dropped out; so many more of them can’t get traction. It’s because of this. It’s because the modern Democratic Party is so hellbent on getting the president rather than getting you a job or de-reg or the military funding. This is one of the most successful weeks of the Trump presidency. USMCA; China; military -- the third consecutive military pay raise, third consecutive investment in our military, over $700 billion. They have more resources, more respect. NDAA; paid family leave; Space Force. Who knows what he’ll do tomorrow?"
    },

We cannot impeach Trump over slavery unless we are impeaching Abraham Lincoln or one of his predecessors. The impeachment cannot be about slavery. Look, at this point, the Democrats are playing a game of Mad Libs. You can pretty much insert anything in there and just blame it on Trump. “We must impeach Trump for the original sin,” which I believe was when Eve bit the apple. [laughs] I think that might have been the original sin --"

But here’s the issue, Jesse. All right, the truth is these Democrats are so unhinged right now. They have nothing to hang their hats on. What they know is that this impeachment has fallen flat. The American people don’t support it. The president’s numbers are better than ever, and they’re on the cusp of losing the majority of the House of Representatives again for getting nothing done. So, this is what happens in a hyper-partisan environment when AOC is running their caucus and Nancy Pelosi has been run over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Do you blame Nancy Pelosi for this, Candace? Because she was the one that held firm and said, “We’re not going to do it until we have bipartisanship,” and then Schiff kind of snookered her into this whistleblower deal, and she let all these insane people have control of the asylum."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Candace Owens",
      "utterance": "And that’s exactly right. Look, she gave in. She threw in the towel on these radical leftists that are in her party, mainly because she was pretending to be a leftist. She’s not; she’s much more moderate. She’s worth way too much money to be a socialist, and she should have combated that early socialism in her party. And look what’s happening; look at the lesson of this week, with Boris in the U.K. There’s going to be a referendum on radical leftism in this country just like there was in the U.K., and they are going down. Trump will win 2020 in a landslide."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "All right, Corey, take us through the next couple months now. You have -- the House is going to have to vote. Are Democrats going to side with Republicans in this House? And then what the hell happens in the Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Corey Lewandowski",
      "utterance": "I think the Democrats are probably going to lose between two and five members of their caucus to vote against the impeachment proceedings. I think of these members who are in districts that Donald Trump won -- there are 31 Democrats sitting in those districts that Donald Trump won in 2016 that Democrats won in 2018, so some of those members are going to vote against the impeachment, which means this was not going to be a bipartisan effort, which is what Schiff and Pelosi and Nadler promised us. It’s going to be a strictly partisan effort except on our side. That being said, this is going to go to the Senate. I hope that this expediated process -- unless we’re going to see Hunter Biden come before us, Adam Schiff come before us -- they’ll never allow that to happen. Donald Trump is not going to be convicted because there was no crime. He’s going to win in a larger margin of the electoral college than he did in 2016, and America is going to continue to go forward with the greatest economy in the world."

    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "The IG report dropped this week. It’s the biggest political scandal of the decade. The Obama FBI opened an investigation into the Trump campaign based off a rumor someone heard at a bar overseas. Instead of investigating the Russians, the FBI investigated Trump. The FBI didn’t warn Trump about Russian interference; they warned Hillary instead. McCabe, who hates Trump, handpicked a team of agents to investigate Trump. They send undercover agents wearing wires to talk to Trump officials. Nothing they heard was bad, but they kept pushing. They tried to get a warrant to wiretap Carter Page, and they were told no. Then they get the dossier. The IG says the dossier was the only reason they got the warrant. So Hillary bought a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. She paid a foreign agent to get dirt from a Russian, and then the FBI used that to wiretap an American. The FBI knew Page was clean, but doctored evidence to make him look dirty. That FBI lawyer is going to be prosecuted. It's like planting a gun on a suspect and telling the judge, \"Oh, that guy was armed.” The FBI got caught, though. Even worse, when the FBI spoke to the Russians source for Steele's dossier, he said the whole thing was a joke. But the FBI lied to the court, the FBI said, \"Everything was legit,\" and kept spying on Trump official Carter Page for the rest of the year. That's illegal. The FBI used an intel briefing as an excuse to spy on Donald Trump as well. The IG said there was massive misconduct, massive abuse. And when the FBI agents were asked about it by the IG, they said, \"I don't remember,\" and \"I don't know.\" Remember, what did Comey tell you?"

Now, John Durham believes the whole investigation may have been launched crookedly and is still investigating. Bill Barr had this to say."

I think wiring people up to go in and talk to people and make recordings of their conversations is spying. I think going through people's emails, which they did as a result of the FISA warrant, they went through everything, you know, from Page's life -- their case collapsed after the election, and they never told the court, and they kept on getting renewals on these applications. They -- there was documents falsified in order to get these renewals. There was all kinds of withholding of information from the court. And the question really is, what was the agenda after the election that kept them pressing ahead after their case collapsed?"

      "utterance": "Well, he should face legal accountability. There was already one criminal referral against him for stealing presidential memos and leaking them, one of which was classified. So we'll wait and see what Durham has to say. But, you know, one of the reasons my book is 500 pages long is because I detail all of James Comey lies, and it takes a lot of pages to do that. Let me just give you one of them. Before the first FISA warrant that he signed was issued by the court, a month before -- he knew Carter Page was not a Russian spy. Because, as I dug up out of the government documents, Page sent Comey a letter saying, \"Hey, I've been helping the U.S. government. I'm an Intel asset for the United States.\" Comey disregarded it, ran to the FISA court, lied to the court. There are 51 misrepresentations in that. That was not accidental. John knows this full well."

      "utterance": "Yeah. Solomon, what do you think the worst thing about this is? Was it the falsifying of evidence? Was it the lying? Was it the deception? Was it the wearing the wires when all they needed to do was just maybe tell the Trump campaign the Russians may have been trying to interfere? I mean, what's worse, in your opinion?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "John Solomon",
      "utterance": "You know, I think the sum total is what makes it most reprehensible. This was a systematic effort at deceiving the court, a systematic effort at violating an American civil liberties, and the systematic effort at interfering in the U.S. election and in the early presidency of Donald Trump, using false information, doctored information. And when they found out that their case had collapsed, fallen apart, they tried to switch it to a special prosecutor's probe, sustain it with no basis. That pattern, that long pattern, is the most reprehensible part. It's not any one act. It's the total impact of the misconduct that the FBI conducted here. And for anyone who thinks that this is an accident, that these were just mistakes, incompetence, Keystone cops, the statistical odds that all of the 51 errors that were made would all be to the disfavor of Donald Trump is astronomical. The chance of that that wasn't intentional is almost zero. Infinitesimal. So very scary to see the power of the state used this way systematically for three years."

They thought, you know, the scripture was whatever intelligence agencies were leaking to them without actually determining the truthfulness or veracity of the information. They passed it along.

Here's the front page in The York Times the next day, \"Inspector accuses FBI of gross incompetence in handling of wiretap.\" There's a whole separate story on it.

North Korea is pushing the Trump administration to revive stalled nuclear negotiations, all this as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, arrives in South Korea. Biegun hopes to ease tensions between Washington and Pyongyang before North Korea’s December 31st deadline. And President Donald Trump attending the Army-Navy game this afternoon.

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "[laughs] Says this guy David Keller. He really wanted to prove his point when he registered his beehive online. Now, I personally think emotional support insects are a great idea. And we're going to go book David on Walter's World for next week, and we're going to fly him out here, and he's going to bring his beehive on the plane with him, and we're going to let you know how that goes. That's all for us tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Justice with Judge Jeanine is next, and remember, I'm Watters, and this is My World.
