We're going to have more on all of that in just a minute.  But, first, what was an incredible day in our nation's capital fireworks all over Capitol Hill. This is a historic day in so many ways. Disgraced anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok, he was in the hot seat and tonight, we are just finally now beginning to expose the biggest corruption bias, dereliction at some of the highest levels, sadly, of the FBI and Department of Justice.  In other words, everything we have been telling you on this show is true and the saddest part is we are only about 15 percent into this abuse of power and the biggest corruption scandal in history. We're going to show you the most contentious, the most revealing moments from the hearing as an incredibly smug, arrogant, narcissistic Peter Strzok suspended every bit of logic lied about his blatant bias and even took yes some veiled cheap shots at yours truly.  Now, tonight, we're going to have a direct message for the corrupt FBI investigator. You know what? You may have smelled me and my fellow Trump voters in a Virginia Walmart in 2016, but now, you're going to be hearing loudly from all of us until you are held accountable for what are your malignant actions. All right. Hold on. Sit tight. Buckle up. It's time for tonight's explosive breaking news London opening monologue.",

He was the FBI agent at the very heart of the deep state and as I have been telling you now for a long time, the biggest corruption abuse of power scandal sadly in our history.  Now in 2016, he was the lead investigator in the Clinton's server probe. He played a lead role in writing Hillary Clinton's exoneration, of course, before the investigation, before ultimately conducting her investigation months later. Despite what we now have which is incontrovertible evidence that Hillary Clinton was guilty of numerous serious felonies and crimes he then immediately transitioned to the Trump Russia witch-hunt left wing talking point, all the while as he has expressed a massive bias in favor of Hillary Clinton who he was supposed to be investigating and an extraordinary extreme hatred, animus against Donald Trump to his FBI colleague mistress, Lisa Page, all by the way on official FBI phones used to conduct official FBI business.   Now, tomorrow, Lisa Page, well, she said to testify like she was Wednesday before a closed-door session in Congress. We'll see. But today, for the very first time in a public setting, yes, Peter Strzok was now forced to begin to answer for his prejudice, his bigoted the point of view before he did an investigation, including by the way texts and statements like these.

This is a massive abuse of power scandal. Everything we have been saying is right. We're going to have a lot more on this all throughout the show. But, first, I want to end our monologue tonight with a message directly to Peter Strzok. Just so you know, I love law enforcement, Peter. My mom worked as a prison guard for about 25 years of her life. She worked more 16-hour shifts than I could ever add up or recall. My father, a family court officer. Many relatives who worked in law enforcement including the NYPD, two who made it to the tippy-top that worked for that organization that I have so much respect for, the FBI. They were revered in my family. And today, you told the American people not to believe your own words, their clear meaning. You tried to cover up your bias. You took no ownership of your terrible and despicable actions. Mr. Strzok, you are not the 99.9 percent of law enforcement in this country that serve and protect us, nor was your girlfriend Lisa, nor was your boss Jim, or Deputy FBI Director McCabe. What you are is a partisan political hack and you abuse the trust and the power that we the smelly people of the United States that like Walmart gave to you, the people that work hard every single day contribute to the society, make it better, play by the rules, pay their taxes, use their salary, obey the laws, get taxed into oblivion by corrupt government, the people who struggle to make ends meet, the ones that you have shown nothing but contempt and hatred for and the ones you think you're superior to.  And if your chosen candidate, your beloved Hillary, had won, none of this corruption would have come to light. Now, the deep state, your days are numbered and we smelly Trump supporters and I'm one of an irredeemable deplorable, we will not rest and all of your deep state colleagues until they are held accountable for what you've done here, Joining us now, two congressmen who did grill Peter Strzok earlier today. He's the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, of course, Mark Meadows from North Carolina, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. Chairman Meadows, this guy wants us to believe that his own words have no meaning. I thought Clinton parse words really well in a corrupt way. This is a whole new level.

And so, they could be potentially false testimony, and they are in conflict with other testimony that we've had from Rod Rosenstein, specifically the lead up that you had in your monologue talking about Bruce Ohr's involvement. You have one part of the DOJ saying, oh, he wasn't involved you have testimony today that suggests that he is. We've long suspected that.

We're going to show you the most contentious, the most revealing moments from the hearing as an incredibly smug, arrogant, narcissistic Peter Strzok suspended every bit of logic lied about his blatant bias and even took yes some veiled cheap shots at yours truly. Now, tonight, we're going to have a direct message for the corrupt FBI investigator. You know what? You may have smelled me and my fellow Trump voters in a Virginia Walmart in 2016, but now, you're going to be hearing loudly from all of us until you are held accountable for what are your malignant actions. All right. Hold on. Sit tight. Buckle up. It's time for tonight's explosive breaking news London opening monologue."

He was the FBI agent at the very heart of the deep state and as I have been telling you now for a long time, the biggest corruption abuse of power scandal sadly in our history. Now in 2016, he was the lead investigator in the Clinton's server probe. He played a lead role in writing Hillary Clinton's exoneration, of course, before the investigation, before ultimately conducting her investigation months later. Despite what we now have which is incontrovertible evidence that Hillary Clinton was guilty of numerous serious felonies and crimes he then immediately transitioned to the Trump Russia witch-hunt left wing talking point, all the while as he has expressed a massive bias in favor of Hillary Clinton who he was supposed to be investigating and an extraordinary extreme hatred, animus against Donald Trump to his FBI colleague mistress, Lisa Page, all by the way on official FBI phones used to conduct official FBI business. Now, tomorrow, Lisa Page, well, she said to testify like she was Wednesday before a closed-door session in Congress. We'll see. But today, for the very first time in a public setting, yes, Peter Strzok was now forced to begin to answer for his prejudice, his bigoted the point of view before he did an investigation, including by the way texts and statements like these. Take a look."

It is not who I am, and it is not something I would ever do, period. I understand that my sworn testimony will not be enough for some people.

And Donald Trump is bigoted an enormous bleep, he's a disaster, he's a bleeping idiot. His presidency is bleeping terrifying. This is just a small sample, by the way, of what are hundreds of anti-Trump texts. Now, Congressman Trey Gowdy, he will be joining us tonight in just a few minutes.

He has a different set of rules for others that he's investigating. Agent Strzok thinks saying someone he is allegedly investigating should be elected president 100 million to zero, before he ever interviews, he doesn't think that's biased.

Now, we were alone, but I never really thought we're alone. In order to believe these bizarre explanations from this verbal contortionist, you would literally have to suspend all sense of fact and fiction and, of course, Peter Strzok, well, he does think that the smelly, irredeemable, deplorable Trump supporters of Walmart, the hillbillies like us that believe in god and guns and bibles and religion, we don't measure up. He thinks, yes, I guess we're pretty dumb and he could just do whatever he wants. I have some bad news for Peter. He's not the infallible super patriot that he clearly is convinced himself he is. He lies to our face and in the end he's not going to get away with it. In other words, he's not above the law because the American people saw these lies today. We know a cover-up when we see one.

This is a massive abuse of power scandal. Everything we have been saying is right. We're going to have a lot more on this all throughout the show. But, first, I want to end our monologue tonight with a message directly to Peter Strzok. Just so you know, I love law enforcement, Peter. My mom worked as a prison guard for about 25 years of her life. She worked more 16-hour shifts than I could ever add up or recall. My father, a family court officer. Many relatives who worked in law enforcement including the NYPD, two who made it to the tippy-top that worked for that organization that I have so much respect for, the FBI. They were revered in my family. And today, you told the American people not to believe your own words, their clear meaning. You tried to cover up your bias. You took no ownership of your terrible and despicable actions. Mr. Strzok, you are not the 99.9 percent of law enforcement in this country that serve and protect us, nor was your girlfriend Lisa, nor was your boss Jim, or Deputy FBI Director McCabe. What you are is a partisan political hack and you abuse the trust and the power that we the smelly people of the United States that like Walmart gave to you, the people that work hard every single day contribute to the society, make it better, play by the rules, pay their taxes, use their salary, obey the laws, get taxed into oblivion by corrupt government, the people who struggle to make ends meet, the ones that you have shown nothing but contempt and hatred for and the ones you think you're superior to. And if your chosen candidate, your beloved Hillary, had won, none of this corruption would have come to light. Now, the deep state, your days are numbered and we smelly Trump supporters and I'm one of an irredeemable deplorable, we will not rest and all of your deep state colleagues until they are held accountable for what you've done here, Joining us now, two congressmen who did grill Peter Strzok earlier today. He's the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, of course, Mark Meadows from North Carolina, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. Chairman Meadows, this guy wants us to believe that his own words have no meaning. I thought Clinton parse words really well in a corrupt way. This is a whole new level. Let's get your reaction to the hearings."

And so, today, Peter Strzok's luck ran out. I'm here to tell you that there are a number of things that he said today that are not supported by evidence. And so, they could be potentially false testimony, and they are in conflict with other testimony that we've had from Rod Rosenstein, specifically the lead up that you had in your monologue talking about Bruce Ohr's involvement. You have one part of the DOJ saying, oh, he wasn't involved you have testimony today that suggests that he is. We've long suspected that. So I can -- I can just tell you, the American people know that there was one particular witness today that had a hard time with the facts."

So, Hillary Clinton had a rigged investigation and they allowed her to continue because she was the favored one. He thought, of course, it was going to be a hundred million and none because smelly people like me and others wouldn't vote for Donald Trump. So, I guess the question is, when do we get justice? When is a real investigation into Hillary happened? When do we get to the bottom of the FISA abuse scandal? Jim Jordan is going to join us later. He got some new information on that today. When do we get -- when does the truth come out and when are these people held responsible for abusing the power that we the people gave them, the smelly people."

      "utterance": "We are only going to get justice when Attorney General Jeff Sessions does his job and follows the advice that dozens of us in Congress have been giving him to appoint a second special counsel, Sean. But we won't get justice from the Democrats. If you watch the hearing today, you saw the Democrats give a five hour cat bath to Peter Strzok. You had one Democrat from the state of New Jersey say that he deserved hugs and kisses. A Democrat from Rhode Island said that we needed to give Peter Strzok our apology and one Democrat from Tennessee even said that he deserved the Purple Heart. That is incredibly offensive to the people who've gone down range and fought for our country who live in my district who've been wounded in action. And it just shows the extent to which anything that could in any way be negative for Donald Trump is something the Democrats will embrace even if that very same stuff is harmful to our country and the institutions that we all have to be able to rely on."

      "speaker": "MEADOWS",

There's a standard here in Washington, D.C. for the well-connected of which obviously Hillary Clinton, Peter Strzok, some of the others that we we're now seeing, perhaps even the director of the CIA and James Clapper, the well-connected, there's a standard for them. And yet, there's a standard for all other Americans. So, here's how we have to actually get to the bottom of it. There has to be criminal referrals that start, enough of the talk, enough of the hearings. You know, we're starting to gather enough information. It is time for criminal referrals and that includes going back to some of the evidence that has been put forth."

Before he ever began investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, he'd already made up his mind that President Trump would be destabilizing for the country. I mean, think about how serous that word is, Sean -- destabilizing for our country. And he hadn't even begun to interview the first person in August. He said, we'll stop it. We need an insurance policy. And then he began talking about impeachment one day after Bob Mueller's investigation began. So, Peter Strzok has a level of bias, it would make it impossible for any prosecutor to stand in front of a jury and use him as a witness. On the other hand, while he's convicting Donald Trump before the investigation begins, he's exonerating Hillary Clinton -- a hundred million to zero is what the vote ought to be -- and he had an interviewed her and he hadn't interviewed 30 other witnesses."

Keep in mind, Sean, 60 Democrats have already voted to move forward with impeachment on President Trump and Bob Mueller hadn't released his first single solitary finding. So, they've already made up their minds. And, of course, they'd be sympathetic to an FBI agent who's already made up his mind. He's the only person in America who doesn't think he was biased. He's the only person in America that does not understand how incredibly detrimental those texts are to any kind of serious investigation. So, look, I spent 10 hours with him two weeks ago, about an equal amount of time today. He just doesn't -- he thinks what his personal opinion is what the rest of us call bias."

What I am worried about more than anything else here, Hillary Clinton is allowed to take things that are subpoenaed and delete them. Use bleach bit on the hard drives, have aides break up devices and hammers and remove SIM cards and move with Espionage Act you cannot mishandle or destroy classified or top- secret information, both of those things happened. He wrote an exoneration with, of course the FBI Director Comey in early May and they didn't interview her until July 2nd. She was exonerated on July 5th. That to me, and you've been involve in these things, do we have equal justice under the law?"

Will the director of the FBI announce my innocence before 20 some odd interviews have been done including my own? And keep this in mind too, Sean, they were really clear when they went into her interview, she's not going to be charged with anything, unless -- unless she lies. So the mishandling of classified information she was never in jeopardy from that, even before they interviewed her. So I think everybody would like that deal, that the FBI is going to come talk to me and the only thing I got to do is tell the truth. Yes, I rob the bank, yes, I kidnapped this person, yes, I committed bank fraud. And you got to do is tell the truth and you're going to get out of jail free. Converse that with the fact that Donald Trump not a single solitary witness had been interviewed before Peter Strzok is promising to stop him from ever becoming president. That is a dichotomy that erodes public trust in our justice system and in our law enforcement."

I call -- when you had the FISA abuse questions that he was asking, I called this the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in American history. Let's stay on what you were just talking about. Was Peter Strzok and others, were they abusing their power in an attempt to impact an American election in a way that they saw fit to help candidate and hurt another candidate. And what does that mean if that can happen in the United States of America, congressman?"

If we begin to view that blindfolded lady holding a set of scales is really having an R or a D on her brass plate, if that's where we are, then we are finished as a republic. I'm proud to be on the House intel committee and we've done some really important work on the FISA abuse. It's been a long slag and we haven't had a lot of help at times. But Devin has made a really good progress on under covering on what went in to that FISA application. So I don't know. I know this. I know that there were lots of things that should have been in that application that was presented to the judge that were not, and I know that they decided not to charge her before they interviewed 30 fact witnesses. So if that is not a dichotomy that we're going to withhold exculpatory information in this case and we're going to withhold any prospect of prosecution in that case, I don't know how anyone cannot be left with the conclusion that if your name is Clinton, then you will be treated differently than if your name is Jones or Smith."

I mean, Hillary Clinton had a rigged investigation. I think the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible for obstruction and for the Espionage Act and a number of statutes that we laid out here. What happens to her and what happens to the people that were involved in the exoneration before the investigation to impact the presidential election. Never mind lying to four FISA judges to get warrants to spy on Americans an opposition party candidate representatives."

Jeff Sessions, Rod Rosenstein, Chris Wray. It's no longer Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder and Jim Comey. I mean, it's our folks. So if they had uncovered systemic abuse or any potential criminality, they have an obligation to prosecute it. My fear is when you have the head of the FBI stand up in front of the entire world and exonerate her the way Jim Comey did, I don't know a prosecutor in the world that is good enough to win that case. So our opportunity to find out whether or not she violated the Espionage Act, I think Jim Comey ruined that -- they ruined it by not interviewing her seriously. And then they ruined it by that unprecedented press conference. So we'll never know the answer to your question."

Isn't it interesting that James Comey also has the same amnesia? He told the inspector general, I don't remember writing those words that Hillary Clinton was grossly negligent and committed crimes.
