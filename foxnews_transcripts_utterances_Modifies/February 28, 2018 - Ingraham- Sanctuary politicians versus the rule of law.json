We had a roller coaster news day including an uproar among Second Amendment advocates over remarks made by President Trump.  Plus, Trump confidant, Roger Stone, tells us what the special counsel may be trying to pin on the president and on him.  And later, tonight's ANGLE on the ICE chief blasting Oakland's mayor calling her, quote, 'No better than a gang look out' after she tipped criminals off to sweeps and raids that were done over the last three days.  And some in Hollywood -- this is unbelievable -- are trying to push Ryan Seacrest off the red carpet at the Oscars. And just as Barbara Streisand is blaming gun violence, of course, on the president. We'll have all the details. But first, is President Trump giving away the store on gun rights? During a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers this afternoon, the president shocked Republicans -- yours truly included -- and Democrats alike after saying this.",

It was not cool for a lot of people, who believe in the Second Amendment. REPRESENTATIVE RON DESANTIS, R—FLORIDA: When I think of the overall debate, not just that meeting, but since this has happened, you have an instance in which the authorities had dozens of calls and visits to this shooter's home. People in the school knew that this was somebody who had serious problems.  Obviously, he got kicked out of the school. So, you had all these red flags, and of course, the FBI was given a specific tip that he was going to commit a school shooting, and yet they fell down on the job. That is the number one issue that comes out of this. And then I think there are obvious things that we should be doing on a state and local level to harden the schools, to provide more visible security, and to deal with the mental health issues.

He is certainly supposed to advise the president on legal and perhaps in some cases ethical matters, but he is not supposed to run the Justice Department to run interference politically or legally for the president. The president has been disappointed from the jump with Sessions because he thought Sessions would be helping him out in dealing with the Russian matter and so on, and Sessions, quite properly, in my view, recused himself. And in this instance, quite properly, turned to the inspector general to investigate alleged misconduct by the department rather than having Justice Department lawyers investigate the Justice Department.

Mo, let's start with you. The public polling on this isn't great for the people who want to arm teachers. In Florida 50 percent say no or 56 percent say no.

The training that these folks go through, not quite to the deputized level like you were mentioning earlier, but they are very, very well trained, and they certify in firearms proficiency just like police officers do in states where this is being done. So to say that it is only law enforcement that can stop a killer, we say that that is just not accurate, and the faster you stop the shooter, the fewer people died.

      "utterance": "All right, Sean, take care. Good evening, from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. We had a roller coaster news day including an uproar among Second Amendment advocates over remarks made by President Trump. Plus, Trump confidant, Roger Stone, tells us what the special counsel may be trying to pin on the president and on him. And later, tonight's ANGLE on the ICE chief blasting Oakland's mayor calling her, quote, 'No better than a gang look out' after she tipped criminals off to sweeps and raids that were done over the last three days. And some in Hollywood -- this is unbelievable -- are trying to push Ryan Seacrest off the red carpet at the Oscars. And just as Barbara Streisand is blaming gun violence, of course, on the president. We'll have all the details. But first, is President Trump giving away the store on gun rights? During a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers this afternoon, the president shocked Republicans -- yours truly included -- and Democrats alike after saying this."

You could do exactly what you're saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second. You have to look at the age of 21 for certain types of weapons. Some people aren't going to like that, but you're going to have to look at that very seriously."

Because you are afraid of the NRA. That was stunning. He also added that he wanted to strengthen background checks for gun buyers, that's fine. The problem is, those policies have been fiercely opposed by the NRA and other advocates that he said he was standing with on most issues. A little bit confusing. Joining us now to discuss this and a lot more, Jeff Sessions fall out, is Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis, and Fox News senior political analyst, Brit Hume. It is so great to have both of you on the show. Brit, I don't think you have been on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE before and I'm losing my mind. Thank you for joining us. I appreciate it."

It was interesting, sitting next Dianne Feinstein, and you had Manchin and Toomey who had come up with some interesting legislation, then the president kind of hits Toomey and says, you are afraid of the NRA. I don't think Toomey seems to be afraid of the NRA on most any issue that I know of."

And he basically seemed to say, well, we should look at that too, and then it may be either an all-out pan -- it was very difficult to follow. She seemed to be rubbing her hands together and saying, goody. Maybe this was all a show. I know you and I are big fans of the president, but this was a wild thing. It was not cool for a lot of people, who believe in the Second Amendment. REPRESENTATIVE RON DESANTIS, R—FLORIDA: When I think of the overall debate, not just that meeting, but since this has happened, you have an instance in which the authorities had dozens of calls and visits to this shooter's home. People in the school knew that this was somebody who had serious problems. Obviously, he got kicked out of the school. So, you had all these red flags, and of course, the FBI was given a specific tip that he was going to commit a school shooting, and yet they fell down on the job. That is the number one issue that comes out of this. And then I think there are obvious things that we should be doing on a state and local level to harden the schools, to provide more visible security, and to deal with the mental health issues. I mean, all that stuff could be dealt with. I think you get really good even bipartisan support. I think when you start going down the waters that Dianne Feinstein wants to go down, that's not going to go."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Take the guns and go to the court later, I wasn't following that. We have to get to the bad blood between Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and Donald Trump. The president started by saying, 'Why is AG Jeff Sessions asking the inspector general to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey. Isn't the IG an Obama guy, why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!' And Brit, you said this is Trump at his worst. He's asking the DOJ to investigate itself. The inspector general has his own staff of lawyers and investigators, et cetera. Brit, let's go to you first on this, what's happening here with this continued frustration, the president obviously has with the attorney general, is this wise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Laura, I think it is simple, I think the president's conception of what an attorney general is supposed to be is to be his political protector, his political and legal protector. As you and I both know, that is absolutely not what the attorney general is supposed to do. He is certainly supposed to advise the president on legal and perhaps in some cases ethical matters, but he is not supposed to run the Justice Department to run interference politically or legally for the president. The president has been disappointed from the jump with Sessions because he thought Sessions would be helping him out in dealing with the Russian matter and so on, and Sessions, quite properly, in my view, recused himself. And in this instance, quite properly, turned to the inspector general to investigate alleged misconduct by the department rather than having Justice Department lawyers investigate the Justice Department. So, you know, I think the president is clearly off-base here and I think the nation has been well served by Jeff Sessions. We all should hope that Sessions would stay on the job regardless of this hazing by the president."

He'll take a year and a half to write a report and offer recommendations. And there is a time and a place, but from what we have seen over the last six or seven months, just scores of people who have been demoted or have to leave these agencies, a bunch of different potential offenses ranging from false statements to disclosure of classified information. You need a special counsel who can actually pursue those matters, somebody from outside the Justice Department, who is not afraid to offend the applecart. That's what we need in this situation. The IG just not going to cut it."

They famously take forever. They run far afield from their original purpose. I have had constitutional doubts about special counsels.

So, I think she is a loss. I don't think that her departure is any kind of scandal or reflects badly on her. I suspect she has had enough in two years in that job, and that is a pretty long tour of duty. And I suspect that the opportunities waiting for her on the outside are extraordinary.

These leaks keep coming out, don't they, of the Mueller investigation? We'll get into a lot of it. But some of it is now seeming to focus on whether Donald Trump knew about those WikiLeaks hacks or the e-mails that WikiLeaks had of John Podesta and the DNC, and your name keeps popping up as a potential intermediary between, I guess, implied, the Trump campaign and Julian Assange.

The truncated doctored screenshot published by The Atlantic magazine actually proves that I had no advanced knowledge of the source or content of the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary Clinton and I never claimed that I did. Julian Assange himself has said, 'Roger Stone merely retweeted and followed what I was saying and tweeted, absolutely true.' And to be absolutely clear, I never discuss the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding Hillary or John Podesta, which I also had no knowledge of come up with candidate Donald Trump, before, during, or after the election. There is just literally nothing there. Now, all this material that was released today had been turned over to the House Intelligence Committee months ago.

Look, Donald Trump didn't want to go to war over Syria and Hillary Clinton was promising the deep state and expansion of the proxy war there. If you look at Syria, Assad finances Hezbollah and Hamas propped up by the Russians. On the other side, you have ISIS and a thousand other radical groups. We have no friends here. Donald Trump does not want to spend borrowed American money or American lives going to war with Russia over Syria. A no-fly zone as favored by Hillary Clinton and John McCain would have been an invitation for a World War III. So, Donald Trump was the peace candidate in the last election. He has no illusions about Russia or the corruption of the Russian system or the fact that Putin is a bad guy, but they have thermonuclear weapons, Laura, perhaps we should be talking to them."

But they were trying to do the reset, they had to deal with Bill Clinton, the secretary of state, Uranium One. I think the argument is clear that, if anyone was soft on Russia, it was Obama. It wasn't Trump. It was Obama who was soft."

There was one candidate whose foundation was taking millions of dollars from Russian interests. That would be the real Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Panama Papers published in January of 2016 exposed the Podesta brothers' dealings, shady dealings, in Russia, the gas deal, the uranium deal, the banking deal. This is all a matter of public records. So, she was the candidate in bed with Putin, not Donald Trump."

When Immigration Customs and Enforcement announced last night that it had just wrapped a three-day sweep that netted 150 illegal aliens, many of you were probably cheering, but Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf was not amused. Last weekend, Mayor Schaaf took the extraordinary step of sending out a public notice that warned immigrants and their families of the impending ICE raids."

So, get this, if you are a criminal alien, there is no better state to live in then good old California. What Mayor Schaaf did with her illegal immigrant emergency broadcast bulletin, it wasn't just outrageous, it is potentially criminal. ICE Director Tom Homan said the Justice Department is reviewing the possibility of filing federal charges against the mayor. And 'The Washington Times' headline said, 'Locked Libby up now, worry about Hillary later.' That was a fun one. Half of the 150 arrested were convicted criminals, and the charges included gang membership, weapons, domestic violence, and DUIs. But unfortunately, some 864 criminals that ICE was seeking remain at large in the Oakland and San Francisco regions. Now, some of them undoubtedly fled the area after receiving the warning by Mayor Schaaf. Well, this incensed the ICE director, Tom Homan, who spoke to 'Fox & Friends.'"

And she later told 'The Washington Post,' 'I consider myself a law-abiding citizen. I consider myself a believer in American democracy that moves towards a more just society, and I definitely consider myself part of the resistance.' At least she's honest. Resistance to common sense, it may be. Well doing this, Mayor Schaaf's dancing right on the edge of obstruction of justice for shamelessly putting agents, police, and her neighbors in danger. I really hope that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is taking a serious look at this. Here's the bottom line. Because the Oakland mayor put politics and, frankly, her sheer hatred of the president ahead of the rule of law, innocent Californians, and legal immigrants, by the way, might die, be terribly harmed, and I know Oakland is a liberal place -- but how does making life easier for criminal aliens, including MS-13 gang bangers, how does that help your community? It's disgraceful. And that's ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction is Bay Area radio talk show host, Ethan Bearman, who is in L.A. tonight. Ethan, that is your neck of the woods up there in San Francisco area, talk radio is hot up there. We have 864 criminal aliens now on the loose who have either been ordered deported -- didn't show up for their deportation hearings -- or convicted criminals, also illegal immigrants, who were released back into the system. ICE wants to get them out of the country to keep the people of the Bay area safe. How does this mayor, in good conscience, one them to escape, and why is that good?"

It's not like we are like, violent felons hang around California, that's not the case at all. What it is, is we have a couple of million people who are members of our community, the city of Oakland specifically, Mayor Schaaf, those are members of the community. Her job is to protect and care for her community. So, these are members of our community who may have married an American citizen, have children who are American citizens --"

However, there is something called federal immigration law, and we are not allowed as American citizens to pick and choose which federal laws that we abide by -- if we don't like them, that's fine, figure out a way to elect more officials in Washington that change the laws. But the laws on the books now say that if you are a criminal alien, you are subject to immediate deportation in the United States once released. California has made it -- put out a welcome mat for individuals in the country illegally who commit crimes. Maybe it is multiple DUIs. People die in those crimes. Maybe it is simple narcotics trafficking charge. Maybe it is stealing. Maybe it's domestic abuse. Those are the types of people who were swept up in this raid. Now we have the people who are still at large, by the way, one of the targets in Oakland include a Honduran citizen who was previously arrested in San Francisco multiple times for cocaine possession and transport -- probation violations and sex with a minor under the age of 16.

The source, who was on the scene, said that was atrocious and could have cost lives. We brought you a similar report a few days ago, and it related to a body camera. They were told if you don't have body cameras, don't go in. That report has not been disputed by Broward. And the stream of disturbing revelations is fueling a major flashpoint in the gun debate. So should teachers be allowed, if they want, to carry guns in school? For more, we are joined by Laura Carno. She's the founder of Faster Colorado, a civil liberties organization that advocates for arming teachers, along with Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. Mo, let's start with you. The public polling on this isn't great for the people who want to arm teachers. In Florida 50 percent say no or 56 percent say no. But this will be a state by state determination.

Now, when we talk about teachers being armed, the last thing we want to do certainly as an association is suggest that anyone's Second Amendment rights were violated. We are not about that at all. We recognize certainly that there are concerns about teachers as a whole being armed, and when you hear a statement like arming teachers, that is a broad statement.

You made a lot of progress in Colorado on this issue, talked to you on the radio today. The scenario is the teacher has a gun and the student wrestles it away, gun goes off, shoots the kid, or a teacher gets frustrated with a mouthy kid and blasts away, that's a concern."

      "utterance": "Right. And let's think about who these folks are. They're not just teachers. They are janitors, principals, all kinds of folks throughout the school, and they are all volunteers. And a lot of people are saying teachers don't want to be armed. If they don't want to be armed, they are not going to ever be armed. But all of those what-if scenarios, we train for that. The training that these folks go through, not quite to the deputized level like you were mentioning earlier, but they are very, very well trained, and they certify in firearms proficiency just like police officers do in states where this is being done. So to say that it is only law enforcement that can stop a killer, we say that that is just not accurate, and the faster you stop the shooter, the fewer people died. And even where there is a school resource officer, in a school that is big enough for an SRO, that is a big school with lots of hallways and lots of classrooms, and the bad guy knows that. The SRO is in uniform, they know exactly who they are."

      "utterance": "Again, I always go back to this. We have a God-given right, in my view, to be defend ourselves, and to ask these teachers to go to school where you may or may not have a resource officer who is there at the right place and responds and the right way, I would much rather be able to defend myself, defend my students, if I train regularly, background checks, mental health, whatever it is. That is my God-given right. And I think if you don't want to do that as a teacher, Mo, then don't do it, or if you are a parent who has a problem with this, I would hightail it to another school district that doesn't have armed school teachers. But I would take the chances of a teacher or a maintenance person who knows firearms who trains of protecting that classroom over hoping the police get there in time and hoping the one resource officer can handle it. It's our God-given right, and I don't like people taking away our God-given rights. Thank you both. Great segment. And by the way, meanwhile, Barbra Streisand, she is claiming President Trump is to blame for gun violence in Florida, as MSNBC -- it gets better -- slams the first lady first lady and Ivanka Trump as fakes. We'll show you what's fake when we return."

First up, Ryan Seacrest is under pressure more than ever from the #MeToo movement, even after an investigation cleared him of sexual harassment. For more let's bring in Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo. It's a gang up on men time in the culture, all the men are evil and all the women have the answers."

For a business dependent on the family, many of them Christians, this seems like the definition of a mental illness, if you ask me. And in the meantime, Joy, we are praying for you.

And by the way, Jeff Sessions has told Axios that the dinner he had tonight with Rod Rosenstein, his deputy, and Noel Francisco, his solicitor general, was not a show of force against Trump, OK? It was just the boys hanging out together. It was preplanned, just congratulating each other on the great jobs they are doing. It's not being mean to be president. So no mean tweets about Jeff Sessions having dinner. The man needs to eat. That is all the time we have tonight. I cannot wait to watch Shannon Bream and the 'Fox News @ Night' team. They have a great show on tap. Miss Shannon, take it from here."
