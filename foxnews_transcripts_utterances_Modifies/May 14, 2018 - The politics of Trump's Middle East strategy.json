There's an old saying that goes around Washington, people who have dealt with this issue, that the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. And that's what they are doing now.   I think it's also interesting that what you are seeing is a lot of this is coming out of Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas and run by Hamas, right, and you are not seeing this intensity come outs of the West Bank. This is clearly being ginned up for political purposes. And the White House is so concerned. Look, what's only a couple weeks ago that the White House hosted a conference on the future of Gaza and how to improve its infrastructure and improve the lives of the people. Got the Gulf Arab states to show up and pledge some aid. These are states that don't like to talk to one another in some respects because of the dispute in the Gulf and don't like to be in the same room with Israeli representatives, and they were all there.
