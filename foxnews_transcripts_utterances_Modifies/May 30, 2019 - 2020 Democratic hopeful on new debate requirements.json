So, for example, if I were an FBI counterintelligence agent, and I had a smidgen of evidence that potentially the Russians were trying to infiltrate a presidential campaign, but it wasn't enough under the guidelines that exist and under the law that exists to seek a FISA warrant or use confidential informants to try to infiltrate the campaign. If I was so concerned about Russia, because Russia is such adversary challenge for the United States globally, I might err on the side of being overly aggressive. And while that would be understandable given the challenge of Russia, it would be insufficiently respectful to a very important democratic principle, which is that in this system, it's we, the sovereign, the people, who get to decide what our leaders are. And law- enforcement people, intelligence people, unelected bureaucrats, have to -- have a respectful distance from the democratic process.  You don't go past that norm, you don't interfere in the political process unless you have a very, very good reason. So, the question is what was their predicate here?",

And that piece Alan Dershowitz, constitutional law professor writes this. \"Virtually, everybody agrees that, in the normal case, a prosecutor should never go beyond publicly disclosing that there is insufficient evidence to indict. No responsible prosecutor should ever suggest that the subject of this investigation might indeed be guilty even if there was insufficient evidence or other reasons not to indict.\" That was really interesting to hear from Alan Dershowitz. He made the case that those that were siding with Robert Mueller here might make the case that this was not an ordinary case. He says all the rules, same rules should apply here.

The reason this investigation is screwed up from the beginning, Sandra, is it's never been a traditional prosecutor's investigation. It started out as counterintelligence, which you don't need a prosecutor for. I've always thought the linear progression here is the counterintelligence investigation was a pretext to do a criminal investigation without a predicate crime. The criminal investigation has been a pretext to gather what could be impeachment information to get that to Congress. And the impeachment inquiry is what this is really about which is not removing President Trump from power. That's never going to happen. What this is about is bruising him up that is the president until we get to autumn of next year, and they -- hopefully from their perspective have made him unelectable.

Smollett identified his attackers as being white saying he could see through the eye holes of their ski masks. But now we know on the advice of his attorney, Smollett refused to look at a photo line-up of potential suspects that included the Osundairo brothers. And when the brothers were finally arrested for the allege attacks Smollett admitted he knew them but told police they couldn't be the suspects because, quote, \"they are black as sin.\" Smollett later said he assumed his attackers were white because they said \"MAGA country.\" Text messages also reveal that several months before the attack Smollett asked the Osundairo brothers if they had any contacts for Mollie and Whitney, meaning, ecstasy, cocaine and other pills. And remember when Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx dropped the 16 counts against Smollett and Chicago police said they were blindsided? Well, maybe not so much. The documents show that after Smollett was indicted on February 28th, quote, \"Assistant States Attorney Lisa Lanier informed detectives that she felt the case would be settled with Smollett paying the city of Chicago 10,000 in restitution and doing community service.\" And that's exactly what happened almost one month later and here's what police said at the time.

He said that there would be a big announcement coming, an immigration related announcement.

The Congress is the number one branch of government, equal branch of government, and they should not let a president get away with obstruction of justice."

Whether or not there was information withheld from the FISA Court. That would seem to be the more prominent question before us. And I would agree with Robert Mueller in his statement that the biggest threat here is not that the president acted inappropriately after being falsely accused. The biggest threat is that Russians are trying to interfere with our elections. We should hold hearings on those questions, we should work together as a -- as a bipartisan Congress to try to react to and respond to that threat.

They can take steps beyond what the factual information before them can demand. And still, be motivated in good faith by what they see as the protection of the United States. So, for example, if I were an FBI counterintelligence agent, and I had a smidgen of evidence that potentially the Russians were trying to infiltrate a presidential campaign, but it wasn't enough under the guidelines that exist and under the law that exists to seek a FISA warrant or use confidential informants to try to infiltrate the campaign. If I was so concerned about Russia, because Russia is such adversary challenge for the United States globally, I might err on the side of being overly aggressive. And while that would be understandable given the challenge of Russia, it would be insufficiently respectful to a very important democratic principle, which is that in this system, it's we, the sovereign, the people, who get to decide what our leaders are. And law- enforcement people, intelligence people, unelected bureaucrats, have to -- have a respectful distance from the democratic process. You don't go past that norm, you don't interfere in the political process unless you have a very, very good reason. So, the question is what was their predicate here?"

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Very interesting stuff. I heard you earlier today referenced Alan Dershowitz and this piece he quickly wrote after we heard that public statement from Robert Mueller yesterday. He writes, \"Shame on Robert Mueller for exceeding his role.\" We just had this debate about Robert Mueller and obviously looked at the criticism from the president earlier today. And that piece Alan Dershowitz, constitutional law professor writes this. \"Virtually, everybody agrees that, in the normal case, a prosecutor should never go beyond publicly disclosing that there is insufficient evidence to indict. No responsible prosecutor should ever suggest that the subject of this investigation might indeed be guilty even if there was insufficient evidence or other reasons not to indict.\" That was really interesting to hear from Alan Dershowitz. He made the case that those that were siding with Robert Mueller here might make the case that this was not an ordinary case. He says all the rules, same rules should apply here. Final thoughts, Andy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think -- I think, Alan is right about that in terms of just narrowly what it's proper for a prosecutor to do. The reason this investigation is screwed up from the beginning, Sandra, is it's never been a traditional prosecutor's investigation. It started out as counterintelligence, which you don't need a prosecutor for. I've always thought the linear progression here is the counterintelligence investigation was a pretext to do a criminal investigation without a predicate crime. The criminal investigation has been a pretext to gather what could be impeachment information to get that to Congress. And the impeachment inquiry is what this is really about which is not removing President Trump from power. That's never going to happen. What this is about is bruising him up that is the president until we get to autumn of next year, and they -- hopefully from their perspective have made him unelectable. I've always thought this was about hardball politics more than anything wrong."

Democrats who are in districts that are Trump friendly, who have been trying to walk this line of saying, \"Yes, we think there was an impeachable conduct, but the Senate would never remove him, so, what's the point of going down this road? What Muller did, Sandra, was give the base the which is much more rabidly anti-Trump ammunition to do really what Juan William said a few minutes ago which is to say if we don't act here, that means Trump is above the law and he gets away with it."

But then they have these donor criteria and I just don't understand where that came from or what the thinking is behind that. And I don't actually think it's a good idea because as best I can tell as someone who's campaigned all over this country, a lot of Americans are struggling. About 50 percent of the American people can't afford basic necessities like their housing or their utilities or their food.

This person found it Occupied DNC and she makes the case that the mainstream media and the DNC are colluding against the American people. That's what it feels like.

I have no issue with them trying to narrow the field. That makes sense. Historically that's been done by polling averages. That also makes sense.

I think even though the chief negotiator agreed with the United States, they didn't want to do it because it looked like they were giving in to the United States. We got to recognize that world image and domestic image for the communist party running China is a major, major issue. And I think even today that issue is -- was seen being played out. They've unleashed their state-owned media, Sandra, to come up with this bluster that you were quoting there and also to threaten us. But President Xi isn't doing that. China knows full well that the president has imposed tariffs on them. And but at the end of the day, they don't want this relationship to go away. They desperately need the United States. We are their number one market. And clearly, they want a relationship with these two major economies in the world and these two major militaries in the world. And they are trying to, I think, navigate through challenging waters for them. Sandra, no American president in a generation has pushed back on China the way this president has done. That's number one. Two, there is a certain volatility here and unpredictability to the president, let's be frank about it. And that also adds to this. I can't imagine how many hundreds of analysts they are trying to figure out what Trump's advisors are thinking so they can anticipate what moves the president may be making in the future. I think --"

In return we'll get sanction relief. It didn't happen. President Trump said no. And certainly, this is the behavior that reminds us how repressive and outrageous and atrocious this leadership is in North Korea.

They've been on -- they have been in place for a year. And the data shows they have been paid 100 percent by the American consumer. This was a tax on us, the prices went up by the full amount of the tariffs. We paid $50 billion or so in higher taxes for these goods. So that's why I think the -- if you are going to do something, if you are going to get an agreement, let's get it soon because all that's happened so far, is we have penalized ourselves $50 billion."

The tariff will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.\" So, this announcement just made by the president a moment ago at which time the tariffs will be removed details from the White House to follow.

You can't just single out one country and apply tariffs to them. But, two, this is exactly what I mean. We negotiated a new NAFTA that hasn't passed Congress, but now the president is going to go to our trading partners and launch tariffs on them? You have seen him go to Europe and threaten Europe with tariffs. And now simultaneously going to go threaten a trade war against China when we need our North American allies and Japan and Europe to be on our side to confront the Chinese, he is just ticking everyone off today. So, I just -- I don't think this is a right strategic approach."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Sandra. These files include 460 pages of Chicago police reports and documents. We are still scouring them. But so far some pretty fascinating contradictions. For example, this is the first time that we're learning it was during a supplemental police report that Jussie Smollett apparently remembered that his attackers yelled, quote, \"this is MAGA country\" followed by a racial slur. Smollett identified his attackers as being white saying he could see through the eye holes of their ski masks. But now we know on the advice of his attorney, Smollett refused to look at a photo line-up of potential suspects that included the Osundairo brothers. And when the brothers were finally arrested for the allege attacks Smollett admitted he knew them but told police they couldn't be the suspects because, quote, \"they are black as sin.\" Smollett later said he assumed his attackers were white because they said \"MAGA country.\" Text messages also reveal that several months before the attack Smollett asked the Osundairo brothers if they had any contacts for Mollie and Whitney, meaning, ecstasy, cocaine and other pills. And remember when Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx dropped the 16 counts against Smollett and Chicago police said they were blindsided? Well, maybe not so much. The documents show that after Smollett was indicted on February 28th, quote, \"Assistant States Attorney Lisa Lanier informed detectives that she felt the case would be settled with Smollett paying the city of Chicago 10,000 in restitution and doing community service.\" And that's exactly what happened almost one month later and here's what police said at the time. Watch."

He announced it via a tweet after teasing it earlier today on the lawn of the White House as he was leaving. He said that to expect a dramatic announcement on the border. Here is the president's tweet a moment ago. \"On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods coming into our country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our country stop. The tariffs will gradually increase until the illegal immigration problem is remedied at which time the tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.\" We have got a statement now from the president regarding these emergency measures as they are calling them to address the crisis at the border. That statement starts out talking about what they're calling the United States, America has been invaded by hundreds of thousands of people coming into Mexico and entering our country illegally. As I mentioned, the president earlier today when he was departing the White House, he commented on a variety of issues. One of them was this. He said that there would be a big announcement coming, an immigration related announcement. He said we are going to do something very dramatic on the border is what he said this morning is because people are coming into our country. So now we have the president threatening these new tariffs on Mexico that would begin June 10th on all goods coming from Mexico into the United States. And as the tweet alludes, they would increase if that does not stop over time. Markets are reacting to this tonight. They were down about 150 points, or they fell about 150 points on this news. It was a sharp drop. Dow Futures I should say they open about 6 o'clock --"

But you should also keep in mind, this is not the first time that the White House and President Trump has threatened tariffs on Mexico. Remember they talked about 25 percent tariffs on Mexican auto parts that come into this country if they didn't do anything about the border. So, this is not the first time that we have heard this. In fact, 5 percent might be even less than 25 percent threat that we heard just about last year. But don't forget, that we're in the middle of trying to seal this USMCA which is the new NAFAT, NAFTA 2.0. We know Mike Pence was in Canada speaking to Prime Minister Trudeau today to try to get that trade deal finalized. So, this obviously doesn't help if you're trying to get Congress on side to get this pass through."

      "speaker": "LI",

They also do a lot of garment business and a lot of parts that come into this country as well. So, when he threatens to shut down the border there were concerns that maybe this will -- this is going to impact two-way trade since billions of dollars cross that border each and every year."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I want to read this portion, because we now have the statement from the White House here. \"Mexico must step up and help solve this problem.\" The White House wrote. \"We welcome people who come to the United States legally. But we cannot allow our law to be broken and our borders to be violated. For years Mexico has not treated us fairly. But we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign nation.\" The president has put it out there that he suggested tariffs would be more effective means to pressure Mexico to do more about this migrant situation."

    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "Right. Don't forget cutting off aid as well to those three nations Honduras, Guatemala and the like of that make up the most of the caravans, the individuals trying to cross that southern border. But tariffs seem to be the favorite way that the president wants to tackle issues whether it has to do with China or Mexico, and these are countries that enjoy surpluses trading with the U.S. It's understood that they get a lot of money out of this country. So, in some ways I would say that the U.S. has a stronger position to negotiate from."

Ninety-two- year-old Robert Chrismer is a World War II navy veteran who discovered the American flag flying in front of his Fresno home was stolen. When he reported the theft to local law enforcement, they not only responded to his call, but brought him a brand-new flag. The Fresno County sheriff's deputies then hung the new flag just in time for Memorial Day. The deputies thanked the war hero for his service, and then in the Facebook post reminded everyone that good deeds always outshine bad people. And that is “The Story” for this Thursday night.
