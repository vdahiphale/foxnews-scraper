Good evening, I'm Sandra Smith in for Martha MacCallum. Prosecutors say Salman knew about Mateen's guns, his affinity for violent Muslim extremist videos and his intention to attack a location but did nothing to stop him. June 12th, 2016, he opened fire at the Orlando nightclub killing 49 people, injuring 58 others. Mateen was killed in a gun battle with police. Tonight, the victims and their families are overcome with anger, outrage, and heart break. As we have learned, Salman cried with joy after the verdict was announced.

      "sentences": "Sandra, the memo authored by Andrew Bosworth is titled \"The Ugly\". It was released internally to Facebook employees back in June of 2016 and it reveals that Facebook certainly understands the physical and social risks their product carries. But Bosworth, who is among Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg's trusted lieutenants, also makes it very clear that as long as the company is growing, the dangers are secondary. And it should be noted that Facebook's growth is astounding. The company has more than two billion users and a market value of nearly half trillion dollars. Buzzfeed reports that inside Facebook, Andrew Bosworth is known for being blunt but not diplomatic. In the memo, Bosworth argues that connecting people is paramount despite what could be catastrophic consequences. Quoting here: \"The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.\" The memo was actually posted internally one day after the shooting death of a man in Chicago was captured live on Facebook. And shortly after the memo was posted, an Israeli teen was stabbed to death by a terrorist who boasted on Facebook that he planned to die as a martyr. And Facebook has been under fire in recent weeks for allowing its user profiles to be acquired and used for political purposes.   Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, responded to the release of the memo saying, \"Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook, including myself disagreed with strongly. We never believed the ends justify the means.\" And Bosworth himself is weighing in, saying the memo was certainly meant to be provocative and rally the troops and he also laments the fact that it was leaked, quoting again: \"this is the very real cost of leaks. We had a sensitive topic that we could engage on openly and explore even bad ideas, even if just to eliminate them.\" Though, in looking at Facebook's track record, critics wonder if the bad ideas truly are being eliminated.

They don't care about user privacy, they don't care about protecting our data. they've always only been about the bottom line. That's not really what concerns me, though, I've known that for a while. They're open about it in their terms and conditions. What I think is funny about this whole thing I don't think that we would be talking about it if Donald Trump were not president.

And money is supposed to go to the Pentagon, and there probably would have to be a separate vote if you want to shift the money around. But here's the real point: it might not matter because what we saw from the border chief today is they're going to take a little bit of money here.   A little bit of money there, and while Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are saying, you're not going to build the wall, they're building it already as we speak two miles at a time. For a quick example, Calexico in California, the border. There are a lot of critics this week's saying, oh there was already a wall there from the 1990s. That is not the wall.

And we still can't. The very people who should have been protecting us as children were active in concealing and covering up the abuse. And we're really dealing with this situation now. MSU's internal reports where they were tracking the social media profiles complained that my husband was one of the ringleaders in the social media war. And the reason that he had to be was because MSU wasn't taking leadership. MSU wasn't doing what they should have done. They should have been grieving. They should have been pouring time and resources and energy into finding out how they could have the worst sexual assault scandal in campus history right there. And instead they were preoccupied with trying to dig up dirt on the survivors. At the exact time they were doing this, we had 256 women coming into court to confront their abuser. And MSU was more preoccupied with protecting the institution and digging up dirt on the victims or trying to dig up dirt on the victims than they were at finding out why there was a pedophile flourishing on their campus abusing little girls for 20 years.",

That is the theme of an explosive new memo burning through the Internet tonight, written by top Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, defending company's data mining practices, saying: \"So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies, maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools, and still we connect people.\" Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast Newsroom with this story.

      "utterance": "Sandra, the memo authored by Andrew Bosworth is titled \"The Ugly\". It was released internally to Facebook employees back in June of 2016 and it reveals that Facebook certainly understands the physical and social risks their product carries. But Bosworth, who is among Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg's trusted lieutenants, also makes it very clear that as long as the company is growing, the dangers are secondary. And it should be noted that Facebook's growth is astounding. The company has more than two billion users and a market value of nearly half trillion dollars. Buzzfeed reports that inside Facebook, Andrew Bosworth is known for being blunt but not diplomatic."

      "utterance": "\"The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.\" The memo was actually posted internally one day after the shooting death of a man in Chicago was captured live on Facebook. And shortly after the memo was posted, an Israeli teen was stabbed to death by a terrorist who boasted on Facebook that he planned to die as a martyr. And Facebook has been under fire in recent weeks for allowing its user profiles to be acquired and used for political purposes. Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, responded to the release of the memo saying, \"Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook, including myself disagreed with strongly. We never believed the ends justify the means.\" And Bosworth himself is weighing in, saying the memo was certainly meant to be provocative and rally the troops and he also laments the fact that it was leaked, quoting again: \"this is the very real cost of leaks. We had a sensitive topic that we could engage on openly and explore even bad ideas, even if just to eliminate them.\" Though, in looking at Facebook's track record, critics wonder if the bad ideas truly are being eliminated.

Allie, let me start with you first, you know, people are wondering just what the heck is going on here. And now, the latest for them, this leaked memo. I mean, it's circulating not all around Silicon Valley, which it did first, but all over the world -- people have seen this thing.

Facebook cares about growth not because they care about connectivity or community, but because they care about money. And I think we've seen that pretty blatantly over the last couple weeks. The way that Mark Zuckerberg became a millionaire, the way that Facebook has a market cap of over $400 billion is not through Farmville, it's through selling our information. They don't care about user privacy, they don't care about protecting our data. they've always only been about the bottom line. That's not really what concerns me, though, I've known that for a while. They're open about it in their terms and conditions. What I think is funny about this whole thing I don't think that we would be talking about it if Donald Trump were not president. No one has really been that concerned about Facebook's integrity as it concerns with politics until it concerned Donald Trump. They weren't concerned over those Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, but now that Donald Trump is president, he used it as a means to win."

But it's interesting, Jessica, in the wake of all of this, it seems that there's a lot of outrage by this Andrew Bosworth or Boz, as he's known inside of the company -- he's really in the inner circle. One of Zuckerberg's closest and most trusted lieutenant, that they're really worried about the cost of the leaks. It's almost like they're more worried about the leaks than what is actually being let out from this. But, I have to ask you, is this really the cost of a company, which was a young company, building itself, a technology company, and perhaps the way of defending this is you got to throw everything out there, right, to see what sticks?

I don't know what kind of troops you are trying to rally when you're talking about losing another human being to connect people? That's something that Mark Zuckerberg said, you know, I didn't agree with, and majority of employees didn't agree with. I don't understand how this wasn't something that was stamped out immediately and frankly circulated earlier.

I think we are all familiar with brainstorming, but that he is saying the end justifies -- or yes, the means justify the end. But if someone murders someone that it's not that big of a big because, hey, we grew more and we raised our profits by selling more user data.

For a quick example, Calexico in California, the border. There are a lot of critics this week's saying, oh there was already a wall there from the 1990s. That is not the wall. What they are doing now is taking a small bit that we recycled steel or something and turning into 30 foot ballers for two mile stretch. 30 feet is basically a wall. That's another way to say it."

They shamed the victims. They attacked our character and our motivation. That has not changed. Just a few weeks ago, the interim President, Angler, testified before the Michigan Higher Education Committee and he told a lot of the exact same lies about our character and our motivations as related to the legislative package that I had put forward.

And we still can't. The very people who should have been protecting us as children were active in concealing and covering up the abuse. And we're really dealing with this situation now. MSU's internal reports where they were tracking the social media profiles complained that my husband was one of the ringleaders in the social media war. And the reason that he had to be was because MSU wasn't taking leadership. MSU wasn't doing what they should have done. They should have been grieving. They should have been pouring time and resources and energy into finding out how they could have the worst sexual assault scandal in campus history right there. And instead they were preoccupied with trying to dig up dirt on the survivors. At the exact time they were doing this, we had 256 women coming into court to confront their abuser. And MSU was more preoccupied with protecting the institution and digging up dirt on the victims or trying to dig up dirt on the victims than they were at finding out why there was a pedophile flourishing on their campus abusing little girls for 20 years."

      "utterance": "Monday, affluenza teen Ethan Couch is set to be released from jail. Five years ago, Couch killed four people after getting behind the wheel, drunk on beer, he stole from a Texas Walmart. Couch got no jail time for his actions after arguing in court he suffered from affluenza. A disorder that left him unable to tell right from wrong, because his wealthy parents never taught him how to behave responsibly. Couch went on to violate his parole in 2016, landing him in jail for two years. In moments, we will hear from a close friend of one of Couch's victims, and why he makes weekly visits to Couch in jail. But, first, Trace Gallagher, once again in our West Coast Newsroom with the back story. Trace?"

      "utterance": "Sandra, as part of his lenient sentence and probation, Ethan Couch was told to steer clear of alcohol and drugs, yet later video emerged of Couch, at a Party where alcohol was being served. To avoid the probation hearing and jail time for being around alcohol, Couch and his mom fled to Mexico. But, he was arrested south of the border. Brought back to Texas and summarily sentenced to 720 days in jail. That is 180 days for each of the four people that he killed. But three days from now on April 2nd, affluenza teen, Ethan Couch, will walk out of jail just days before his 21st birthday. He still has several years left on probation and he will be required to wear a GPS monitor, maintain a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. Have to drive with a camera equipped ignition unlocking device and submit to daily drug and alcohol testing. If for any reason his probation is revoked, he faces up to 40 years in prison and the man who initially prosecuted the then 16-year-old, says it is unlikely Ethan Couch will play by the rules. Watch."

      "utterance": "The time of incarceration that he has had, I would like to think it would have changed him. But my position hasn't changed. Ethan's character is what it is. His character was formed long before the conduct that brought him into contact with the D.A.'s office. And I would be very surprised, if he completes his probation."

      "utterance": "Remember, along with killing four people, Ethan Couch had two teens riding in the bed of his pickup truck who were severely injured. We are told one of those teens continues to suffer the effects of a significant brain injury. And now Couch's mom is behind bars days before her son is set to get out. After Tanya Couch was caught in Mexico, she was arrested and charged with money laundering and hindering the apprehension of a felon. She was freed on bond, but as a condition of her release from-- she was prohibited from drugs and alcohol. She failed a urine test on Wednesday and she was taken back into custody in Tarrant County, Texas, again. Sandra?"

      "utterance": "Trace, thank you. My next guest lost his best friend in that 2013 crash. Tim Williams, said he struggled for a long time after his childhood friend Brian Jennings, there on the left was killed and the person responsible was not punished. But with a background in ministry, he became a visiting chaplain at Couch's jail, spending time with him almost every week for the past two years. Minister Tim Williams, joins me now. Thank you for coming on with us tonight. It's something that many people might find hard to believe that this is someone who killed your childhood friend and you decided to visit him weekly while he was in jail. Why? TIM WILLIAMS, FRIEND KILLED IN 2013 CRASH: Well, there was certainly a lot of personal things I had to work through before I could even think about visiting with him. But, really, it was something that I felt Brian would do if he was here. And so I checked with a few friends and we had a consensus that this was his heart, but also, you know, extending forgiveness is such a biblical act and so those are some of the core motivators for why I began to visit with Ethan."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "You widowed your best friend's wife, made her a widow, I should say. He caused his children, not to grow up with a dad. It's an incredibly difficult story and it is one possibly of forgiveness. Have you found the ability to forgive him for what he did?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I have -- I found the ability, the strength to forgive before I met with Ethan. And it wasn't connected with meeting with him. And certainly it is a very painful thing for all the victims, all the family members who lost loved ones."

      "utterance": "Is he a different person today than he was then?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I think that his character has shifted. I think that he is a different person. I have seen him become more honest and actually own what he caused."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "What does the future hold for him, do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Ethan has a good long road ahead of him to be compliant with the terms of his condition. I do think that he does want to work and keep the conditions of probation. I believe he does want to work with his dad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Can you give us an idea -- sort of what you two would talk about and what he shared with you? What was the conversation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, the initial visits really set the framework. And in the bible there's a book called, Romans, and in chapter eight, the opening line is, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. And I said, Ethan that is the real context of me coming to you today. There is a lot of reason for me to have anger and hate or condemnation of you, because have you caused so much pain and destruction to many of my closest friends, including my family."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I was just going to say, I wanted to begin, Ethan, and just see if maybe, if there is hope for you. Can we maybe begin a conversation to see if you are wanting to grow forward or if we are going to hear excuses?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "He claimed then, that he didn't know right from wrong. Does he know that now?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I would say he does, yes."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "You know, it's an amazing story of hope, but one of sadness, I mean he killed four people and those people will never come back. You know, one might say, you are doing god's work by trying to meet with him and see if he is a changed man. We will continue to follow this story as he will -- he will walk out on Monday. Thank you."
