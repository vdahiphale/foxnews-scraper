      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Back in Washington tonight. Now, Susan Rice really wants to be Joe Biden's number two and a shameless appearance. I don't know if any of you guys saw, I hope you didn't, but I was on Meet the Press and she told this story about, well, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Well, guess what? Mike Pompeo is here with exclusive reaction to her charges against the administration. And a reminder to Americans about what her ascension would bring.  Also, tonight, what do COVID deaths really mean today when they continue to plummet as the number of cases rise? Of course, we don't want anyone to die of COVID. It's a horrible thing and a tragedy. But what do these numbers really tell us? And why are the experts avoiding that truth?  My medicine cabinet is here on that. And, of course, the incredible news about hydroxychloroquine and the media spent the weekend lying about Trump's Mount Rushmore speech. Not at all surprising. Raymond Arroyo will tell us how it relates to Joe Biden's latest union event in Seen and Unseen. But first, why the Left lies? That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  All right, Democrats have reached, I think the obvious conclusion that their only path, sure path to victory is the burn it all down approach of the neo Bolsheviks on the streets. Joe Biden's team has formed common cause with those who not only seek the destruction of the nuclear family. If you don't believe me, check out BLM's website. They've actually decided that promoting racial hatred is the only way they can win. They know that Trump's policies, it's obvious have delivered results for working people of all races, while theirs have largely failed. Now, the Left hopes that by inflaming a racial division and hiding their candidate, they could avoid a real debate on the issues.  So, over the weekend, the President responded with two powerful speeches to celebrate our independence and identify the domestic forces now threatening it. His remarks at Mount Rushmore reaffirmed America's identity and inspired millions of Americans who've basically been living in despair because of the one two punch of the virus and the continuing riots.",

In moments of rare candor, they know that Trump beats Biden hands down on jobs and wages for African Americans. Trump beats Biden on education. He favors liberation for parents and students who are stuck in bad schools.  Trump beat Biden on prison reform. Obama and Biden both talked a good game. They didn't get it done. And, of course, Trump has done something that Biden never did. He has actually hired and promoted African Americans and other minorities across as many businesses. Now, where Biden and Democrats are content to patronize African Americans with these meaningless symbolic gestures, conservatives actually believe that minorities want what all people want, a fair chance at prosperity and to pursue their happiness in freedom and safety. Trump knows this is only possible with a vibrant, growing economy where all criminals are prosecuted.  Meanwhile, Biden thinks he can surf to victory on racial anger stoked by mobs, many of whom are white, who would rather see every city in America burn than a second Trump term.   Now, this requires a massive effort to lie and defame one that an honest press would have exposed long ago. Now, as I've said before, instead of covering the Democrats, the media cover for them, their tactics, and their toxic associations, I'm talking about. So long as the end game of any activist or politician is to rid America of Trump, the press will excuse all manner of falsehoods, hypocrisy and even criminality. So, to stoke racial tension, the Biden campaign requires a massive effort to lie and defame one that, of course, would have already been exposed long ago. Now, when you think back - when you think about how this whole thing went down, how did it go down? It went down after this long shutdown. People had a lot of time on their hands. Again, if we continue to allow these lies and this ongoing slander and defamation to continue, well, what happens?

Economic deprivation was far worse in 1968 than it is today. On the other hand, too is that there was good reason to oppose on the part of many people. The war in Vietnam. But some people did it peacefully. Other people didn't do it peacefully. But there seems to be today kind of a recklessness.

And those cases received less than 20 percent of the media coverage of police violence. You can look at interracial crime the same way. There's fairly little interracial crime. A 93 percent of black murder victims. 85 percent of white murder victims are killed by people of the same race. The person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or current husband.  But when you look at interracial crime, that in general slants say 80 percent black on white. Among those two races, media coverage slants in the exact opposite direction.

It's the worst kind of behavior from a national security leader. And as for her comments about Russia, it was on the Obama watch, under the Susan Rice watch, under Vice President Biden's watch that Ukraine had one-fifth of its real estate taken by Vladimir Putin with virtually no response. It was under her watch that Syria was handed over to the Russians as a result of a red line that Obama had drawn in the sand, but then refused to enforce. And you'll recall too, when it comes to having American soldiers taking care of what she suggests this administration didn't do but does always.

I don't know if any of you guys saw, I hope you didn't, but I was on Meet the Press and she told this story about, well, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Well, guess what? Mike Pompeo is here with exclusive reaction to her charges against the administration. And a reminder to Americans about what her ascension would bring. Also, tonight, what do COVID deaths really mean today when they continue to plummet as the number of cases rise? Of course, we don't want anyone to die of COVID. It's a horrible thing and a tragedy. But what do these numbers really tell us? And why are the experts avoiding that truth? My medicine cabinet is here on that. And, of course, the incredible news about hydroxychloroquine and the media spent the weekend lying about Trump's Mount Rushmore speech. Not at all surprising. Raymond Arroyo will tell us how it relates to Joe Biden's latest union event in Seen and Unseen. But first, why the Left lies? That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. All right, Democrats have reached, I think the obvious conclusion that their only path, sure path to victory is the burn it all down approach of the neo Bolsheviks on the streets. Joe Biden's team has formed common cause with those who not only seek the destruction of the nuclear family. If you don't believe me, check out BLM's website. They've actually decided that promoting racial hatred is the only way they can win. They know that Trump's policies, it's obvious have delivered results for working people of all races, while theirs have largely failed. Now, the Left hopes that by inflaming a racial division and hiding their candidate, they could avoid a real debate on the issues. So, over the weekend, the President responded with two powerful speeches to celebrate our independence and identify the domestic forces now threatening it. His remarks at Mount Rushmore reaffirmed America's identity and inspired millions of Americans who've basically been living in despair because of the one two punch of the virus and the continuing riots."

He favors liberation for parents and students who are stuck in bad schools. Trump beat Biden on prison reform. Obama and Biden both talked a good game. They didn't get it done. And, of course, Trump has done something that Biden never did. He has actually hired and promoted African Americans and other minorities across as many businesses. Now, where Biden and Democrats are content to patronize African Americans with these meaningless symbolic gestures, conservatives actually believe that minorities want what all people want, a fair chance at prosperity and to pursue their happiness in freedom and safety. Trump knows this is only possible with a vibrant, growing economy where all criminals are prosecuted. Meanwhile, Biden thinks he can surf to victory on racial anger stoked by mobs, many of whom are white, who would rather see every city in America burn than a second Trump term. Now, this requires a massive effort to lie and defame one that an honest press would have exposed long ago. Now, as I've said before, instead of covering the Democrats, the media cover for them, their tactics, and their toxic associations, I'm talking about. So long as the end game of any activist or politician is to rid America of Trump, the press will excuse all manner of falsehoods, hypocrisy and even criminality. So, to stoke racial tension, the Biden campaign requires a massive effort to lie and defame one that, of course, would have already been exposed long ago. Now, when you think back - when you think about how this whole thing went down, how did it go down? It went down after this long shutdown. People had a lot of time on their hands. Again, if we continue to allow these lies and this ongoing slander and defamation to continue, well, what happens?

Economic deprivation was far worse in 1968 than it is today. On the other hand, too is that there was good reason to oppose on the part of many people. The war in Vietnam.

They were the ANTIFA of their era. The Democratic Party started the Civil War because the Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860. And 1861, Fort Sumter was fired on by Southern Democrats. The fort held by union troops. And that was what kicked off the Civil War, it was the attack by Southern Democrats on northern troops in Fort Sumter, in Charleston Harbor in South Carolina."

And those cases received less than 20 percent of the media coverage of police violence. You can look at interracial crime the same way. There's fairly little interracial crime. A 93 percent of black murder victims. 85 percent of white murder victims are killed by people of the same race. The person most likely to kill you is your ex-wife or current husband. But when you look at interracial crime, that in general slants say 80 percent black on white. Among those two races, media coverage slants in the exact opposite direction. And we do have to ask why that is. I mean, what are the biases in the media that caused that slant?"

She went on and made up a story about a video and a protest when she knew full well that this was a terror attack. She did so because it was politically convenient to say that. It's the worst kind of behavior from a national security leader. And as for her comments about Russia, it was on the Obama watch, under the Susan Rice watch, under Vice President Biden's watch that Ukraine had one-fifth of its real estate taken by Vladimir Putin with virtually no response. It was under her watch that Syria was handed over to the Russians as a result of a red line that Obama had drawn in the sand, but then refused to enforce. And you'll recall too, when it comes to having American soldiers taking care of what she suggests this administration didn't do but does always. It was her administration that was underwriting the Iranian regime while it was killing American soldiers in the Middle East. That was an administration that didn't care about our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and certainly didn't act away that was securing the American national interest."

Whether it was in Taiwan where they refused to do the right thing, or even protecting Americans from predatory economic activity, costing Americans thousands and hundreds of thousands of jobs here in the United States.

And now they are not ruling out, Mr. Secretary, China is not, blocking Hong Kong citizens from leaving for the U.K., because the U.K. says you want to come back and live here, come here.

I certified the same. And we can see this is going to end up just being another communist run city. It's unfortunate. Hong Kong was such a special place where there were all the freedoms that the people of Hong Kong were promised by the Chinese Communist Party. It's much like the promise they made to tell us the truth but where the coronavirus came from. We know it started in Wuhan. We know it came from China, and yet they covered it up for an awfully long time. It's these same kinds of broken promises that will lead the United States to take the right response with respect to Hong Kong's new national security law. We have already begun the process of revoking visas for people who made these decisions. And there will be a series of actions that the administration will take.

Dr. Oskoui, the trashing of herd immunity, even the president is kind of pooh-poohed a number of times, like, the herd. I love that little box. There he is on that --"

      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "I think it's a mistake to trash it. The reality is that's the mechanism by which all vaccines work. It's the way we've gone through and conquered prior pandemics and epidemics. Herd immunity is real and it's already occurring as we speak. Since Memorial Day, we have seen people get out and about. We have seen a rise in positive tests. But as you've seen, people aren't getting as sick, and death rates continue to drop. This is what you see in herd immunity. It's virology 101, it's first, second year of medical school."

      "utterance": "Dr. Oskoui, one of our mutual friends says that we are going to end up like Sweden. A lot of people don't understand, what does that mean? Because we didn't kind of let it roll. We didn't keep kids in school. Sweden did, at least younger kids. But how does that, what does it mean, we will end up like Sweden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "I think what our friend is referring to is the fact that slowly and surely herd immunity has developed. The virus, as it attenuates and mutates becomes less and less problematic. Sweden was smart. They quarantined their most vulnerable, and they let their healthiest, least vulnerable individuals, namely children, continue their schooling. And that was much better for both the educational system and the health of their country and their economy. We are about three weeks behind."

      "utterance": "Since you've treated so many patients over the last months, I want to get your reaction. I know you appeared with us last week, but I wasn't here. And the hydroxychloroquine study that dropped from the Henry Ford Clinic' health system there, the mortality rate for patients on hydroxy was basically cut in half."

      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It just basically smashed back at all the doubters, all the critics. And your point is that we should take the hydroxychloroquine we have in our stockpile and perhaps consider giving it prophylactically to health care workers. Explain that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "Well, there are studies, and this is done in India routinely where hydroxychloroquine is given in low doses as prophylaxis to protect high- risk individuals, in India specifically the protocol is for health care workers. We now have a burst of infections in the southern states. A lot of this is due to people coming up from Mexico. And the way to protect first responders and other health care workers I think is very evident -- evidence-based, and it's to give them prophylaxis."

      "utterance": "It's time for the Last Bite, or maybe a nibble. OK, so family and friends hit the river in Jackson, Wyoming, on Friday for some fishing, and I didn't want to show off, so here's my award winner. Do you see the fish? So many punchlines, so little time. It's a tiny little thing. It's like a bait fish. All right. Don't forget, always DVR \"The Ingraham Angle,\" it's so bad.
