When you look at your constituents back home and say you agree with the president that we have to do something about security at the southern border, are you telling the truth or are just doing something that's politically expedient?   This is a chance for them to let their actions speak louder than words. Keep in mind the last time the Democrats sort of follow Nancy Pelosi blindly down a path on policy, we ended up with Obamacare and bailouts and cap and trade, they lost control of the House. So, the question is, is Nancy really leading the Democratic Party, or is she just being led by the hard left wing of her party, and will the rest of the Democrats follow her?  So, this is just the next step in the negotiation. We thought it was the exact right thing for the president to do at the time.

It's not a giant 30-foot concrete barrier that so many Democrats seem to have difficulty with. He even put DACA and TPS on the table at some point during this process and they refused to even engage. So I think the better question is, what are the Democrats willing to do? The president from the very beginning here actually has been the one willing to negotiate. He was the one staying in Washington, D.C., when Nancy went to Hawaii. He's the one who stayed in D.C. when Democrats all went down to Puerto Rico.

So, you have to build it in land, anywhere from a couple of hundred yards, to in some places a mile, which might help you in interdicting drugs and human trafficking, the people who don't want to get caught. But for all of those migrants, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, the Northern Triangle countries, they can still even with a border barrier get feet on U.S. soil and their goal is to be apprehended by the border patrol and get in the system.

If the border -- if the wall -- if the barrier is back one foot from the border and someone can get one foot on our soil depending on what country they're from, they can claim asylum and stay here almost indefinitely. It's why some of the other things we've done that deal was negotiating with Mexico to allow folks who are claiming asylum here to have to go back to Mexico to wait while their asylum is being adjudicated. That's been a major improvement that I don't think has gotten the attention it deserves, but it does raise -- your point does raise the larger picture that we need to change the laws. That's part and parcel of this comprehensive border security concept. It is not just about a barrier. It is not just about technology, it's about changing the laws that right now act as this giant poll.

I mean, clearly, the president showed -- shown real flexibility here for a guy who's not always that flexible. I mean, he has changed his view of this as he's gotten more information about how you secure the border, about ways to do that. We have consistently said that barriers were part of that. The president went from talking about a wall along the entire southern border at one point during the campaign as part of the campaign discussion, to let's have barriers where they work and let's have something else where barriers wouldn't work as well.  Four presidents have build barriers. Joe and I have both supported that when we've been in the Congress, and I think there's certainly a way forward here. But part of the way forward is to look at the other issues that are out there too that need to be dealt with and deal with those, the spending issues that are going to be right in front of us as soon as we get this done. One of the things we learned this year was if you do this the right way, you can -- you can have 100 percent of the government funded by the beginning of the fiscal year. At this time, we got 75 percent of the government funded. That should be one of the lessons we learn here. What do we need to get on the table right now so that we get 100 percent of the government funded and how do we deal with the border as an issue? I've always thought securing the border first made the most sense and then I think the other problems related to immigration are much easier to solve and people think the government has done its fundamental job. And, you know, nobody will ever had more credibility on this than President Trump. If he says the border is secure at the level that the American people should expect, then the other discussions about what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country, what do you do with people who came or stayed illegally -- about half the people not illegally here came legally, and then decided, gee, we're in the United States of America, this is a great place to be.

The AP poll, Julie is here now, now him at 34 percent approval. So that's a drop for him. I'm particularly in touch with the idea that independents, who I think are key as we look towards 2020 and the president and his team are increasingly focused on his re-election prospects, you look at the independents and what they're saying is disapproval of ten points now to 63 percent. And so, overall, even just a general discussion of the topic of border security, Republicans historically hold the advantage. What we see now is that the two sides are equal. That 42 percent trust Pelosi and the Democrats to 40 percent trusting Trump and the Republicans. But let me just add one quick point here.

So, I think the president saw a chance here to try to take the Democrats at their word. Some of the rank and file, also some of the leadership, Dick Durbin said some decent things about border barrier, Jim Clyburn, my former colleague from South Carolina, said that the experts thought we really needed a barrier, he could vote for it. So, let's give a chance for the Democrats to prove whether or not they really do believe in border security and are willing to go against Nancy Pelosi, or whether or not they are so beholden to their leadership that they are never going to vote for a barrier on the southern border."

      "utterance": "I laugh at times she says there's no money for the wall. She actually just voted for almost a quarter billion dollars for a barrier on the southern border with this deal that just got approved last week. But I think what we simply do is go to the Democrats and say, look, are you telling the people the truth? When you look at your constituents back home and say you agree with the president that we have to do something about security at the southern border, are you telling the truth or are just doing something that's politically expedient? This is a chance for them to let their actions speak louder than words. Keep in mind the last time the Democrats sort of follow Nancy Pelosi blindly down a path on policy, we ended up with Obamacare and bailouts and cap and trade, they lost control of the House. So, the question is, is Nancy really leading the Democratic Party, or is she just being led by the hard left wing of her party, and will the rest of the Democrats follow her? So, this is just the next step in the negotiation. We thought it was the exact right thing for the president to do at the time.

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",

I have been on the meetings. He's listened to CBP. He's listened to ICE. We have identified the top 17 highest priorities in terms of where we can put up barriers to discourage people from crossing the border illegally. It's about 243 miles. That's what driving this discussion. It's not a made a magical number of $5.7 billion. It's the wall, where we need it the most and where we need it the quickest. That's what driving this.

The president has all ready gone to the Democrats and said, look, it's not a 2,000-mile sea to shining sea wall. It's not a giant 30-foot concrete barrier that so many Democrats seem to have difficulty with. He even put DACA and TPS on the table at some point during this process and they refused to even engage. So I think the better question is, what are the Democrats willing to do? The president from the very beginning here actually has been the one willing to negotiate. He was the one staying in Washington, D.C., when Nancy went to Hawaii. He's the one who stayed in D.C. when Democrats all went down to Puerto Rico. He was in D.C., which he tried to leave to go to Europe and the Middle East last week. He wants to negotiate on the deal. The Democrat leadership simply refused to take him up on that."

We have been hoping for months to do it through legislation with Democrats because that's the right way for the government to function, but the end of the day, the president's commitment is to defend the nation and he will do it either with or without Congress."

One thing I find curious that nobody's talking about here is that in most places along the Rio Grande, you can't build a fence in the floodplain of the Rio Grande. So, you have to build it in land, anywhere from a couple of hundred yards, to in some places a mile, which might help you in interdicting drugs and human trafficking, the people who don't want to get caught. But for all of those migrants, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, the Northern Triangle countries, they can still even with a border barrier get feet on U.S. soil and their goal is to be apprehended by the border patrol and get in the system. So, how would building a barrier in Texas affect this problem of illegal immigration of the president talks about each and every day?"

Yes, there's technology and a part that sometimes gets forgotten about and something the president has talked about many, many times, which is to change our laws because you're absolutely right. If the border -- if the wall -- if the barrier is back one foot from the border and someone can get one foot on our soil depending on what country they're from, they can claim asylum and stay here almost indefinitely. It's why some of the other things we've done that deal was negotiating with Mexico to allow folks who are claiming asylum here to have to go back to Mexico to wait while their asylum is being adjudicated. That's been a major improvement that I don't think has gotten the attention it deserves, but it does raise -- your point does raise the larger picture that we need to change the laws. That's part and parcel of this comprehensive border security concept. It is not just about a barrier. It is not just about technology, it's about changing the laws that right now act as this giant poll. We encourage people to come here from other countries to enter the country illegally because of the way our laws are structured and those need to be fixed as well as part of the larger national security package."

I can tell you, without giving away anything that shouldn't, that we are in constant communication with the secretary of state, constant communication with the other parts of the federal government to find out what's going on on the ground down there, making sure that our people and our property is safe down there. And also to make sure that we can do everything we can to encourage the Maduro government, which we consider to be illegitimate, to leave. And to back the new national assembly leadership that declared this week. So, it's a very serious situation.

The people came for the wrong reason, we want to make sure they go out and stay out. You need border security for that. But I think that people that came for the right reason have been productive, ought to have a pathway forward. Some. That would change the whole complexion of this. The whole dialogue would change if that could be done. As far as the $5.7 billion, if that's the number, we are figuring how do you split that up? And let the professionals. We have proven it's hard for us because with the president and White House and the legislature, we have locked horns on this thing -- no wall, all wall, halfway in between -- let the professionals tell us what it takes to keep us safe.

      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "I think compromise is the essence of what we do and I think the American people are tired of watching the government where people get locked down for no reason except maybe political reasons. I mean, clearly, the president showed -- shown real flexibility here for a guy who's not always that flexible. I mean, he has changed his view of this as he's gotten more information about how you secure the border, about ways to do that. We have consistently said that barriers were part of that. The president went from talking about a wall along the entire southern border at one point during the campaign as part of the campaign discussion, to let's have barriers where they work and let's have something else where barriers wouldn't work as well. Four presidents have build barriers. Joe and I have both supported that when we've been in the Congress, and I think there's certainly a way forward here. But part of the way forward is to look at the other issues that are out there too that need to be dealt with and deal with those, the spending issues that are going to be right in front of us as soon as we get this done. One of the things we learned this year was if you do this the right way, you can -- you can have 100 percent of the government funded by the beginning of the fiscal year. At this time, we got 75 percent of the government funded. That should be one of the lessons we learn here. What do we need to get on the table right now so that we get 100 percent of the government funded and how do we deal with the border as an issue? I've always thought securing the border first made the most sense and then I think the other problems related to immigration are much easier to solve and people think the government has done its fundamental job. And, you know, nobody will ever had more credibility on this than President Trump. If he says the border is secure at the level that the American people should expect, then the other discussions about what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country, what do you do with people who came or stayed illegally -- about half the people not illegally here came legally, and then decided, gee, we're in the United States of America, this is a great place to be. Let's just not go back."

Many of the Democrats in the last few months have looked at the president making this a big issue in his campaign and they have decided, well, we can't be for that anymore. 2013, virtually every Democrat who is still in the Senate voted for 700 miles of barriers and a whole lot more money than anybody is talking about right now, Speaker Pelosi has been for barriers in the past. You know, the whole idea that somehow 650 or 700 miles of barriers are appropriate, but 702 miles are immoral, that is an incredibly interesting place to draw your line about what's moral and what's not moral. I think this debate got way too political. I do think -- let me say again, I think the president has shown more room -- willingness to move so far than others have, but we need to solve this. We need to solve it in three months. It may look like right now that Speaker Pelosi got what she wanted, open the government and we'll talk. The \"we'll talk\" part of that now is where we really are going to see the speaker either step up and talk, along with Senator Schumer, or find out that \"we'll talk\" really didn't mean anything.

The breakdown came -- basically, the fiscal year 2019 budget for the homeland security was $1.6 billion. That was appropriated. Then it went to the House and the House has bumped it up to $5 billion and it became in contention. So they were going to put that one on the 30-day or let's say to February the 8th and put that one at 1.3 continuing resolution and then fight that one out. I thought that's exactly where the president would go. He got pushed from the base. He jumped up and said we are not going to. Never before have I ever seen when we all agreed unanimously on six bills that we've kept 90 percent of the government open, 96 percent of all money flowing for the government to operate and hold that hostage and so much harm was done.

The government shut down and he got blamed. I think Nancy Pelosi is, obviously, the big winner here. You know, a month ago people were questioning whether she should even be speaker again. I think she's put that to rest. But they feel like they're on a roll here. They picked up the House majority, 40 seats or so. And the president's approval rating has declined significantly during the shutdown. So, clearly, they're the winner. Now, the onus is now on Pelosi and the Democrats to negotiate, like they said they would, in good faith, if the government is reopened. And we'll see if they do that. One thing that strikes me about this, the real losers here are the dreamers. I think those dreamer immigrants have just been treated like pawns, particularly by Pelosi and the Democrats."

I -- I share Jason's winner in this situation. It is definitely Nancy Pelosi, not only on the shutdown itself and how she negotiated with the White House. She comes out of this with her caucus more united than they were when they were sworn in as the new Democratic majority just a few weeks ago. She's got those freshmen who were emboldened coming out of their elections who are now firmly behind her because they see that she is willing to hold a tough line against the president. And for the president, I think one of the things that -- that we really learned through this last few weeks is that he really does not have a strategy for dealing with a Democratic house majority, not just on the shutdown, but more broadly.

I mean what we know from the polling, and we've had some recent polls indicating very clearly now, I think it's 54 percent of the American people don't favor the wall. So that the wall itself, which is a huge political symbol for this president, does not seem to have the political power that he thought. We've seen his numbers drop. The AP poll, Julie is here now, now him at 34 percent approval. So that's a drop for him. I'm particularly in touch with the idea that independents, who I think are key as we look towards 2020 and the president and his team are increasingly focused on his re-election prospects, you look at the independents and what they're saying is disapproval of ten points now to 63 percent. And so, overall, even just a general discussion of the topic of border security, Republicans historically hold the advantage. What we see now is that the two sides are equal. That 42 percent trust Pelosi and the Democrats to 40 percent trusting Trump and the Republicans. But let me just add one quick point here. It's one thing to hear from people who, you know, are pretty critical of Trump about who won and who lost, but why don't you go ask the base and then you hear from people like Ann Coulter of the talk radio crowd and they think Trump lost."

I -- I think some might -- might come around to that. I don't know that -- that -- that -- that Trump will get all of the money he wants, but I think he will get -- get something at the very least, and I think there will be pressure coming from -- from Democrats on Nancy Pelosi to do that. The thing here for the president, though, he clearly believes that the -- that the border security was his ticket in 2016 and that it will be his ticket to re-election. The question is whether there are diminishing returns here for the president on this issue."

But, John, you were at these rallies in 2016, as I was, and I was constantly struck by the fact that a lot of Trump supporters, when he had the chance about build the wall, who will pay for it, that wasn't just a political talking point for a lot of these people."

By the end of next year, NATO allies will add 100 -- 100 billion extra U.S. dollars for defense. So we see some real money and some real results and we see that the clear message from President Trump is having an impact.

It's good for Europe. But it's also good for United States. We have to remember that the only time we have invoked Article V of our collective defense clause was after an attack on the United States. And hundreds of thousands of Canadian, European soldiers have fought shoulder to shoulder with U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. We have worked together with U.S. in defeating Daesh, ISIS in Iraq and Syria. So it's a great advantage for the United States to have 28 allies. Russia doesn't have that. China doesn't have that.

We had a new training mission in Iraq, but also partly by investing more.

      "utterance": "He is. He is in a position for Mueller to squeeze him. That's true. And what this also tells us is that Mueller isn't done yet. He's still out there searching for scalps (ph) and this is something -- this is going to be a cloud over the administration for the foreseeable future. And that is the -- the long-term consequences of this. These may be small fry figures, but it's going to keep this story in the press going forward and off of the president's agenda, to the extent that he has one."

I spoke to the National Security Council just as morning, John, and they told me they're putting a lot of stock this weekend in the fact that Venezuela's defense attache here in Washington yesterday publicly switch sides. He's now thrown his support away from Maduro. They're saying that, you know, armed -- the possibility of armed conflict, as Mick Mulvaney said earlier, is alive and well. This thing could go either way over the -- over the course of the next month (ph)."
