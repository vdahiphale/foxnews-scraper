Day 16 of Putin's brutal invasion and Russian forces are pummeling new targets in Ukraine. A massive fireball seen after Russia struck the western side of the country for the first time. That comes as U.S. officials believe the enormous Russian convoy outside of Kyiv has redeployed and the city now braces for a possible ground assault soon. And during all this chaos, President Biden trying to cripple Russia's economy even more by going after trade.",

I can tell you just in the last hour or so, we've heard some of the biggest explosions we've heard around the city for the last couple of weeks, off in the distance, but explosions that you felt, explosions that shocked the ground. We're not sure if those are air strikes or rockets. It's certainly an escalation from the usual artillery fire. That thump of artillery fire that we hear. On the other side of the building, there were trace of fire fired up into the air earlier. We're not sure if that was just a jumpy Ukrainian soldier here. And I say jumpy because this city has been on edge. People have been warning the city that it is going to come under an offensive soon. And so everyone is just waiting, bracing for the inevitable which they fear is coming. And we see in the images from around the rest of this country and we know it's heading this way. We know that Putin wants the capital, Kyiv, and we know he's moved his troops into place both in the northwest and in the east. The convoy you talked about, which many people used as an example of Russian logistical problems and supply issues. Finally, yesterday, as per satellite images showed that it had disbanded. Some of them moved up to the north. But other pieces, artillery and howitzers have moved into the tree line are believed to be facing the city. There are battles going on in some of the outskirts. Some street to street. Brave Russian -- rather Ukrainian soldiers, holding back the Russians. Mainly with these Javelins, which have been so -- so successful in keeping back the Russians. And so, here we are today, waiting, again, another night to see whether this is the night that Putin's forces decide to attack. President Zelensky speaking out and said that when it did come, he didn't know how long the battle would last. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): It's possible to say how many days we have to free Ukrainian land. But we can say we will do it because we want it. It's a patriotic war against a very stubborn enemy which doesn't pay attention to talents of its own killed people, killed soldiers which collects reservists and conscripts to throw them into the hell of this war.",

Putin's ground forces have been unable to enter almost every city. They're in one city of Kherson. But they are -- Ukrainians are fighting back. The missiles you see fired now, Ukrainians firing at Russian warships in the Black Sea and again, has been fearing an amphibious assault on Odessa that would give Russia control of the coastline. So, there's a lot happening in this country. But a lot of the focus right now here in the capital Kyiv and the sense that any day now, if not any hour, that attack is going to happen. It doesn't seem as if the Russians have been able to surround the city totally. They have been trying for some time now to calm down both the east and the west and cut off the south. They've been unable to. So, the fear is now they're just going to start firing their longer-range artillery, their rockets into the city, softening this target, cutting off the will of the people before they then send in their troops. When they do send in their troops, it's going to be difficult. The city is like a fortress. That's what the mayor said earlier. It's going to be their Stalingrad in the words of many people who live here. Jesse?",

And it seems like it's not going to be impossible for him to do that in the next 24 hours. Next 24 or 48 hours. I'm not a military expert. I don't know. But what I do know is that the Russians have been delaying and delaying because they've had food problems and they've had all kinds of fuel problems, weapon problems, but so has -- so has Zelenskyy. In the end, I don't know where it goes. Let's assume that they take Kyiv. Then what happens? They're not going to stay there. They're not going to occupy. What do they want to do? They want to put their own leader there and then take off and then we're going to be left with an insurgency and it's going to be like Afghanistan all over again. But there's one thing I want to bring up. There's article 42 of the U.N. powers to do a collective military intervention. No one has talked about that. And I think it's probably too early. But the U.N. does have powers beyond what we're talking about with NATO. They would kick Russia off the security council there and do their own intervention. But who knows where the red line is? Up to this point, Putin is deciding where the red line is, and we're just cowering in the back.",

To your point, Judge, what's the long-term victory? Is it to occupy a radicalized population in Ukraine over the long term? That would take enormous Russian resources. Is it to put in a puppet government? Which by the way, wouldn't just include a president? Ministers at every level. Local police department.

The people of Russia ultimately will be let back into the world community once they retire Putin. Once they decide that they, too, want to respect decency and humanity. Now, we can have disagreements politically. And we will. We have in our own country and we have it with other countries.

We were fine with the Pols transferring the jets. That was fine. We just didn't want to bring them off our air base in Germany and the Germans didn't want it coming off of the German air base. That was an escalation in our opinion, and that's because we haven't been giving them jets to begin with. We've already been loading them up with Javelins. And Javelins cost $80,000. And old MiG these are like 4.5 million. So, in our estimation that was a huge escalation. So, the question is, if you give them the MiGs and Russia escalation, we have to then escalate. Then you're on the escalator. That's the concern from the west, because right now, we're safe. Things are fine, this is a one-on-one. We don't need to make it a five-on-one.

That comes as U.S. officials believe the enormous Russian convoy outside of Kyiv has redeployed and the city now braces for a possible ground assault soon.

We're not sure if those are air strikes or rockets. It's certainly an escalation from the usual artillery fire. That thump of artillery fire that we hear. On the other side of the building, there were trace of fire fired up into the air earlier. We're not sure if that was just a jumpy Ukrainian soldier here. And I say jumpy because this city has been on edge. People have been warning the city that it is going to come under an offensive soon. And so everyone is just waiting, bracing for the inevitable which they fear is coming. And we see in the images from around the rest of this country and we know it's heading this way. We know that Putin wants the capital, Kyiv, and we know he's moved his troops into place both in the northwest and in the east. The convoy you talked about, which many people used as an example of Russian logistical problems and supply issues. Finally, yesterday, as per satellite images showed that it had disbanded. Some of them moved up to the north. But other pieces, artillery and howitzers have moved into the tree line are believed to be facing the city. There are battles going on in some of the outskirts. Some street to street. Brave Russian -- rather Ukrainian soldiers, holding back the Russians. Mainly with these Javelins, which have been so -- so successful in keeping back the Russians. And so, here we are today, waiting, again, another night to see whether this is the night that Putin's forces decide to attack.

The missiles you see fired now, Ukrainians firing at Russian warships in the Black Sea and again, has been fearing an amphibious assault on Odessa that would give Russia control of the coastline. So, there's a lot happening in this country. But a lot of the focus right now here in the capital Kyiv and the sense that any day now, if not any hour, that attack is going to happen. It doesn't seem as if the Russians have been able to surround the city totally. They have been trying for some time now to calm down both the east and the west and cut off the south. They've been unable to. So, the fear is now they're just going to start firing their longer-range artillery, their rockets into the city, softening this target, cutting off the will of the people before they then send in their troops. When they do send in their troops, it's going to be difficult. The city is like a fortress. That's what the mayor said earlier.

And you know, then you've got Zelenskyy saying we've reached a strategic point, if anything, that taking Kyiv is what Putin is looking to do. And he is surrounding the city. And it seems like it's not going to be impossible for him to do that in the next 24 hours. Next 24 or 48 hours. I'm not a military expert. I don't know. But what I do know is that the Russians have been delaying and delaying because they've had food problems and they've had all kinds of fuel problems, weapon problems, but so has -- so has Zelenskyy. In the end, I don't know where it goes. Let's assume that they take Kyiv. Then what happens? They're not going to stay there. They're not going to occupy. What do they want to do? They want to put their own leader there and then take off and then we're going to be left with an insurgency and it's going to be like Afghanistan all over again. But there's one thing I want to bring up. There's article 42 of the U.N. powers to do a collective military intervention. No one has talked about that. And I think it's probably too early. But the U.N. does have powers beyond what we're talking about with NATO. They would kick Russia off the security council there and do their own intervention. But who knows where the red line is? Up to this point, Putin is deciding where the red line is, and we're just cowering in the back."

To your point, Judge, what's the long-term victory? Is it to occupy a radicalized population in Ukraine over the long term? That would take enormous Russian resources. Is it to put in a puppet government? Which by the way, wouldn't just include a president? Ministers at every level. Local police department. He had to put in a puppet at every level of the government. Which again, I don't think he has the capability of doing. He may get some short-term victories.

I think in the long term, you -- you host nuclear weapons, you build nuclear weapons. You build a huge army. You build a huge armed services to protect your people. The people of Russia ultimately will be let back into the world community once they retire Putin. Once they decide that they, too, want to respect decency and humanity. Now, we can have disagreements politically. And we will. We have in our own country and we have it with other countries. The question becomes, when you violate those very basic rules, which he is and continues to, an amazing thing happens, you run into the resistance of people, you run into the will of a people who are not going to consent to a dictator. I think China is watching this. The Chinese people to the extent that they're able to watch this.

I don't understand that logic, especially when it's described to me as, look, they wouldn't that effective anyway in helping the Ukrainians. If it's not that effective, why would it provoke Vladimir Putin? But now to weakness, I do agree with Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton. I think there's a very, very thin needle here that must be thread. I do respect the potential, as we all should, of nuclear escalation. But, there's something more than something to be said for the way the President Trump handled his business with unpredictability, leaving your enemy wondering how you might react. It's clear this administration projects predictability, irrationality and weakness. If we do this, we're worried you may do that.

We should be united on this. And Putin sees that. He sees NATO is split. He sees political splits here. And that wasn't good. We shouldn't have this conversation out in the open like that. We were fine with the Pols transferring the jets. That was fine. We just didn't want to bring them off our air base in Germany and the Germans didn't want it coming off of the German air base. That was an escalation in our opinion, and that's because we haven't been giving them jets to begin with. We've already been loading them up with Javelins. And Javelins cost $80,000. And old MiG these are like 4.5 million. So, in our estimation that was a huge escalation. So, the question is, if you give them the MiGs and Russia escalation, we have to then escalate. Then you're on the escalator. That's the concern from the west, because right now, we're safe. Things are fine, this is a one-on-one. We don't need to make it a five-on-one. It's like when your buddy's buddy gets into a fight. It's not your buddy, but it's your buddy's buddy. So, if four buddy jumps in, then you have to jump in.

And more importantly, in his in his short-term vision, what Democrats have to do to avoid losing majorities in the House and the Senate. It's a long way away still, and we'll see. But Democrats have to be brutally honest. 57 percent disapproval rating for the president translates into a lot of losses in November in congressional seats and Senate seats. You got to get that number back 50-50. And you got to figure out what's most on people's minds crime, the border inflation. He manages us out of this Ukraine thing in a meaningful way, much like George HW Bush got a huge bounce when he ejected Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. This President standing up to Vladimir Putin on behalf of NATO in the West, it will help them as well. But you have to address the domestic issue. George HW Bush lost, you know why? Because he neglected economic issues. You focus on the economy, and you're honest with the American people, what you've done, what you've done right, what you've done wrong, and what you can do to correct it.

It's protection for nations that currently rely on Russia for natural gas and oil, and it starves Vladimir Putin and this war on Ukraine, but they won't do it, number one. Biden incorporate his problem since his beginning of his time in office, is that he believes that the electorate and voters are stupid, and he's talked to them like that all along. We're just a bunch of hayseeds and hicks and rubes and deplorables and rednecks. And if you -- particularly if you disagree with them and question them on their recklessness, like their attack on fossil fuels from day one, then they really dismiss you. And that is their biggest problem. I can tell you that if somebody walked up to my father at the Food Lion and said to him, you pay -- how much were your groceries. Payments problem. Or how much should you pay for gas? Putin's problem. My father would glare at them and say, did somebody hit you in the head? And then he would walk out into the parking lot and he would saw the sideview mirrors off that Tesla with the hatchet in the back of his pickup truck.

And he's asking for protective custody is if, you know, I'm so special, they're going to kill me. And I'm not suicidal. I mean, if somebody acted out like that in my courtroom, I would make sure they got -- they're set back down and kept quiet. Until they were quiet, they'd have to stay in the courtroom. They would not leave my courtroom like that. But that is indicative of everything he did throughout this case. He is arrogant, he is condescending, he is everything that the judge said he was.

Why didn't you try them and charge them with a crime. They didn't lie to the police. Jussie. You lied to the police. You created it. You wrote it. You force law enforcement to spend $120,000 and over time. This is a guy who was upset because he couldn't get more of an audience in the courtroom, even during COVID, and he wanted -- you know, he wanted his brother -- his brother has given the judge a lecture on racism in America at the sentencing.

Because what he did in terms of this particular crime perpetuating a hate crime is the max. I can't think of someone who would have committed this crime in a more heinous and inflammatory fashion. What Jussie Smollett did is dupe a nation, but put a nation on the razor's edge of a race war. This is race relations set on fire. And it doesn't stop there. He was perfectly fine, I guess, with the police randomly rounding up some white dudes and throwing them in jail for his fake crime. Meaning he would have sacrificed the lives of a couple of individuals as part of this theater, as part of this entire hoax. That is not just, as the judge said, profoundly narcissistic, selfish, and arrogant, that is sociopathic. This is criminal behavior, criminal mindset. I hear what you're saying. He is a broken man.

But to Will's point, he would -- what if he incited a riot. And he took up the time of the police officers in Chicago where murder is rampant. He has to pay restitution for $120,000 for the overtime spent by Chicago police officers. Not only could he have triggered race riots, but what did -- what did this do to the people and the victims and the families who are truly suffering who deserve those police officers on the beat investigating those crimes? I'll just add one more thing, I just think people are shocked that he got any jail time because around here we see people -- you know, criminals punching people in the face and send them to the emergency room and they don't even get held on bail. They don't go to jail. They don't get prosecuted. But if this is a racial issue, I'll note that Lori Loughlin spent two months in prison for that college admissions scandal, two months.

So, he's soft on this, the whole government has been soft on this for decades. No one has really woken up to it this -- about couple years ago. Trump woke up to it. But if someone had died in Ukraine, an American, president would have been out talking about it out in the Rose Garden. But this happens in this country. You know what? He'll never say anything. And that's the problem. You know, you pay all this -- all these taxes to these politicians to protect the border, to protect our streets, to protect our children.
