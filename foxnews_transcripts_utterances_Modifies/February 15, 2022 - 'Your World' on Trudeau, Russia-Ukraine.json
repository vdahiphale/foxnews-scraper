He spoke to the American people about how there would be pain at home if Russia invades Ukraine. It could affect energy prices. He also addressed the Russian people directly. And he made very clear that NATO is not threatening the Russian people. NATO is not planning to place missiles on Ukrainian territory. But he said that the NATO alliance is strong, united and would stand firm. He also warned Vladimir Putin, while leaving the door open to diplomacy, that any movement into a NATO Article 5 country would be met with force. He also sent another message, a very important message, because we have been hearing so much about the potential for cyberattacks, if those cyberattacks were to target any Western infrastructure, any American critical infrastructure, target anything here in the United States, that the U.S. would respond forcefully. This was a very strong speech. It was the first time that we'd heard that there are now 150,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's border. The president was very clear that, despite the messaging from Moscow that some of those troops had been returning to barracks, that they have seen no evidence of that and that those Russian troops remain in a threatening position tonight -- Sandra.",

And we do have the ability to see whether any Russian troops have been pulled back or are moving back to barracks. And that has not happened, based on my reporting, speaking to U.S. officials today. And you also heard that from the president just moments ago, that those troops, there's no evidence that they have been pulled back at this point. President Biden very clearly wanting to leave open the door to diplomacy, but also not wanting to give any indication that we are in the clear, and that diplomacy is now under way, and that Russia poses no threat to Ukraine. In fact, officials that we have spoken to today say that this is very much part of the Russian playbook in the past, to be suggesting to talk, while, in fact, an invasion has already begun. So this is not -- they're not taking any sort of statements coming out of the Defense Ministry in Russia at their word. They are waiting and seeing. And they have eyes in the sky above Ukraine. And they can see that there are now 150,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's border, in addition to very threatening missile systems and aerial bombardment artillery. None of that has been pulled back at this point, Sandra.",

Now the read from FOX News senior strategic analyst and former vice chief of staff for the Army, General Jack Keane joining us now. General Keane, what also struck me listening to the president just now is how he chose to, at one point, speak directly to the Russian people, telling them that U.S. and NATO pose no threat to their country and do not view them as our enemy, even saying -- quote -- \"I do not believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine, a country and people with whom you share such deep ties of family history and culture.\" Why was it important for the president just now to directly address the Russian people?",

And the idea that their military is going to start killing Ukrainian people, I think, is pretty abhorrent to many Russians. And there's certainly no justification for it. I applaud the president for dealing directly with that issue. The other thing is, I thought, his tone here and his firmness and forcefulness was just about right, and better than what we have seen before. Certainly, he's left the door open that there is possibly a pathway to a diplomatic solution about that. He's not Pollyannish about it at all. He knows full well we have been dealing with this for weeks and months, and we have had a lot of false starts diplomatically here. And he knows full well also, based on the report he rendered, there is now 150,000 troops there. There's 500 combat aircraft. There's 40 ships alone in the Black Sea, and significant amount of ground combat troops that are massed there, and, certainly, that invasion option is very real. And he knows full well how intimidating that is to the Ukrainian people, and what could happen as a result of an invasion like that. Putin has plenty of options left. I do think he's trying to get -- find a pathway and get some major concessions. This is sort of the 11th hour, so to speak, where it's more likely you're going to get concessions. I believe that has been a goal for his all along. And he's playing that certainly here.",

      "sentences": "You know, I don't know that. And I have been concerned about this all along, because the president, that's the first time he's been that specific about what he would do with economic sanctions. And I know there's been disagreement with our NATO and European allies as to whether to -- as to whether we should take them out of the international telecommunication system or not. And there's opposition to it. But I do know this, that the United States acting unilaterally, based on what the Treasury Department can do and what the State Department can do, we can truly hammer Putin, regardless of what the Europeans are saying, in terms of their central banks, cutting off foreign investments. Their whole system rides on participating in the dollar-driven financial system. We can impact them significantly. The fact that we're going to go after different sectors of his economy, that is a very good thing. There's no doubt we can hurt him. But I don't think the sanctions, in and of themselves, will ever be an impediment to Putin. He's dealt with sanctions in the past. He knows there's division in the European Union and also in NATO about how to administer them. And he knows this, that, after some pressure is put on, as sanctions are being executed, enforcing sanctions over time takes a lot of commitment and discipline. He knows that the Biden administration, when they came in, began not to enforce the Trump sanctions on Iran. And that is the world we're dealing with today. So Putin understands all of that. What you say you're going to do, and how you wind up six months from now may be a different matter entirely, because the evidence is in that. Listen, we missed the opportunity, as we have said before, the idea of trying to deter Putin based on things that we would do after the invasion, as opposed to doing these things starting back in March, when he put the 70,000 to 90,000 troops on the border of Ukraine, and began to hammer him as a result of that provocation. He has no right to put 90,000 troops on the border of a country and intimidate and coerce the people of that sovereign state, without some accountability. And we were wrong not to have that accountability then. We'd be in a much better position now if we had done that. But the good news coming out of this, I believe, is that there is a possibility of a diplomatic path going forward. He is certainly not going to interfere with his buddy President Xi's Closing Ceremony on Friday. And we may get to a point where we can get some kind of agreement. I think we got to be -- take a healthy dose of skepticism here, Sandra.",

But at least now, it seems, he understands what's at stake here and is taking what I hope are the right steps that would deter bad behavior by the Russians. But a lot of it has to do with the pipeline. A lot of it has to do with Nord Stream 2 and the energy issues that would impact Russia's economy if they went in. And so he is saying the right things at the moment. And let's hope it will have the desired effect. I think the Russians initially, at least, saw an opportunity, particularly after what happened Afghanistan, to really test the president, perceived him as somebody who wouldn't be up to taking on this task.

President Biden was very clear to Americans that if Vladimir Putin gives the order and his forces invade Ukraine, there will be pain here in the U.S. in terms of energy prices, there will be pain in Europe, but that we stand firm in terms of the principles at stake. A country cannot violate the sovereignty of another country and invade without NATO and the U.S. leading NATO to stand up to that country. And there will be issues in terms of disruption to the energy markets. That's something that Putin has factored in. Remember, Vladimir Putin has about $630 billion in his coffers because of the high price of oil. That is how he's been stocking away those reserves. And he knows that, I think, when he met with the German chancellor today, he might have expected to hear a weaker message or thought that he could peel the German chancellor away from NATO. But I have spoken to German officials after that meeting. And the initial reports -- there were some misleading reports on Twitter suggesting that the German chancellor had suggested that he had agreed that Ukraine would never be a part of NATO. And I'm told that that is absolutely not true and not the message that Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, delivered to Vladimir Putin. So I think Putin is testing NATO. They're -- he's testing each one of these leaders who come to Moscow. He's testing to see if there's any breaking point. And, right now, NATO is holding strong. But what President Biden warned is that there could be disruption to energy markets, and that we will be prepared for that, and that the U.S. government is prepared for how to counteract that. That's why they are cutting deals for LNG, gas that can be put into reserves inside Europe, so that -- to sort of counteract if, in fact, Putin goes in and there's disruption to the gas markets.",

It says this will authorize banks to freeze and suspend any account that's suspected of supporting those blockades, prohibits unlawful public assembly and gives federal police more powers to ticket, tow and also arrests. Now, the government tells us this is a targeted effort aimed here at the capital city in Ottawa and also at those blockades near the border entries connecting United States with Canada. It's focused also, the government says, on finding groups that they believe are mixed in and are prepared to use violence to overthrow the Canadian government, like this group that was arrested in Coutts in Alberta. Take a look there. You can see those are the guns that were seized at that Coutts blockade just in the past few days, 13 people arrested after they found weapons and even a machete inside of that trailer. Listen.",

They could have arrested Martin Luther King I mean, I think that the office needs to dial down, not just in its rhetoric, but at the means that it is using. By freezing this money, what the government is doing is preventing other people from supporting a protest.

What you're looking at here is the father, who was unresponsive under the water. Agent jumped in, pulled him to the shoreline. And you can see they performed CPR on him in an effort to save his life. Very happy to report that all three of those family members survived, mom, dad and 5-year-old girl all alive thanks to the efforts of those Border Patrol agents. Elsewhere along the border, take a look at this photo out of Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector, where a single large group of 112 migrants was encountered all from Central America, 70 unaccompanied kids mixed in with that group. Then, also out of Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector, a big fentanyl bust, border agents there arresting a Mexican national who was smuggling these fentanyl pills under his clothes while he was writing public transit, a shuttle to the Tucson area, those pills worth $85,000 on the street. DEA Phoenix now handling that case. And, lastly, if we can pull up this mug shot here, border agents also arresting a convicted child rapist who crossed illegally into Arizona.

He spoke to the American people about how there would be pain at home if Russia invades Ukraine. It could affect energy prices. He also addressed the Russian people directly. And he made very clear that NATO is not threatening the Russian people. NATO is not planning to place missiles on Ukrainian territory. But he said that the NATO alliance is strong, united and would stand firm. He also warned Vladimir Putin, while leaving the door open to diplomacy, that any movement into a NATO Article 5 country would be met with force. He also sent another message, a very important message, because we have been hearing so much about the potential for cyberattacks, if those cyberattacks were to target any Western infrastructure, any American critical infrastructure, target anything here in the United States, that the U.S. would respond forcefully. This was a very strong speech. It was the first time that we'd heard that there are now 150,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's border. The president was very clear that, despite the messaging from Moscow that some of those troops had been returning to barracks, that they have seen no evidence of that and that those Russian troops remain in a threatening position tonight -- Sandra."

And we do have the ability to see whether any Russian troops have been pulled back or are moving back to barracks. And that has not happened, based on my reporting, speaking to U.S. officials today. And you also heard that from the president just moments ago, that those troops, there's no evidence that they have been pulled back at this point. President Biden very clearly wanting to leave open the door to diplomacy, but also not wanting to give any indication that we are in the clear, and that diplomacy is now under way, and that Russia poses no threat to Ukraine. In fact, officials that we have spoken to today say that this is very much part of the Russian playbook in the past, to be suggesting to talk, while, in fact, an invasion has already begun. So this is not -- they're not taking any sort of statements coming out of the Defense Ministry in Russia at their word. They are waiting and seeing. And they have eyes in the sky above Ukraine. And they can see that there are now 150,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's border, in addition to very threatening missile systems and aerial bombardment artillery.

And the idea that their military is going to start killing Ukrainian people, I think, is pretty abhorrent to many Russians. And there's certainly no justification for it. I applaud the president for dealing directly with that issue. The other thing is, I thought, his tone here and his firmness and forcefulness was just about right, and better than what we have seen before. Certainly, he's left the door open that there is possibly a pathway to a diplomatic solution about that. He's not Pollyannish about it at all. He knows full well we have been dealing with this for weeks and months, and we have had a lot of false starts diplomatically here. And he knows full well also, based on the report he rendered, there is now 150,000 troops there. There's 500 combat aircraft. There's 40 ships alone in the Black Sea, and significant amount of ground combat troops that are massed there, and, certainly, that invasion option is very real. And he knows full well how intimidating that is to the Ukrainian people, and what could happen as a result of an invasion like that. Putin has plenty of options left. I do think he's trying to get -- find a pathway and get some major concessions. This is sort of the 11th hour, so to speak, where it's more likely you're going to get concessions.

      "utterance": "You know, I don't know that. And I have been concerned about this all along, because the president, that's the first time he's been that specific about what he would do with economic sanctions. And I know there's been disagreement with our NATO and European allies as to whether to -- as to whether we should take them out of the international telecommunication system or not. And there's opposition to it. But I do know this, that the United States acting unilaterally, based on what the Treasury Department can do and what the State Department can do, we can truly hammer Putin, regardless of what the Europeans are saying, in terms of their central banks, cutting off foreign investments. Their whole system rides on participating in the dollar-driven financial system. We can impact them significantly. The fact that we're going to go after different sectors of his economy, that is a very good thing. There's no doubt we can hurt him. But I don't think the sanctions, in and of themselves, will ever be an impediment to Putin. He's dealt with sanctions in the past. He knows there's division in the European Union and also in NATO about how to administer them. And he knows this, that, after some pressure is put on, as sanctions are being executed, enforcing sanctions over time takes a lot of commitment and discipline. He knows that the Biden administration, when they came in, began not to enforce the Trump sanctions on Iran. And that is the world we're dealing with today. So Putin understands all of that. What you say you're going to do, and how you wind up six months from now may be a different matter entirely, because the evidence is in that. Listen, we missed the opportunity, as we have said before, the idea of trying to deter Putin based on things that we would do after the invasion, as opposed to doing these things starting back in March, when he put the 70,000 to 90,000 troops on the border of Ukraine, and began to hammer him as a result of that provocation. He has no right to put 90,000 troops on the border of a country and intimidate and coerce the people of that sovereign state, without some accountability. And we were wrong not to have that accountability then. We'd be in a much better position now if we had done that. But the good news coming out of this, I believe, is that there is a possibility of a diplomatic path going forward. He is certainly not going to interfere with his buddy President Xi's Closing Ceremony on Friday. And we may get to a point where we can get some kind of agreement. I think we got to be -- take a healthy dose of skepticism here, Sandra."

But I think that the fact that we are projecting a united front when it comes to NATO, that lethal aid continues to be delivered there is providing the context, at least, for Putin to reconsider and rethink this.

The statements about Nord Stream 2 were statements he could have made when they lifted the sanctions in the first place on the pipeline. And we had a vote on that here in the Senate a few weeks ago, where Senate Democrats could have joined Senate Republicans in putting sanctions on the Putin pipeline. That vote failed. But at least now, it seems, he understands what's at stake here and is taking what I hope are the right steps that would deter bad behavior by the Russians. But a lot of it has to do with the pipeline. A lot of it has to do with Nord Stream 2 and the energy issues that would impact Russia's economy if they went in. And so he is saying the right things at the moment. And let's hope it will have the desired effect. I think the Russians initially, at least, saw an opportunity, particularly after what happened Afghanistan, to really test the president, perceived him as somebody who wouldn't be up to taking on this task. But, again, it's in our country's best interests, it's in the region's best interests and, frankly, for that matter in the world's best interests if this de-escalates and a -- the path forward can be found that would actually avoid a Russian invasion."

The one area that they haven't -- they haven't done that yet on is toddlers. And so we have literally Head Start schools, 1,600 of them around the country. The president is proposing a regulation that would require toddlers under the age of 5 to wear masks. And so I got a piece of legislation that would prevent that from going into effect.

Jennifer Griffin joining us now from the Pentagon. You tell me what you heard there. A big chunk of it initially was about bringing down gas prices. And Jen Psaki said all options are on the table. She was asked about a gas tax holiday. Nothing to predict for you at this point. It's just interesting, Jen, because we know that energy is at the very center of the conflict that we are seeing on the Russia-Ukraine border. And, as a result, we're seeing a rise in energy prices globally. But you tell me, what was your takeaway from what we just heard?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it really was a follow-on to what we heard from President Biden. President Biden was very clear to Americans that if Vladimir Putin gives the order and his forces invade Ukraine, there will be pain here in the U.S. in terms of energy prices, there will be pain in Europe, but that we stand firm in terms of the principles at stake. A country cannot violate the sovereignty of another country and invade without NATO and the U.S. leading NATO to stand up to that country. And there will be issues in terms of disruption to the energy markets. That's something that Putin has factored in. Remember, Vladimir Putin has about $630 billion in his coffers because of the high price of oil. That is how he's been stocking away those reserves. And he knows that, I think, when he met with the German chancellor today, he might have expected to hear a weaker message or thought that he could peel the German chancellor away from NATO. But I have spoken to German officials after that meeting. And the initial reports -- there were some misleading reports on Twitter suggesting that the German chancellor had suggested that he had agreed that Ukraine would never be a part of NATO. And I'm told that that is absolutely not true and not the message that Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, delivered to Vladimir Putin. So I think Putin is testing NATO. They're -- he's testing each one of these leaders who come to Moscow. He's testing to see if there's any breaking point. And, right now, NATO is holding strong. But what President Biden warned is that there could be disruption to energy markets, and that we will be prepared for that, and that the U.S. government is prepared for how to counteract that. That's why they are cutting deals for LNG, gas that can be put into reserves inside Europe, so that -- to sort of counteract if, in fact, Putin goes in and there's disruption to the gas markets."

It says this will authorize banks to freeze and suspend any account that's suspected of supporting those blockades, prohibits unlawful public assembly and gives federal police more powers to ticket, tow and also arrests. Now, the government tells us this is a targeted effort aimed here at the capital city in Ottawa and also at those blockades near the border entries connecting United States with Canada. It's focused also, the government says, on finding groups that they believe are mixed in and are prepared to use violence to overthrow the Canadian government, like this group that was arrested in Coutts in Alberta.

That is a standard tactic of groups going back to the civil rights movement and even earlier to block bridges and streets, to do what was referred to as -- quote -- \"good trouble.\" And so the troubling aspect of what is coming out of the prime minister's office is that, by this rationale, they could have cracked down on the civil rights movement. They could have arrested Martin Luther King I mean, I think that the office needs to dial down, not just in its rhetoric, but at the means that it is using. By freezing this money, what the government is doing is preventing other people from supporting a protest. These are Canadian citizens who have gone to their capital to engage in acts of civil disobedience. The government can clear the roads. They can arrest people who are blocking the roads. But they have gone to an extent here that treats these protesters as if they were terrorists."

This is a prime minister who supported BLM protests. The BLM regularly takes over streets, blocks areas, even occupies areas. But you didn't have Prime Minister Trudeau declaring them to be terrorists or U.S. politicians for that purpose. I mean, it seems to me that these people feel marginalized and voiceless.

But I share something with these truckers, in the sense of a right of free speech and association. It troubles to me how they're being treated. And it's going to magnify their sense of marginalization. And that's when people get angry, and they get detached from the government. I think the Trudeau government has gone the wrong way in addressing these truckers and their cause. They can demonize them, but all they will do is marginalize them.

A mom, dad and little girl tried to swim a cross. They went under the water. Agents jumped in, rescued the mom and daughter. What you're looking at here is the father, who was unresponsive under the water. Agent jumped in, pulled him to the shoreline. And you can see they performed CPR on him in an effort to save his life. Very happy to report that all three of those family members survived, mom, dad and 5-year-old girl all alive thanks to the efforts of those Border Patrol agents. Elsewhere along the border, take a look at this photo out of Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector, where a single large group of 112 migrants was encountered all from Central America, 70 unaccompanied kids mixed in with that group. Then, also out of Border Patrol's Tucson, Arizona, sector, a big fentanyl bust, border agents there arresting a Mexican national who was smuggling these fentanyl pills under his clothes while he was writing public transit, a shuttle to the Tucson area, those pills worth $85,000 on the street. DEA Phoenix now handling that case. And, lastly, if we can pull up this mug shot here, border agents also arresting a convicted child rapist who crossed illegally into Arizona.

Those things will only continue to get worse if the United States and partners start to put sanctions in place against Russia. We will see our inflation continue to worsen. We will see Russia retaliate. We will see them likely use cyber warfare against our financial institutions, against our infrastructure .The United States will then have to retaliate. And we will end up in this endless cycle of tit for tat that will hurt the American people in ways that are difficult to even estimate at this point.

Why doesn't he just say that and guarantee it and say, you know what, NATO and the United States are not going to make Ukraine the next military outpost, and, by doing so, alleviate this crisis and prevent the American people and people in other parts of the world from facing the suffering that will come about from this continued escalation?"
