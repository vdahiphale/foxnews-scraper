They're somehow, to her, anti-democratic because they believe illegal immigrants should vote and they think the biggest threats facing America look like this guy, the Coors Light Trespasser who took selfies in the Capitol on January 6. You see that guy? Yes, Kamala. That guy and others like him, they're going to throw us into a totalitarian abyss, so pathetic. Now, the reason Democrats are so rabid about the so called Freedom to Vote Act that got invoked a law today is that in practical terms it would be a Democrat incumbent protection racket. Among other things, it would bypass state authority by nationalizing rules for voter registration and mail-in ballots. That means bye, bye meaningful election security laws. Of course, liberals don't get lots of help from media elites to sell their myths about the dark cloud, anti-democracy cloud hanging over the GOP. People like former conservatives, David Brooks, who are kind of stuck in an early 2000s time warp help market the Trump as authoritarian myth writing Trumpian authoritarianism does doesn't renounce holy war. It embraces holy war, assumes it is permanent. In fact, it seeks to make it so. In the Trumpian world, disputes are settled by raw power and intimidation. Holy War, has David never heard of Dick Cheney? Does he really not know how often the Bush family relied on raw power and intimidation to get its way? But, Brooks goes on. As long as the warrior ethos dominates the GOP, brutality be - will be admired over benevolence, propaganda over discourse, confrontation over conservatism, dehumanization over dignity. Two words David, Abu Ghraib. Now, who was president when that was going on? And, who was the vice president? No, hint it wasn't Donald Trump or Mike Pence. The establishment that we've known for decades is steadily losing power and being replaced by smarter, better people. I like to think of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State versus Antony Blinken. Enough said. Now, not only is the GOP getting smarter, its reach is broadening and now appealing to minorities once thought safely in the Democrat camp, at least they were under previous years. In 2020, Trump put together the most diverse GOP coalition in 60 years. How is that authoritarian? Hispanic voters in Texas, Florida, are flocking to the Republican banner. Republicans also made huge inroads with suburban women in Virginia who were concerned about what their kids are being taught in school and then vilified for it. Now, the fact is Republicans, not Democrats, have become more democratic. Think about it this way. Since 1988, the GOP was essentially run by one family, the Bushes. Now, if you're on their good side, all was well, but if you question them, oh, my goodness, if you dared to criticize them, you were shunned. But, it's not a democracy when your party is controlled by big donors that are one small clique or family. For years, the conservative grassroots, they were demanding real change and things like foreign policy, border policy, trade policy, but they were summarily ignored until Trump came along. Now, David Brooks and others like him, they want to return to the old days when the GOP voters lost gracefully and lost regularly by following naive globalist dreamers. GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We see a China that is becoming one of the most dynamic and creative societies in the world.

And by administering endless doses, somehow, it seems like health professionals think this is going to suddenly become effective. There is so much data showing now that these vaccines can never ever achieve the goal of herd immunity. These are - first of all, what I want to point out is we have to keep in mind the very definition of vaccines was altered to allow that term to be applied to these current inoculations that were given to people. The duration of immunity is far too short. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been effectively developing new variants that can readily evade this immunity. The new Omicron variant has so many mutations in the spike protein. It's going to be able to even more effectively evade vaccine induced immunity than the Delta variant did. And, the combination of all of these things, combined with of course the fact that there is although people try and hide it as much as possible, it's becoming impossible to hide the harms that these vaccines are causing. And, there is no question now that the cost benefit analysis makes no sense. People who are \"fully vaccinated\", which is the two doses at the moment, they can still get infected. They can still get COVID. They can still get disease. They can still die from COVID. And, they transmit the virus and at least equal proportion to equal quantities--",

A decade ago in Tyler, Texas, a small town, two white police officers were found guilty of murdering a black inmate by an all-white jury. So thank God that our court system has not surrendered to wokeness, so that is one blessing. But Jussie Smollett I think committed moral treason by exploiting the rich legacy of the civil rights movement, using it to advance his career. And that has dire consequences for police resources that have been employed to investigate that. These are resources that could have been spent trying to reduce the murder rate that is an all-time high in Chicago's dangerous killing fields.

They are in danger of returning us to the pre civil rights south. I lived in Mississippi in the 50s, in the military, and I can tell you what it was like. If a black killed another black, often they were not arrested. And we said this demeaned black life, and what we demanded was equal justice for the law.

So some things you haven't even heard about our this DOJ prosecuting four- year-old alleged donor violations of Trump owners right before the statute of limitations runs out, which has not been done in prior administrations. You have subpoenas going out from the House to members of the Republican National Committee seeking their personal and private communications, having really having nothing to do with being at the capitol, just to harass them. You, of course, see the persecution of lawyers and advisors for the former president, and that is being now handled by the DOJ, unsealing charges again supporters like Steve Bannon and others. And at the same time, you have the same DOJ weaponizing against parents who are standing up for the rights of their children. And finally, you have the DOJ hunting journalists, like my client James O'Keefe, who happens to be a critic of this administration and is uncovering corruption.

Does any of that sound pro freedom to you? That's when Biden warns about democracy backsliding. He is preemptively excusing what will likely be a crushing loss for his party in the midterms and even in 2024.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Her argument is actually that law is requiring you to show an ID to vote or to clear dead people off the voting rolls, to verify signatures on mail-in ballots. They're somehow, to her, anti-democratic because they believe illegal immigrants should vote and they think the biggest threats facing America look like this guy, the Coors Light Trespasser who took selfies in the Capitol on January 6. You see that guy? Yes, Kamala. That guy and others like him, they're going to throw us into a totalitarian abyss, so pathetic. Now, the reason Democrats are so rabid about the so called Freedom to Vote Act that got invoked a law today is that in practical terms it would be a Democrat incumbent protection racket. Among other things, it would bypass state authority by nationalizing rules for voter registration and mail-in ballots. That means bye, bye meaningful election security laws. Of course, liberals don't get lots of help from media elites to sell their myths about the dark cloud, anti-democracy cloud hanging over the GOP. People like former conservatives, David Brooks, who are kind of stuck in an early 2000s time warp help market the Trump as authoritarian myth writing Trumpian authoritarianism does doesn't renounce holy war. It embraces holy war, assumes it is permanent. In fact, it seeks to make it so. In the Trumpian world, disputes are settled by raw power and intimidation. Holy War, has David never heard of Dick Cheney? Does he really not know how often the Bush family relied on raw power and intimidation to get its way? But, Brooks goes on. As long as the warrior ethos dominates the GOP, brutality be - will be admired over benevolence, propaganda over discourse, confrontation over conservatism, dehumanization over dignity. Two words David, Abu Ghraib. Now, who was president when that was going on? And, who was the vice president? No, hint it wasn't Donald Trump or Mike Pence. The establishment that we've known for decades is steadily losing power and being replaced by smarter, better people. I like to think of Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State versus Antony Blinken. Enough said. Now, not only is the GOP getting smarter, its reach is broadening and now appealing to minorities once thought safely in the Democrat camp, at least they were under previous years. In 2020, Trump put together the most diverse GOP coalition in 60 years. How is that authoritarian? Hispanic voters in Texas, Florida, are flocking to the Republican banner. Republicans also made huge inroads with suburban women in Virginia who were concerned about what their kids are being taught in school and then vilified for it. Now, the fact is Republicans, not Democrats, have become more democratic. Think about it this way. Since 1988, the GOP was essentially run by one family, the Bushes. Now, if you're on their good side, all was well, but if you question them, oh, my goodness, if you dared to criticize them, you were shunned. But, it's not a democracy when your party is controlled by big donors that are one small clique or family. For years, the conservative grassroots, they were demanding real change and things like foreign policy, border policy, trade policy, but they were summarily ignored until Trump came along. Now, David Brooks and others like him, they want to return to the old days when the GOP voters lost gracefully and lost regularly by following naive globalist dreamers. GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We see a China that is becoming one of the most dynamic and creative societies in the world. America welcomes the emergence of a strong and peaceful and prosperous China."

If you let us have power long enough, we will completely transform the country. Meanwhile, he is letting China walk all over him.

I mean, this is the narrative that they are preparing. And, I go back to their continuing assault on America. If you listen carefully, what you hear the Biden administration saying today and over and over again is America is systemically racist. It's systemically oppressive. It's systemically evil. It's just so terrible. And, the American people, they just are too dumb to understand how good we are for them. Well, it's quite the reverse. The American people are good people.

I mean, it's the same message everywhere you look from this administration, America is fundamentally flawed. Well, you know what, they're totally wrong about that. And, as it turns out, the American people don't like being told that they're a bunch of backwards idiots. Parents don't like being told that they're domestic terrorists, and the American people just aren't going to have it. They know who the real idiots are here.

And by administering endless doses, somehow, it seems like health professionals think this is going to suddenly become effective. There is so much data showing now that these vaccines can never ever achieve the goal of herd immunity. These are - first of all, what I want to point out is we have to keep in mind the very definition of vaccines was altered to allow that term to be applied to these current inoculations that were given to people. The duration of immunity is far too short. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been effectively developing new variants that can readily evade this immunity. The new Omicron variant has so many mutations in the spike protein. It's going to be able to even more effectively evade vaccine induced immunity than the Delta variant did. And, the combination of all of these things, combined with of course the fact that there is although people try and hide it as much as possible, it's becoming impossible to hide the harms that these vaccines are causing. And, there is no question now that the cost benefit analysis makes no sense. People who are \"fully vaccinated\", which is the two doses at the moment, they can still get infected. They can still get COVID. They can still get disease. They can still die from COVID. And, they transmit the virus and at least equal proportion to equal quantities--"

So, regular people are like, well, it sounds good to me, what do I getting the fourth shot?"

Now, if that's the case, then people can get vaccinated and they can reduce their risk if they perceive it to be doing such in getting the severe and potentially fatal disease. That doesn't mean that everybody else should be getting it. That is just - that's an individual benefit. In terms of the benefit to other people around them, the data is very clear, there is zero benefit to people around individuals who are double vaccinated. They are still shedding as much virus. So, it makes no sense to push the vaccine mandates from that context. And third - fourth doses are coming to America. There is no question. As scientists, we've been seeing this come for a long time. This is now all about the profit. It's clear and it has to be because it is not about the science. There is a mountain of science saying we should not be pushing these vaccines. We certainly should not be mandating them. And think about, every dose that gets added, is a gross amount of profit for these companies, and how the CEOs--"

And, time and again, The Ingraham Angle has proven to be ahead of the curve on COVID, and today, the New York Times reporting that the Coronavirus attacks fat tissue, scientists find. The research may help explain why people who are overweight and obese have been at higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID. My next guest pointed this out on our show in the first weeks of the pandemic. Joining me now is Dr. Steven Smith, Founder the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. Dr. Smith, what took them so long and did they really get it right at the New York Times?"

      "utterance": "Well, the first part is what took him so long, I don't know. I think the lesson to be learned here is, it's OK to say the emperor has no clothes. It never has no clothes. And, the establishment wouldn't accept the fact that obesity was a severe risk factor for severe COVID. I don't know why the data were just simply chart derived data that we had. And, I had cited several different leading journals. At least the editor of Jama said basically essentially he didn't believe me, to believe me. They're just chart data, just publish the data, I begged him. But, getting back to your prior guests view, I agree that we should be science and the science of risk factors, epidemiology to vaccinate those who are at risk for severe disease, not everybody. And obviously the waning immunity, this is a decent vaccine in the beginning but it wanes much quicker than any good vaccine we ever had. So, it makes it essential for us to focus on people at risk for severe reason, not everybody. And, I'm really -"

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I think that's - yes, that's probably the wrong - that's one of the main problems we all want to know how and why, how and why don't matter in medicine? What is it matters? Nice to see there is a beautiful study from Stanford in this preprint that they took adipose or fat tissue from surgical specimens, people that had bariatric or obesity surgery or cardiac surgery. And, they took these specimens and tested the ability of the virus to grow in fat cells, and it didn't. The macrophages within these fat tissues well, and that makes sense. But, making sense in physiology medicine don't matter. What really matters is what you see, what happens to the patient and that's where we've gone wrong. Medicine is a profession of observers and we stopped observing. We tried to fit a round pegs and square holes instead of saying, hey, just look at what we have and what does this mean and now how do we use this information going forward? We just didn't do that. We refused to--"

And with the help of Joe Biden and the entire mainstream press, actor Jussie Smollett attempted to use politics and race to rip the country apart. Tonight, he was justifiably found guilty for his insidious race hoax. Civil rights icon Bob Woodson is here to unpack this ruling and why is it so important."

It's important to remember that his outlandish accusations were aired uncritically for almost about two weeks. This was a narrative that, of course, confirmed the left's worst abuse about America - - attackers in MAGA, anti-gay slurs, a black man fighting for his life in a white supremacist country."

Joining me now is Bob Woodson, civil rights activist and founder of The Woodson Center. Bob, what is the big lesson going forward here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOB WOODSON, FOUNDER, THE WOODSON CENTER",
      "utterance": "Thanks for having me back, Laura. First of all, the lesson is that America, the judicial system is fair and just. Not only was this decision, but all people don't realize in the Rittenhouse decision that was made the same day that that decision was made, a young man by the name of Andrew Coffee, a black man who was on trial for shooting a police officer that entered his house in the middle of the night without announcing it, he was found innocent also, not guilty, which means that our judicial system is fair. A decade ago in Tyler, Texas, a small town, two white police officers were found guilty of murdering a black inmate by an all-white jury. So thank God that our court system has not surrendered to wokeness, so that is one blessing. But Jussie Smollett I think committed moral treason by exploiting the rich legacy of the civil rights movement, using it to advance his career. And that has dire consequences for police resources that have been employed to investigate that. These are resources that could have been spent trying to reduce the murder rate that is an all-time high in Chicago's dangerous killing fields. But Jussie Smollett and his enablers but his personal interests ahead of the well-being and health and welfare of thousands of blacks in those community. That is why I accused him of committing moral treason."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "He also, Bob, thought that playing the victim here, but the defiant victim in a racist society, that that, I think, was going to help him professionally. And sure enough, all these people, you saw the media folks, Hollywood, they all rallied to him. Even after his story started to fall apart, they still kind of didn't want to believe he lied about this. But he thought, and I think rightly so, it would help them, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOODSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Like I said, he put his selfish interests above the interests and well-being of thousands of blacks in these inner cities. Think about all the police resources that were used to investigate this hoax. These are resources that could've been deployed in these neighborhoods. Laura, more blacks are killed in one year by other blacks than were killed and lynched in 40 years of the Klan. And yet we are talking about Jussie Smollett exploiting that. They are in danger of returning us to the pre civil rights south. I lived in Mississippi in the 50s, in the military, and I can tell you what it was like. If a black killed another black, often they were not arrested. And we said this demeaned black life, and what we demanded was equal justice for the law. And I went to jail in the civil rights movement with others, and Dr. King and others, so that we would be treated fairly by our judicial and law enforcement system. And yet, we don't get upset when blacks kill other blacks. Black lives only matter when it is taken by a white person. And so --"

      "utterance": "Bob, your words tonight -- your words tonight -- I'm sorry to interrupt, we've got to roll, but your words tonight, they are giving me chills, because more people will need to hear this. Bob, thank you. Civil rights icon. Will Jussie Smollett be brought up on federal charges? Of course not. They are too busy investigating January 6th. Just yesterday, the DOJ unsealing charges against Thomas Conover of Texas. What was his crime? Entering the capitol with the Coors Light -- no. Entering the capitol while drinking a beer and saying I don't always storm the capital of the United States of America, but when I do, I prefer Coors Light. Joining me now is Harmeet Dhillon, managing partner of the Dhillon law group. Harmeet, it seems the DOJ right now is deliberately trying to, I think, intimidate conservatives, former Trump supporters, Trump supporters, from gathering together before this midterm election, because you might have an infiltrator in the crowd, who knows what could happen, and then your life is over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARMEET DHILLON, DHILLON LAW GROUP MANAGING PARTNER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, Laura. What's happening here is the DOJ has been weaponized and used again supporters of the prior president in a way that is really unprecedented in this country. It is the kind of thing you see in third world countries or places where they don't have a rule of law, and they put the political enemies in prison. So some things you haven't even heard about our this DOJ prosecuting four- year-old alleged donor violations of Trump owners right before the statute of limitations runs out, which has not been done in prior administrations. You have subpoenas going out from the House to members of the Republican National Committee seeking their personal and private communications, having really having nothing to do with being at the capitol, just to harass them. You, of course, see the persecution of lawyers and advisors for the former president, and that is being now handled by the DOJ, unsealing charges again supporters like Steve Bannon and others. And at the same time, you have the same DOJ weaponizing against parents who are standing up for the rights of their children. And finally, you have the DOJ hunting journalists, like my client James O'Keefe, who happens to be a critic of this administration and is uncovering corruption. So from our DOJ, which I think was far less active than it should have been under Trump for advancing American interests and civil rights in our courts, you have the exact opposite. And it's absolutely biased, out of control, and unfortunately, there seems to be almost no oversight happening in the House or the Senate on these very important issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It's infuriating, but Harmeet, one quick question before we go. Your thoughts on this. Earlier tonight the New York City Council, they passed a bill giving permanent residents, noncitizens, the right to vote in city elections. Is this just a sign of things to come?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. This has been happening, Laura, in different cities around the United States. We have it in San Francisco where even illegal alien parents can vote in school board elections. So to my surprise when I looked this up as a lawyer to see if I could file a lawsuit to challenge it, it is not illegal under federal law for this to happen, and it's a wave. You can expect to see it happening all over the place. And by the way, these city governments are not trivial. They give out a lot of benefits and a lot of contracts, and a lot more of those are going to go towards so-called immigrant causes. As an immigrant, I don't think that immigrants should be allowed unless they are United States citizens to vote at any level of our elections in this country."

Harmeet, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight. And crime in L.A., we know it's out of control, but D.A. George Gascon still insists his soft on crime agenda is actually working. A mother whose son was murdered and is leading a new effort to recall Gascon hits back in moments. Stay there."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Crime is totally out of control, but at a press conference yesterday, Gascon insisted things were just -- couldn't be better."

      "speaker": "GEORGE GASCON, (D) LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "How is that working out so far? After Gascon acted on his soft on crime agenda, crime is raging. Murders in a L.A. up nearly 47 percent from 2019. Shootings are up 56 percent. Carjackings up nearly 53 percent. So it's not too difficult to draw a line from his approach to crime to the lawlessness we are seeing today. But he is totally unfazed."

Just ask my next guest, Desiree Andrade, who had to watch Gascon's office, and it's of course trending towards leniency, as it did for her son's killer. Desiree, the last recall effort fell short, but do you think this renewed effort, given everything that has happened, will work? DESIREE ANDRADE, \"RECALL GEORGE GASCON\" ORGANIZER: Definitely. Laura, thank you for having me on, I appreciate it. I definitely feel that this time around we have this completely, we are well funded, we are better organized. And people are seeing firsthand the effects that George Gascon's policies are having on public safety right now. So I think that more people are going to get involved. And I feel that this time around, we have a better grasp of things. You have to understand, the first effort was really a grassroots effort. So now we have all the funds that we need to start this. We did raise $2.5 million before starting, so we are well prepared and ready to get this started and up and going."

But at the end of the day, this is much more than just my story. This is about many other victims out there that are living today without a loved one and hurting just as much as I am. So this fight, again, it's not only for my son. I'm doing what I can for every voiceless victim out there. I feel that this is what I need to do, this is what my calling is. I'm doing this for everyone. But yes, Laura, it hurts every single day, what I'm going through. And it doesn't help that George Gascon is revictimizing me just by his pro- criminal agenda and what he's done to my son's case. It's awful. It's awful.
