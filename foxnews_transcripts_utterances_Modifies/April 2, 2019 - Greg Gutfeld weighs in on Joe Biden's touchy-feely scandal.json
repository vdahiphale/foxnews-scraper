You can hold these two thoughts that Biden has acted strange at times. And yet, this is a calculated hit to get him out of the race by his own side.  After all, it's not just about touching women but being an old white man, which basically for the left makes you worse than a war criminal. But also, how can Biden's people not see this coming? The proof are like Biden's hands all over the place, as Nancy Pelosi puts it.",

Even if Biden is guilty of just clumsy affection, the accusers must be heard and believed no matter how long ago it happened, because Biden's own party demands it. Due process, if you remember, was sexist. They made that clear just months ago and hearing over some guy named Brett.  So it's no coincidence the complaints are coming forward now. When Biden wasn't in the way and no one cared, friendly, goofy Joe. Now the old sports just hanging around so he's got to go, because when you're no longer wanted by those who want power for themselves, they'll be more than happy to put their arms around your shoulders, smiled, and then walk you into traffic.   All right, Juan, I have a theory. This is my defense of Joe Biden. And I don't think anybody said this but my theory is the guy has been through hell, lost his wife, lost a daughter in -- very young, car accident, lost his son, could the affection that he shows be a vow to show appreciation to the living because you never know when they'll be there -- if they'll be there tomorrow?

But I can tell you -- I mean, what you're hearing from Pelosi and others is true. He is a very much a touchy-feely, empathetic guy with guys and with women.  I mean, Senator Coons of Delaware who, you know, his successor in the senate said, you know, there were questions about how Joe had whispered into his 13-year-old daughter's ear. He said, you know, the little girl said that Joe was telling her she's handling the moment well. He was trying to pump her up.  But again, if you're a critic, and yesterday on the show, there are people who are saying we know this is an opposition dump on Joe's head from Democrats who are trying to get him out, you know, kind of preempt him before he gets in the race. But my take, especially after listening to your monologue is, I think Republicans are still upset about Kavanaugh, are still upset about questions about President Trump who said he was going to grab women in their private, and think, well, according to the Wall Street Journal, oh, you've got to make excuses and apologies from being a pale male these days. Again, so they say identity politics. I think this is so interesting to watch because this is going to go on all through the Democratic primaries. If President Trump is going to be tweeting, we're going to be talking, and you've got all these Democrats up there throwing punches, haymakers at each other, and this may be one of them, Greg.",

But just some perspective here, he's a creepy guy that likes to nuzzle but he's not Bill Cosby. He crossed the line, he should apologize, that's fine. Let's move on. But the media had a huge hand in this. Let's just remember, the media created political correctness to use as a weapon against conservatives to silence them and to bully them. And now the Democrats are using political correctness against each other in the primary and the media is sitting around exasperated saying, hey, you're trying to take down the one guy that can win white working class voters away from Donald Trump. And the fact that conservatives have been joking about Biden for about ten years, the media never covered it because the media by trying to protect Joe Biden actually ends up hurting Joe Biden.  Because if the media covered this for the last ten years, Biden could have addressed it, it could have been digested, and we could have moved on. But they always try to cover Republican weaknesses and then cover up for Democrats. So the Democrat ends up getting out there and he's not in fighting shape, and he's rusty, and then he gets body slammed right before he announces.

And by the way, it wasn't a sexual assault or anything, it was just inappropriate touching and I'm just letting everybody know about it. But the left put themselves into this corner, into this box, and the question now is whether they're going to play by their own rules. I agree with Greg. Joe Biden has done some weird stuff.  You know the thing now is everyone is coming out and saying, well, my experience with him is not that. Alyssa Milano was one of them. So you should believe me when I say he's a good guy who respects survivors of sexual assault. But that was not the case when it came to Brett Kavanaugh, and they smeared his family. And when the truth came out about him which was 100-plus pages of a senate report showing not a single accusation against him had any evidence at all.

But here's the deal, New York can pass a bill that is extreme in terms of infanticide and not providing care for babies who survive abortions. Georgia voters want this to happen. The governor talked about being proud of the legislators who passed this bill through. And the people in Hollywood should just mind their own business.",

Due process, if you remember, was sexist. They made that clear just months ago and hearing over some guy named Brett. So it's no coincidence the complaints are coming forward now. When Biden wasn't in the way and no one cared, friendly, goofy Joe. Now the old sports just hanging around so he's got to go, because when you're no longer wanted by those who want power for themselves, they'll be more than happy to put their arms around your shoulders, smiled, and then walk you into traffic. All right, Juan, I have a theory. This is my defense of Joe Biden. And I don't think anybody said this but my theory is the guy has been through hell, lost his wife, lost a daughter in -- very young, car accident, lost his son, could the affection that he shows be a vow to show appreciation to the living because you never know when they'll be there -- if they'll be there tomorrow? That is my theory."

But I can tell you -- I mean, what you're hearing from Pelosi and others is true. He is a very much a touchy-feely, empathetic guy with guys and with women. I mean, Senator Coons of Delaware who, you know, his successor in the senate said, you know, there were questions about how Joe had whispered into his 13-year-old daughter's ear. He said, you know, the little girl said that Joe was telling her she's handling the moment well. He was trying to pump her up. But again, if you're a critic, and yesterday on the show, there are people who are saying we know this is an opposition dump on Joe's head from Democrats who are trying to get him out, you know, kind of preempt him before he gets in the race. But my take, especially after listening to your monologue is, I think Republicans are still upset about Kavanaugh, are still upset about questions about President Trump who said he was going to grab women in their private, and think, well, according to the Wall Street Journal, oh, you've got to make excuses and apologies from being a pale male these days. Again, so they say identity politics. I think this is so interesting to watch because this is going to go on all through the Democratic primaries. If President Trump is going to be tweeting, we're going to be talking, and you've got all these Democrats up there throwing punches, haymakers at each other, and this may be one of them, Greg."

But just some perspective here, he's a creepy guy that likes to nuzzle but he's not Bill Cosby. He crossed the line, he should apologize, that's fine. Let's move on. But the media had a huge hand in this. Let's just remember, the media created political correctness to use as a weapon against conservatives to silence them and to bully them. And now the Democrats are using political correctness against each other in the primary and the media is sitting around exasperated saying, hey, you're trying to take down the one guy that can win white working class voters away from Donald Trump. And the fact that conservatives have been joking about Biden for about ten years, the media never covered it because the media by trying to protect Joe Biden actually ends up hurting Joe Biden. Because if the media covered this for the last ten years, Biden could have addressed it, it could have been digested, and we could have moved on. But they always try to cover Republican weaknesses and then cover up for Democrats. So the Democrat ends up getting out there and he's not in fighting shape, and he's rusty, and then he gets body slammed right before he announces.

And by the way, it wasn't a sexual assault or anything, it was just inappropriate touching and I'm just letting everybody know about it. But the left put themselves into this corner, into this box, and the question now is whether they're going to play by their own rules. I agree with Greg. Joe Biden has done some weird stuff. You know the thing now is everyone is coming out and saying, well, my experience with him is not that. Alyssa Milano was one of them. So you should believe me when I say he's a good guy who respects survivors of sexual assault. But that was not the case when it came to Brett Kavanaugh, and they smeared his family. And when the truth came out about him which was 100-plus pages of a senate report showing not a single accusation against him had any evidence at all.

The legislation would ban abortions after a heart beat is detected, which is usually six weeks into a pregnancy. It would allow abortions in cases of rape or incest. The bill sparking outrage among many in Tinseltown, including Aleck Baldwin, Rosie O'Donnell, Lena Dunham, and Sean Penn. They've all sign Milano's letter vowing not to work in the state if the bill becomes law. Milano saying, quote, as actors our work often brings us to Georgia, we've always found your state to be populated with friendly, caring people. We've been glad to bring billions of dollars in revenue to support Georgia's schools, parks, and communities, but we can't, in good conscience, continue to recommend our industry remain in Georgia if HB 41 becomes law. Katie, what do you say?"

I don't think the people in Georgia really care about a bunch of people who live in California who are using Georgia to get away from high taxes and bad business practices, and therefore they're filming and doing movies in a different state. I find it funny that other governors from places like New Jersey where they also have bad tax laws are trying to out-court them based on abortion. But here's the deal, New York can pass a bill that is extreme in terms of infanticide and not providing care for babies who survive abortions. Georgia voters want this to happen. The governor talked about being proud of the legislators who passed this bill through. And the people in Hollywood should just mind their own business."

I watched Sean Penn movies. I listen to Beyonce. I don't care. The thing is, is that everything is tainted if you look at it through a political lens. You put gas in your car from Saudi Arabia.

And how little do you have to have in your life that you can -- that you have this take up your time, maybe work on your own problems rather than casting aspersions on others. This - OK, they actually could do a boycott that reflects real sacrifice. What political decision upset them most? The election of Donald Trump. Why not boycott America?

So, you'd lose about 1.5 percent GDP. That's a huge hit to the economy overall. It's a drastic step, but I think that the President realizes how drastic it is. But it's the leverage that he has right now, because Congress won't get together and do something to - like a comprehensive peace to do that. The thing I worry about is that taking that drastic step and not having a plan in place for like what do you do after that because maybe Mexico helps for a little while, but then they backslide. Are you going to shut it down again? And what - there has to be a way to have a plan and I was thinking today about - remember the surge in Iraq, it had to be - it's like totally different way to fight the war. And I feel like we're so stuck that there has to be a different way to approach this because we're having the same arguments for years. So is there - I don't know what it is, but I feel like somebody has to break through in a way. The President is talking about possibly appointing an immigration czar perhaps that will help."

Animal control officers in Billerica posted a picture of the unfortunate little smelly critter and they said it is amazing that his head could fit into such a small opening and noted that it gave a new term, new meaning to the term skunks beer ha-ha. Police say, the skunk was taken to Tufts Wildlife Clinic in North Grafton after being found Wednesday and the plan was to sedate the skunk. Yes, you have to do that for that."
