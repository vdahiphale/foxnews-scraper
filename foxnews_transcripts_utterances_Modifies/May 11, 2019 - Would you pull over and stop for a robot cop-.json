SRI International -- whoever they are -- has developed a police robot prototype to prevent dangerous interactions during traffic stops which is great. First, a robo- arm extends from the cop car to the car in front of it and spits out a spike strip behind the rear tires. It's great. While this happened, it comes with really neat music. Anyway, it's maybe a little slow, but it's just a prototype. Then an officer talks to the driver via a webcam without ever leaving the car."

So I guess this is just the evolution of where we're going. I think for traffic stops, it is probably a good idea. My only concern would be if the robot jams. You're going to be there for a minute.

That's a continent, Emily -- propelled entirely by the oceans current and eating nothing but the fish he caught himself.
