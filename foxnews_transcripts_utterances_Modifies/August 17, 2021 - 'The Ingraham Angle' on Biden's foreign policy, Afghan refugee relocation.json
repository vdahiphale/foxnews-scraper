The debate over how many Afghan refugees our country should absorb is one that certain folks don't want to have, but most Americans do. Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller is here on why it matters. Plus, restaurant owners are being driven out of business by New York City's vaccine mandate. And a nurse's job is in jeopardy because she refuses to get the jab. We will speak to both tonight. But first, the invisible president. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now we've about now 3500 troops redeployed in Afghanistan. As of tonight, hundreds of thousands of people are trying to get out. China is poised to exploit the situation. The U.S. border under siege with COVID-infected migrants. And we don't have an actual president in charge. Yesterday, Joe Biden darted back to DC from Camp David, read for about, what, 19 minutes, then took no questions and skedaddled off the podium. Oh, and then he went back to Camp David. Now, answers were supposed to be provided today by Biden's national security adviser, a young chap who looks like he's running for student council. But I sure as hell wouldn't vote for him after this performance.",

We've just suffered one of the most humiliating defeats in American history, a defeat made worse by their utter inability to predict anything with accuracy. And their response is that Biden isn't talking to anyone. Should Biden be talking to everyone and trying to assure them that he actually knows what he's doing? Even if the Biden team doesn't think he can do the job? Shouldn't they, at least, pretend that he can do it? They could have given him some flashcards, or something to read on the phone, anything. But no, we just had radio silence. The team of Blinken, Sullivan and Klein has plainly failed. The notion that they could run the country while Biden hid from public view has been proven false. On the Military front, General white rage Milley, Secretary CRT Austin should have already been terminated. They're being outmaneuvered everywhere in the world and it shows. Democrats and Republicans on the Hill should all be demanding that Biden clean House and bring in much better people to get the situation under control. We can't take these three much longer. We can't take three weeks of this, much less three more years of this. And that's the ANGLE. Tonight, as Biden and many leftists rush to blame Trump for old Joe's blunders, we're bringing you the inside story of what Trump had actually planned for Afghanistan.

And three and most importantly, that if any American interests was harmed, or any American personnel was harmed, President Trump informed us to bring the full wrath of the United States Military to protect our citizens abroad. And we were prepared to do that. And lastly, we were always going to leave a special operations force in country for counterterrorism purposes.

Look, Jake Sullivan, you said it, and this is the starkest thing I'll say tonight. He said they're basically sending out text messages to the 10,000 Americans in country and asking them to come to us. No, that's not what America does. America goes into war zones and gets our citizens. They send out armored personnel carriers, our fighting forces and rotary wing assets, and we go rescue our own.

The White House is mum on that. Americans deserve to know where their hard-earned dollars are going. Well, luckily, the good folks from OpenTheBooks put together a fairly comprehensive list of how taxpayer dollars were spent, or I should say, misspent in Afghanistan. That includes nearly $83 billion for the Afghan security forces that surrendered within days of American troops falling out. $174 million on drones that we lost track of, $9.4 million on the Kabul carpet center, yes, you heard that right, and $800 million on a respect women PR campaign aimed at the Taliban. That's obviously taken hold. What we see in the last 48 hours tells us that that's a joke. Joining me now is Indiana Congressman, Jim banks, Afghan war vet, Republican Study Committee chair.

Now that the U.S. bad government has fallen, it's just an impossibility. But there's one more important fundamental point that has to be made. Those who are advocating mass Afghan resettlement in this country are doing so for political, not humanitarian reasons. It is extraordinarily expensive to resettle a refugee in the United States. They get free health care, they get free education, they get free housing, they get free food, they get cash welfare. For the price that you could resettle refugees in America, you can resettle 10 times more, 15 times more in their home region. In this case, primarily in Pakistan. Resettling in America is not about solving a humanitarian crisis, it's about accomplishing an ideological objective, to change America. And if we really want to help people in the region, we'll be working with our partners to find a safe place for people to go. But that's not America.",

The debate over how many Afghan refugees our country should absorb is one that certain folks don't want to have, but most Americans do. Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller is here on why it matters. Plus, restaurant owners are being driven out of business by New York City's vaccine mandate. And a nurse's job is in jeopardy because she refuses to get the jab. We will speak to both tonight. But first, the invisible president. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now we've about now 3500 troops redeployed in Afghanistan. As of tonight, hundreds of thousands of people are trying to get out. China is poised to exploit the situation. The U.S. border under siege with COVID-infected migrants. And we don't have an actual president in charge. Yesterday, Joe Biden darted back to DC from Camp David, read for about, what, 19 minutes, then took no questions and skedaddled off the podium. Oh, and then he went back to Camp David. Now, answers were supposed to be provided today by Biden's national security adviser, a young chap who looks like he's running for student council.

Foreign leaders didn't listen to him, they said. But all of it was a lie. We've just suffered one of the most humiliating defeats in American history, a defeat made worse by their utter inability to predict anything with accuracy. And their response is that Biden isn't talking to anyone. Should Biden be talking to everyone and trying to assure them that he actually knows what he's doing? Even if the Biden team doesn't think he can do the job? Shouldn't they, at least, pretend that he can do it? They could have given him some flashcards, or something to read on the phone, anything. But no, we just had radio silence. The team of Blinken, Sullivan and Klein has plainly failed. The notion that they could run the country while Biden hid from public view has been proven false. On the Military front, General white rage Milley, Secretary CRT Austin should have already been terminated. They're being outmaneuvered everywhere in the world and it shows. Democrats and Republicans on the Hill should all be demanding that Biden clean House and bring in much better people to get the situation under control. We can't take these three much longer. We can't take three weeks of this, much less three more years of this. And that's the ANGLE. Tonight, as Biden and many leftists rush to blame Trump for old Joe's blunders, we're bringing you the inside story of what Trump had actually planned for Afghanistan. And you'll hear it from the man Trump appointed to take over the DoD after he fired former defense secretary Mark Esper. Joining me now Kash Patel, former Pentagon chief of staff and advisor at President Trump. Kash, this was really a fight against the swamp entrenched Pentagon bureaucracy here, was it not?"

President Trump sent me over there and he said, listen, we have conditions controlled withdrawal from Afghanistan. That is they have to surrender any affiliation and totally reject Al Qaeda. Two, they have to sit down at the table that is the Afghan government and the Taliban and negotiate an interim peace government that will last. And three and most importantly, that if any American interests was harmed, or any American personnel was harmed, President Trump informed us to bring the full wrath of the United States Military to protect our citizens abroad. And we were prepared to do that. And lastly, we were always going to leave a special operations force in country for counterterrorism purposes. So that is a coordinated strategic plan that has conditions-based withdrawal, which is totally lacking today."

      "utterance": "No. I mean, he had to fire two Secretaries of Defense to get what the commander-in-chief wanted. That's not how the elected democracy works. And here's a prime example of a failure and leadership. When you're playing the blame game on national TV, and your response for the largest fighting force on God's green earth and you failed the commander-in-chief, he didn't fail you, you failed him because you failed to prepare the logistical requirements necessary to remove Americans and American citizens securely. Look, Jake Sullivan, you said it, and this is the starkest thing I'll say tonight. He said they're basically sending out text messages to the 10,000 Americans in country and asking them to come to us. No, that's not what America does. America goes into war zones and gets our citizens. They send out armored personnel carriers, our fighting forces and rotary wing assets, and we go rescue our own. We don't text them and ask them to come to us in a foreign land. That is just an obnoxious leadership that is politicizing our country."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATEL",
      "utterance": "Great question. And President Trump said clearly, our manning and not just our personnel, but our equipment, our machinery and our weaponry had to come back, because leaving them there would be a national security disaster. And in the Department of Defense, we have an entire logistical department that takes on these transport operations. We literally fly in thousands of airplanes, the size of four Greyhound buses for months at a time to remove those equipments. And we had a plan in place to do that. And we were not going to remove those - of that manning and equipment until the Taliban and the Afghans agreed to our terms, which they did and it was working. And here's another example, not one American casualty occurred under President Trump's withdrawal plan from Afghanistan that we implemented. Now you have people dying at the airport at Kabul, falling from cargo planes to their death."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Another question. Now, this might be a really stupid question. But how is it that Biden's team - someone there has to have a brain, wouldn't have started withdrawing people, withdrawing Americans, contractors, they have to get out of the country before August or July, whenever they were going to start ramping up the plan for full Military withdrawal. Why would 10,000 Americans still be there? I don't get that. They knew this day was coming, in other words."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATEL",
      "utterance": "Yes. Absolutely. And you're right on. They failed to prepare and plan like we did under President Trump. We prepared to secure interests. We prepared for the withdrawal of people and personnel. And we prepared to prop up a joint government with the Afghans and the Taliban. But what President Biden failed to do was listen to the Intelligence from career officers. He politicized the Afghan withdrawal and instead listened to the mainstream media while taking naps at Camp David and eating ice cream."

We recently learned that Biden planned on throwing billions more into that money pit, $3 billion to be exact. Now, were they at all worried about that cash ending up in the Taliban's hands. The White House is mum on that. Americans deserve to know where their hard-earned dollars are going. Well, luckily, the good folks from OpenTheBooks put together a fairly comprehensive list of how taxpayer dollars were spent, or I should say, misspent in Afghanistan. That includes nearly $83 billion for the Afghan security forces that surrendered within days of American troops falling out. $174 million on drones that we lost track of, $9.4 million on the Kabul carpet center, yes, you heard that right, and $800 million on a respect women PR campaign aimed at the Taliban. That's obviously taken hold. What we see in the last 48 hours tells us that that's a joke. Joining me now is Indiana Congressman, Jim banks, Afghan war vet, Republican Study Committee chair. Congressman, is it not time for Congress to hold comprehensive hearings on the utter catastrophe that has been this withdrawal and the lies about the Afghan security forces being up to snuff that had been happening and been going on for at least they had gone on for 10 years? Where are the congressional hearings on this?"

And the least that we can do is hold congressional hearings to get to the bottom of why. I'm not holding my breath, though, with Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, saying that she supports President Biden's plans in Afghanistan and the undoing of everything that's happened over the last 72 hours up to the month before that. If the Speaker of the House supports Joe Biden's efforts there, I can't imagine that she's going to allow us to have oversight hearings, perhaps those will have to wait until the Republicans went back to majority in '22."

That's where I served in 2014 and 2015 when I was there as a reservist. I participated in these efforts and I can - it's humiliating to me to think that the Taliban now controls one of the most expensive U.S. embassies that we built around the world. They now own it. They literally own the United States Embassy. It's humiliating, it should be humiliating to every American.

And by the way, this isn't been - hasn't been widely reported. But another part of that press conference with Jake Sullivan was that they aren't prioritizing Americans in Afghanistan to get them out first. I mean, why would Americans not be prioritized to get them out of the country. They can't even get to the airport, they don't know who to call. My office is receiving phone calls from Americans and others in Afghanistan who have no idea what to do, where to go, because our embassy has been vacated. There was no plan at all to get Americans safely out of Afghanistan, and to responsibly make this happen by the Biden administration. It is shameful and it will go down in history as a black mark on our country. And certainly will prove that this President is not up for the job."

We're being kept in the dark about how any of these people will be vetted. For starters, how many are there? What criteria is being used to determine who gets in? And more importantly, will their family members be allowed to join them? You just heard family members mentioned. Is it cousins, second cousins? Who qualifies as a vulnerable person? By looking at the news and the websites tonight, pretty much everyone in Afghanistan is vulnerable. So there are about 30 million people in Afghanistan. So how many do they really propose we take? And on what basis? They can't all be interpreters. The lesson of this 20-year war cannot be that every time we turn a country upside down or make huge mistakes, our immigration laws, our refugee laws no longer apply. Of course, the left believes that everyone, everyone should be able to come here. And that the 20-plus million here illegally right now should not only be allowed to stay, but to vote as well. And now they think we have nothing at all, I guess, to learn from who they usually tell us we should listen to, Europe. What about Europe's experience recently with millions of Syrian refugees and Afghan refugees and Iraqi refugees. And drawing any such parallels is deemed, well, you guessed it, racist."

The Taliban has all of the control of the government now. So the notion that people could just show up at a checkpoint and demand resettlement into the United States, and we can have any idea about their background, their belief system, where they come from. Now that the U.S. bad government has fallen, it's just an impossibility. But there's one more important fundamental point that has to be made. Those who are advocating mass Afghan resettlement in this country are doing so for political, not humanitarian reasons. It is extraordinarily expensive to resettle a refugee in the United States. They get free health care, they get free education, they get free housing, they get free food, they get cash welfare. For the price that you could resettle refugees in America, you can resettle 10 times more, 15 times more in their home region. In this case, primarily in Pakistan. Resettling in America is not about solving a humanitarian crisis, it's about accomplishing an ideological objective, to change America. And if we really want to help people in the region, we'll be working with our partners to find a safe place for people to go. But that's not America."

The United States of America never ever made a promise written or unwritten to the people of Afghanistan, that if after 20 years they were unable to secure their own country, that we would take them to ours. That is nonsense. That has never been U.S. government policy."

In moments, we're going to speak to two restauranteurs who are fighting back. Plus Australia, strict lockdown, and the COVID situation there is getting worse during the lockdown.

OK, which of course implies that the unvaccinated our being locked out. In other words, if you are not vaccinated, doesn't matter if you have natural immunity, you are an untouchable. You need to be shunned from polite society. The left wants you to think this is progress, but it is just shameful. It's un-America. I'm not the only one who thinks so. New York City business owners are fighting back against this disgusting attack on our civil liberties. With me now is the manager and owner of Pasticceria Rocco Mary Josephine and Rocco Generoso.

You said it in your opening there. This to me is segregation. We are trampling on civil liberties. We are discriminating against people. The mayor of New York essentially just locked out tourists, he locked out families. He's telling people who have not been vaccinated that they don't belong. They are not allowed to roam freely in society, that they don't count, essentially. I can't believe that we have created two new classes."

It's discrimination against us, the bar owners, restaurant owners, and gym owners who go against what he said, that all city employees and city officials can either be vaccinated or take a weekly COVID test. That doesn't apply to us, so that is discrimination against us on that end. And then he's just discriminating against people who freely choose not to take a vaccine.

This is an attack on people just wanting to come to the restaurant, sitting down and have a cup of coffee with their families, with their friends. You are a father and son. You want to take your son to a ballgame? Can you do that now? If you are not vaccinated, you can't take a 12-year-old to a ball game? Where are we? What kind of country do we live in? This is insane that people can't see that it's not just about safety. Without our civil liberties, without our Constitution, what foundation do we have? People have said to me, are you afraid that you are going to lose money? Are you afraid about the fines that might come your way? Money is a big deal, of course it is. But without the country that I grew up in, what is money without freedom? I really implore everybody to listen to what is going on here. The message is not really meant to be political. I said this many times before -- we need to protect the Constitution. We need to protect our civil liberties. We can't start segregating people vaxxed, unvaxxed. I have natural immunity. You brought it up. It's not even discussed. If you look at other countries, like Israel for example, they allow for at least natural immunity. You've had doctors on your show that have said as much."

Halfway around the world, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern put her entire nation on lockdown over one case. In addition, she warned citizens not to speak to their neighbors. Now over in Australia, the lockdown is so ineffective that seven weeks in they've just experienced their worst day of the pandemic. Of course, their response to this news totally unhinged. Newly imposed restrictions now include a ban on removing face masks to take a drink of alcohol in public. Here to break it down, all the insanity, Australian member of parliament George Christensen. George, the lockdowns don't work, they prolong the pandemic. Does anyone see this in Australia except for a few like you?"

And when I thought that no one could beat us in this insanity stakes, along comes New Zealand who always wants to do one better than Australia, and they have, locking down their entire country over one single case.

The ridiculous sort of stuff that we are seeing now, restrictions on visiting graveyards. There was one person in Victoria who reported being fined by police for visiting a graveyard. Now they have just shut down access to playgrounds so kids can't run around free in the local playground or park. And more than that, I think that your compadre there, Tucker, pointed out our premier, it's the equivalent of a governor, the premier for Victoria Dan Andrews actually said to people you are not to remove your masks to drink alcohol outside. And I've got to tell you, Laura, that Aussie's take their beer drinking very seriously, so they'll would probably give that away."

    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTENSEN",

And the media then said afterwards, there was no spread of COVID-19 from these protests because, you know what, it doesn't spread outside. But when people go to protest against the restrictions themselves, suddenly they are evil people who must be fined and must be locked up. And so I think that the police really need to think again. They are delving far too far into a political argument here."

They are now policing in New South Wales and other states who you hook up with as a single. You have to register who you are seeing.
