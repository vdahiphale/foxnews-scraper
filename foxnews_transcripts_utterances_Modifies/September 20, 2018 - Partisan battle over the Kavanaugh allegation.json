But today, the burden is on the accused to prove one's innocence, even with an event decades ago that's unclear even to the accuser. So now the Dems have gone from Borking one man to Borking a system and accusation is all you need. The legal system becomes a game of tag. Plus, it's saying that the accused is presumed innocent is now seen as pro-abuse, why not rid us of courts all together? Just rely on memory. The media thinks it's full-proof, but is it? Hillary believes she ran from sniper fire and didn't believe Juanita. Blumenthal believed he was in 'Nam. Brian Williams believed everything he said on talk shows. But memory is fallible for all and that's for accuser and the accused. It's just shocking how fast the media fires when they see the desired moving target. And after sitting on it for many months, Feinstein gave that target to them. But says the mob: Let's not rush things. We've got all day as they twirl their rope. But what of the media? At work they swarm, but at home, do they look at their spouse or kid and think what if this ever happens to them? People love Shakespeare's tragedies because afterwards you can go home and say, hey, I'm glad I'm not Julius Caesar. It made you welcome a humble life. No more. Today, we're all Caesars, facing a mob of Brutuses armed with trespasses shaped like daggers and microphones.  All right, Jesse. We need to hear from her, don't we?",

I think what happened was, they thought they were going to take it up to a certain point, and then they realized that this woman was going to have to testify Monday. And that was way too soon for the Democrats because this was a delay tactic. And this is a really dirty business. And for that reason, today, I'm withdrawing from consideration from the Supreme Court, and for many administration, whatsoever, because it's ugly. And they're destroying this guy's life. And I wanted to give Ford the benefit of the doubt at the beginning. Remember, on Monday and Tuesday, I've been saying I believe she believe something happened. Something may have happened. There was a polygraph involved. I don't want to cast any doubt on her allegations. But the way they're dragging this out now it's become so political, Greg, that it's gotten away from the actual alleged crime, and now it's about the process and the nomination of this guy. She's not doing things and the Democrats aren't doing things in a way that people would do if she was a true victim. If you go out and you say the first thing, you hear Kavanaugh's name, you call the Washington Post, and then you call your congresswoman, and then you call Dianne Feinstein and you say you don't want to come forward because you want to be anonymous, but at the same time you take a polygraph test. And when they ask you how did you pay for the polygraph, you don't say how you paid for it. And then you hire a Clinton fund-raiser as your lawyer to represent you. And now it looks like there's some behind the scenes stuff were Brian Fallon, who worked for Hillary Clinton, has teamed up with Paige Herwig, who worked for Dianne Feinstein, and they've raised $5 million, a lot from George Soros, to fund a group called Demand Justice. And Demand Justice is the main organization that's running to stop the Kavanaugh nomination. And they're working in concert with Debra Katz, the lawyer for Ford. It's just way, way too suspicious what's going on. I wanted to believe her. I still kind of believe she believes something happen, but it doesn't sit right anymore.",

It looks like Dean Heller is actually doing a lot better. So, you actually have Republicans figuring out ways to run based on what their state needs and figuring out a way to run with Trump and not against him, necessarily, but having a little bit of distance, and it's working in some of those states. So, at the end of all of these, let's say that maybe the -- maybe the Republicans don't lose the House. They'll lose some seats. Maybe they hold on by a few. Maybe they lose the House. OK, that would be something they have to deal with. But it looks like the Republicans will keep the Senate. And so if the Democrats really want to succeed, talking about symposium -- like you're at a symposium isn't going to necessarily work.

Save the cat.\" The crews quickly ran in, lifted the junk car, freeing the kitten from below it. And good news, spectators Melissa and her stepdaughter Samantha immediately fell in love with the kitten. They named her Showstopper after she was able to bring the loud monster truck crowd to a halt. And Jim Murdoch of News 12 down in Jersey brought this to us. Isn't that cute?

At the end of the game they had one more play. Hayes got to carry the ball all the way to the end zone for his first touchdown ever.

Plus, it's saying that the accused is presumed innocent is now seen as pro-abuse, why not rid us of courts all together? Just rely on memory. The media thinks it's full-proof, but is it? Hillary believes she ran from sniper fire and didn't believe Juanita. Blumenthal believed he was in 'Nam. Brian Williams believed everything he said on talk shows.

And that was way too soon for the Democrats because this was a delay tactic. And this is a really dirty business. And for that reason, today, I'm withdrawing from consideration from the Supreme Court, and for many administration, whatsoever, because it's ugly. And they're destroying this guy's life. And I wanted to give Ford the benefit of the doubt at the beginning. Remember, on Monday and Tuesday, I've been saying I believe she believe something happened. Something may have happened. There was a polygraph involved. I don't want to cast any doubt on her allegations. But the way they're dragging this out now it's become so political, Greg, that it's gotten away from the actual alleged crime, and now it's about the process and the nomination of this guy. She's not doing things and the Democrats aren't doing things in a way that people would do if she was a true victim. If you go out and you say the first thing, you hear Kavanaugh's name, you call the Washington Post, and then you call your congresswoman, and then you call Dianne Feinstein and you say you don't want to come forward because you want to be anonymous, but at the same time you take a polygraph test. And when they ask you how did you pay for the polygraph, you don't say how you paid for it. And then you hire a Clinton fund-raiser as your lawyer to represent you. And now it looks like there's some behind the scenes stuff were Brian Fallon, who worked for Hillary Clinton, has teamed up with Paige Herwig, who worked for Dianne Feinstein, and they've raised $5 million, a lot from George Soros, to fund a group called Demand Justice. And Demand Justice is the main organization that's running to stop the Kavanaugh nomination. And they're working in concert with Debra Katz, the lawyer for Ford. It's just way, way too suspicious what's going on. I wanted to believe her. I still kind of believe she believes something happen, but it doesn't sit right anymore."

She should not be insulted. That was the first thing Kellyanne Conway said and everyone followed that lead. And the president has been quite muted about it. And everyone -- you can be heard. You will be heard. There is a question about this idea, Judge Napolitano said earlier on the 2 o'clock show, should the president asked the FBI to take two weeks, see what you can find out, and at the end of that, then vote on him and allow him to get seated by November 1st rather than October 1st. That's not what the Democrats want. I don't think they're ever, ever going to be satisfied even if there is an FBI investigation. And if there's nothing there, that won't ever matter.

It never would have come out if it hadn't been for the fact that he was up for Supreme Court. And the person that's making the accusation has unclear memories on it. But he's tarred for life.

You know, this is not Maduro in Venezuela where they are having a -- it's tragic what's going on right there. What's happening in the United States is a booming economy. It's actually quite the opposite. You know, we have more Venezuelan immigrants coming to the United States because of it, fleeing from a real authoritarian tendency and dictator.

Plus, America loves when people get fired in Washington. That's why we sent Trump there.

Just today, the Fox power rankings that Chris Stirewalt runs showed an improvement, especially in Nevada. That was the Democrats thought that was a pick up for them for the senate seat. It looks like Dean Heller is actually doing a lot better. So, you actually have Republicans figuring out ways to run based on what their state needs and figuring out a way to run with Trump and not against him, necessarily, but having a little bit of distance, and it's working in some of those states. So, at the end of all of these, let's say that maybe the -- maybe the Republicans don't lose the House. They'll lose some seats. Maybe they hold on by a few. Maybe they lose the House. OK, that would be something they have to deal with. But it looks like the Republicans will keep the Senate. And so if the Democrats really want to succeed, talking about symposium -- like you're at a symposium isn't going to necessarily work. I do think that what Michelle Obama is doing and announced that she's doing is a much more helpful thing for Democrats. So she's going to have a big new effort. She's doing a big celebrity thing of voter turnout and voter registration. Democrats are very good at registering new voters, and if you register a voter, they are 99 percent likely to vote that first year that they register. So that is where a lot of energy should be placed if you want to win."

Like, \"He says things that I think are racist\" or \"He says things that are mean about the press.\" That's not anything, because that's not an actual deed. Meanwhile, he hasn't stopped the media. He's woken it up. Authoritarians don't do that. He hasn't started wars. He's trying to prevent them. Authoritarians don't do that. He wants to bring the troops home. That's all he's been talking about. Authoritarians want to send troops out. And he wants other countries to pitch in militarily. That's not authoritarian either. And I need you -- and you must remember, around November 18 in 2020, it won't be the authoritarian causing violence and intimidation in the streets. Progressives are merely fascists in camo. And when the time is right, the disguises will drop. And they'll be out there like they were after the election.

The kitten was hiding in a junk car that was used for the monster trucks to drive over. And when an onlookers noticed the cat in the car, the crowd started chanting, \"Save the cat. Save the cat.\" The crews quickly ran in, lifted the junk car, freeing the kitten from below it. And good news, spectators Melissa and her stepdaughter Samantha immediately fell in love with the kitten. They named her Showstopper after she was able to bring the loud monster truck crowd to a halt. And Jim Murdoch of News 12 down in Jersey brought this to us. Isn't that cute? I mean, that would be scary."

The book is getting terrific reviews. Kirkus Review called the book \"relevant, well-grounded, cogent response from a veteran journalist.\" Civil rights hero John Lewis said, \"This book is going to inspire you, move all Americans.\" Historian Doug Brinkley highly recommends it and called it vivid investigation into Trump and civil rights. So conservative or liberal, if you're in THE FIVE audience, this is a book that's going to get you thinking, talking about Trump and the controversial issue of how he deals with race. So I'd like you to preorder your copy today, and I want to say thanks in advance. As you know, the book officially hits the bookstores Tuesday, September 25. So take a read."

Ten-year-old Hayes was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at 18 months old and relies on a motorized wheelchair to get around. He's always been a diehard football fan but hadn't been able to be part of the team until his friends asked him to join the Converse Tigers for their game against their rival. At the end of the game they had one more play. Hayes got to carry the ball all the way to the end zone for his first touchdown ever. The crowd cheered him on and chanted his name as he made his way down the field, which ended in celebratory huddle all around Hayes from both teams."
