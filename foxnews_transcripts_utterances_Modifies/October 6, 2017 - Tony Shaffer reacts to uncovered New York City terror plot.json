What I cannot confirm to you today and what we continue to investigate is whether anybody else may have known about this incident before he carried it out. The bulk of Tannerite there we found and whether we believe he was trying to make it into an IED. I can tell you, we found it in the condition that it was and it did not resemble an IED.

      "sentences": "Yes. Hey, Martha, a lot of developments today. Unfortunately, nothing that points directly to a motive. You can hear the frustration in the police as they held that news conference today. What is crystal clear today and really forming every single day and we see this is that there was a ton of planning by Stephen Paddock and he had one goal it seemed, and that was to kill as many people as possible not really caring who or whereas he looked all over the United States at places where he could attack.  There are reports that today, that Paddock either tried to buy or did by tracer ammunition. Either way, it was not used but could have made the massacre even more deadly because he likely would've been more accurate. As for investigators, they continue to dive inside Paddock's phone and computer for any clues -- that work being done at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. There's also a note police found in the gunman's room, not a suicide note. It contained a bunch of numbers which they're trying to decipher right now. More chilling information that Paddock may have been planning similar attacks elsewhere. He searched for a hotel room near Fenway Park in Boston, he also and booked two rooms in Chicago during the Lollapalooza Festival but never showed there. Some interesting information is leaked from the police interview of Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley. She reportedly told investigators that recently, Paddock has been agitated at night, waking up moaning and sometimes screaming -- not sure what to make of that. Meantime, in an unrelated story, the Department of Justice later today announced that they broke up a plot to detonate bombs in New York's Times Square and also the subway. A terrorist attack was supposed to take place last summer in New York. Three people with ties to Pakistan and the Philippines have been arrested; one has pled guilty to terrorist-related charges and two are awaiting extradition. Martha.",

Look, this credibility issue is something the officials are not doing well on, and I think they have to be much clearer what was in the room, what's in the video. But to your point about deception -- look, the bump fire issue, the weapons that are being shown on the networks, they're trying to create, essentially in my judgment, a state of panic.  Tracers, look, I fired weapons with tracers, they don't help in a situation like this. They simply show you kind of the trajectory of where your bullet is going.

I've looked at the field of fire, so I don't -- again, I think some of the reporting is almost spectacular to the point of where they're trying to draw attention away from the court issues of what happened here, why did he become radicalized and trying to focus on the technology?

If a child were doing that, we'd call the doctor. The second most important thing is the revelation that he was taking a valium, that he was new at using it, that he had a prescription for it. Valium is an anti-anxiety agent, it's a tranquilizer, it's like a dry martini -- calms the person down. But extended use, frequent use, and extended can cause more problems.

The storm is just off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, and the light we're getting right through the Yucatan Channel here, not having any interaction with the Yucatan. That means no real weakening from it. I will tell you, it's really got its act together over the last few hours; winds are up to 60 miles an hour. It's also going over kind of the warmest water that it will have at any point; right here, across parts of the Western Caribbean. The water as it moves forward not as warm even though the temperature is certainly plenty warm to sustain a hurricane; doesn't have the depth and that extra fuel it'll need. You will, however, notice it's going to make a V-line, right there, towards the central gulf. Because of that, the rainfall totals are going to be heaviest right here where it comes on shore inland, even all the way across parts of the southern appellations, I think that's where we could see the worst of the flooding from this storm, especially just due to some of the mountains in the hills that are across this area.  Localized flooding, especially, maybe around the Mobile Bay, that's where, I think, we'll see the worst of the storm surge. But the track of this, very much in agreement; all of our model's in agreement coming on-shore somewhere between New Orleans and over towards the Alabama coastline. That's where the worst of the storm surge will be. But you'll notice, this is tomorrow night, we are about 30 hours likely from having a landfall of a very strong tropical storm and a possible hurricane here towards the central gulf. Because it's moving so fast, it's going to get here very fast, but then it's also going to move on very quickly. I want to point out one last thing, Martha, moving up through the Tennessee Valley, and eventually through the Ohio Valley, and across parts of the northeast throughout the weekend. And in the early part of next week, a lot of people are going to be having some impacts of from this storm.",

Certainly, learning that people are dying there, that American troops are dying there was significant to people. But this Iran deal is big and I think that it is something that completely blows up the last couple of years of Obama foreign policy, something that we were told just couldn't be done, that we could get Iran back to the negotiation table.

Some Hollywood insiders reacted to this bombshell New York Times story about Harvey Weinstein multiple sexual harassment settlements by saying that he's conduct was an open secret. Yet, the movie mogul acknowledgement this he is, quote, caused a lot of pain for female colleague is throwing a fresh spotlight on the depth of his ties to the Democratic Party. Buzz Feed is reporting that as the Times gathered its evidence, Weinstein retained a number of top P.R. executives. Among them, according to Buzz Feed was Anita Dunn, the White House communication director during President Obama's first term. Dunn is perhaps best known for leading the so-called war on Fox News in 2009, when Obama aides declared this network of an arm of the Republican Party and worked behind the scenes, unsuccessfully, to get Fox News expelled from the White House pool. The consortium of TV networks that rotate the cost and duties of White House coverage. On inauguration day the Hollywood reporter reported that first daughter Malia Obama was going to be interning for the Weinstein Company starting the following month. Across the 3 decades in which the Times reported these sexual harassment cases occurred, Weinstein contributed an estimated $750,000 to Democratic causes and candidates, and the Republican National Committee demanding those funds be returned. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is donating $16,000 and change he receives to charities that support women. The nearly 12 grand received by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand also of New York is going to a nonprofit that helps victims of sexual violence. Likewise, Senator Cory Booker is sending nearly 8,000 to the New Jersey coalition against sexual assaults. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts donated 5,000 to a Boston nonprofit. Among those Democrats who've not yet returned return or donated Weinstein's contributions, at least thus, are New York governor Andrew Cuomo, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, and Senator Kamala Harris of California. She, like Gillibrand, Booker and Warren is considered a potential presidential contender in 2020. Martha?",

      "utterance": "Yes. Hey, Martha, a lot of developments today. Unfortunately, nothing that points directly to a motive. You can hear the frustration in the police as they held that news conference today. What is crystal clear today and really forming every single day and we see this is that there was a ton of planning by Stephen Paddock and he had one goal it seemed, and that was to kill as many people as possible not really caring who or whereas he looked all over the United States at places where he could attack. There are reports that today, that Paddock either tried to buy or did by tracer ammunition. Either way, it was not used but could have made the massacre even more deadly because he likely would've been more accurate. As for investigators, they continue to dive inside Paddock's phone and computer for any clues -- that work being done at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. There's also a note police found in the gunman's room, not a suicide note. It contained a bunch of numbers which they're trying to decipher right now. More chilling information that Paddock may have been planning similar attacks elsewhere. He searched for a hotel room near Fenway Park in Boston, he also and booked two rooms in Chicago during the Lollapalooza Festival but never showed there. Some interesting information is leaked from the police interview of Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley. She reportedly told investigators that recently, Paddock has been agitated at night, waking up moaning and sometimes screaming -- not sure what to make of that. Meantime, in an unrelated story, the Department of Justice later today announced that they broke up a plot to detonate bombs in New York's Times Square and also the subway. A terrorist attack was supposed to take place last summer in New York. Three people with ties to Pakistan and the Philippines have been arrested; one has pled guilty to terrorist-related charges and two are awaiting extradition. Martha."

And this has been something that they've been studying very carefully. The basic plot was, individuals working to establish logistical support, and, obviously, explosives to place them at critical locations within the city to attack transportation. Clearly, Martha, you know, you lived there, and I've been in New York, attacking these modes would've caused huge and continuous panic. So, clearly, as we've said before before this issue came up out of Vegas that you have ISIS is making a concerted and constant effort to establish both the network, as well as folks who will be able to execute attacks there.

      "utterance": "I do. I do. Well, to Candice's point, they need to put out the note to let us know what's on it. If it's nothing, then, you know. The other thing that they opened up with the report was there's no credible motive, and this goes to the other reporting. Look, this credibility issue is something the officials are not doing well on, and I think they have to be much clearer what was in the room, what's in the video. But to your point about deception -- look, the bump fire issue, the weapons that are being shown on the networks, they're trying to create, essentially in my judgment, a state of panic. Tracers, look, I fired weapons with tracers, they don't help in a situation like this. They simply show you kind of the trajectory of where your bullet is going. And let me tell you something, he had no problem putting those bullets where he wanted them. I've looked at the field of fire, so I don't -- again, I think some of the reporting is almost spectacular to the point of where they're trying to draw attention away from the court issues of what happened here, why did he become radicalized and trying to focus on the technology? So, I think it's a very disservice to the public and dishonest overall in the reporting."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, the more we learn about him, Candice, he spent a lot of time alone sitting at gambling machines in casinos. He traveled from place to place. He looked at a number of different hotels, many of which were overlooking some of these venues. I mean, most big cities, you're going to be overlooking something. But when you put all these together, it's definitely curious. And the night terrors that she talks about, what does all that tell you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELONG",
      "utterance": "The night terrors interest me quite a bit. If it was just once it could be written off as a bad dream, but the implication is that it was more than once, and that tells me this man was very, very disturbed to be crying and moaning and screaming while he was asleep. If a child were doing that, we'd call the doctor. The second most important thing is the revelation that he was taking a valium, that he was new at using it, that he had a prescription for it. Valium is an anti-anxiety agent, it's a tranquilizer, it's like a dry martini -- calms the person down. But extended use, frequent use, and extended can cause more problems. When the person comes down off the dose, the drug is no longer acting in their system, they can go into a clinical depression and become even more nervous."

      "utterance": "Again, I'm surprised where this investigation hasn't gotten to that point. I mean, these drugs are controlled, prescription is very controlled. So, why aren't we figuring out more about who prescribed these and why? And this goes back to my contention earlier this week on Monday, when we first talked about this, Martha. This does parallel the Hodgkinson attack in Alexandria against Congressman Scalise, because of the fact that-- clearly, this man was mentally disturbed and something was going on.

Their names are on the bullets on the cover of the New Yorker Magazine in a very moving, artistic display as well. The search for the motive, as you know, goes on this evening. And the conversation turned to gun control, specifically so-called bump stocks-- it's the gun accessory that allowed gunman, Stephen Paddock, to fire hundreds of shots within minutes. Now, the NRA is clarifying its position on calls to ban them."

      "utterance": "So, I mean, this is just another thing that is an example of technology out-pacing legislation. Those people who are in charge right now are legislators; you cannot legislate on emotion on this. We're rushing to judgment to look for someone or something to blame. This is Paddock's fault, and he's not an inanimate object. You cannot legislate personal responsibilities. And when you do, like they're trying to do with this bump stock, you get bills like you did in Connecticut after Sandy Hook which was SP-1160 -- which essentially made a ton of law-abiding citizens felons over overnight. It didn't solve any problem, wouldn't have stopped the actual shooting itself. We can't afford to have bad legislation like this; this needs to be thought through. And if it's deemed that this is somehow of a negative effect on society outside of this shooting, then, yes, we should take a look at it. But I don't think banning certain individual parts of technology because then it will be the trigger, then it'll be the barrel, and where does it stop?"

It's very hard to get a permit to have an automatic weapon, and there's very good reason for that, and one of the reasons we saw in horrible detail in Las Vegas. But another thing to keep in mind here: it is true that these bump stocks, to my knowledge, haven't been used in a major crime before, but they could be in the future because these things -- these kinds of crimes often have copycats."

It just raises the question, Carl, there's obviously too much death in this country by these ways of killing yourself, either with a gun or killing other people with a gun. We all know that there are other ways for people to die. However -- and we also understand that people want the ability to protect themselves and keep themselves safe.

We have been shouting from the rooftops about this, and let me give you one example: after Sandy Hook, the parents Sandy Hook banded together and decide to push for something constructive. They knew that they couldn't get assault weapons banned, and they couldn't things that were related to their own tragedy, that what they wanted to do is improve the background checks and to keep going inside their heads in the very criminals that are victimizing people in Chicago."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Yes, it's a really fast-moving storm, that means the impacts are going to come very quickly throughout the day tomorrow. The storm is just off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, and the light we're getting right through the Yucatan Channel here, not having any interaction with the Yucatan. That means no real weakening from it. I will tell you, it's really got its act together over the last few hours; winds are up to 60 miles an hour. It's also going over kind of the warmest water that it will have at any point; right here, across parts of the Western Caribbean. The water as it moves forward not as warm even though the temperature is certainly plenty warm to sustain a hurricane; doesn't have the depth and that extra fuel it'll need. You will, however, notice it's going to make a V-line, right there, towards the central gulf. Because of that, the rainfall totals are going to be heaviest right here where it comes on shore inland, even all the way across parts of the southern appellations, I think that's where we could see the worst of the flooding from this storm, especially just due to some of the mountains in the hills that are across this area. Localized flooding, especially, maybe around the Mobile Bay, that's where, I think, we'll see the worst of the storm surge. But the track of this, very much in agreement; all of our model's in agreement coming on-shore somewhere between New Orleans and over towards the Alabama coastline. That's where the worst of the storm surge will be. But you'll notice, this is tomorrow night, we are about 30 hours likely from having a landfall of a very strong tropical storm and a possible hurricane here towards the central gulf. Because it's moving so fast, it's going to get here very fast, but then it's also going to move on very quickly. I want to point out one last thing, Martha, moving up through the Tennessee Valley, and eventually through the Ohio Valley, and across parts of the northeast throughout the weekend. And in the early part of next week, a lot of people are going to be having some impacts of from this storm."

And then, in the meantime, the Trump administration is, you know, all of the real news is happening, we're not focusing on it, we are talking about the calm before an impending storm that we're not really sure what it is.

I mean, he's talking about recertifying the Iran deal, there's the ever sort of bubbling difficulty intention with North Korea. One another possibility that we haven't talked about is that a very significant and dark moment that the loss of some of our Green Berets in Niger, and the possibility that there might be some retaliation perhaps for that.

And I think it is important, you know, people get so distracted by what President Trump says, and it's really key to just pay attention to what's, what's actually going on or what policy changes are going on, and there is a lot that's happening. And I do think that this decertification of the Iran deal is a huge story. Now, I'm not sure if anything is fought in Niger, I don't even know if people understood that we had troops there for the last couple of years. Certainly, learning that people are dying there, that American troops are dying there was significant to people. But this Iran deal is big and I think that it is something that completely blows up the last couple of years of Obama foreign policy, something that we were told just couldn't be done, that we could get Iran back to the negotiation table. They've signaled the six world powers that they're willing to talk on ballistic missiles. Just in August, they were increasing funding there after shouting death to America. You know, their parliament voted increase funding's. So this is significant and could be what he's talking about."

Is that true?"

We have a guy -- a report say calls the president a moron, and then he goes out to say I think he's smart. Did you ever call him a moron? Well, I don't want to get into that right now. That won't do to have your secretary of state in that position. And also, to the policy front that Mollie's references, you have a group of people inside this administration, including Tillerson, including secretary of defense James Mattis, and others who are urging the president not to back out of the Iran deal. And in fact, to stay in to get the good stuff that they see on the back side after the bad stuff the Obama administration gave away on the front side. They say you've got to stay in here. We need this as a framework. So there are real policy implications underneath that."

There's only implication on our foreign policy that we've work really hard on, whether you agree with it or not. I think the other thing worth looking is Rex Tillerson's state of mind. Remember, for the past few years before being secretary of state, Rex Tillerson was like a world leader. Exxon is like a country. So now he's reporting to Donald Trump. He's sort of distanced himself from the president's tweets during Charlottesville and other things. And now he has to sort of take directions from a guy who -- I don't like his tweeting, I don't like his policies directives. And the press conference we saw was very awkward for him. So I think he thinks his days are numbered because he's like, I'm sort of tired of this."

When ask about the juvenile gossip that people like to put out there, he said I'm not going to do your juvenile gossip thing.

But there's no explanation whatsoever as to what moral convictions mean there. We have Tony Perkins here, maybe he could explain that to me. But what it seems to be is that the Trump administration, just like with the Muslim ban, is going to face a number of lawsuits on this issue. Going to have a lot of angry Americans who rely on that health care. You've heard, hundreds of thousands of women who get it through ObamaCare, 62 million women nationwide right now who are covered. And there was something else in the guidance that I found interesting, it said having access to contraception's promoted risky sexual behavior. But that has nothing to do with religion.

You know, it's nonsensical that the little sister of the poor, a group of Catholics nuns who care for the impoverished that they have to provide for contraceptive in their health care. And we're talking about contraception that could be -- can act as a (INAUDIBLE). Look, this is not about cost. If the government really wanted to provide contraception, they could.

So still ahead tonight, quite a story here. An Oscar winning producer, he has deep ties to the Democratic Party, and is facing blockbuster claims that he sexually harassed young women for years. Conservative columnist John Podhoretz is calling out the hypocrisy as he sees it as some of the people who are supporting Harvey Weinstein tweeting this, Harvey Weinstein is such a wonderful feminist that he has feminist Lisa Bloom and Anita Dunne fronting for his disgusting misogyny. That's what he tweeted today. Attorney Mark Eiglarsh and entertainment reporter Matt Donnelly joins us next."

The Hollywood mogul is now on damage control mode and seeking the advised of former Obama officials Anita Dunn as Democrats have taken millions of dollars in donations and fundraisers at his home scramble to respond. Many of them have started to give back some of this money. Correspondent James Rosen in Washington with more on this tonight. Hi, James."

      "utterance": "Martha, good evening. Some Hollywood insiders reacted to this bombshell New York Times story about Harvey Weinstein multiple sexual harassment settlements by saying that he's conduct was an open secret. Yet, the movie mogul acknowledgement this he is, quote, caused a lot of pain for female colleague is throwing a fresh spotlight on the depth of his ties to the Democratic Party. Buzz Feed is reporting that as the Times gathered its evidence, Weinstein retained a number of top P.R. executives. Among them, according to Buzz Feed was Anita Dunn, the White House communication director during President Obama's first term. Dunn is perhaps best known for leading the so-called war on Fox News in 2009, when Obama aides declared this network of an arm of the Republican Party and worked behind the scenes, unsuccessfully, to get Fox News expelled from the White House pool. The consortium of TV networks that rotate the cost and duties of White House coverage. On inauguration day the Hollywood reporter reported that first daughter Malia Obama was going to be interning for the Weinstein Company starting the following month. Across the 3 decades in which the Times reported these sexual harassment cases occurred, Weinstein contributed an estimated $750,000 to Democratic causes and candidates, and the Republican National Committee demanding those funds be returned. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer is donating $16,000 and change he receives to charities that support women. The nearly 12 grand received by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand also of New York is going to a nonprofit that helps victims of sexual violence. Likewise, Senator Cory Booker is sending nearly 8,000 to the New Jersey coalition against sexual assaults. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts donated 5,000 to a Boston nonprofit. Among those Democrats who've not yet returned return or donated Weinstein's contributions, at least thus, are New York governor Andrew Cuomo, Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, and Senator Kamala Harris of California. She, like Gillibrand, Booker and Warren is considered a potential presidential contender in 2020. Martha?"

Good to have both of you with is tonight. You know, it is interesting to look at the people who are involved in defending or tutoring is one of the word that's being used. Lisa Bloom is apparently tutoring Harvey Weinstein out of what he has called is bad behavior in the past. Just to familiarize everyone with her, let's watch some of this video of her defending women who claimed that they were harassed in the past. Watch this."

And this is the tired old way to go. This is the way that guys used to behave in the workplace. But, Harvey, we're not going to be doing that anymore. Do you find that contrast striking, Mark?"

      "utterance": "I don't agree with you on this one. I've got to say at first, I read 3 times -- wait, she's defending him? Is that what I'm reading? But then -- here's what I found out. First, you've got to read her statement in its entirety. People are picking out little sound bites. Secondly, she's not defending him. She's serving as an advisor. And when someone like this readily admits what they've done wrong to some extent, obviously, he takes exception on something, and he's saying I want to evolve, I want to raise my level of awareness, then who better than someone who's been a fierce advocate for victims to help him find his way?"

I just think there's a little bit of a double standard going on here in terms of the way that this cases is looked at by this attorney and, you know, she's not defending him in that sense. But she is tutoring him is the word that was used. And she did say in remarks today that some of these allegations she believes are false. That is not something that we have ever heard from her on any of these prior cases, in terms of understanding, you know, the background and the full picture and looking at both sides of this equation, which she is apparently is quite willing to do with Harvey Weinstein."

Even Lisa would be the first to say if you don't like it, that's totally OK. But her firm is very different than her mother's. She has an open practice. We know her for defending victims, she also does other kind of work. And in this particular case when someone comes out and says, I want to accept responsibility. I want to get better. What's wrong? Where is that person supposed to go for assistance? It's going to somebody like Lisa."

So, it's a pretty interesting tactic that Lisa would go to the other side and really help change behavior. But, obviously, it raised a lot of eyebrows here. But they have a book deal. They have one of Lisa's books in development as a mini-series that Jay-Z, by the way, is an executive producer about the Martin case--"

It sounds somewhat like what we heard about Bill Clinton and others, you know, that it's an addiction, that there's a problem that they need to work through. The language when it was used, when she was defending -- you know, when she was representing women who accused the president of things, Bill O'Reilly of things as well was completely different. I mean, in those cases she said after that case, this is what happens when women speak our truth. We can slay dragons. In this case on Harvey Weinstein, she saying as a woman advocate he is an old dinosaur learning new ways. I mean, doesn't that strike you as a little bit of hypocrisy?"
