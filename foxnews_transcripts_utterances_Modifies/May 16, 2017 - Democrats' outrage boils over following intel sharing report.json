Russia lost a jetliner in 2015, 227 souls died in that. There are common fights against ISIS.

      "sentences": "Yes, and they've known about it for a while, too, because they had a statement ready to go, which we'll read to you here, the White House response to all of these allegations. Quote, \"While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies in all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.\" What we have not gotten from the White House yet is their side of the story. Well, what did the president say to the director of the FBI? The New York Times says that this was an Oval Office meeting back in February. There were a number of people who were meeting with the president, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions. At the end of that meeting, the president asked everyone to leave except for the FBI director. An according to The New York Times reporting on this Comey memo, the president said something to the effect that Flynn had done nothing wrong, that the FBI should move on. \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.\" The White House specifically pushing back against that language. And I expect they're going to push back against this hard, because it would be highly inappropriate, at the very least, for the president to say to the FBI director, \"I hope you can let this go and move on.\" At the worst, it could be obstruction of justice. And we all know where that could lead. So the White House is behind closed doors right now. The communications staff deep in a meeting. It's in the Roosevelt Room. So I think it's probably with some other high-level officials at the White House, trying to figure out a way to get past this latest one, which occurs just as the White House is in the middle of this other maelstrom over the president's meeting with Lavrov from Russia last week and what he told him during that meeting.

That Comey was concerned about what the president was up to and wrote himself detailed notes after every time they met. Now, don't forget. The president last week sent a warning shot across Comey's bow to say, \"Before you start leaking anything, you better consider yourself -- concern yourself with whether or not there are any, quote, 'tapes' of our meetings.\" We're talking about a White House Oval Office meeting here. And we all remember that one president famously taped all of his private conversations. The White House has refused to say whether there's any kind of recording system in the Oval Office.

President Trump is defiance in the wake of the report, tweeting earlier that he has an, quote, absolute right to share facts with Russia. National security adviser H.R. McMaster drove that point home further today."

What I'm saying is really the premise of that article is false, that in any way the president had a conversation it was inappropriate or that resulted in any kind of lapse in national security.

Rex Tillerson was in the room. This meeting was attended by five people. Dina Powell as well was there. And this happened six days ago. Now all of a sudden someone leaks at the real story here is who's leaking to the press and what they think is important information, primarily to hurt Donald Trump? Primarily to say Trump's not doing things right. This was a discussion surrounding a common enemy, a common foe, ISIS, it was an aviation risk that Donald Trump said, hey, look, we have some intel on what ISIS is planning to do. Don't forget. Russia lost a jetliner in 2015, 227 souls died in that. There are common fights against ISIS. I think this was a lot to do about nothing, but you watch the mainstream media they're is freaking out about it."

But I'm kind of with Eric on this, I'm kind of over the politics, and ultimately it's our national security that is at risk when these types of leaks continue to occur. Eric, there were five people in this room, so I am very concern while I'll be watching the president in the White House on the fallout of that. I also want to know, we've got to figure out who this leak is, with that small of number of people in the room, this is getting out of control, and we're ultimately going to pay the price for it."

But if you get to the heart of it, the heart of this was, President Trump believes that Russia is an important ally in this sense, they both want to destroy ISIS. And he wants to make sure that they get a leg up in that fight. Just by the way, as President Obama before him try to do the same thing on the fight on ISIS. So I think where we all get confused as we say, well, he shouldn't -- how those photos get out? What was the protocol on this one? It was a little sloppy. But in the end, I think the policy is correct, and it reminds everybody what is the Trump policy. The Trump policy is at least trying to get along with Russia if we can. And let's do everything we can to just kill and defeat ISIS."

If this is so important, classified material, sober, serious, and Trump is not, how are these people, the nation's esteemed journalist, high-fiving each other and tweeting that out. Because they're viral count -- the quick count of this went past the access Hollywood camp. That to me say where we are. I think Trump has to tighten up. I think everybody that I know that knows him thinks there has to be more tightness, but I think this was a blunder rather than making it he's treasonous."

I mean, I love you, Joe, but it wasn't that important of a deal. They were pointing out that -- well, if this leak -- you know, Trump turned over some information with an ally, that the ally discovered, that means the ally was no longer going to share information to fight terror or fight ISIS with us. It turns out that I think the Washington Post -- I'm sorry the New York Times and CNN have reported that the information came from an Israeli source. Now, Ryan Dermer, the ambassador, the Israeli ambassador says, quote, Israel has full confidence in our intelligence sharing relationship with the United States and it looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump. So if this isn't much ado about nothing, there's nothing that is."

So that statement, while I appreciate the spirit, it doesn't really tell us anything truthfully because that's what you have to say in this moment in time as a diplomat. So we don't know. They're not confirming or denying whether or not they were the source. But here's to Don."
    },

To your point and to Don's point, there's no doubt that there are people in this country that are just salivating at every moment, every day they wake up and it's a fresh opportunity to impeach Donald J. Trump, and I think that's absolutely has to stop. Because then that undermines the important conversation that we're having at this table about our ally in Israel, about what might chill the effect of this information sharing which is so important because, certainly, their ability to provide us information is critical to them and to us. But we can't even have that conversation effectively because we are too busy worrying about every single little not full of opportunity to impeach President Trump."

I've been critical on occasion, and I think everybody has. But when you go out there, and treason is thrown out, and Mika Brzezinski and all this stuff, then what you do is -- the Trump base, people that call me they get riled up.

That's awful."

Same thing with Comey, should he be gone as FBI director, every Democrat in the senate would have said get rid of him, right? But when they can make politics out of it -- let's look at the White House, some sloppiness around the creation of this meeting. They do have to tighten that up. The idea that they didn't know who had what devices taking photos, that means they could be listening on conversation. We had enough of that with Russia. We don't need more of that. And the next piece of this is, on the personnel side, they've got to fill these slots. They've just got to fill them. We've got to have better staff work done. I know the senate -- the Democrats and the senate are transigen. They want to stop everyone. But part of this is on the White House, too. You've got to fill these slots. The people I know who are in that administration doing great work, love the president, they're just flat out exhausted."

And I agree also, Eboni, with you when you're saying that a lot of people would jump on anything that they see as something to take down Donald Trump. I'm just so confuse. If really the story is, he did say certain things, but it's OK to say them but the premise is wrong, why not come out with that first, instead of saying this is all false, and then coming out the next day and saying the premises false. He did -- some of the stuff is true, but it was OK for him to say it. It was for a common goal."

But then the question of judgment to your concern I think that's a legitimate question. Is it smart to be sharing information our allies are giving us, even if to Matt's point it's the interest of furthering an alliance with Russia on the issue of ISIS. It's just something to consider. Because if Eric and I are friends, right, and we talk and we exchange information, even if it's something that I wouldn't necessarily mind you finding out, Kat, it might do something to my trustworthy of Eric."

You know what, guys, I've just have to let you know. We wanted music in the studio before we started. I was going to push for music, you guys cool with it? Yeah.

My advised to them as a party would say, OK, now is the time -- there are some missteps, some sloppiness, at least as Matt called it, from this White House. You said it's an opportunity. Get in front of issues on -- get an economic message. Get in front of national security. Get in front of, I don't know, criminal justice reform. And actually put together a cohesive message that people can go to the polls and vote for, not just being so afraid and intimidated by Donald Trump."

And I think if you're a Democrat and you're concerned about national security but only if it's a threat that's potentially committed by a Republican, you're not really concerned about national security. You're concerned about taking down Republicans, and that's just the truth. You have to be concern about it on all sides. But that applies to both sides. Republicans, too, and Democrats. But people have had enough of these politics for the sake of politics, which is exactly why they voted for Donald Trump. And if they continue this, they're saying, oh, this is so shocking, this is so shocking. Well, the guy was shocking when he was running, very shocking and he still won.

They all wanted to defeat ISIS. They're the original idea, but we don't have to have the fear the Soviets or the Russians, we've should make nice, and we should all get along. All these policy disagreements they're really not there. So you know when it all comes down to, Donald Trump is not legitimate. Donald Trump -- this was erratic behavior.

Either you care about national security or you don't. We need to get to a point where we care about issues and issues about Russia, particularly. Remember when Mitt Romney said that Russia was our single greatest threat. They were laughing. There were t-shirts mocking him with that on it. Now they decided, oh, yeah, nobody it is.

And people are telling me within the Trump administration they're going to have that ability, which is just frightening. So think about this next step. Why isn't it happening quicker? My guess is we have some pretty smart cyber experts ourselves, and we're messing around with their software and everything else. That's why a lot of those missiles are ending up in the sea.

Whether it's North Korea, whether it's Russia, another country having the ability to hack into our systems, even potentially change votes or, like you said, even in a -- when it comes to military and, you know, DOJ systems, that's a very, very serious thing. And that is the way people are fighting now. We need to make sure that we're secure. We need to make sure we don't play politics with this issue in terms of who's done what or who said what, and all unite around this, because otherwise, it's -- I don't even want to think about it."

That's according to a memo that Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meetings, per The Times. But we have a response now from our John Roberts, sent this to us. I'll read it very quickly, on background. \"While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies and all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.\" Now Eboni, this is breaking news. As we went to break, we heard about it.

On this one, I just love Jim Comey. He goes and has an intimate dinner with the president, and the president brings it up in an interview, and what does Jim Comey do? It's why he isn't going to be the FBI director anymore, because he's a political animal. He had to immediately start leaking about his end of the story. And you know, we just want something better than that in our FBI director. We don't want somebody who's trying to weasel his way into every story, and this is what this sounds like again.

And they're looking at other places to get the facts. It's really the media's own fault. People keep saying fake news. I'm fine with that. But the idea is this.

The people around him were obviously giving him that advice. Now he has cover-his-you-know-what memos so that, if something goes down, he can look like the good guy in the end. He's now going to prosecute Donald Trump in the press, just like he's done Mike Flynn, just like he's done other people who have crossed them. This sounds like the old days of J. Edgar Hoover. It's not what we need as a country. And let's go get somebody good to run the FBI."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, and they've known about it for a while, too, because they had a statement ready to go, which we'll read to you here, the White House response to all of these allegations. Quote, \"While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. The president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies in all investigations. This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.\" What we have not gotten from the White House yet is their side of the story. Well, what did the president say to the director of the FBI? The New York Times says that this was an Oval Office meeting back in February. There were a number of people who were meeting with the president, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions. At the end of that meeting, the president asked everyone to leave except for the FBI director. An according to The New York Times reporting on this Comey memo, the president said something to the effect that Flynn had done nothing wrong, that the FBI should move on. \"I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go.\" The White House specifically pushing back against that language. And I expect they're going to push back against this hard, because it would be highly inappropriate, at the very least, for the president to say to the FBI director, \"I hope you can let this go and move on.\" At the worst, it could be obstruction of justice. And we all know where that could lead. So the White House is behind closed doors right now. The communications staff deep in a meeting. It's in the Roosevelt Room. So I think it's probably with some other high-level officials at the White House, trying to figure out a way to get past this latest one, which occurs just as the White House is in the middle of this other maelstrom over the president's meeting with Lavrov from Russia last week and what he told him during that meeting. You know, somebody's said earlier today at this White House, it just never ends. And you know what? There's credence to that."

      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Hey, John, very quickly. So yesterday about 5:45, we had this other issue that you just brought up, you know, the leak to \"The Washington Post\" regarding the discussion between Lavrov and Trump in the Oval Office from six days ago. Today at 5:30, we get this next one. We did this kind of on the fly. And I've got to ask you, what is this memo? I know The New York Times is reporting on this memo, but this Comey memo, where was it -- who generated -- obviously, he wrote it. But who was he sending it to and how did The Times get it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "I couldn't tell you how \"The Times\" got it. We are searching around, trying to get it ourselves. But it would seem that, according to The New York Times, that James Comey kind of had an idea. This is, again, according to people who were close to Comey, who read The New York Times, the contents of the memo. Because they do not actually have the document itself. That Comey was concerned about what the president was up to and wrote himself detailed notes after every time they met. Now, don't forget. The president last week sent a warning shot across Comey's bow to say, \"Before you start leaking anything, you better consider yourself -- concern yourself with whether or not there are any, quote, 'tapes' of our meetings.\" We're talking about a White House Oval Office meeting here. And we all remember that one president famously taped all of his private conversations. The White House has refused to say whether there's any kind of recording system in the Oval Office. Everyone thought that the president was referring to his dinner with Comey and his discussions with Comey about not being a target of the investigation on the telephone. Bu maybe what the president was referring to was this. We don't know, Eric."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "All right, John Roberts. Thank you very much at the White House. Please let us know, break in again if you have any more breaking news on that. Matt, it strikes me that this happened a while ago. James Comey had the meeting with President Trump. Maybe the rest of the room was excused except for the two of them. He wrote down notes, took these notes and decided to hold onto those. And then, you know, just days after he's been fired, decides to write a memo, kind of a scathing memo that can put Trump in some hot water if true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "So I wrote an article about this this week. I was the person in the Bush administration, one of the people James Comey had to come meet with so he could figure out his political point of view. By the way, let's say he's ambidextrous when it comes to these questions. He's liberal, he's conservative. He's whatever he needs to be. What you realize about Jim Comey, he's really about preserving his own reputation. And what did -- what did Donald Trump do? He did what a president is allowed to do, his prerogative. At the pleasure of the president, he let somebody go. And now Jim Comey is going to prosecute the president for having humiliated him with that decision. Why did -- why are we reading about this memo and learning about it today? Because Jim Comey is striking back. It's how he plays the game, and it's why he did a terrible job politicizing the FBI."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think the political implications, I've been very critical of Comey around how he's politicized this election. And now, yes, he's moving forward as a political animal, absolutely. But let's take it at face value. I think there are questions here about loyalty. A lot of people in America are concerned about President Trump and this issue of loyalty. So this accusation that, you know, Comey was asked to look the other way when it comes to Flynn. And ultimately, in even the statement that we just got from the White House right now, Eric, he ultimately says, you know, \"I think Flynn is a good guy.\" I think that there are people that are very concerned about how far does Donald Trump take loyalty and this issue of loyalty? Does he take it far enough to obstruct justice, as being accused here? We don't know. But I think that's going to be a question that's going to be top of mind as we move this conversation forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, you see how much he turns on anybody who disagrees with him or he feels has treated him unfairly. Again, like you said, this accusation in particular is a very, very extreme one. So I don't know if just his personality is evidence that he could've done this."

    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "But let me read this line again, from the statement from the White House, the White House response. And this is part of it, not the whole thing, but part of it. It says, \"The president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn.\" Dom, I think he very clearly is denying, categorically denying Comey's memo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIORDANO",
      "utterance": "Right. And to your point, if this were that serious, and it is, and it's obstruction of justice, I think if I'm playing the legal eagle here. If he uttered those words to Comey, why wouldn't Comey then have to come out with it at that point? Why wait until now? So the credibility gap, I think, is more here with Comey, if it's these two. And that's all that we'll have. I don't know that anybody can corroborate anything here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think so at all. I think those that hear this today in this moment and are likely to believe it readily, absent evidence around it, it's again going back to this concern of how loyal is Donald J. Trump? How much is loyalty a part of -- and how far he will go around it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I don't think anyone's mind is going to change about any of these situations because of this. People who support Trump are going to say of course Comey was lying. People who want Trump to be fired are going to say, \"No, he wasn't. Of course Trump would do that.\" There's no actual evidence here, so I don't think it's going to change anybody's mind about anything until we actually have something."

But let me just ask a very simple question. If the president is trying to obstruct justice to the FBI director, he never says anything? If the president is asking inappropriate questions of Jim Comey, he still goes over and has dinner with him and yucks it up with him, has a cocktail? Jim Comey shows a strange pattern of behavior if the president was actually pushing him to do something inappropriate. And the own FBI, the FBI itself is saying the White House pushed -- pushed back on nothing. They said they did nothing to try to stop these investigations. So the pattern of behavior shows the exact opposite of what Jim Comey is saying."

I'm kind of feeling it now.\""
