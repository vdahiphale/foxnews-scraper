The Democrats are now 0 for 4 in Congressional special elections for seats vacated by Trump appointees. The Democrats issues were on full display on Tuesday after the GOP netted two wins in special elections in Georgia and South Carolina. This is despite unprecedented spending by liberals. President Trump brought up the Republican victories last night at his rally in Iowa.",

You have to be sure that she's going to fall in order to take the action. But I just don't think Pelosi fundamentally understands America or Americans. And I don't think the Democratic Party is self-aware enough to realize that she cannot be the face of the party because she doesn't play outside of the state of California. She had a nice run.  You know, she took charge in 2006 after the Iraq war went South and after some Republican scandals. And then she pushed through ObamaCare, the stimulus disasters, misread the will of the American people and then she got bounced out in 2010 when the Tea Party wave took over. But according to the latest polling, nearly half of the country believes the Democratic Party has become too extreme. That's up eight points over the last year. And the whole Democratic message under Pelosi is built on fantasy. Free college. Free health care. Russia. So, I don't know how many moral victories the Democrats are going to be able to stomach before they realized it's time to actually start winning. You know, President Trump like to say, you know, we are going to win so much, you are going to be sick of winning. Are the Democrats sick of losing yet? We are not really sure. And I think one of the side effects of Trump derangement syndrome is short-term memory loss.  Because the Democrats have forgot about the issue. The Democrats actually are competitive when they talk about Medicare, college tuition, wages, things of that nature but when they go off on identity politics and Russia, Russia, Russia, they lose the resistance -- it fails. It's not a winning message. And I think actual Democrats in the heartland wish the D.C. Democrats are obsessed over them instead of obsessing over Russia.",

Up to 100,000 North Koreans are sent abroad as essentially slave labor to build, among other things, the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. When the workers return, nearly all their money is taken by the government, which I doubt is spent on eldercare or prenatal nutrition. Obviously, we must pressure banks from handling North Korea's money here and elsewhere and we can do that by punishing everyone involved. We also need countries to stop using these laborers. And we also need to lean on FIFA, which after translation stands for International Federation of Association Football and by football, we mean soccer. It's the soccer organization that benefits from this gross export. North Korea exports bodies, extracts their value and tosses them aside. Now, I know no one is going to cancel the World Cup, especially if the world doesn't exist in 2022. North Korea got its nukes after all, and they got nukes because people pay them to build stadiums. The money paid goes straight to those maniacs who don't use it to feed their citizens, but to build missiles. So what if you started writing to FIFA now, demand that the games not be played on a field created by tormented souls? It may not amount to anything, but it sure beats watching soccer. Actually, I like playing soccer, played it for eight years, but I don't like watching it. Not enough stuff is going on for me, but I do like playing it. By the way, I just want to point out that this morning, it was Otto's funeral in Wyoming in Ohio, it was open to the public but closed for the press. Meanwhile, North Korea is still massing weapons, Jesse, at a testing site. Do you think Donald Trump is planning something?",

And they are worried about a refugee fallout if the regime collapses. Because then, what are they going to do, you know, with all the people coming across the borders and the problems? Much like what we have been kind of seeing, right, in Syria, what's happening there with refugees, and people displaced, when you have this tumultuous activity and different factions fighting. There is a tremendous amount of fallout. And it happens in these bordering countries, they shoulder the burden you know physically and financially, economically. That type of thing. I think sanctions are hugely important, it is part of the overall scheme to try to put pressure on North Korea. I don't think the United States or the world can stand by and allow this for a second longer, that strategy has failed.",

There's also now a whole thing with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus talking about some immigrants that served in the military, but then after they get back, they get deported.

But according to the latest polling, nearly half of the country believes the Democratic Party has become too extreme. That's up eight points over the last year. And the whole Democratic message under Pelosi is built on fantasy. Free college. Free health care. Russia. So, I don't know how many moral victories the Democrats are going to be able to stomach before they realized it's time to actually start winning. You know, President Trump like to say, you know, we are going to win so much, you are going to be sick of winning. Are the Democrats sick of losing yet? We are not really sure. And I think one of the side effects of Trump derangement syndrome is short-term memory loss. Because the Democrats have forgot about the issue. The Democrats actually are competitive when they talk about Medicare, college tuition, wages, things of that nature but when they go off on identity politics and Russia, Russia, Russia, they lose the resistance -- it fails. It's not a winning message. And I think actual Democrats in the heartland wish the D.C. Democrats are obsessed over them instead of obsessing over Russia."

Now, that being the case, believe me, but Republicans are not going to delight in her demise. They want to prop wrap. There's by more Republicans supporting her staying in place. And Chuck Schumer staying in place, and crazy Tom Perez, you know, at the DNC, let them stay. Okay. Those three kings. Like, let them be in their place. Because it's not helping. However, I do think in this case, she's being a little bit scapegoated. The big problem, I will touch on what Jessie said is the Democratic Party.

      "utterance": "All right. As everyone tries to figure out what to do with North Korea, National Review reveals a key fact: The world buys slaves from the place. Up to 100,000 North Koreans are sent abroad as essentially slave labor to build, among other things, the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. When the workers return, nearly all their money is taken by the government, which I doubt is spent on eldercare or prenatal nutrition. Obviously, we must pressure banks from handling North Korea's money here and elsewhere and we can do that by punishing everyone involved. We also need countries to stop using these laborers. And we also need to lean on FIFA, which after translation stands for International Federation of Association Football and by football, we mean soccer. It's the soccer organization that benefits from this gross export. North Korea exports bodies, extracts their value and tosses them aside. Now, I know no one is going to cancel the World Cup, especially if the world doesn't exist in 2022. North Korea got its nukes after all, and they got nukes because people pay them to build stadiums. The money paid goes straight to those maniacs who don't use it to feed their citizens, but to build missiles. So what if you started writing to FIFA now, demand that the games not be played on a field created by tormented souls? It may not amount to anything, but it sure beats watching soccer. Actually, I like playing soccer, played it for eight years, but I don't like watching it. Not enough stuff is going on for me, but I do like playing it. By the way, I just want to point out that this morning, it was Otto's funeral in Wyoming in Ohio, it was open to the public but closed for the press. Meanwhile, North Korea is still massing weapons, Jesse, at a testing site. Do you think Donald Trump is planning something?"

I think what that does is that it shows that Trump is the unpredictable one. Because the last thing that China wants is some sort of destabilizing strike on the north to create downward migration pressure on their borders. They don't want that at all. So I think that is going to motivate the Chinese to do something. Mattis and Tillerson are over there meeting with their counterparts. The South Korean president is gong to meet with Trump next week. I think, you know, there are some things you can do, still import tariffs that we can do. China has to crackdown on some cyber situations, on money laundering.

And they are worried about a refugee fallout if the regime collapses. Because then, what are they going to do, you know, with all the people coming across the borders and the problems? Much like what we have been kind of seeing, right, in Syria, what's happening there with refugees, and people displaced, when you have this tumultuous activity and different factions fighting. There is a tremendous amount of fallout. And it happens in these bordering countries, they shoulder the burden you know physically and financially, economically. That type of thing. I think sanctions are hugely important, it is part of the overall scheme to try to put pressure on North Korea. I don't think the United States or the world can stand by and allow this for a second longer, that strategy has failed."

Last week, he signed the order allowing dreamers to stay, but their parents could be deported. It continues to be messy. There's also now a whole thing with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus talking about some immigrants that served in the military, but then after they get back, they get deported. They tried to reach out to the president on that. So the window for comprehensive immigration reform is closing pretty quickly. And specially after the summer, they move on to tax reform.
