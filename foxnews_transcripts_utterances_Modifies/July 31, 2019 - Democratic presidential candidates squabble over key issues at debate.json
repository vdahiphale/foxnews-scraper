We know Medicare for all will result in doctors being paid less. Hospitals being paid less. Procedures being paid less. Long waiting lines to see specialists and more pressure on a system especially primary care. So let's apply this. Let's do education for all. Not cancelling the debt because that only hurts the banks. But let's say free education for all. That would apply to professors, right?  The left. They would have longer hours, they would have lower pay, they'll have more red tape, and there'd be no funding for all of their precious research because there wouldn't be any money. So if you applied Medicare for all into an area where you can't demonize the person like a doctor, but like, oh, the poor professors, they would run screaming. They'd have their pitchforks if they knew where they could buy them at the hardware store.",

I couldn't even understand half of their plans. They don't make any sense at all. Tim Ryan made the best point I think of everybody. These unions have negotiated these amazing healthcare plan, Cadillac plans they're so good.  They have their own name. Why would you rip those away? And not only that, and then give them to illegal immigrants? It makes no sense politically and as a policy, and Warren totally out of touch. I don't know about you guys, but I like my healthcare. I go to the doctor. I check in.  I give a $5 co-pay. He tells me I'm fine. I leave. I do no paperwork.  It's great. And 180 million Americans feel that way. Only 27 million Americans do not have health insurance right now. Let's focus on them instead of tearing the whole system down. And Bernie, he thinks making a profit is evil. I don't know what he's talking about.  So many great things have been done through Aetna, Blue Cross and Blue Shield. I don't think these are evil companies. I think these are good companies that need to bring costs down. And there's ways to do that without destroying a great system. Trump can exploit this divide within the Democratic Party, and it's a gift because the Republicans -- I'm not really sure what their healthcare plan is, but the Democrats are making it so easy to exploit by offering up this socialist utopia that makes no sense and does remove healthcare from a lot of people."

It stops at Medicare for all, and then once you get into the iceberg below it, it's so obvious that as the cost came out today, the $3.2 trillion, it's not worth it. It takes away choice from people.  It ignores the fact that everything has a cost and somewhere it has to be absorbed. So if it's not you absorbing it, then it's a business absorbing it which means that you're fielding the cost later, etcetera. So once -- again, I think it's just that kind of overarching approach that they're taking.

We know Medicare for all will result in doctors being paid less. Hospitals being paid less. Procedures being paid less. Long waiting lines to see specialists and more pressure on a system especially primary care. So let's apply this. Let's do education for all. Not cancelling the debt because that only hurts the banks. But let's say free education for all. That would apply to professors, right?  The left. They would have longer hours, they would have lower pay, they'll have more red tape, and there'd be no funding for all of their precious research because there wouldn't be any money. So if you applied Medicare for all into an area where you can't demonize the person like a doctor, but like, oh, the poor professors, they would run screaming.

Biden is caught now because he's been called Sleepy Joe and he has to remain calm under attack, but he won't be, he'll overcompensate and spaz out. And then also Biden has to be disciplined and perfect yet, it wasn't the reasons he's so liked is because he's imperfect and undisciplined. So, that's a catch 22 there. But ultimately, you just saw we got some new opposition research dropped. There is a report from Fox News that Kamala Harris accepted $5000 in donation from Donald Trump in 2011 at the height of Trump's birther innuendo. So, let's see if that's going to come up."

I think we are going to see a really strong Kamala, because this is where she's defending her championship essentially and where she needs to be strong and where I assume we will see her be strong is defending her health care plan and being specific about it, defending her criminal justice record which as a Californian I would have a ton of questions about her flip flopping and I hope the debate moderator goes deep enough on that. And also seeing whether she has kind of that presidential level command of everything. And I think on Biden, we hopefully will see him, his reaction to how is he going to bridge the civil war. How is he going to unify the party? How is he going to be the complete package that up until now we have not seen one from the Democratic Party at all?"
