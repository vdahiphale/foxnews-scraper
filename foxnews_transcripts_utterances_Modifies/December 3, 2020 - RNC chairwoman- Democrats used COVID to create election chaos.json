She even participated in the governor's panel with all of the people who actually are governors during the DNC. So, Stacey Abrams has spent the last couple of years not only casting doubt on the result of the elections that she lost, but also working furiously to change the system in Georgia in ways that she hopes will drive up votes for Democrats, and it worked in the national election this time around. So this week we learned though that one of the groups that she helped to launch, called the new Georgia project, is one of the groups that is under investigation now by the Secretary of State, who is looking for any instances of groups that try to register out-of-state, or dead voters to vote in the presidential election, this is a state where the President lost to the Former Vice President Joe Biden by two tenths of 1 percent, very, very slim margins. So, you can bet that for both sides, they know that every vote is going to count and matter a lot in this Georgia Senate race, so President Trump is heading there. He will be there on Saturday for a rally for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue as they content those Senate races. In many ways, the leaders of the turnout machine in Georgia, is going to be President Trump and Stacey Abrams. That is why today, the Trump side sort of began to turn the way they were looking at these two so-called advocates of the Presidents fight for the election. Attorneys at Lin Wood and Sidney Powell have been telling Republicans in Georgia on the ground not to vote on January 5th or before, when voting starts.",

That's going through the process. But if Georgia Republicans and conservatives do not show up and vote, then there is no way that we keep these seats, and that is what has got to happen. Because I do not want to see Chuck Schumer become the leader in the Senate, in which we don't have just a change in the Senate, we have a reversion in the Senate. You want to see the tax cuts go away. You want to see these legislative victories that the President has made.

But also, I have to say Martha, while we are doing this people cannot give up on the system because right now, we have got to turn our voters back out. Now if Stacey Abrams has never conceded the governor's race, I don't know if I can call her a Former Governor, but here's the problem she had. She worked actually to try and weaken these standards. She actually got in the consent decree that was signed by the State of Georgia into the state that actually weakened this. But also, they actually went out and encourage their voters to use the absentee ballot system to make it work. That is what we saw here.

Also, in Georgia, you have - at least we take this out, we have - once they are separated from the envelope, the ballot doesn't have a mark on it they would identify it back to the actual signature.

KATIE PAVLICH, townhall.com NEWS EDITOR: Well, I think that there is a big risk to some of the language and strategy of some of the folks who have been down in Georgia trying to sort out some of the things that have gone on that are completely valid, but this idea that if you think that the President won Georgia, and you believe that he is going to still win the White House, why would you then decide that you are going to saddle him with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic house, where he would be unable. And really not capable of standing up in a big way against big policy agenda items the left has been pushing, and they need a Democratic Senate - a Democratic run Senate to get it through. Why would you want him to have to deal with that, rather than dealing with Republican Senate that has been so crucial to his legacy over the last four years? And also, if you want to protect his legacy, you want Republicans to win in Georgia. You don't want Chuck Schumer going in and rewinding the clock on a number of policy initiatives that the President has put forward during his time in the White House.",

And I think the only way Republicans if you look at history, they tend to do well, Doug Collins mentioned this, the Congressman just a moment ago. Republicans historically do very well in this runoff election in Georgia. The way they can lose is if the Democrats are united, which they are, and Republicans are at each other's throats and divided. And even if you get, because I am hearing from people on the ground, who are plugged in that race, they are saying it is a very close race, both of them. Perdue and Loeffler had very tight races on their hands. It just takes a small sliver of Trump supporters and Republican voters to say it's not worth it, it's not worth my time, the whole thing is rigged I'm not going to participate. If they sit out, that is the path to victory for the Democratic Party. They know it, which is why they are stoking these fires. And by the way, as you mentioned, Lin Wood, that attorney who is pretending, at least, to be, or putting himself out there as a big Trump supporter, he is a two-time Barack Obama donor. He donated against David Perdue's Democratic opponent last time. He has voted in Democratic primaries.

So, this is important to point out, these are actual ballots that were cast, 2,468 votes by voters that legally change their address to another state or another country, approximately 42,000 voters who voted twice in Nevada. 1500 voters who were listed as deceased by the social security administration.

She even participated in the governor's panel with all of the people who actually are governors during the DNC. So, Stacey Abrams has spent the last couple of years not only casting doubt on the result of the elections that she lost, but also working furiously to change the system in Georgia in ways that she hopes will drive up votes for Democrats, and it worked in the national election this time around. So this week we learned though that one of the groups that she helped to launch, called the new Georgia project, is one of the groups that is under investigation now by the Secretary of State, who is looking for any instances of groups that try to register out-of-state, or dead voters to vote in the presidential election, this is a state where the President lost to the Former Vice President Joe Biden by two tenths of 1 percent, very, very slim margins. So, you can bet that for both sides, they know that every vote is going to count and matter a lot in this Georgia Senate race, so President Trump is heading there. He will be there on Saturday for a rally for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue as they content those Senate races. In many ways, the leaders of the turnout machine in Georgia, is going to be President Trump and Stacey Abrams. That is why today, the Trump side sort of began to turn the way they were looking at these two so-called advocates of the Presidents fight for the election. Attorneys at Lin Wood and Sidney Powell have been telling Republicans in Georgia on the ground not to vote on January 5th or before, when voting starts."

So then, we saw this tweet from the Trump war room, saying, \"Lin Wood has for decades voted for and donated to Democrats, including Barack Obama and David Perdue's 2014 opponent, then Newt Gingrich, support of the President, chimed in, \"Lin Wood and Sidney Powell are totally destructive, every Georgia conservative who cares about America must vote in a runoff.

So, we've got to have everybody turn out. There are issues with the election. I respect everybody - I will be the one who is fighting, as others fighting for this. We are filing suits. That's going through the process. But if Georgia Republicans and conservatives do not show up and vote, then there is no way that we keep these seats, and that is what has got to happen. Because I do not want to see Chuck Schumer become the leader in the Senate, in which we don't have just a change in the Senate, we have a reversion in the Senate. You want to see the tax cuts go away. You want to see these legislative victories that the President has made. Then you've got to let David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, because if we don't, then it's a voter say - for Trump voters, it is a vote not to keep what Trump has done. We've got to make that clear.

The issues now is that we are seeing the signature ballots, we are asking still for an audit, I know that the governor has asked for that, but also at the same point in time, when you are actually now putting the pressure on to make sure these things are happen, we need to make sure that the election office and Secretary of State are making these fair elections. But also, I have to say Martha, while we are doing this people cannot give up on the system because right now, we have got to turn our voters back out. Now if Stacey Abrams has never conceded the governor's race, I don't know if I can call her a Former Governor, but here's the problem she had. She worked actually to try and weaken these standards. She actually got in the consent decree that was signed by the State of Georgia into the state that actually weakened this. But also, they actually went out and encourage their voters to use the absentee ballot system to make it work. That is what we saw here. So, for Republicans, it is time for us to also get back out and make sure that every vote that we have gets out to vote, if they can get to the polls, we won at the polls, if not then we do it."

And that is what the Democrats have asked for because for people and what we did see is we saw a lot of people who had never voted in a long time actually use the absentee process. Look the governor can call a special session in the general assembly could with three fifths votes. They don't have three fifths votes. The governor could call his excuse and reason for not calling a special session was, it no matter what they pass, it would not be effective for this campaign because he believes the courts would strike him down. Now that is his reason for not doing it, there's a lot of people, though, they want to see this actually taken out. That is why we have lawsuits going on, that's what we having to see if we can get this work. But tight now, it is imperative that we take what we have been given and have turn out to be the key in this race. And Georgia, it has always been the issue for Republicans turning on special elections. We have always done well on that.

Also, in Georgia, you have - at least we take this out, we have - once they are separated from the envelope, the ballot doesn't have a mark on it they would identify it back to the actual signature. So once they are separated, it makes it even harder. These are things that have to be corrected, but right now, there are also things that have to deal with in this next election."

And really not capable of standing up in a big way against big policy agenda items the left has been pushing, and they need a Democratic Senate - a Democratic run Senate to get it through. Why would you want him to have to deal with that, rather than dealing with Republican Senate that has been so crucial to his legacy over the last four years? And also, if you want to protect his legacy, you want Republicans to win in Georgia. You don't want Chuck Schumer going in and rewinding the clock on a number of policy initiatives that the President has put forward during his time in the White House."

The biggest smiles in the room are Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris, the latter of whom would be the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to make the Former Chuck Schumer the majority leader, right? And I think the only way Republicans if you look at history, they tend to do well, Doug Collins mentioned this, the Congressman just a moment ago. Republicans historically do very well in this runoff election in Georgia. The way they can lose is if the Democrats are united, which they are, and Republicans are at each other's throats and divided. And even if you get, because I am hearing from people on the ground, who are plugged in that race, they are saying it is a very close race, both of them. Perdue and Loeffler had very tight races on their hands. It just takes a small sliver of Trump supporters and Republican voters to say it's not worth it, it's not worth my time, the whole thing is rigged I'm not going to participate. If they sit out, that is the path to victory for the Democratic Party. They know it, which is why they are stoking these fires. And by the way, as you mentioned, Lin Wood, that attorney who is pretending, at least, to be, or putting himself out there as a big Trump supporter, he is a two-time Barack Obama donor. He donated against David Perdue's Democratic opponent last time. He has voted in Democratic primaries. I mean, he is stoking the fires that Democrats hope turn into a blaze to burn down the Republicans chances and hand the Senate and the Federal Government completely over to the Democrats.

He is the one who warned in September that mail-in voting was like playing with fire, citing past cases of voter fraud is a result of mass mailing voting, it's not accurate to say that the justice department hasn't looked into this, the U.S. Attorney in Nevada actually looked into that case of the 3000 votes where there are question about residency that ended up being military votes. When Bill Barr is talking about evidence, he is talking about evidence that has to miscible in court that can presented to a judge or a even a jury with no reasonable doubt and be proven in court. Bill Barr is not saying that there aren't some irregularities, that there may be evidence of very suspicious situations which we've seen all over the country that continue, but he is talking about evidence that his attorneys, U.S. Attorneys and prosecutors, can bring to a judge in a court and prove, and they are continuing to look at cases that continue to come in, but they have to build a case on these things, which they have been unable to do."

He says, well, talk to me in a few weeks. It should not be outcome oriented. Either Bill Barr is doing a good job as Attorney General or he is not, and that does not depend on whether or not some magical evidence is conjured by Barr and the DOJ. I think, as Katie said, that is an unfair characterization."

It says that we have almost 8,000 ballots cast by voters with addresses that are physically nonexistent in Nevada, approximately 15,000 votes registered to vacant - or commercial voters registered to vacant or commercial properties that cast ballots. So, this is important to point out, these are actual ballots that were cast, 2,468 votes by voters that legally change their address to another state or another country, approximately 42,000 voters who voted twice in Nevada. 1500 voters who were listed as deceased by the social security administration. Almost 20,000 Nevada voters with a non-Nevada mailing address, and about 6,000 USPS flags on vacant addresses of votes that were cast in the election that - we haven't seen those, but that is what they are saying is the evidence that was submitted. What do you think about this Nevada case, and it is a different than what we have seen so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, Martha, if you total all of that, it means Donald Trump will win Nevada. If you have 42,000 voters double voting, including people voting from abandoned residences and casting votes, we've had staff on the ground, knocking doors, and actually collecting this evidence, and running against our data. And I do think it is important that we get to the bottom of this, especially with Nevada and the law changes they put in place before this election, which we sued them for doing. We lost in court because they codified it into law, but they absolutely try to make it the most porous election, so everybody got a ballot, so that anybody could vote, whether you live there or not, they did not check their voter rolls, and this is what you are getting, chaos on the back end, and I think it is good that we called this to attention and we make sure that we don't let this happen again. And I'm glad it's in the court, and the rest of the country needs to pay attention to what is happening in Nevada."

There was a piece today in \"The Federalist\" and it was entitled \"were insecure voting processes this year's insurance policy\" for Democrats, election tampering happened in plain sight it consisted of demanding and getting a chaotic mess of constantly changing voter rules, layered atop early in person and mail-in voting that started long before election day. I would imagine you agree with that take."

    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",

I was saying that when it was happening back in August, when they were just sending live ballots to people who do not live at the address that they were sending it to. You know, Martha, there are things that ensure a safe and fair election. A person actually requesting a ballot is part of that, and Democrats stripped that away. Voter ID laws, signature verification, changing the settings on the machine in Nevada, what they did in Georgia in the do consent decree, and what's hard for us at the RNC and the Trump campaign is these were codified into law, legislatures were called into special sessions and laws were changed by governors, 30, 60, 80 days out from an election. There is nothing unconstitutional about that, but it absolutely wreaks chaos in the selection and why so many Republicans feel something happened with this election that was not right. And you should not have a 45-day election or a two month election, there is an election day for a reason, and this election is proving that and Democrats used COVID to create chaos."

And you know and you make an interesting point because - and that is why I think it is very difficult to get anywhere in this fight, in a lot of ways, and perhaps why the attorney general looks at the legislation that you talked about and says, you know what, they change the rules. It might be - you know, it might have been sneaky, but it's not illegal. And so that raises the question, I interviewed Brad Parscale the other day, and he suggested that we wanted to have a day of election teams in place all across the country, an army of people who are watching this process very closely, and he said that it didn't happen the way it was planned to happen. What do you say to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I love Brad, but I disagree with him on that, because I worked with Justin Clark at the campaign who put that together, and there were hundreds of people in Detroit and Philadelphia and Maricopa County. When I am talking about with Nevada, when they change the setting on the machine that happened months earlier, we sued against that, and we lost. Pennsylvania, we took it to the Supreme Court, we lost. So, some of these things were done by legislators and Democrats changing laws on the fly and using COVID as an excuse. And Georgia, those are Republicans who did that and they weaken their election process, but it's hard for parties or candidates to sue when it is codified by legislative authorities, and that is the problem that we have, but I will tell you, they weakened our system, they made it porous, and they allowed room for fraud, and this is what we are seeing across the country."

And if people down there who are saying whether they are working on behalf of the President are saying don't keep the Senate, shame on them. We have to do both.

So far, it looks like the intensive care units in four of the states five regions will fall into that category. That means the majority of California is looking at a lockdown for the next three weeks. Newsom also says they plan to implement more strict rules on community gatherings and in person shopping, as well, and they will also limit restaurants and take out -- to take out delivery only, so some changes afoot in California tonight. So, Kentucky's attorney general and a private Christian school filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court trying to overturn an order from Kentucky's governor that shut down all in-person learning at K through 12 schools in the states at the end of November, including private religious schools due to COVID-19. Kentucky's A.G. writing this. In Kentucky, one can work out at the gym, attend a wedding, send his or her child to day care or preschool, college students can attend classes, but all of the Kentucky's religious schools are shuttered. Now, Justice Brett Kavanaugh is asking Kentucky's governor, Democrat Andy Beshear to respond to the high court by 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

I know parents all across the commonwealth who, in exercising their right to free religion here in the commonwealth, are sending their children to private Christian schools, and the governor has infringed upon that right.

Dr. Fauci talked about the importance of the developmental aspects of being back in school. We wholeheartedly agree with that. Again, I know parents all across the commonwealth send their children to religiously affiliated schools, not only so they can learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also so that they can learn about the values of faith that are intertwined with the curriculum."

But it's very interesting to me that the Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said while we all want to get our kids back to in-person instruction, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recognize that doing so now would endanger the health and lives of Kentucky children, educators, and families, which is absolutely the opposite of what we have seen in two very significant medical studies from JAMA and also from the Lancet, which we have also heard now backed up by Dr. Anthony Fauci and many others.

      "utterance": "So, before I let you go, I want to ask you about this. Because obviously, you are involved with the Breonna Taylor case as the attorney general of Kentucky. The mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, where that happened, Greg Fischer, now says this. Our systems are more than broken, they must be dismantled and replaced. That's why I'm announcing today that I'm signing an executive order declaring racism a public health crisis in Louisville. What's your reaction to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMERON",
      "utterance": "Well, I know the mayor, and I recognize that he has put forth that declaration, but I want to get past talk in our respective communities and make sure that we are finding justice. We had a pretty significant case. It is important for the attorney general to make sure that we are marrying the law with the facts. That's what I think most folks expect out of their prosecutors. That's what we tried to do in that case. I have complete confidence in our justice system. Obviously, there are always challenges, and we have to build a more perfect union, and I look forward to being part of any productive conversation about some of the challenges we have here in the country."

      "utterance": "So, throughout the Russia investigation, Adam Schiff was adamant that the special prosecutor must be protected. Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, can ever be allowed to fire Robert Mueller. He said. So, what does Trey Gowdy make of his latest 180-degree turn, suggesting that now John Durham should not be protected, in fact, it's time to fire him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "This week, Attorney General Bill Barr announced that he appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham as special counsel in the investigation into the Russia probe that Durham was already leading. The move gives Durham extra protection from being fired by the Biden administration. House intel committee chairman Adam Schiff quickly jumping to criticize that move by Barr."

      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA)",
      "utterance": "The appointment is not consistent with the language of the statute that he's relying on and can be rescinded I think by the next attorney general. I would presume the next attorney general will look to see whether there is any merit to the work that John Durham is doing and make a rational decision about whether that should continue at any level."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "SCHIFF",
      "utterance": "We had to take up this bill in the last week of the session and make sure Mueller is protected so that we don't have to wonder what happens in the kind of constitutional crisis that would follow a fast or slow- moving Saturday night massacre."

      "utterance": "What do you make of Adam Schiff's shifting opinion on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "You know, Martha, he spent his entire career, what's left of it, on this Russia collusion. Remember he told us, he promised us he had evidence, more than circumstantial but not direct, remember when he said that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I mean, lay aside the fact there is no category of evidence like the one he described, but that's what he said. He told us there was no FISA abuse. Remember, he belittled Devin Nunes and Kash Patel and others who wrote the Nunes memo. He even told us it was likely the president would go to jail based on colluding with Russia. So far, the House and Senate intelligence committees have debunked what Schiff said. Mueller debunked it, and Michael Horowitz, the inspector general. So of course, the last thing he wants is one more person to remind us of just how tragically wrong Adam Schiff has been. And I don't think it is lost on the Democrats, either, Martha. I mean, you and I have a better chance of being appointed to that vacant California Senate seat than he does. No one is talking about him for that. He has not been talked about for CIA director, ODNI. I mean, I think even the Democrats are tired of the charade of Adam Schiff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's a good point. You know, when you look at the sort of the difference in the way he handled it, and what Bill Barr is trying to do to protect Durham at this point, you know, how do you see all of this playing out? And everybody has a bottom line, basic question about, where is the Durham investigation at this point? Which we now learned is pretty much narrowly defined to crossfire hurricane, and it's an FBI investigation, no longer CIA or any agency investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I mean, honestly, I can't imagine anyone, any reasonable minded person that doesn't want to know, look, this thing our country went through for four years, what were the factual origin? I can't imagine anyone would not want to know, we give law enforcement incredible powers, wouldn't you want to know whether or not they are good stewards of that power? I mean, John Durham is a career prosecutor. He is a straight arrow. So, if the facts are there, great. Tell us if they're not there. That's great too. Tell us. But the notion that we have something to fear from a career prosecutor providing oversight over DOJ, the FBI, and essentially the surveillance of a political campaign, the only thing Adam is worried about is that it will be now five people that tell him he is wrong, as opposed to the four that already exist."

They came from very humble beginnings. Frank, even more so than Reg. Frank used to say to me to me when we first met, he said, you know, people say that they thought I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, he goes, Kathie, we didn't have spoon.

In this book, I talk about partnering with God for your entire life, basically womb to the tomb to beyond. And it's --I am not a fan of religion. People think I'm just so religious. I am the least religious person you will ever meet, but I love the living God with all my heart, and I want to know Him better, and I want to walk purposely with Him every day, and I don't want to waste a moment of it. It was Paul Newman, there was a story that I tell in the book, who told me if you have a pulse, you got a purpose, and you have to understand the whole context of THE STORY to understand what I say it, but that stayed with me. And then when I held my husband, who had passed on just a few moments before, and I found him gone, but gone to glory, the look, this was his look, and I said, my God, he saw Jesus, and Jesus took his breath away. And I rejoice. I'm holding him. I'm sobbing, but it wasn't tears of anguish, I was rejoicing with him, and that's what I tried to explain to Regis two weeks before he died."
