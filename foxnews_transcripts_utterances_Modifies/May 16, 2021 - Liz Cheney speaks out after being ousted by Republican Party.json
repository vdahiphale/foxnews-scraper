In the hearing earlier this week, she was asked about kids attending summer camp and said she was going to keep her own vaccine-eligible son from going to summer camp when most of the activities are presumably outside.

President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel basically created alliances. They negotiated the so-called Abraham Accords. They created alliances through the Middle East with a focus on defeating Iran, stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions. But as a consequence, decades of negotiations focused on a two-state solution, which has been U.S. policy across party lines forever. That effort, that two state solution paradigm was abandoned and I think consequently we are now in a dynamic where the Palestinians very much feel isolated, voiceless. I think that you have seen the Palestinian Authority, the Fatah, undermined in that dynamic while Hamas, the most radical and extreme faction in the Palestinian segment, now is elevated and they feel like they are free to fight. Meanwhile, Israel feels unbound in terms of responding because they are no longer in that two-state dynamic. So this is a very dangerous situation. I was so impressed by Trey Yingst reporting there.

If you look at what Hamas was trying to do, Hamas was poised to do well in elections there. You had the Palestinian Authority, I think, stepping up to show that it too could be tough, could take the fight to Israelis, in anticipation of a court ruling. We hadn't even had the court ruling yet. So you had in this internal dynamic amongst Palestinians, this effort to look like they were tough, like they were taking the fight to the Israelis. Look, I think the Israelis have no choice but to respond and respond in a pretty significant fashion when you have 1,500 rockets, as Jen Psaki said. I've been interested by the Biden administration's response to this. It's been pretty straightforward and pretty favorable to the Israelis I think given what -- given the tense relationship that we saw between Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu. Remember Biden didn't see or talk to Netanyahu early in the administration.",

The problem with that is that neither are they. You look at the things that they've been saying and doing in the time since they -- this came up again, they're the ones elevating Donald Trump and putting him front and center again. You had Elise Stefanik give interviews to podcasts in which she talked, you know, sort of raised again these election conspiracies and -- and got behind Donald Trump on those. You had Kevin McCarthy go on Sean Hannity the other night and talk about how virile Donald Trump is because he doesn't require a lot of sleep. You had the NRSC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, sending out 112 emails mentioning Donald Trump since April 24th.

CATHERINE LUCEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, certainly, Chris, President Biden is well aware of the optics of, you know, rising gas prices. You know, he was in the Senate himself when then President Jimmy Carter dealt with a gas shortage. And what we saw this week was the White House move really aggressively to manage and to message this. You know, as you saw with the cabinet secretary there, we saw a lot of officials out talk about this, efforts to calm nerves. They took a variety of efforts to try and, you know, get fuel out, ease shortages around the country and the president himself addressing it as the pipeline came back online. I think what you also saw this week was an executive order from the president that aimed to deal with improving the federal government's response to cybersecurity. You know, obviously, that's -- you know, those agencies. But there is a hope that that will, you know, increase efforts in the private sector as well. And then also the president is really seizing on this moment to, you know, promote his infrastructure proposal and his infrastructure plans, you know, arguing that this is a moment to invest in infrastructure and you're going to see him keep pushing on that this week as well as he tries to negotiate with Republicans on those plans.",

Then there are other groups, both Russian government directed and affiliated with the Russian government that conduct these kinds of attacks, more damaging attacks rather than ransomware attacks, where the Russian government has an active hand. It's plausible to me that the Russian government wouldn't have known in advance exactly what these groups were doing, but you still had to answer those questions and the United States should still insist the Russian government stepped down, clamp down on these groups who are conducting their attacks, who are operating from their territory, particularly in the context of the diplomatic back and forth about the SolarWinds hacks.",

Things in this pandemic are starting to turn around. And what's also happening is we're getting data, evolving data, on the science. Just last Thursday, we -- there were two papers that were published in The New England Journal, and then just Friday, this past Friday, there was a large study that was published in the MMWR.

Deaths per day are still more than 600. And almost two-thirds of Americans are still not fully vaccinated.

Please go get vaccinated or continue to wear your mask. The vaccine is now available to over 90 percent of Americans within five miles.

That we have new guidance and new science, really, that informs that guidance that allows us to be able to say vaccinated people can take off their masks. Certainly there's a lot of virus circulating in other areas of the world and we do need to be cautious about new variants that might emerge there, might emerge here.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch\"; Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for \"The Wall Street Journal\"; and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams. Steve, it's easy to second-guess both the CDC and the Biden administration for either moving too slowly or too fast and it's changing guidance during evolving situation, but how fair do you think the criticism is of the CDC, especially this week?"

      "utterance": "Well, Chris, as you point out, it's difficult, if you're the CDC, you have to continue to update the guidance and you have to continue to follow the science. You heard Dr. Walensky say today that she's just following science and providing this information as quickly as possible. I think the challenge for the CDC is that's not what's been happening. She's been late to updating the science. She hasn't been following the signs. In the hearing earlier this week, she was asked about kids attending summer camp and said she was going to keep her own vaccine-eligible son from going to summer camp when most of the activities are presumably outside. That's just where people's heads are at this point. And if you get to the point where the U.S. public is not paying attention to the CDC because it's so late in arriving to common sense solutions based on the science, then I think you really do have a problem."

Or do you think they feel the public, in the end, it's just going to focus on the fact it's good news, we are making progress on the pandemic, and those people who are fully vaccinated can take their masks off?"

      "speaker": "CATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",

As you said earlier, they had the president out in the Rose Garden maskless, you know, to talk about this as a step forward and I think you're going to hear more from them on that. They really believe that his biggest mandate is to show progress on the pandemic, to show Americans that he's moving forward with the vaccination campaign with reopening. But certainly, there are challenges ahead. They are facing criticism at the city and the state level from some key unions and as Dr. Walensky said, they still have to update other key pieces of guidance around schools and children and other parts of American life. So you're going to continue to hear from them on that and I think you are going to continue to hear from them trying to frame this and promote this as a positive."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Chris, I think the ground has shifted in that Israeli-Palestinian dynamic over the last few years. President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel basically created alliances. They negotiated the so-called Abraham Accords. They created alliances through the Middle East with a focus on defeating Iran, stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions. But as a consequence, decades of negotiations focused on a two-state solution, which has been U.S. policy across party lines forever. That effort, that two state solution paradigm was abandoned and I think consequently we are now in a dynamic where the Palestinians very much feel isolated, voiceless. I think that you have seen the Palestinian Authority, the Fatah, undermined in that dynamic while Hamas, the most radical and extreme faction in the Palestinian segment, now is elevated and they feel like they are free to fight. Meanwhile, Israel feels unbound in terms of responding because they are no longer in that two-state dynamic. So this is a very dangerous situation. I was so impressed by Trey Yingst reporting there. That seems to me to be an explosive situation that could get dangerously worse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Steve, I want to pick up on that because there is some domestic politics here. Hamas is clearly trying to show Palestinians once again that they are fighting for their cause as opposed to the more establishment Palestinian Fatah Party. There's also domestic politics in Israel because Benjamin Netanyahu was just on the verge of losing his position to an opposition coalition. How big a role do you think Netanyahu and Hamas feel to fight this out right now from a domestic politics point of view?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it's a very good point. I think this whole thing in a sense started because of domestic politics within the Palestinian side. If you look at what Hamas was trying to do, Hamas was poised to do well in elections there. You had the Palestinian Authority, I think, stepping up to show that it too could be tough, could take the fight to Israelis, in anticipation of a court ruling. We hadn't even had the court ruling yet. So you had in this internal dynamic amongst Palestinians, this effort to look like they were tough, like they were taking the fight to the Israelis. Look, I think the Israelis have no choice but to respond and respond in a pretty significant fashion when you have 1,500 rockets, as Jen Psaki said. I've been interested by the Biden administration's response to this. It's been pretty straightforward and pretty favorable to the Israelis I think given what -- given the tense relationship that we saw between Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu. Remember Biden didn't see or talk to Netanyahu early in the administration."

He is -- he's continuing to affirm, as he said, Israel's right to defend itself, but he is also expressing concern about the loss of life, about death of civilians, of children, and the safety of journalists.

In order for us to be in the strongest possible position to be able to prevail, to be able to defeat the ideas that we see coming from the other side that are really bad for the country, we have to be a party that's based on a foundation of truth.

You know, what he's doing is he's causing people to believe that they can't count on our electoral process to actually convey the will of the people. You know, we have to be a nation of laws.

I mean that is really a key here. We lost the House, the Senate, and the White House while Donald Trump was president.

We know that there were conversations in the Oval Office before this about the possibility of declaring martial law and seizing, you know, election -- and seizing the ballot machines. So I think that -- that all of this really points to why it's so important that we have a commission. You know, we've done that after Pearl Harbor. We did it after the Kennedy assassination. We did it after 9/11. It's a way that we, as a country, come together in a non-partisan fashion to understand what happened, to get to the bottom of it. It must have subpoena power.

You -- you can understand on the one hand why these House members wouldn't want Liz Cheney there because she's not talking only about Joe Biden and, you know, that's the argument they've made. The problem with that is that neither are they. You look at the things that they've been saying and doing in the time since they -- this came up again, they're the ones elevating Donald Trump and putting him front and center again. You had Elise Stefanik give interviews to podcasts in which she talked, you know, sort of raised again these election conspiracies and -- and got behind Donald Trump on those. You had Kevin McCarthy go on Sean Hannity the other night and talk about how virile Donald Trump is because he doesn't require a lot of sleep. You had the NRSC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, sending out 112 emails mentioning Donald Trump since April 24th.

I mean what we've got right now is a full-fledged civil war within the Republican Party. You've got Trump on one side and I think what happened in the last week is that Republicans in the House caucus elevated Liz Cheney as the leader of the rebel forces by excommunicating her.

This is a civil war within the GOP that's going to last certainly through the midterms.

CATHERINE LUCEY, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, certainly, Chris, President Biden is well aware of the optics of, you know, rising gas prices. You know, he was in the Senate himself when then President Jimmy Carter dealt with a gas shortage. And what we saw this week was the White House move really aggressively to manage and to message this. You know, as you saw with the cabinet secretary there, we saw a lot of officials out talk about this, efforts to calm nerves. They took a variety of efforts to try and, you know, get fuel out, ease shortages around the country and the president himself addressing it as the pipeline came back online.

It's plausible to me that the Russian government wouldn't have known in advance exactly what these groups were doing, but you still had to answer those questions and the United States should still insist the Russian government stepped down, clamp down on these groups who are conducting their attacks, who are operating from their territory, particularly in the context of the diplomatic back and forth about the SolarWinds hacks."

It's the national security angle that I think is really difficult because I think it's the new face of war and terrorism, Chris. And the Biden administration has to figure out how to respond. Certainly we have to harden our infrastructure. But also there has to be consequences. You know, we'll see exactly what those consequences will be in terms of sanctions or even military action."
