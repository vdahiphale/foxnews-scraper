Well, a very happy New Year to all of you, it is a brand-New Year but the confusion over COVID coming from the Biden administration it remains the same. America is seeing a spike in cases with the Omicron variant expecting to peak by mid-January. Lines to get a test is exceptionally long, people are being forced to wait hours just to get swabbed and it could take days to get the results. On top of all that, there is no new mixed messaging from the CDC. Last week the agency slashed the isolation period to five days for asymptomatic COVID patients but now that guidance is being directly contradicted.",

Maybe we shouldn't be shutting schools down. Maybe we shouldn't be firing nurses. Maybe vaxxed people can transmit this thing. So, you're seeing a retreat in the war against the virus by the left and they are circling back to where conservatives have been for months if not years. Forget about what they say. Look what they do. AOC flopped to Florida after party in Miami. She didn't go to California. Doesn't seem like AOC is taking Anthony Fauci seriously? Not even Fauci is taking Fauci seriously. He slashed the quarantine time in half because he said we don't want to upset the economy too much. Whoa. That all of a sudden is a consideration? And now the experts are saying, wait a second, masks might not be effective? So, for those people keeping score at home, that's three times they've changed their position on masks. The media is now reframing this thing as a bipartisan menace. You know, it shouldn't be a stigma attached to catch an COVID-19. Shouldn't be ashamed of catching the virus. Thanks, guys. Where has that been? Now MSNBC came out and said this. A flu can still be dangerous but we don't reorient our lives around the flu. That's basically what Donald Trump said two years ago and he was killed for that. CNN just came out with a report today, you know, if you lose weight, it might help beating COVID. I mean, we've known that for what, a year and a half? Where have they been on this? Joe Biden finally said you know what, guys, governors, they're on -- governors are really, they really going to have a lot of work to do here. Isn't that Trump's position? The federal government can help the states? Joe Biden's entire presidency has been a fraud. We were supposed to put this guy in office because he was the one man, the one Democrat who had the compassion to beat this virus. And he threw everything at this thing. Now all of a sudden, he is not the guy? he can't beat this thing? And the same people that push this fraud this lie that he could do it are now saying you know what, can't do it. Everyone is going to get the cron (Ph). We got to live with it. No, we're all getting back to where Florida has been from the jump. Got to be smart, got to be safe and you've got to be free.

I think Fauci really said it best when he was talking about, this was really about how much could we get the public to endure. How much could we get the public to take before they had enough? I think what we are seeing is that they realize that they pushed -- they pushed America pretty far. They can't push it. They can't push us any further. I always go back to the February 1st cut off. That's when it's over. And I'm not going to go after people for changing their minds when they get new information. I would congratulate them on coming around, even though they didn't give up the same best intentions when any of us said -- many of us here at this table or this fantasy table said all of these things. We said that the Omicron was going to be widely contagious but benign and would probably act as a natural, a natural immune booster. We were laughed about that. And that now turns out to be conventionally expert advice. But this is, we had -- we were way ahead of the game on all these things. And people thought we were crazy.

I think they have said that these variants are growing up in unvaccinated communities. And three, we should get tested. Now the administration has a challenge. Dana, I thought you laid it out very clearly right before Christmas about the failures around the testing. And hopefully even if we are to vanish Omicron, which all the experts are saying from whomever you may believe. Dr. Fauci or Dr. Gottlieb, or any of them, they believe that we are near the end of it. I hope the administration will continue to invest in a testing regime largely because Doctors Redfield and Admiral Giroir all believe that we are going to need that going forward. I hope the people who have made mistakes along the way admit that they have made mistakes, whether they are friends of ours, people we support or people we don't support.

They all know that this is happening. More research is going to come out that shows that this was so harmful to them from suicide rates to plunging test scores. The inability for them to get back on track. And you know, the teachers complained that there are behavioral problems in the classroom. Really? You think so? Because you kept them out of school for a year and half. And just recently there was a big article in the New York Times that really puffed-up Randi Weingarten and said that she, as the head of the teachers union, was very much trying to keep kids in school. But then as the judge pointed out, we have the actual e-mails from the CDC and the school district that then went to the White House, that basically said teachers wanted to keep schools close.

But I would encourage Mayor Lightfoot and others, one of the things that's best for kids, put aside the electoral politics for one moment, is to find ways to get teachers and students back in school and for us to be competitive against China, we have to continue to educate our kids and at a minimum help them catch up from the year they missed last year.

America is seeing a spike in cases with the Omicron variant expecting to peak by mid-January. Lines to get a test is exceptionally long, people are being forced to wait hours just to get swabbed and it could take days to get the results.

You know, we've got -- we have Fauci saying, OK, you know, we now have, we can do this in five days instead of 10 days. You can quarantine as long as you don't have any of the symptoms. But before you come out of quarantine, you've got to make sure you take a test. Now if you take the PCR test, chances are for up to 12 weeks it's going to say you still have it even if you don't have it, and if you take a rapid test, we are not sure the rapid test even works.

Maybe we shouldn't be shutting schools down. Maybe we shouldn't be firing nurses. Maybe vaxxed people can transmit this thing. So, you're seeing a retreat in the war against the virus by the left and they are circling back to where conservatives have been for months if not years. Forget about what they say. Look what they do. AOC flopped to Florida after party in Miami. She didn't go to California. Doesn't seem like AOC is taking Anthony Fauci seriously? Not even Fauci is taking Fauci seriously. He slashed the quarantine time in half because he said we don't want to upset the economy too much. Whoa. That all of a sudden is a consideration? And now the experts are saying, wait a second, masks might not be effective? So, for those people keeping score at home, that's three times they've changed their position on masks. The media is now reframing this thing as a bipartisan menace. You know, it shouldn't be a stigma attached to catch an COVID-19. Shouldn't be ashamed of catching the virus. Thanks, guys. Where has that been? Now MSNBC came out and said this. A flu can still be dangerous but we don't reorient our lives around the flu. That's basically what Donald Trump said two years ago and he was killed for that. CNN just came out with a report today, you know, if you lose weight, it might help beating COVID. I mean, we've known that for what, a year and a half? Where have they been on this? Joe Biden finally said you know what, guys, governors, they're on -- governors are really, they really going to have a lot of work to do here. Isn't that Trump's position? The federal government can help the states? Joe Biden's entire presidency has been a fraud. We were supposed to put this guy in office because he was the one man, the one Democrat who had the compassion to beat this virus. And he threw everything at this thing. Now all of a sudden, he is not the guy? he can't beat this thing? And the same people that push this fraud this lie that he could do it are now saying you know what, can't do it. Everyone is going to get the cron (Ph). We got to live with it. No, we're all getting back to where Florida has been from the jump. Got to be smart, got to be safe and you've got to be free.

I think Fauci really said it best when he was talking about, this was really about how much could we get the public to endure. How much could we get the public to take before they had enough? I think what we are seeing is that they realize that they pushed -- they pushed America pretty far. They can't push it. They can't push us any further. I always go back to the February 1st cut off. That's when it's over. And I'm not going to go after people for changing their minds when they get new information. I would congratulate them on coming around, even though they didn't give up the same best intentions when any of us said -- many of us here at this table or this fantasy table said all of these things. We said that the Omicron was going to be widely contagious but benign and would probably act as a natural, a natural immune booster. We were laughed about that. And that now turns out to be conventionally expert advice. But this is, we had -- we were way ahead of the game on all these things. And people thought we were crazy.

I think they have said that these variants are growing up in unvaccinated communities. And three, we should get tested. Now the administration has a challenge. Dana, I thought you laid it out very clearly right before Christmas about the failures around the testing. And hopefully even if we are to vanish Omicron, which all the experts are saying from whomever you may believe. Dr. Fauci or Dr. Gottlieb, or any of them, they believe that we are near the end of it. I hope the administration will continue to invest in a testing regime largely because Doctors Redfield and Admiral Giroir all believe that we are going to need that going forward. I hope the people who have made mistakes along the way admit that they have made mistakes, whether they are friends of ours, people we support or people we don't support.

They all know that this is happening. More research is going to come out that shows that this was so harmful to them from suicide rates to plunging test scores. The inability for them to get back on track. And you know, the teachers complained that there are behavioral problems in the classroom. Really? You think so? Because you kept them out of school for a year and half. And just recently there was a big article in the New York Times that really puffed-up Randi Weingarten and said that she, as the head of the teachers union, was very much trying to keep kids in school. But then as the judge pointed out, we have the actual e-mails from the CDC and the school district that then went to the White House, that basically said teachers wanted to keep schools close.

I would reckon that that probably could be applied to education one of these days. This is truly a teachable moment, literally. Here is the area that you could say arguably suffers the most, which is education, it's the one that combats intensely at any outside influence that smacks of competition. You know, imagine any industry dealing with children was like this. They can't offer an alternative child seat. You know, they only make one car seat and it sucks, right? But you've got to buy it and by the way, we are not going to be in the car with you. OK. Good luck. You know, that's what it's like. They are making one product and because there is no competition, there's no push for school choice, they can make that product as bad as they want it to be. They don't have to go. So, this pandemic, the teachable moment finally we have one, shows that you need school choice, affordable school choice or you are going to end up in a bizarre hostage situation where your kids are basically held captive by people who don't want to work."

But I would encourage Mayor Lightfoot and others, one of the things that's best for kids, put aside the electoral politics for one moment, is to find ways to get teachers and students back in school and for us to be competitive against China, we have to continue to educate our kids and at a minimum help them catch up from the year they missed last year.

And I think he made a recommendation that evidently the CDC and others had been considering. And it's probably the smart thing. I think Jesse's idea about pairing the pilots who may have COVID, there may be some value in thinking about how you -- you know, you might be able to utilize those who are asymptomatic and if tested.

So, maybe if we all tried to fly more and live more on planes, we would be healthier. The challenge here is not the testing. It's what do you do with the results? It's entirely possible to create a natural lockdown that shuts down an economy for good if you do not know what to do with the results of tests that have a high frequency of being wrong, right? Rapid testing can be wrong. You don't want to shut down an economy. I returned to the fact that, you know, the experts aren't in charge because they're paid for the data. The leaders aren't in charge because they are paid for by the elections. It is up to us to shout mission accomplished. We should do it on February 1 because no one else is going to say it.

It certainly spells challenge for you in your election year. I don't know what will happen in 2024 but I know this, crime, COVID, supply chains, and inflation, and the border. If they just focus on two or three of those, they could find themselves in a better spot.

But if you're serious about helping Joe Biden and the country, pass something. Take victories that are in front of you. Help every American. I thought Phil Levine had it -- the former mayor down in Miami Beach had a great piece in The New York Post today. We outline things that Democrats should be for. And if you can't find Phil Levine's piece, and you're having difficulty understanding what it means to get a win, look to the new mayor of New York. Look to what he's about, talking about COVID and crime and moving the city forward. The Democratic electorate in New York elected a mayor, who, frankly is probably to the right of Joe Biden on things. That's where the Democratic Party is.
