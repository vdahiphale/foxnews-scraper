I don't mean that in the pejorative sense.  It seems to me, Neil, he's very much like Trump and Obama. Like President Trump, he ran against the system. Started with nothing. Established his own movement, his own party. Like President Obama, he's very cerebral a guy. He tries to be far-sighted. Let me tell you my concern. And I'm delighted to have France and the people of France as an ally. I thank them so much for helping us in Syria.  But I wonder if President Macron is a little bit naive. I think he thinks that we can reason with the ayatollah in Iran and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and President Putin in Russia. I hope he's right. And certainly you should talk and try diplomacy.  But there are some folks who understand strength. And I think that in dealing with Putin and the ayatollah and Kim Jong Un from weakness is like trying to hand-feed a shark. I think President Putin, for example, understands one thing. You have got to hit him right in the face. I think he understands those sanctions. I think Kim Jong Un does, too. I think Kim Jong Un saw what happened in Syria. I'm not saying that you don't try to reason with your adversaries, but -- as President Macron wants us to, but there are just some bad people in the world. They're not sick, they're not confused. It's not a question that momma or daddy didn't love them enough. They're just bad people.",
