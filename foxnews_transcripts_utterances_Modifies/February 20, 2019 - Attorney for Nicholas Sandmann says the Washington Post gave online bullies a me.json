      "sentences": "Welcome to “Hannity.” All right. We start with a Fox News alert. We have huge news all over the place tonight. Breaking news as we speak, including Lara Logan's powerful rebuke of the media, a risk that may cost her a future.  And also, the lawyer for Nicholas Sandmann, Lin Wood, yesterday filing a $250 million lawsuit against \"The Washington Post.\" He joins us tonight with an exclusive interview.  But we begin tonight with the breaking news. \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. Now, this is a class four felony, punishable by three years in prison. It's a major decision now by prosecutors.  And it comes as a newly uncovered surveillance video -- look at this -- shows the two brothers that allegedly testify before the grand jury today paid by Smollett to stage the assault. And they are purchasing multiple items that were used and what now looks like a hate crime hoax, including glasses, a ski mask, even a red hat. And earlier today, these two men literally testified before the grand jury against Smollett. Now, with evidence mounting, Smollett is in serious legal jeopardy tonight, and it could get far worse. Federal charges could also be on the way.  But tonight, Smollett's attorneys -- they are pushing back in a statement that says, quote, like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information both true and false has been repeatedly leaked. Given the circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense. By the way, we believe in the due process and a presumption of innocence here on the show. But earlier today, the two brothers that you just saw on that surveillance tape had this message for the embattled actor. Take a look.",

Sadly, what we see with Smollett is absolutely nothing new in terms of the media buying a hoax, hook, line, sinker. They go all the way in.  Now, our top story tonight, “Hannity” watch into this abusively biased, hateful mob media in America. Remember not so long ago, countless so- called journalists, pundits from all of these other outlets threw caution to the wind in order to support Jussie Smollett and his very flawed story. I was warned early on, be careful, we didn't talk about it for a long time, waiting for the facts to come in.   Now, despite the glaring red flags, they desperately wanted these wild claims, and his narrative to be true. According to the mainstream media, all Trump supporters are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, we are all monsters that want dirty air, water and to kill grandma and kids. But their coverage of Smollett is only a tiny tip of the iceberg in what is a media mob coordinated character assassination that takes place so often, they are wrong so often. That fake news is abundance in this country. Remember the outrageous, despicable treatment in the media of now Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh? What about the Duke Lacrosse case? What about the UVA rape case? What about Ferguson, Missouri? What about Baltimore? What about the Covington high school kids?  Well, now, famed attorney, somebody I have known a long time, Lin Wood, has filed a massive $250 million lawsuit against \"The Washington Post\" on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann, a brutally devastating 38-page lawsuit, you can see it on hannity.com. Lin will be here in just a few minutes. Now, his newest client, a 16-year-old, 115-pound Covington High School student who was absolutely vilified by this media mob after he was videotaped standing, saying nothing, smiling, and trying not to react to all that was going on around him -- as you can see, a 64-year-old Native American activists drumming right in his face, and screaming rather loudly in his face. Despite showing incredible amazing great restraint in staying calm and doing absolutely nothing wrong, Nicholas Sandmann was repeatedly smeared, slandered, his character assassinated, over and over again and again on a national stage.  They falsely reported that Nicholas Sandmann approach the Native American activists, it was the other way around. They falsely reported that Nicholas Sandmann was a racist and disrespectful and mean-spirited and even physical, all of that is not true. They did all of this based on what was only a short, inconclusive 15-second clip which showed absolutely nothing.  But from print media, Hollywood actors and actresses, Democrats, cable news, major networks, nonstop absolute complete pile on. Fake news, character assassination against a 16-year-old kid and it turns out did nothing wrong. Except maybe wear a MAGA hat. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Nicholas Sandmann's public persecution was widespread, all on the various almost all liberal media outlets, but \"The Washington Post,\" they were one of the ones that led the way. And the Sandmann's suit affirms that.   Listen to this, a 38-page brutal takedown. \"The Post\" bullied an innocent child with an absolute disregard for the pain and destruction that these attacks could cause to his life. And, quote, \"The Post\" wanted to lead the charge against the child, because he was nothing but a pawn in a political war against their political adversary.  Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz believes and I agree with him, this is a very reasonable case with a really good chance of coming out in favor of Nicholas Sandmann against \"The Post\", by the way, and I predict others. There's a ton of precedents in this. What we see with Sandmann is nothing new. You know, I met Lin Wood who is going to join us in a minute, 1996, before the year I started here at the Fox News Channel, I started in October 1996 after the Olympics was in Atlanta. He was representing Jewell, 1996, and the immediate aftermath of the Olympic bombing.  Richard Jewell was heralded and considered a hero after he spotted a suspicious bag, he pushed people away from the scene, he literally single- handedly saved countless lives in the process. But then \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", they pointed the finger at Richard Jewell writing that they hero guard may have planted to the bomb. The media mob all piled on in that case too. Why? Because they said that he fit the vision or the profile of a loan bomber. Single white man and he lived with his mother.  I happened to be on the air at that time in Atlanta. I found out later, I did not know it at the time, Richard Jewell was actually listening to my radio show. He told me later that I was the only person that did not to rush to judgment, because I thought that it was ridiculous.  Well, just because he lives with his mother does not make him out to be a terrorist. I learned a valuable lesson. It has served me so well ever since.  In the end, it turned out that the media mob was dead wrong. I was right, Jewell was innocent and he was a hero. Lin Wood likely made him a rich man. I have not seen the settlements. Sadly to this day, I believe that Richard died, he died at the age of 44 from a heart attack. I guarantee you, they say stress contributes to heart attacks. I strongly believe that in my heart, no medical assessment that is so devastated Richard Jewell that it probably increased the stress load which led to an early death.  Now, we cover every controversial case. That lesson taught me to not rush to judgment in the Duke Lacrosse case, the UVA rape case, Ferguson, Baltimore, Trayvon, and George Zimmerman, even the Russian collusion hoax. The media goes in there direction, they are being proven wrong. That Cambridge police acted stupidly, even vetting Obama, who the media mob loved and refused to do, I did what they would not do. Time after time this mob gets it wrong again and again. And the media and their friends on the left are always happy to smear, slander, besmirch anyone and everyone as long as it fits into their divisive political narrative. Now, this has been the case for decades, but it has never been this bad. In the era of Trump, it has become obvious more than ever. Let's take a look.",

First, before we talk to attorney Lin Wood, we have other big news. It appears that the Mueller probe is finally wrapping up. Sources telling the Fox News Channel that the investigation is, quote, near the end game. And while the Department of Justice, the special counsel's office have declined to comment, even fake news CNN, maybe they got something right, they are reporting Mueller could submit his findings to the Attorney General Bob Barr as early as next week. Earlier today, the president had a lot to say about the release of the report, saying that it is all in the hands of his new attorney general, not him. And Justice Department rules say he decides. And according the special counsel regulations, Mueller will provide a confidential report to the Attorney General Bob Barr explaining the decisions reached by the special counsel. Next, the attorney general will notify the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, quote, upon the conclusion of the special counsel's investigation. It is totally in the hands of the attorney general and his alone to decide what if any details can be released and in compliance with the law. It can control the timing of the notification over, quote, legitimate investigative or privacy concerns. And also remember, these regulations -- they were presented to Congress, oh, two decades ago by Democrats. Janet Reno, the A.G., Deputy A.G. Eric Holder, that was after the Starr investigation. They were designed to make the special counsel more accountable to the public. And now, ironically, these same people who are outraged at Starr's authority and the release of that report are the same ones wanting to give Mueller free rein over President Trump. By the way, next week, the president and we will be with him. We'll have an interview with him in Vietnam, an important summit about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and Kim Jong-un. Would it not be wholly inappropriate to actually release the findings when the president is out of the country? Participating in these high-stakes negotiations on such an important topic?  We also know, and I have always suspected, maybe I will be proven wrong, Mueller's team of Democrats would love to undermine the president in any way that they can. We'll have more on this later in the show. Also, huge breaking developing news by Sara Carter and John Solomon. But, first, joining us now with more on this lawsuit and what is a media mob, I got to know him in 1996, one of the most tenacious attorneys in the country, if he sent me a letter of cease and desist, I'd beg for an apology.

So, this video goes viral, the mob attacks, and you would expect that the mainstream media would be responsible enough to pause, recognize that they are dealing with a student, investigate, and make sure that they have the facts accurate, that the story that they tell is accurate. But they didn't pause when it came to Nicholas, because they wanted to rush out and they wanted to jump into the mob and give the mob a megaphone, so that they could attack this boy, because he was white, he's Catholic, and he was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" cap. If Nicholas had not purchased that souvenir cap that day at the Mall, if he was not wearing it, none of us would know who Nick Sandmann is. He would still be living his life privately, going to school without worrying about how his school and his classmates and the world feel about him. Here is a 16-year-old kid, Sean. It is tough being 16. Think about what this young boy is having to deal with at age 16 when the entire world saw him the way that the media portrayed him as literally the face of evil.

Breaking news as we speak, including Lara Logan's powerful rebuke of the media, a risk that may cost her a future. And also, the lawyer for Nicholas Sandmann, Lin Wood, yesterday filing a $250 million lawsuit against \"The Washington Post.\" He joins us tonight with an exclusive interview. But we begin tonight with the breaking news. \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. Now, this is a class four felony, punishable by three years in prison. It's a major decision now by prosecutors. And it comes as a newly uncovered surveillance video -- look at this -- shows the two brothers that allegedly testify before the grand jury today paid by Smollett to stage the assault. And they are purchasing multiple items that were used and what now looks like a hate crime hoax, including glasses, a ski mask, even a red hat. And earlier today, these two men literally testified before the grand jury against Smollett. Now, with evidence mounting, Smollett is in serious legal jeopardy tonight, and it could get far worse. Federal charges could also be on the way. But tonight, Smollett's attorneys -- they are pushing back in a statement that says, quote, like any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information both true and false has been repeatedly leaked. Given the circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense. By the way, we believe in the due process and a presumption of innocence here on the show. But earlier today, the two brothers that you just saw on that surveillance tape had this message for the embattled actor. Take a look."

Sadly, what we see with Smollett is absolutely nothing new in terms of the media buying a hoax, hook, line, sinker. They go all the way in. Now, our top story tonight, “Hannity” watch into this abusively biased, hateful mob media in America. Remember not so long ago, countless so- called journalists, pundits from all of these other outlets threw caution to the wind in order to support Jussie Smollett and his very flawed story. I was warned early on, be careful, we didn't talk about it for a long time, waiting for the facts to come in. Now, despite the glaring red flags, they desperately wanted these wild claims, and his narrative to be true. According to the mainstream media, all Trump supporters are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, we are all monsters that want dirty air, water and to kill grandma and kids. But their coverage of Smollett is only a tiny tip of the iceberg in what is a media mob coordinated character assassination that takes place so often, they are wrong so often. That fake news is abundance in this country. Remember the outrageous, despicable treatment in the media of now Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh? What about the Duke Lacrosse case? What about the UVA rape case? What about Ferguson, Missouri? What about Baltimore? What about the Covington high school kids? Well, now, famed attorney, somebody I have known a long time, Lin Wood, has filed a massive $250 million lawsuit against \"The Washington Post\" on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann, a brutally devastating 38-page lawsuit, you can see it on hannity.com. Lin will be here in just a few minutes. Now, his newest client, a 16-year-old, 115-pound Covington High School student who was absolutely vilified by this media mob after he was videotaped standing, saying nothing, smiling, and trying not to react to all that was going on around him -- as you can see, a 64-year-old Native American activists drumming right in his face, and screaming rather loudly in his face. Despite showing incredible amazing great restraint in staying calm and doing absolutely nothing wrong, Nicholas Sandmann was repeatedly smeared, slandered, his character assassinated, over and over again and again on a national stage. They falsely reported that Nicholas Sandmann approach the Native American activists, it was the other way around. They falsely reported that Nicholas Sandmann was a racist and disrespectful and mean-spirited and even physical, all of that is not true. They did all of this based on what was only a short, inconclusive 15-second clip which showed absolutely nothing. But from print media, Hollywood actors and actresses, Democrats, cable news, major networks, nonstop absolute complete pile on. Fake news, character assassination against a 16-year-old kid and it turns out did nothing wrong. Except maybe wear a MAGA hat. Watch this."

After all, he is wearing a red let's \"Make America Great Again\" hat, and attending oh, he is pro-life, in March for Life rally, which according to so many in the media, that's a vile, bigoted act.

      "utterance": "Nicholas Sandmann's public persecution was widespread, all on the various almost all liberal media outlets, but \"The Washington Post,\" they were one of the ones that led the way. And the Sandmann's suit affirms that. Listen to this, a 38-page brutal takedown. \"The Post\" bullied an innocent child with an absolute disregard for the pain and destruction that these attacks could cause to his life. And, quote, \"The Post\" wanted to lead the charge against the child, because he was nothing but a pawn in a political war against their political adversary. Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz believes and I agree with him, this is a very reasonable case with a really good chance of coming out in favor of Nicholas Sandmann against \"The Post\", by the way, and I predict others. There's a ton of precedents in this. What we see with Sandmann is nothing new. You know, I met Lin Wood who is going to join us in a minute, 1996, before the year I started here at the Fox News Channel, I started in October 1996 after the Olympics was in Atlanta. He was representing Jewell, 1996, and the immediate aftermath of the Olympic bombing. Richard Jewell was heralded and considered a hero after he spotted a suspicious bag, he pushed people away from the scene, he literally single- handedly saved countless lives in the process. But then \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", they pointed the finger at Richard Jewell writing that they hero guard may have planted to the bomb. The media mob all piled on in that case too. Why? Because they said that he fit the vision or the profile of a loan bomber. Single white man and he lived with his mother. I happened to be on the air at that time in Atlanta. I found out later, I did not know it at the time, Richard Jewell was actually listening to my radio show. He told me later that I was the only person that did not to rush to judgment, because I thought that it was ridiculous. Well, just because he lives with his mother does not make him out to be a terrorist. I learned a valuable lesson. It has served me so well ever since. In the end, it turned out that the media mob was dead wrong. I was right, Jewell was innocent and he was a hero. Lin Wood likely made him a rich man. I have not seen the settlements. Sadly to this day, I believe that Richard died, he died at the age of 44 from a heart attack. I guarantee you, they say stress contributes to heart attacks. I strongly believe that in my heart, no medical assessment that is so devastated Richard Jewell that it probably increased the stress load which led to an early death. Now, we cover every controversial case. That lesson taught me to not rush to judgment in the Duke Lacrosse case, the UVA rape case, Ferguson, Baltimore, Trayvon, and George Zimmerman, even the Russian collusion hoax. The media goes in there direction, they are being proven wrong. That Cambridge police acted stupidly, even vetting Obama, who the media mob loved and refused to do, I did what they would not do. Time after time this mob gets it wrong again and again. And the media and their friends on the left are always happy to smear, slander, besmirch anyone and everyone as long as it fits into their divisive political narrative. Now, this has been the case for decades, but it has never been this bad. In the era of Trump, it has become obvious more than ever. Let's take a look."

First, before we talk to attorney Lin Wood, we have other big news. It appears that the Mueller probe is finally wrapping up. Sources telling the Fox News Channel that the investigation is, quote, near the end game. And while the Department of Justice, the special counsel's office have declined to comment, even fake news CNN, maybe they got something right, they are reporting Mueller could submit his findings to the Attorney General Bob Barr as early as next week. Earlier today, the president had a lot to say about the release of the report, saying that it is all in the hands of his new attorney general, not him. And Justice Department rules say he decides. And according the special counsel regulations, Mueller will provide a confidential report to the Attorney General Bob Barr explaining the decisions reached by the special counsel. Next, the attorney general will notify the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, quote, upon the conclusion of the special counsel's investigation. It is totally in the hands of the attorney general and his alone to decide what if any details can be released and in compliance with the law. It can control the timing of the notification over, quote, legitimate investigative or privacy concerns. And also remember, these regulations -- they were presented to Congress, oh, two decades ago by Democrats. Janet Reno, the A.G., Deputy A.G. Eric Holder, that was after the Starr investigation. They were designed to make the special counsel more accountable to the public. And now, ironically, these same people who are outraged at Starr's authority and the release of that report are the same ones wanting to give Mueller free rein over President Trump. By the way, next week, the president and we will be with him. We'll have an interview with him in Vietnam, an important summit about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and Kim Jong-un. Would it not be wholly inappropriate to actually release the findings when the president is out of the country? Participating in these high-stakes negotiations on such an important topic? We also know, and I have always suspected, maybe I will be proven wrong, Mueller's team of Democrats would love to undermine the president in any way that they can. We'll have more on this later in the show. Also, huge breaking developing news by Sara Carter and John Solomon. But, first, joining us now with more on this lawsuit and what is a media mob, I got to know him in 1996, one of the most tenacious attorneys in the country, if he sent me a letter of cease and desist, I'd beg for an apology.

You have the era of social media now, Twitter, Facebook -- thank goodness that did not as exist back in 1996 when Richard Jewell was under attack. So, this video goes viral, the mob attacks, and you would expect that the mainstream media would be responsible enough to pause, recognize that they are dealing with a student, investigate, and make sure that they have the facts accurate, that the story that they tell is accurate. But they didn't pause when it came to Nicholas, because they wanted to rush out and they wanted to jump into the mob and give the mob a megaphone, so that they could attack this boy, because he was white, he's Catholic, and he was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" cap. If Nicholas had not purchased that souvenir cap that day at the Mall, if he was not wearing it, none of us would know who Nick Sandmann is. He would still be living his life privately, going to school without worrying about how his school and his classmates and the world feel about him. Here is a 16-year-old kid, Sean. It is tough being 16. Think about what this young boy is having to deal with at age 16 when the entire world saw him the way that the media portrayed him as literally the face of evil. It is inexcusable, reprehensible conduct by the media. And \"The Washington Post\" led the way."

We've got a lot of work to do, because the social media and mainstream mob of bullies was extremely large in number. And they were very vocal. And the mainstream media like \"The Washington Post\" gave them a megaphone to go out and to shout to the world that this young boy had instigated this event, which he did not, had engaged in behavior swarming around Mr. Phillips, which he did not, had blocked Mr. Phillips' ability to leave the scene, which he did not.

No agreement was reached, and therefore, prosecutors put the grand jury in play. The two brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo testified before that grand jury for two and a half hours. Their attorney telling me no plea deal was reached, they were not granted immunity, because they did nothing wrong. Meanwhile, the evidence seems to mount that the two brothers did stage this event. We got surveillance video, Fox 32 obtaining surveillance video from a beauty supply is store showing these men walking into the store buying a red hat, ski masks, and the date of the video was January 28th.

I used to walk a post at 6 - from 6 o'clock at night to 2 o'clock in the morning. You see a couple of guys on a relatively empty street in an industrial area at 2 o'clock in the morning with bleach and a noose, wearing MAGA hats with no one else around, it may not be reasonable suspicion to push them out - to pull him over, but it's probably worth giving them an extra look.

Baker suspiciously changes his mind after discussions with Comey, of course, a Clinton lover and other senior officials, remember who's disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe ramped up his efforts to undermine the President after Comey was fired in May of 2017.

And he specifically states that he absolutely believed from the beginning, when he went through this binder - he was basically given a binder with the classified emails, with documents - he was appalled, he didn't see any other way around it, but to charge Hillary Clinton. And he continued to battle, according to his own testimony, with people in his office along with Comey as well, he had these arguments going back and forth until the very end. And it wasn't until the very end that he changed his mind. But more importantly, when Ratcliffe questions him again and he says, do you still believe it is appalling what happened, the mishandling of these classified documents, which Baker himself describes as highly classified documents, he said yes. He basically said yes. Even to this day, he believes it was appalling. I think the question is—"

The fix was in, she got away with stuff no other American citizen could ever get away with, and then the dossier, the Russian lies ironically never investigated. Lying to the FISA Court, then using it to sabotage and unseat a duly elected President. John Solomon, you report on this as well as the third dossier written by - produced by Nellie Ohr, Bruce's wife."

      "utterance": "Yes, I'm really struck today, Sean. Early in the show, you talked about how much the story shifted on Covington, how much it shifted on the attack in Chicago. Think about how much these two stories on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have shifted from what the media originally reported, what we now know today. For a long time, the FBI said everyone was in unanimity about not charging Hillary Clinton. Now we find out to the very last minute, James Baker was fighting and disagreeing with that decision. And when we started, we were told that the Trump investigation had to be open because it was actionable foreign intelligence, suggesting he was compromised. Now, we know that intelligence was nothing more than Christopher Steele and Sidney Blumenthal, and now the wife of Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, after learning what Christopher Steele sent to the FBI, a report that Bruce Ohr told the Congress, his wife put her own dossier together, put it on a memory stick, gave it to him and he routed it to the FBI, despite the fact that there are conflict of interest rules that say justice officials should never get involved in cases where their spouse has a financial interest. It's remarkable, this story has evolved so much."

Former CBS 60 Minutes reporter Lara Logan is here to explain just how the anti-Trump mainstream media truly is, even risking her total career in doing so. Next. LARA LOGAN, FORMER CBS 60 MINUTES REPORTER: --everywhere is mostly liberal, not just in the U.S. But in this country, 85 percent of journalists are registered Democrats, so that's just a fact. We have few conventions, if you like, because they're not really rules, but that you need at least two first-hand sources for something, right? Those things help keep you - keep your work to a certain standard. Those standards are out the window. I mean you read one story after another or hear it, and it's all based on one anonymous administration official and former administration official, right. I mean that's just - that's not journalism, that's (BEEP) sorry, that is absolutely (BEEP)."

Before I lived there, I was there under Saddam Hussein. So, I mean I was pretty much on the battlefield most of the time from 9/11 and it's only been since I had my children that I've kind of - and of course since I was almost killed in Egypt that I've sort of scaled back."

      "speaker": "LOGAN",

And Geraldo (ph) and his brother were a few vehicles behind us in the convoy. And Sean, you know how incredible this is, in those days the United States military did not even have armored Humvees on the battlefield. If you think about what that context brings--"

I say I also do opinion and news and investigative reporting, I do it all. And 85 percent, I think it's closer to 90 percent, that are liberal and you can see it. And you say you need two sources. That's so far gone. Why if you tell the truth like that, do you believe you just pretty much committed career suicide?"

And I was joking that I'm embraced for fire and fury because I know they're going to come after me again and I'm not the only one. I mean the same people come after you, right, one of them The Sparrow Project. I mean this person was tweeting today, Hannity, watch out about Laura Logan's stuff, right? And there's more coming, Michael Calderon who was at The Huffington Post, I can literally give you the script now. I can tell you who the players are; Joe Hagan, Brian Stelter.

I mean, if there are any independent voices out there, if there are any journalists who are not beating the same drum and giving the same talking points, then we pay the price. You know what's interesting, Sean, they cannot take down the substance of what you're saying, right? They cannot go after the things that matter. So they smear you personally. They go after your integrity, they go after your reputation as a person and as a professional, and they'll stop at nothing. So, I am not the only one, and I am just - like I am done, right, I am tired of it. And they don't get to write my story anymore. They do not get to speak for me. I want to say loudly and clearly to anybody who's listening, I am not owned, nobody owns me, right. I'm not owned by the Left, I'm not owned by the Right."

I mean, that's a part of who we are as human beings. We all have opinions on things. I don't pretend I don't have opinions. My point about the sources is that I've worked with so many great journalists. I can tell you many of their names, Sara Carter is one of them. I have so much respect for her work. And there are so many people at 60 Minutes and in many other places who I have such great respect for. And that's because I didn't invent this. Journalists have always needed two independent first-hand sources. That's always been the standard that we work to. It's not me, I'm not alone, I'm not the only one. And people know - people know that we've slipped. People know that when you're not - when those are no longer your standards, that - that raises questions if you're honest."

Look at the interview, hear what I said, and then listen to him, and you can see that I didn't say that. I don't need to use - I don't need to fall back into dishonesty. And by the way, it's not a job interview, right? I don't know if Fox would want to hire me, because nobody is going to own me."
