      "sentences": "Thanks, Bret. So, good evening everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum in New York. And tonight on “The Story,” Fred Fleitz, spent 25 years in the CIA, and the DIA, the State Department, and the House Intelligence staff. For weeks, he's made the case that it is time to unmask the person who calls themselves the whistleblower. And tonight, that story takes an interesting turn. Also, Republican Congressman Peter King served his New York district for nearly 28 years announced his plans to leave Congress.  But shortly after, he was praised by Senator Chuck Schumer. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar weighed in as well. She called him an Islamophobe and bid him good riddance. Congressman King is here exclusively tonight with his very first response.  And does it seem like Christmas is starting a little earlier this year? Dean Martin's daughter has some choice words for those who are messing with her dad's classic Baby, It's Cold Outside in the name of MeToo. But that's later in the show before we get to that, there is no doubt about it folks. They are burning the midnight oil at the Capitol tonight.  Tomorrow's a big day for both sides in this impeachment battle. And tonight, Speaker Pelosi is rallying her troops in the basement of the Capitol. Republicans on the committee are holding mock sessions where Lee Zeldin, reportedly playing Adam Schiff is in preparation for the big moment in the spotlight. Byron York and Fled Fleitz -- Fred Fleitz are here tonight with their analysis. And we begin with Fred. Fred, good to see tonight. Thanks for being here.",

The fact is that radical Islamic extremists were in the Muslim community. Maybe it's one percent, less than one percent of the population, but we had a situation where it was considered politically incorrect to carry out ordinary surveillance. And police all over the country were telling me they were not getting the cooperation from within the Muslim community that was needed. And I said, people talk about this being an anti-Muslim hearing. The key witnesses there testifying for me were two of them were Muslims and the other was an African American whose son had converted to Islam and had been taken over to Somalia to fight for Al Shabaab. When he wanted to come home, he was killed. And then he -- I'm sorry -- when he came home, he ends up killing American military. The other person was to be -- his son didn't go to Somalia, and he was killed over there.

TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. Speculation about the political future of Nikki Haley has been on-again off-again since she left the Trump administration more than a year ago. Now, it's on again because Haley is outselling a book. She is also painting herself as a big-time supporter of President Trump's agenda and the idea that Nikki Haley is somehow angling to become vice president was ginned up today on MSNBC's Morning Joe. During the show's political panel, the subject came up of Haley writing in her book that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly tried to recruit her to subvert the president as a way to save the country. Both Tillerson and Kelly have dismissed the accusation. But former GOP analyst, Steve Schmidt, says “The Story” speaks to Nikki Haley's political ambition. Watch him.",

And tonight on “The Story,” Fred Fleitz, spent 25 years in the CIA, and the DIA, the State Department, and the House Intelligence staff. For weeks, he's made the case that it is time to unmask the person who calls themselves the whistleblower. And tonight, that story takes an interesting turn. Also, Republican Congressman Peter King served his New York district for nearly 28 years announced his plans to leave Congress. But shortly after, he was praised by Senator Chuck Schumer. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar weighed in as well. She called him an Islamophobe and bid him good riddance. Congressman King is here exclusively tonight with his very first response. And does it seem like Christmas is starting a little earlier this year? Dean Martin's daughter has some choice words for those who are messing with her dad's classic Baby, It's Cold Outside in the name of MeToo. But that's later in the show before we get to that, there is no doubt about it folks. They are burning the midnight oil at the Capitol tonight. Tomorrow's a big day for both sides in this impeachment battle. And tonight, Speaker Pelosi is rallying her troops in the basement of the Capitol. Republicans on the committee are holding mock sessions where Lee Zeldin, reportedly playing Adam Schiff is in preparation for the big moment in the spotlight. Byron York and Fled Fleitz -- Fred Fleitz are here tonight with their analysis. And we begin with Fred. Fred, good to see tonight. Thanks for being here."

Whether or not he was part of some sort of plot, you know, to take down President Trump. And all we see so far is that he said no. What do you -- what do you see in that report, so far?"

Because, as you know, a lot of Republicans have asked about the origin of the whole Trump-Russia investigation. It sounds like another era given that we're talking about this impeachment at the moment. But it's something that Republicans still haven't found out about in the whole series of events that led George Papadopoulos to be the focus of the investigation. For that investigation to be formally started on July 31st, 2016 at the height of the presidential campaign. The role of foreign intelligence services like the Australians and Downer was anybody else involved. The mysterious Joseph Mifsud. Republicans do want to find out what happened. And the fact that Durham has been able to get to Downer and get him to talk is encouraging."

We know they were doing this. And the point of the Durham investigation is to find out do we know everything or was there more?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, it strikes me when you look ahead to tomorrow. You know, when you go into a courtroom, you have both sides presenting their case, you have a cross-examination, we also have a judge who's sort of running things and setting down the rules so that it's fair to everybody. But, in this case, it's sort of like that, you know, the judge is the majority and this is the way it works."

With the -- with the appearance of William Taylor tomorrow, the first witness, and then, George Kent after that. William Taylor has a lot of stature. He's currently the top-rated -- top- ranked diplomat in Ukraine. He's a Vietnam veteran like Robert Mueller was. He has a long career in public service and Democrats are going to point to him as a very credible person. I think one of the things we're going to see is, you know, you asked Fred Fleitz, well, will that testimony -- will their testimony be credible? I think it will be credible for what they know. And Republicans are going to say, well, these guys never talked to the president, they didn't know what was really going on. We know what they said to each other."

He fought in Washington to secure the funding that he believed the survivors deserved. His deep ties to the first responders, firefighters, and law enforcement extended to his fierce fight to battle the scourge of MS-13 in New York. In Washington, he served as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, but now he is getting ready to say goodbye to his work on the Hill. Fellow New Yorker Chuck Schumer called King a principled lawmaker who stood head and shoulders above everyone else. But squad member and freshman lawmaker Ilhan Omar feels differently. She wrote, \"Peter King is an Islamophobe who helped McCarthyite hearings targeting American Muslims and said there are too many mosques in this country and blamed Eric Garner for his own death at the hands of the police.

So they head down in North Carolina with my grandchildren. I just thought after all these years, you know, maybe it's time to spend more time with them. Again, it was -- it was great, so long as they were nearby. But now they have to work out travel and everything.

When we went after the mafia, we went to the Italian-American community. When we went after the (INAUDIBLE) we went to the Irish-American community. The fact is that radical Islamic extremists were in the Muslim community. Maybe it's one percent, less than one percent of the population, but we had a situation where it was considered politically incorrect to carry out ordinary surveillance. And police all over the country were telling me they were not getting the cooperation from within the Muslim community that was needed. And I said, people talk about this being an anti-Muslim hearing. The key witnesses there testifying for me were two of them were Muslims and the other was an African American whose son had converted to Islam and had been taken over to Somalia to fight for Al Shabaab. When he wanted to come home, he was killed. And then he -- I'm sorry -- when he came home, he ends up killing American military. The other person was to be -- his son didn't go to Somalia, and he was killed over there. And when he was warned and threatened by people in his own community, in Congresswoman Omar's district, by the way, not to cooperate, not to talk to the FBI, and not to talk to the police, and I wanted to give him an opportunity to come forward. So that's what this was about."

So that was really the final hole we had to close. That's been done. And getting back to Congresswoman Omar, when she says I said there was too many mosques, I never said that. I said there were too many mosques who were not cooperating with law enforcement. And it was in her district that a young man was seduced to go over to Somalia and was killed.

We put me up against two possible contenders and two who've been mentioned, I beat them by -- one by 30, the other one by 31 points. And I think the district can be held. Because right now it become a swing district with President Trump. He did carry it. President Obama carried it twice, then President Trump carried by nine points, and it can be done. The Republicans did very well in those portions of my district in the last local election, probably the only suburban area in the country where Republicans did that well.

And I personally don't agree with that. I think that black people actually need to take the power back within themselves and vote in their best interest. And it seems very odd to me that there was this consistent narrative that if a black person is voting Democrat, then somehow they're stupid or they don't -- they're not politically aware. That's not the case. Some black people are voting Democrat because that serves their interest."

You said, \"I grew up in a house of addiction, poverty, government assistance, divorce, neglect, abandonment, and violence.\" And then you go on to say, \"They say you are this race, gender, age, zip code, education and so on. Therefore, this is the future that you will have. It is the safe way, the known way. You say, forget that way.\""

And it makes it so that it's almost like a gang. If you jump outside the gang, you're going to get attacked by everyone. So when Kanye West makes that statement, I don't take it as a Conservative statement. I take it as an empowerment statement for black Americans. Truthfully speaking, when we think about the numbers, African-Americans vote for Democrats, over 90 percent of the time but look at our communities, look at Chicago, look at what liberal policies have done to ruin us, and if we were to say listen Democrats, instead of us voting for you, why don't you offer us something and we can vote for you.

Now, Haley who is out on book tour, is attempting to quiet down that idea. Chief breaking correspondent Trace Gallagher has “The Story” for us. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. Speculation about the political future of Nikki Haley has been on-again off-again since she left the Trump administration more than a year ago. Now, it's on again because Haley is outselling a book. She is also painting herself as a big-time supporter of President Trump's agenda and the idea that Nikki Haley is somehow angling to become vice president was ginned up today on MSNBC's Morning Joe. During the show's political panel, the subject came up of Haley writing in her book that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly tried to recruit her to subvert the president as a way to save the country. Both Tillerson and Kelly have dismissed the accusation. But former GOP analyst, Steve Schmidt, says “The Story” speaks to Nikki Haley's political ambition. Watch him."

You know? Which, I just think it's harmless in this case when you listen to the whole song, but it got so much attention. You know?

You know, it's a cute song, as I say, and you know, just watching my dad do it, he was spectacular and I think he would be kind of laughing right now that this was being changed and it's a classic song and I'm sorry that it's happening because that's not baby it's cold outside.
