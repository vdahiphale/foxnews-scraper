Because the big prize is getting that movement forward on border security and immigration that has eluded politicians of left and right for decades. Let's be clear about this issue of immigration, which doesn't just mean the border. It means the whole system, which has been broken for so long. It has been something that has been defeated in the swamp for decades. It's been left to fester. It's been punted along. And finally, you've got a president, Donald Trump, who's not going to let that happen. That's why he did the shutdown, that's why he forced attention on this issue. And even though today may look like a concession to some supporters, in many ways it is.   What he's still doing is forcing those people in Congress who have ducked this issue for so long to try and come up with a solution. He's given them 21 days at the end of that, that's when we'll really know whether he's been able to make a historic difference in the way that no politician has been for such a long time.",

Those are some of what's being said out there. And some of those outlets are not particularly positive on the president in most cases anyway.

Roll back the tape and ask yourself, did they have an impact on the election? Did they have an impact on how the American people voted, because of these releases of these e-mails? Remember, the first group came out around the time of the DNC, the convention for Hillary Clinton. What did they reveal? Basically, they reveal that Debbie Wasserman Schultz had sanctioned practices that made it pretty tough for Bernie Sanders to get a fair shake. So, you had that. Then, you fast forward to October. What did those e-mails that, were hacked into, and revealed say right before the election? These are the Podesta e-mails. One, Donna Brazile had her hands on the debate question. And she gave that question to Hillary Clinton ahead of time. And that some staffers -- were talking about things like this, that rich conservatives, probably found it more palatable to their friends to be Catholic rather than Evangelical. That was seen as a sort of slam against Catholics that might have turned off Catholic voters. Another one said they really should get into bolstering Hillary Clinton with \"needy Latinos.\" That phrase was seen as something that could be troublesome to Latino voters and suggested trying -- that they should try to get an endorsement by Bill Richardson.  These are real e-mails that came out. They were embarrassing. Were they explosive? Where they vote changing? That's a question that is open to answering. This is what the Mueller investigation is trying to find out. Were they the result of Russian hacking and did they give them to WikiLeaks and did the Trump campaign conspire to then have this whole thing blow up? That's where we're at.

Roger still believes to this day that what Julian Assange said in that interview that he's not in any way related to the Russians.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HILTON, HOST",
      "utterance": "I think that what he did today was make the right move. Because the big prize is getting that movement forward on border security and immigration that has eluded politicians of left and right for decades. Let's be clear about this issue of immigration, which doesn't just mean the border. It means the whole system, which has been broken for so long. It has been something that has been defeated in the swamp for decades. It's been left to fester. It's been punted along. And finally, you've got a president, Donald Trump, who's not going to let that happen. That's why he did the shutdown, that's why he forced attention on this issue. And even though today may look like a concession to some supporters, in many ways it is. What he's still doing is forcing those people in Congress who have ducked this issue for so long to try and come up with a solution. He's given them 21 days at the end of that, that's when we'll really know whether he's been able to make a historic difference in the way that no politician has been for such a long time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, we'll see. I mean, because he essentially said that if he didn't get what he wanted, he was going to use his executive powers to declare an -- a crisis at the border. Now, I guess, at -- if, at the end of 21 days, they don't get where they need to be on this to satisfy his base, then, perhaps that option is still there. But -- you know, I mean, the backlash is pretty fierce. So, let's look at some of the headlines out there. Donald Trump Just Lost His Leverage for Building a Wall, Why Trump Blinked. Those are some of what's being said out there. And some of those outlets are not particularly positive on the president in most cases anyway. But, you know, also from Ann Coulter, you know, as you can imagine. She said, good news for George Herbert Walker Bush, as of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp to serve as president of the United States. What do you think, Steve?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, but this stuff is just childish. It's not helpful, it's not serious, OK? This is a really serious problem. Immigration has been growing as a problem and it will continue to grow as you get bigger and bigger migration flows around the world. You got technology, you've got the cost of travel. This is going to be a really serious issue. And so, we have still, it's not the end of the process yet. The time to judge is in a few weeks. If Congress can use this period to finally deal with the problem, the answers are not that complicated."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

I think most of America feels exactly the same way."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "This may sound like a weird thing to say at this moment. But, fundamental decency in the end. How long can she go on, saying that it doesn't matter what you put on the table? She's already said this, in terms of giving up what we want for the kind of priorities that our voters have. We just going to keep saying no, because we hate you, Donald Trump, OK?"

Because the president has shown he is interested in a bigger deal than just traveling over a scrabbling over a bit of money for the wall. And that's what we need."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, I mean, he made a generous offer, I think. Yes, I mean -- you know, just looking at it -- you know, 30,000 feet, it's like you look at what he was offering. He was offering DACA relief, essentially. Huge program to allow people to stay here, increased technology at the border, increased border security in the form of new -- of more agents along that border, and also an actual physical barrier that prevents people from coming in."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And to that, you have to ask the question, do they want to remove what's there? You know, should it just be a completely fluid back and forth area."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "It's exactly. They have no serious argument, they have no substantive argument. It's purely political. But I just want to say this to every supporter of Donald Trump. Where are they are, they're watching tonight, whoever you are. If you want to support this president, if you want to see him re-elected in 2020, then you've got to get behind him right now, at this moment, and push for that kind of big, historic deal. Because that is the best way to make sure that he gets credit from a situation which we can all see has been messy, it's hurt his reputation, his poll numbers are down. But we know at the end, we're halfway through. And he's still got the chance to have used the pressure of shutting down the government and now putting this deadline on it with the threat of the emergency action to get a really big, positive change. That will be the best way to ensure that he's re-elected in 2020."

That they were concerned about the outcome of that vote and felt they were losing -- you know, folks even in their own party. They expected they would lose Mitt Romney, but they lost six people on that vote.

So, the e-mails that were hacked and leaked, where you have heard so much about, that at the heart, really, of this entire Russia investigation. Roll back the tape and ask yourself, did they have an impact on the election? Did they have an impact on how the American people voted, because of these releases of these e-mails? Remember, the first group came out around the time of the DNC, the convention for Hillary Clinton. What did they reveal? Basically, they reveal that Debbie Wasserman Schultz had sanctioned practices that made it pretty tough for Bernie Sanders to get a fair shake. So, you had that. Then, you fast forward to October. What did those e-mails that, were hacked into, and revealed say right before the election? These are the Podesta e-mails. One, Donna Brazile had her hands on the debate question. And she gave that question to Hillary Clinton ahead of time. And that some staffers -- were talking about things like this, that rich conservatives, probably found it more palatable to their friends to be Catholic rather than Evangelical. That was seen as a sort of slam against Catholics that might have turned off Catholic voters. Another one said they really should get into bolstering Hillary Clinton with \"needy Latinos.\" That phrase was seen as something that could be troublesome to Latino voters and suggested trying -- that they should try to get an endorsement by Bill Richardson. These are real e-mails that came out. They were embarrassing. Were they explosive? Where they vote changing? That's a question that is open to answering. This is what the Mueller investigation is trying to find out. Were they the result of Russian hacking and did they give them to WikiLeaks and did the Trump campaign conspire to then have this whole thing blow up? That's where we're at.

So then he's on the outside and he's talking to his you know, sort of like-minded political friends, talking to you, to Jerome Corsi, to Randy Credico, and you know, there's lots of buzz about oh I wonder if you know, there's going to be something that drops, some bad information about Hillary Clinton. So this indictment says that basically, someone in the Trump campaign was nudging him along to say like, can you find out when WikiLeaks is going to drop this stuff? And he you know, was saying that he had a connection, that he could figure out when it was going to drop and making all these statements about this information that was going to drop. Was he doing that because he had direct information, that he had a link to the Russians, he knew when it was going to drop or was he trying to sort of puff himself up and make himself useful to the campaign?"

Roger has argued this point and still does. So he was never at any time thinking he was talking to the Russians when he was trying to reach out to WikiLeaks. And we know now at least from the -- from the proof that we've seen and we'll find out through this trial that nobody ever got in touch with WikiLeaks when it came from -- to Roger trying to urge the you know, some - - you know, the contact to WikiLeaks through Jerry Corsi. Jerry Corsi has never once been in touch with WikiLeaks. Now, the person who was giving him you know, kind of background information as Roger has always said was an intermediary named Randy Credico. And Randy said things about Roger what Roger believes are incorrect. And Roger now states and he has for weeks that he has chapter and verse, e-mails, texts, metadata that proved both of these men are lying. I can tell you, when I sat down with Mueller's team, it was about collusion and conspiracy. Now it's about two men who are willing to lie about Roger Stone.

I was sent there by the Clinton administration, by the way, to meddle in their elections. I spent there a long time. And I thought -- I thought the Russians work and I also thought that they had been so successful with their packing and social media programs in Ukraine and such that they were soon going to turn it on the United States. And in the days that had happened. I thought that Barack Obama should do something about it. Roger didn't agree with that. Roger still believes to this day that what Julian Assange said in that interview that he's not in any way related to the Russians.

I think that that's what Warren is trying to say here. Her approach may not necessarily be the best but a Gallup poll also showed that you know, most Millennials don't even know what socialism really is. So I think that that's another issue here is that when people are talking about socialism, they're thinking about the ideologies that speak to it but not necessarily whether it will take and how it could turn the government on this head. But what cannot be lost in the conversation is the fact that when we have individuals who are not making any money and then others who are billionaires and that is a problem especially in our great nation which is supposed to be the leader.

I mean, the late-term stuff, he would do it 24 weeks, which is five and a half months, about an 80 percent chance of viability, he was doing it way past then. But that's the law in Pennsylvania, you know. Here, where it becomes really gray, is in the area of the woman's health. Is it mental health, is it emotional health? And so, it could be for a myriad of reasons it can happen. And then the scary thing is, it doesn't have to be doctors, it doesn't have to be licensed physicians, it could be, you know, R.N.'s, it can be, you know, very -- some qualified people.

I mean, again, at 24 weeks, that's five and a half months, 80 percent chance of survival. It goes at 90 at 26 weeks. So, it's a really scary, scary thought. And being a father, you know, I've always called myself pro- choice and I've always supported that up until viability.

He wanted to talk to Patrick Mahomes in their section of the stadium, when all of the Razzmatazz had died down. \"I just went and saw him, he's feeling like you think he'd feel when you lose a game like this.
