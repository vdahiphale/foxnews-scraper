Senator Lindsey Graham, says the president will win in court on the national emergency and he has brand-new data about what's going on in the border. And he will says, it will prove it. He's coming up.  Also, Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intel Committee, investigating the president, says there is enormous amounts of evidence. We will ask him about that.  And Senator Rand Paul who has been challenging the president's stance on the border and on Afghanistan. But first up, Democrat Senator Mark Warner and Republican Senator Richard Burr, have been investigating the president Russian collusion as, you know, for two years.  As we anticipate the imminent maybe possibly release of the separate Mueller report, Senator Warner says there is plenty of evidence despite this from his Republican chairman.",

Senator Lindsey Graham, says the president will win in court on the national emergency and he has brand-new data about what's going on in the border. And he will says, it will prove it. He's coming up. Also, Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intel Committee, investigating the president, says there is enormous amounts of evidence. We will ask him about that. And Senator Rand Paul who has been challenging the president's stance on the border and on Afghanistan. But first up, Democrat Senator Mark Warner and Republican Senator Richard Burr, have been investigating the president Russian collusion as, you know, for two years. As we anticipate the imminent maybe possibly release of the separate Mueller report, Senator Warner says there is plenty of evidence despite this from his Republican chairman."

Attempt to interfere on behalf of President Trump more so than Hillary Clinton.

We know based upon Michael Cohen's testimony last week that President Trump knew about and was negotiating with the Russians well past when he announced his campaign, well into the primary season in 2016. We know that there was, at least, some indication that he, Trump knew about the potential leakage of all the DNC materials from WikiLeaks, literally days before it was released. We know that Paul Manafort, the president's campaign manager turned over information to the Russia -- a Russian agent in terms of campaign data. We know that potentially, Donald Trump knew about the famous Trump Tower meeting with a Russian agent. So. I'm just saying --"

Why was Cohen and all of the Trump organization denying these ongoing conversations? I think most primary voters would actually think it's relevant that a candidate for president is still trying to do business with Russia. I'm not saying that in itself is illegal, but I think it is a relevant factor most voters would want to have."

So, it's very hard to understand -- you know, and President Obama said, you know, that Mitt Romney should take his 1980s foreign policy back. We were not in a moment where there was a -- and you know, as we now know, in terms of election interference, we should have been smarter about all of that. But in terms of the actual what you call collaboration or communication, that seems like a far cry from you know, conspiracy to get together with the administration and the Russian government to try to throw the election."

More Manafort, for example, tied up with the judicial proceedings and the legal consequences out of Mueller. You know, we've not been able to have the full time that could get them in for questioning, because they've got the go through the legal process because they're -- they pled guilty to a variety of charges. Those proceedings have to finish before we get access to some of the key witnesses."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And when Mueller issues his report, I don't think he's going to find any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. I can tell you this.

I like what he's doing, he's rebuilding the military, he cut our taxes, he destroyed the caliphate, he got out of the Iran nuclear deal, he's got rocket man at the table, he's -- he regulating the country, you put Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on the bench. From my point of view, he's exceeded every expectation I had. And ashamedly want him to be successful. When I disagree with him, I'll tell him so but nothing's happened to me. The only time you can be seen as a good Republican by liberal side of the equation is when you attack in a Republican. I had my shot at President Trump, the American people chose him.

But by having a small footprint behind of Americans will get more Europeans, ISIS won't come back, Turkey and the Kurds won't go to war with each other, and Iran and Russia won't benefit from the hasty withdrawal. I think this was a smart decision. And President Trump did something Obama would never do. Listen to people in a just strategy. If Obama had listened to people in Iraq, there would be no ISIS.

But here is what the president, and I talked about for an hour and a half today that he's disappointed that he's not able to convince Republicans that this is an emergency. Again, I've been dealing with this issue for a decade. If families get to America, they're released within 20 days, if an unaccompanied minor makes it into our custody, only two percent are returned to the country where they came from. We're sending a signal to all over Central America, if you can make it to America, you're going to stay. We're being overwhelmed, we're on track to have 650,000 illegal immigrants apprehended in 2019. It is a crisis. The legal authority the president is using has been used 50 times. He has the statutory authority given to him by Congress to take money from the military construction budget, and apply it to an emergency situation. He's on a sound legal footing.

So freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaking out against the war on terror calling the 9/11 response \"disastrous and wrong.\" She writes, I remember a time when it was unacceptable to question the Iraq war. All of Congress was wrong including both the GOP and Dem party and led my generation into a disastrous plus wrong war that virtually all would come to regret. She then eventually corrected herself.

Now, as the war has dragged on for the last who knows five or ten years, I think we've lost our mission. I think the mission is creped. I think that now there really is no military solution in Afghanistan, it's become more of a nation-building enterprise. So I would say now that most generals, most Republicans, Democrats, Independents, actually most people you ask say there is no longer a military solution to the Afghan war. And that's why today you know, I introduced legislation to end the war and give every one of our veterans over there who have served in that theater $2,500 apiece but declare victory and come home."

I've talked to the President many times on this and he says he's ready to start saving that money. And I thought what better way to spend some of it in the very beginning with a one-time bonus. It eats up about $8 billion but it's a one-time bonus and we would still save over $40 billion in the first year the war ends. But then every year after that, it's $50 billion savings a year.

And then there was this letter from 22 bipartisan members of Congress that said like you, we seek to ensure that all the gains made in Syria are not lost, that ISIS never returns, that Iran is not emboldened, and that we consolidate our gains and ensure the best outcome in Geneva for American interest. And the President to that with regard to removing troops from Syria said I agree 100 percent all is being done.

There might be a few of them running around scared but we basically wiped out and took their land from them. And that was the President's mission. That we've accomplished. But now there are people around the President trying to change the mission. There are people -- these are the stay forever crowd. They want to stay forever in Afghanistan, they want to stay forever in Syria, they want to stay forever in Iraq. But now they've changed the mission to say oh, we have to stay until Iran is no longer a problem. Well, Iran has got a long-standing relationship, so does Russia with Syria. If we're going to stay till there's no Russian or Iranian influence and everybody's holding hands and singing Kumbaya, we're going to be there a long time and I think it drains us of money and treasure. And when you have only a couple of hundred troops on the ground, I think they become a trip wire to something even worse or the potential for a disaster. What happens if there's a massacre of 200 people together in a barrack? So I think it's a mistake to have a real small force. It's actually worse than having a big force."

He's consistent with me every time that he is going to be the President that's going to end these wars. And then I hear in the media that somebody else is trying to change or modify what he said. But he's always consistent with me. He thinks we've been at war too long in Afghanistan and that we need to maintain a presence where if enemy's crop up, we could defeat them again. But that we shouldn't be doing nation-building and he gets as annoyed as I do with all the money we spend over there on hotels and gas stations and roads, bridges, schools, everything we're doing for them that we can't do for our own people here.

And if we learned anything from 2016, you know, we are in the midst of the biggest political upheaval in the past 50 years. Republicans responded by putting up somebody that was very different. We can I think, all agree that Donald Trump is not like all the others. And the Democratic Party, the problem that they did is they went with Hillary Clinton.

So, this caricature as if AOC is somehow calling all the shots happens to not be the case. And the problem Donald Trump now has is if you look at, again, national polls, 65 percent think he is dishonest, think he committed crimes before he was president. These are things they didn't think necessarily before 2016 but they do think it now. So that is a problem. I'm not dismissing the fact that he is going to be very competitive."

You know, if Democrats wind up with somebody, one of these people who is talking about socialism, talking about embracing, you know, Medicare for all, that destroys private health insurance, anything like that, I think Donald Trump wins the exact same way he won in 2016 by offering a different vision and more positive vision."

Consistent with classification, I don't want any classified information out there, I don't want grand jury material but there's a third point too, and Comey did this in July. He held a press conference and laid out all the evidence he had on someone that he wasn't going to indict. The Department of Justice does not speak through press conferences. They do not speak through reports. They speak through indictments. So, on the criminal side if you have enough, issue an indictment.

He has been obviously very, you know, upfront about his feelings about this whole case and I know you say he's been over his skis on it, what about the fact that he says that the president should do jail time?"

How about a presumption of innocence, is that OK for the president or you just want him to go straight to jail? I think it is reckless and irresponsible, especially for a former federal prosecutor, which is what Adam Schiff was or Jerry Nadler, who was the chairman of judiciary. Nadler over the weekend the president has committed a crime, obstruction of justice. There's been no trial. There's been no determination by 12 of your peers. There's no judge involved. Schiff says there's a very real prospect he's going to go to jail and Nadler says he committed a crime. We haven't even read the reports yet. There's not one single sentence of the Mueller report out and one of them got him convicted and the other one has gotten him in the bureau of prisons."

I want to get your quick thought on a completely different story out of South Carolina tonight because it's just unbelievable. The mayor of Lamar, South Carolina, Darnell Byrd McPherson claimed to be the victim of a hate crime. This seems to be going around. After she woke up and found a strange yellow substance, and I think we have pictures of this if they could put them up, kicked all over her car, she was trying to figure out who would do this to her car. Slime her entire car with all of this yellow stuff and she said \"I likened it to a hate crime because number one there's a history in our town of Lamar. It ignited some fear in our spirit.\" When I saw this but the police went out and investigated, Trey Gowdy, and what did they find? What did they decide it was?"
