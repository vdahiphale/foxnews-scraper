      "sentences": "Welcome to \"The Journal Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. The confirmation proceedings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh thrown into turmoil this week following accusations that he sexually assaulted a young woman more than three and a half decades ago. His accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, now tentatively agreeing to sit down with Senate Judiciary Committee members next week to answer questions about the alleged incident, which Kavanaugh has categorically and unequivocally denied. In a letter to Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, on Thursday, Kavanaugh asked for a hearing as soon as possible so that he can clear his name.  Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and columnists Kim Strassel and Mary Anastasia O'Grady.  So, Mary, what do you make about the nature of facts of this whole accusation?",

That's why I think it's very important that they don't start saying that she's not credible, very important that they don't say boy's will be boys. These are the kinds of things they should stay away from. The should listen to her. But they should also remember that believing her in the faith of him denying it categorically, well, that's destroying a person without any proof. And all of this idea that women will side with her, I don't think that's necessarily true. We all have fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, and we all would want them to be treated fairly in something like this. I think it's just as important they treat her fairly but also showing they are treating him fairly. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: So what does fairly mean? He makes this argument. This word gets tossed around a lot, fair. It's like when you were three years old and you had a fight with your brother. That's not fair. And your mother would say, well, life isn't fair. He's being asked to disprove an allegation that cannot be disproven. The standard has become, if he cannot disprove, then he should be disqualified from the Supreme Court.

This is -- if you go back look, there have been commissions that have studied this and put out proposals, and yet we've made little progress as a country. Absolutely, as economist, I can tell you that it's urgent we do that. But the near-term stress I think is really not something to be concerned about. In fact, I think that what we're seeing with really high GDP growth and the celebration of markets is a response to kind of releasing or opening up a valve, releasing a lot of pent-up demand for capital spending and so on because of the lower corporate tax rate. So that is reducing revenue this year because, like expensing, for example, is more costly when people are buying lots of machines but they buy all those machines and then the machines produce output in the future.

So if you adjust for taxes, of course, that is not going to give you a lot of help for wage growth, President Obama, because, for most people, taxes went up. For a lot of people, taxes went up.

The confirmation proceedings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh thrown into turmoil this week following accusations that he sexually assaulted a young woman more than three and a half decades ago. His accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, now tentatively agreeing to sit down with Senate Judiciary Committee members next week to answer questions about the alleged incident, which Kavanaugh has categorically and unequivocally denied. In a letter to Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, on Thursday, Kavanaugh asked for a hearing as soon as possible so that he can clear his name. Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and columnists Kim Strassel and Mary Anastasia O'Grady. So, Mary, what do you make about the nature of facts of this whole accusation?"

But I think what matters here for the Republicans are the optics of the fair -- the optics in terms of fairness, that they are treating her fairly in her process of making the accusations and that they're treating the judge fairly in his response. That's why I think it's very important that they don't start saying that she's not credible, very important that they don't say boy's will be boys. These are the kinds of things they should stay away from. The should listen to her. But they should also remember that believing her in the faith of him denying it categorically, well, that's destroying a person without any proof. And all of this idea that women will side with her, I don't think that's necessarily true. We all have fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, and we all would want them to be treated fairly in something like this. I think it's just as important they treat her fairly but also showing they are treating him fairly. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: So what does fairly mean? He makes this argument. This word gets tossed around a lot, fair. It's like when you were three years old and you had a fight with your brother. That's not fair. And your mother would say, well, life isn't fair. He's being asked to disprove an allegation that cannot be disproven. The standard has become, if he cannot disprove, then he should be disqualified from the Supreme Court. On that is a complete overturning of reality."

They're going to fill judges, they're going to want to fill -- it's not just a question to the judiciary. Any person nominated for any position in the federal court or the federal government.

I ask that you bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time and place.\" By her own statement, she didn't tell anybody, much less the police."

      "speaker": "O'GRADY",

Whether she filed back then, people who have studied sexual assault cases say the victim often doesn't talk about at the time. Let's give her a pass on that. But the important thing is, when she wants to make an accusation now, I think she is to be more specific than she's been. Particularly, because the judge will have an opportunity to respond and you can't just be dragged out in the public square and hung without some specifics about what you supposedly have done. And that hasn't occurred yet."

And instead, she chose not to go down that route. And if we had these allegations come public after the hearings, after the process that's designed to weigh things like this.

If there's something of concern in that file, or if something else comes to the committee that would be relevant to that file, like a letter that Senator Feinstein received, that could be added to the file. If she raised this a couple months ago, I have no doubt that the committee probably would have sent out an FBI agent just to do an interview or two to make sure these allegations were in the file.

It's not a reasonable request for more information. Every -- every Senator on that committee knows how this works. They know that they could ask the questions themselves.

It is because they know this is a fabulous issue with their base. It really riles them up, gins up the enthusiasm. They will be out. They will claim, if they kill this, they will claim, look, give us a majority in the Senate and we will hold that seat open until 2020 when we can win back the White House. And conversely, it would be enormously demoralizing to Republicans who gave the Senate and the White House to Republicans, in part, to have a say over the Supreme Court, and they do not appreciate these tactics and they would consider it a failure of will by Republican leadership."

I think they have been confused by some polls, which seem to say that most people don't think the tax cuts were great, and, amazingly, didn't think their taxes were cut, even for more than 90 percent of people that did get a tax cut. But the statistics that matter, Americans understand the economies better. This is the one area where Trump actually is in positive territory, clearly, 50-51 percent, eight- point margin, approval on the economy versus disapproval. Since September of 2016, his wrong track/right track has improved by 25 points. So these are happy Americans who think the country is headed in a better direction. The Republicans can sell that."

So one of the things that happen was that we ran over, we ran the number. If you go back to January of 2017, the Congressional Budget Office said we would have about 2 percent growth this year, and instead, we are looking closer really to 3.5 percent growth. That extra 1.5 percent growth gives you so much revenue over 10 years that it's easy to envision the tax cuts on corporate side paying for themselves. It is really, really simple math. In fact, you saw Steve Moore in the Wall Street Journal this week actually laid it out in detail for the people, something I couldn't in White House press conference."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HASSETT",
      "utterance": "Yes. That is a great question. And the point is that if you get more GDP, you get more revenue from all sources, right? So if we have, you know, an extra dollar of GDP, then we are going to get about 18 cents of extra revenue and that is going to come from payroll taxes because people have jobs, from income tax because they have income, and also higher-than- baseline corporate tax. The corporate tax receipts this year down, but as you know, GDP is skyrocketing, markets are skyrocketing. That's going to five us a lot of capital gains revenue. All of that stuff adds up to a much better looking next 10 years than we thought just back in 2017 when President Trump was inaugurated."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HASSETT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that we should definitely be worried a lot about long-run deficits. And this country desperately needs a fiscal consolidation, something I have written about a lot before my public life began at the White House. A fiscal consolidation is when basically both parties get together, look at the long-run entitlement programs and everything else, they put everything on the table and they come up with a way to restore the long-run balance. This is -- if you go back look, there have been commissions that have studied this and put out proposals, and yet we've made little progress as a country. Absolutely, as economist, I can tell you that it's urgent we do that. But the near-term stress I think is really not something to be concerned about. In fact, I think that what we're seeing with really high GDP growth and the celebration of markets is a response to kind of releasing or opening up a valve, releasing a lot of pent-up demand for capital spending and so on because of the lower corporate tax rate. So that is reducing revenue this year because, like expensing, for example, is more costly when people are buying lots of machines but they buy all those machines and then the machines produce output in the future. So I think that the tax cuts are giving us more growth, that is going to put us in a better situation to deal with the long-run budget problem. But --"

Some of your critics say, look, we haven't had the increase in wages, particularly after inflation, that you guys promised. You did a different, a little bit of a different calculation and said, you know what, we're having bigger wage raises. How do you explain that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HASSETT",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, in fact, you know, it's very, very simple that the people who are saying that wages are not growing are excluding benefits. In fact, you guys in the Wall Street Journal had a great article about how benefits are skyrocketing. And they also don't account for tax cuts, which were pretty big. So if you want to know what is happening to the after-tax wage, which is what your viewers take home and it's the money they have, you know, after the government takes its part, that they can spend on rent and food and everything else -- the after-tax wage is growing over the last year about 1.5 percent after adjusting for inflation. And that's pretty healthy wage growth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Yes, but people say, hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys criticized us, the Obama people, because we didn't have rapid enough wage growth, and, suddenly, you are saying you are adding benefits and you are adding bonuses to that calculation. That is not the way -- that is not the way wages are usually calculated. They are done from, as you know, a basic Bureau of Labor stats calculation every month."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HASSETT",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think that what matters to Americans is the amount of money they have to take home and spend on their kids and everything else. And that was true for President Obama as well. And at the end of the Obama administration, they had wage growth that looked a little bit like what we're seeing right now. So if you adjust for taxes, of course, that is not going to give you a lot of help for wage growth, President Obama, because, for most people, taxes went up. For a lot of people, taxes went up. But if you adjust for benefits, it actually is a positive going way back. Because there has been maybe 10 or 15 years of really gradual shifts towards more benefits. So it is not -- the benefits, by the way, are not just health care spending. They are expanded benefits like more vacation days and stuff, going on right now. Especially in this tight labor market employers competing for workers with generous benefits. So it's not just health care."

We think 3.5 is about the sweet spot right now. We think that -- but there's a big range of possibilities. I think that the range -- 3.5 is a conservative call right now. And the odds of being above 4 are certainly a lot higher than the odds of being below 3. But my job is partly to be the conservative guy that keeps reminding people that bad things can happen.

They agreed to release them but stated so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key allies called to ask not to release. Therefore, the inspector general has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe he will move quickly on this. In the end, I can always declassify if it proves necessary. Speed is very important to me and everyone.\" We are back with Dan Henninger and Kim Strassel. So, Kim, this is a startling development here. We urged the president for weeks, months to declassify.

      "utterance": "Yes, it's a very disturbing development, Paul, because -- and I hate to say it -- but it looks like president got rolled here. He has the DOJ and the FBI, the same people that refused to release all of this, even to Congress, now go to the president with the exact same argument they used for why they didn't want to hand this over, even to members of the intelligence community to see. And somehow got into his head, and he has now agreed to have the inspector general review these questions of what will or will not be released."

      "utterance": "Yes?"

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "No. Go ahead. I mean, here is the question. He said this would somehow imping upon the Russia probe. How does more transparency hurt the Russia probe? This is about making documents public. It's not concealing them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Exactly. I mean I think, again, the entire point of putting these out is to provide clarity on the Russia probe. Now some of that may not speak well of the Department of Justice and the FBI and the product that was ultimately handed over to Bob Mueller. But be that as it may, it's something that the United States and the public still deserves to know about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, this is a claim, as well, that the foreign intelligence agencies didn't want it released, maybe because, you know, there might be some secrets in there that they would rather not have clues to. But presumably, that can be protected. And the DOJ and FBI have shown that when they redacted documents in this case, they redacted a lot of stuff that is not jeopardizing national security."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes. That is right. Look, at this point, we can only hypothesize, guess why President Trump walked this back. Here is my guess. That he is somehow being assured that Mueller has reached the end of his investigation, and he is not going to be called to account for the original collusion narrative with the Russians. Having said that, it is hard to see how this would be in his interest. Because the collusion narrative is based on, largely, the Steele dossier. The Steele dossier was being handed around by national intelligence, the CIA and FBI and, ultimately, the Washington press corps, which ran all these anonymous stories based on that. These documents were going to give us the beginning of a road map to who was doing what with that dossier. Presumably, if there was nothing there, that would be in the president's interest. So it's hard to understand why he has walked it back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, time is of the essence here, because if Republicans lose the House, as I expect they will, in November, the Democrats are going to take over House Intelligence Committee. Devin Nunes will be in the minority, if he is still in Congress. And they're going to shut this down, everything about the intelligence probe into the FBI and Justice Department, except for anything that relates to Trump and Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, shut it down on day one. You can rest assured that you are not going to find out anything more about what really happened in 2016 from a Democratic House. You are also not going to get it from the FBI or DOJ itself. And sadly, it seems we are not going to get any of it from the Mueller probe, who has decided not to look into this at all. So this is very crucial. The only other thing I can think of, too, Paul, is whether or not there were some members of Trump's national security team that, you know, in essence, threatened to resign or something if it went fully out unredacted. Perhaps this is a way of mitigating against that and trying to come to a compromise. It's just unclear what happened here."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "speaker": "HENNINGER",

He's looking for reconciliation, socially, politically, economically. I don't think denuclearization is top priority for him. It is for the United States. It is our central objective. I think we've got to stay close to President Moon so he doesn't make any concessions. It looks like he is trying to set up an industrial base on the northern side of the border, like we had once before, an economic industrial base. If he does that, that is violating U.N. sanctions."

Where are the researchers, where are the bombs, how many bombs do you have, where are your missile launches? The whole list of things to be able to know how big the program is, and how to verify whether they are giving it up. They haven't done any of that."

      "utterance": "The other evidence I've been looking at is that sanctions, which, for a while there, at least, looked to be really tightening, the enforcement of sanctions I mean. Now seem to be, this enforcement seems to be wearing down. The Russia, for example, have been blatantly violating sanctions."

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "You put your finger on the problem. Enforcement has always been the issue, even though people agree, Russians have never publicly agreed with sanctions, always violated them. The Chinese have opened the door wider and commodities are flowing into North Korea. It will take a lot of work on the part of the State Department -- they know it -- to keep the countries enforcing the sanctions when there's profit, and not enforcing it, and there's no missiles flying and there's no nuclear test taken. There is no aura of crisis, and that is why it is much more difficult. But this administration has got to press hard to do it, because our leverage is sanctions. Also, we can we can block aid ships from going into North Korea. We can get tougher. We can start saying we are not going to send families anymore into South Korea."

While I feel his frustration, one consequence is it overshadows some otherwise really important work at the Department of Justice. So, yes, this is a hit for Jeff Sessions for his very important remarks on the Frist Amendment on campus this week. And also for having directed his team to intervene in a number of cases on behalf of students who have had their free speech robbed by campus police and administrators. So put Russia side for a little bit. It is great to see a DOJ who again cares about the Constitution."

And her father's estate sold it for $10,000 in 2005 and it just went to auction for $450 million. Rather than bemoaning the money she could have had, she expressed gratitude for having had the painting in her home. And she said the idea just brings me alive."

A country, apparently, he can't tolerate. Was it North Korea? Was it Putin's Russia? Was it Cuba? No. It was a democracy called Israel.
