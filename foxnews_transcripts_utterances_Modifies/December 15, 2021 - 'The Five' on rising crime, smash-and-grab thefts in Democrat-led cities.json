COVID hysteria back in full force. Liberals are renewing their push to impose the forever pandemic on millions of weary Americans. New York and California join a growing a list of blue states with a statewide mask mandate for all public indoor spaces even if people are vaccinated. The freak out over omicron not lining up with the facts so far. Doctors say that the variant not as severe. Republicans in red states are pushing back and telling people it's time to stand up.",

A lot of the parents were furious about the lock -- the shutdowns of all the schools and the continued problems, but like the hypocrisy of you -- all the mom-and-pop shops had to close but the big box stores like Home Depot, et cetera, they could be open. So, then you had the other problem where you have fancy people who can go to a big party and mingle around without a mask but anybody who works there had to wear a mask. So there's a huge disconnect in the inequality in of -- this shaming is really big. We've never figured out a way to address natural immunity. We've never figured out a way to talk about the fact that we do have treatment. So like for example the David Dr idea is quite as you said, despicable, but it's also ridiculous because there are easy ways to treat it now with amazing advances in science. So speaking of science, the Democrats continue to get further and further away from it, which makes it harder to talk about the other issues that are important like climate change, which we're going to talk about later in the show. If you want to see Americans have a complete and total backlash, go ahead and have Eric Swalwell be the face of telling Americans that you are no longer allowed to travel. Let's see how that goes.",

So he's just doing this because he's a sad, sad loser. Anyway, we were talking about this a couple years ago when this was -- start -- when it started out, that the public wants risk management. That's all they're asking for. They can accept risk in their lives. Politicians are into lawyer management, right? They are terrified of being sued. They're also terrified of blood libel like if some people die, their opposition will say you have blood on your hands, you have blood on your hands, something that we were making fun of earlier. But the desires of people, Americans, are becoming less important than their -- than the politicians insurance premiums or the businesses insurance premiums. There really needs to be a grass roots kind of like tea party representation made up of all political stripes. You know, we are dealing -- this is an issue where government now is incompatible with the people it represents. And so you could be hyperbolic and say we need a divorce, we need a civil war, but what you really need is a hostage negotiator, right? We need somebody that can go to the leaders and talk -- and explain to them what the people want so there can be a compromise because this is not going to - - this is not going to end well for the politicians. I don't know what that kind of person is, but our leaders are being held hostage by lawyers and insurance companies, also the fear of blood libel, and they in turn are holding American, the American public hostage. So there, that's where you need the negotiation. Our leaders are no longer leading. They're actually crouching. They're trying to minimize themselves as a target, right? That's what they're doing. They're not standing up the way the governor of Florida is standing up and saying look, I'm ready to fight this. I'm ready to take this. Instead, they're like our governor, the New York governor or our mayor. They sit there and they just want to make sure they don't get sued or they don't get attacked. They are true and utter cowards because adults understand the nature of risk. They do. That's what makes you an adult.",

JPMorgan had to implement only vaccinated people can come in the building because the employees were so angry about how having to wear masks and being vaccinated in their workplace. I just want to point one more thing out. There is -- and Greg's talked about this endlessly -- COVID zero is a fallacy. It is never ever going to happen. And here's why I know, because a large number of deer have gotten COVID in this country. There have been different studies. One-third of deer were tested positive for COVID. There were like 80 percent of sample deer late last year, early this year had COVID. So basically the animal kingdom is going to be just spitting out new variants around the globe and so you'll never ever get rid of it. Just treat it like what it is.",

New York and California join a growing a list of blue states with a statewide mask mandate for all public indoor spaces even if people are vaccinated. The freak out over omicron not lining up with the facts so far. Doctors say that the variant not as severe. Republicans in red states are pushing back and telling people it's time to stand up."

It became very close and part of that was if you look the -- even at the Democrats say, if they look into the research as to why they lost. A lot of the parents were furious about the lock -- the shutdowns of all the schools and the continued problems, but like the hypocrisy of you -- all the mom-and-pop shops had to close but the big box stores like Home Depot, et cetera, they could be open. So, then you had the other problem where you have fancy people who can go to a big party and mingle around without a mask but anybody who works there had to wear a mask. So there's a huge disconnect in the inequality in of -- this shaming is really big. We've never figured out a way to address natural immunity. We've never figured out a way to talk about the fact that we do have treatment. So like for example the David Dr idea is quite as you said, despicable, but it's also ridiculous because there are easy ways to treat it now with amazing advances in science. So speaking of science, the Democrats continue to get further and further away from it, which makes it harder to talk about the other issues that are important like climate change, which we're going to talk about later in the show. If you want to see Americans have a complete and total backlash, go ahead and have Eric Swalwell be the face of telling Americans that you are no longer allowed to travel. Let's see how that goes."

So he's just doing this because he's a sad, sad loser. Anyway, we were talking about this a couple years ago when this was -- start -- when it started out, that the public wants risk management. That's all they're asking for. They can accept risk in their lives. Politicians are into lawyer management, right? They are terrified of being sued. They're also terrified of blood libel like if some people die, their opposition will say you have blood on your hands, you have blood on your hands, something that we were making fun of earlier. But the desires of people, Americans, are becoming less important than their -- than the politicians insurance premiums or the businesses insurance premiums. There really needs to be a grass roots kind of like tea party representation made up of all political stripes. You know, we are dealing -- this is an issue where government now is incompatible with the people it represents. And so you could be hyperbolic and say we need a divorce, we need a civil war, but what you really need is a hostage negotiator, right? We need somebody that can go to the leaders and talk -- and explain to them what the people want so there can be a compromise because this is not going to - - this is not going to end well for the politicians. I don't know what that kind of person is, but our leaders are being held hostage by lawyers and insurance companies, also the fear of blood libel, and they in turn are holding American, the American public hostage. So there, that's where you need the negotiation. Our leaders are no longer leading. They're actually crouching. They're trying to minimize themselves as a target, right? That's what they're doing. They're not standing up the way the governor of Florida is standing up and saying look, I'm ready to fight this. I'm ready to take this. Instead, they're like our governor, the New York governor or our mayor. They sit there and they just want to make sure they don't get sued or they don't get attacked. They are true and utter cowards because adults understand the nature of risk. They do. That's what makes you an adult."

And so, next time around, it's going to be even harder. JPMorgan had to implement only vaccinated people can come in the building because the employees were so angry about how having to wear masks and being vaccinated in their workplace. I just want to point one more thing out. There is -- and Greg's talked about this endlessly -- COVID zero is a fallacy. It is never ever going to happen. And here's why I know, because a large number of deer have gotten COVID in this country. There have been different studies. One-third of deer were tested positive for COVID. There were like 80 percent of sample deer late last year, early this year had COVID. So basically the animal kingdom is going to be just spitting out new variants around the globe and so you'll never ever get rid of it. Just treat it like what it is."

Meanwhile, who were dying? Minorities. Most of these victims are minorities. They're not whites.

Her role of a prosecutor was questionable. So, those are five variables. And if you were looking at them, you would have said, hell no as a VP choice. However, none of those variables mattered. They looked at one, and that was identity. And that was the one variable she could pass and it was the only variable that mattered.
