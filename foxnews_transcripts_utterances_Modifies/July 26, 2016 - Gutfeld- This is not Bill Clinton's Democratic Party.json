It's left-wing Raisin Bran with two extra scoops of socialism. Trashing evil banks, free trade, corporations and small businesses while expanding the size and scope of big government, Hernie has created a road map to success, found on spectacular display right now in Venezuela.   So this is not Bill Clinton's Democratic Party. It's not even a Democratic Party. It's now a slab of left-wing populism, democratic socialism and vile identity politics. Sanders endorses it, because he helped build this grim repudiation of the most successful system in history, and Hillary is fine with it, as is sad comic Sarah Silverman who relied on tired old jokes, and I don't mean Al Franken.",
