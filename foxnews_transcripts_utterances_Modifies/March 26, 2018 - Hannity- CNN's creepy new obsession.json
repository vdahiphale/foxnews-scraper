Breaking tonight, I have said it before, I will say it again and prove it, journalism -- so-called journalism in this country is dead and this weekend you witnessed just one more if not the final nail in the coffin. Well, now that the media's Russia obsession isn't exactly working out according to plan, well, instead of Russia, Russia, Russia, well, now, it's Stormy, Stormy, Stormy and more Stormy.  The mainstream media's non-stop assault on President Trump and his character and credibility has reached an even new low.  And then there's creepy Anderson Cooper along with the king of porn, soon to be scandal plagued Jeff Zucker fake news CNN, they're all leading the way. Tonight, we will show you, get your tape recorders running how this breathless hysteria surrounding Stormy Daniels exposes the blatant double standard within your mainstream media. And we'll give you our take on Stormy Daniels and the much hyped interview on '60 Minutes' last night.  Plus, despite the press in this country telling you would never happen, President Trump he is taking tough swift action against Russia expelling diplomats some of whom are spies from our borders and closing Russia's consulate in Seattle. We have that and more you do not want to miss our breaking news opening monologue.",

Look at this, CNN was running images all day long, oh there she is, porn star Stormy Daniels next to Karen McDougal. We're not making this up. There's a serious note to all this. And aside from Anderson's usually salacious interviews, the mainstream media's coverage of Daniels and McDougal is revealing a huge double standard in this country. You got allegations from a porn star about a one-time consensual relationship with Donald Trump gets round-the-clock coverage, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS conspiracy TV MSNBC and others. According to a study -- this is where we get serious -- from Newsbusters, between March 7th and March 25th, the evening newscast from just NBC, ABC, and CBS while they dedicated a whopping 40 minutes of airtime to Trump allegations of a consensual relationship. But for decades, the mainstream media has completely ignored serious stories of abuse. Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, all women that accused a former president, Bill Clinton, of serial predator like gross sexual misconduct, and the Media Research Center, they crunch those numbers. And according to their count, 1994, when Paula Jones came forward with details about Bill Clinton dropping his pants and exposing himself to her in a hotel room, CBS and NBC actually ignored the story. ABC, to their credit, gave a whopping 16 seconds of coverage. And then in 1997, when Kathleen Willey's allegations about Bill Clinton became public, that he groped and grabbed and fondled and touched and kissed her against her will, oh, CBS and NBC gave it one minute and 34 seconds of coverage, ABC didn't touch the story. But in fairness to Ed Bradley, who did pass away, he did do an interview on '60 Minutes' with Kathleen and I believe he talked to Paula. But CNN's evening newscast dedicated just 26 seconds of coverage -- being different CNN then and now. And in 1998, when news broke about Juanita Broaddrick's serious claims that she was raped by Bill Clinton in the '70s, ABC, CBS, they didn't find a spare second to cover it. And meanwhile, Lisa Myers from NBC, she booked the first interview with Juanita Broaddrick, and according to a report from 'The Washington Post', for over a month, NBC chief Andy Lack and others prevented the interview from airing because they said they were unable to corroborate her story. Right here on the Fox News Channel, Brit Hume, remember and others, were wearing free Lisa Myers buttons on air to encourage NBC to release that extremely important interview. When the mainstream media eventually did cover the stories of Bill Clinton's accusers, the reporting was often dismissive. Let's take a look at some of the clips provided to us, thanks to the Media Research Center.",

They take accusations and about 12 years ago about an alleged consensual encounter between Trump and Stormy Daniels, and they turn it into a weeks and weeks long scandal but even up until November of 2016, they were totally timid as it relates to Bill Clinton's serial predatory behavior, almost ignoring all the allegations. Think of this -- rape, groping, fondling, touching, kissing against one woman's will, exposing yourself. You know, when it comes to Bill Clinton, OK, they're not going to fixate on any of it, but every detail of an alleged consensual relationship as it relates to Donald Trump over a decade ago. Journalism is dead and every day gets very deeper and deeper. Which brings us to our next top story that the media will not talk about tonight and that is their narrative the Trump-Russia collusion narrative suffered yet another blow today. And in response to Putin's sanction nerve attack against an agent, against an ex-spy in Great Britain, the Trump administration announced they're kicking out 60 Russian diplomats in this country including some who are believed to be spies operating in the U.S. and a Russian consulate in Seattle was ordered closed because of its proximity to a U.S. naval base. The expelled Russians will have just seven days to leave this country and while President Trump takes serious action against Russia on something we didn't see until the final weeks of the Obama administration you might remember when the mainstream media was predicting that Donald Trump would do the exact opposite, that President Trump was some kind of shill for Vladimir Putin, or Brennan saying last week, oh, maybe they've got something on Donald Trump.",

And our next guest, Monica Crowley, wrote an op-ed in 'The Hill' today titled: The voters care about Trump's sexual history, ask Bill Clinton. She joins us, now along with CRTV host Michelle Malkin.

But all of this hysterical coverage over Stormy Daniels, you know, we all know sex sells. OK, that's part of it. But this breathless coverage looks like a 'Saturday Night Live' skit and the point, Sean, is that they are so desperate to try to get Trump on anything. And now that the Russian collusion story is falling apart, at least with regards to Trump and his team, it's certainly in play with Hillary Clinton in the DNC and the Democrats. But now that that line is falling apart, they've got to come up with a new narrative. So what they're doing with Stormy Daniels it's not about the consensual sex from over a decade ago. They're trying to nail him on some sort of violation of campaign finance law. They're dying for a Trump stag tape to come out at some point that they can roll anything to embarrass and use as a weapon against Donald Trump they will find.",

The greatest hypocrisy and Monica knows this well because we've lived it as conservative women in public for 20, 25, 30 years, is that when these Me-Too radical feminists say believe all women, there is a massive exception in that rule, and that is never believe a conservative woman or a Republican woman who is turning the tables and exposing the sexual predation of Democratic and liberal men.",

He taught the American voter, taught the American people not to regard this with kind of thing with any kind of real importance, right? To treat it as irrelevant. What happens in a presidential bedroom where before a man becomes president stays in the bedroom, right, especially if it's consensual. We're not talking about non-consensual here.

And not only that, it also opened up the door for the SR-300 missiles, their defensive missiles that the Russians were going to sell and did sell to Iran so that they could defend these power plants that we were so intent on finding more information about these nuclear reactors that we believe they were using for their nuclear program.

Breaking tonight, I have said it before, I will say it again and prove it, journalism -- so-called journalism in this country is dead and this weekend you witnessed just one more if not the final nail in the coffin. Well, now that the media's Russia obsession isn't exactly working out according to plan, well, instead of Russia, Russia, Russia, well, now, it's Stormy, Stormy, Stormy and more Stormy. The mainstream media's non-stop assault on President Trump and his character and credibility has reached an even new low. And then there's creepy Anderson Cooper along with the king of porn, soon to be scandal plagued Jeff Zucker fake news CNN, they're all leading the way. Tonight, we will show you, get your tape recorders running how this breathless hysteria surrounding Stormy Daniels exposes the blatant double standard within your mainstream media. And we'll give you our take on Stormy Daniels and the much hyped interview on '60 Minutes' last night. Plus, despite the press in this country telling you would never happen, President Trump he is taking tough swift action against Russia expelling diplomats some of whom are spies from our borders and closing Russia's consulate in Seattle. We have that and more you do not want to miss our breaking news opening monologue."

Look at this, CNN was running images all day long, oh there she is, porn star Stormy Daniels next to Karen McDougal. We're not making this up. There's a serious note to all this. And aside from Anderson's usually salacious interviews, the mainstream media's coverage of Daniels and McDougal is revealing a huge double standard in this country. You got allegations from a porn star about a one-time consensual relationship with Donald Trump gets round-the-clock coverage, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS conspiracy TV MSNBC and others. According to a study -- this is where we get serious -- from Newsbusters, between March 7th and March 25th, the evening newscast from just NBC, ABC, and CBS while they dedicated a whopping 40 minutes of airtime to Trump allegations of a consensual relationship. But for decades, the mainstream media has completely ignored serious stories of abuse. Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, all women that accused a former president, Bill Clinton, of serial predator like gross sexual misconduct, and the Media Research Center, they crunch those numbers. And according to their count, 1994, when Paula Jones came forward with details about Bill Clinton dropping his pants and exposing himself to her in a hotel room, CBS and NBC actually ignored the story. ABC, to their credit, gave a whopping 16 seconds of coverage. And then in 1997, when Kathleen Willey's allegations about Bill Clinton became public, that he groped and grabbed and fondled and touched and kissed her against her will, oh, CBS and NBC gave it one minute and 34 seconds of coverage, ABC didn't touch the story. But in fairness to Ed Bradley, who did pass away, he did do an interview on '60 Minutes' with Kathleen and I believe he talked to Paula. But CNN's evening newscast dedicated just 26 seconds of coverage -- being different CNN then and now. And in 1998, when news broke about Juanita Broaddrick's serious claims that she was raped by Bill Clinton in the '70s, ABC, CBS, they didn't find a spare second to cover it. And meanwhile, Lisa Myers from NBC, she booked the first interview with Juanita Broaddrick, and according to a report from 'The Washington Post', for over a month, NBC chief Andy Lack and others prevented the interview from airing because they said they were unable to corroborate her story. Right here on the Fox News Channel, Brit Hume, remember and others, were wearing free Lisa Myers buttons on air to encourage NBC to release that extremely important interview. When the mainstream media eventually did cover the stories of Bill Clinton's accusers, the reporting was often dismissive. Let's take a look at some of the clips provided to us, thanks to the Media Research Center."

      "utterance": "By the way, that's pretty pathetic and in that last clip that we showed, Andrea Mitchell, NBC actually edited the online version to remove her using the word discredited. What we just showed you is appalling. In just a few minutes, by the way, Paul Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, they will react to this double standard right here in studio to shed some light on how they have been treated by the liberal media. But it's very clear the mainstream media shrouds itself in moral superiority in order to just slam Donald Trump, but then get down in the gutter to defend all things Clinton. They take accusations and about 12 years ago about an alleged consensual encounter between Trump and Stormy Daniels, and they turn it into a weeks and weeks long scandal but even up until November of 2016, they were totally timid as it relates to Bill Clinton's serial predatory behavior, almost ignoring all the allegations. Think of this -- rape, groping, fondling, touching, kissing against one woman's will, exposing yourself. You know, when it comes to Bill Clinton, OK, they're not going to fixate on any of it, but every detail of an alleged consensual relationship as it relates to Donald Trump over a decade ago. Journalism is dead and every day gets very deeper and deeper. Which brings us to our next top story that the media will not talk about tonight and that is their narrative the Trump-Russia collusion narrative suffered yet another blow today. And in response to Putin's sanction nerve attack against an agent, against an ex-spy in Great Britain, the Trump administration announced they're kicking out 60 Russian diplomats in this country including some who are believed to be spies operating in the U.S. and a Russian consulate in Seattle was ordered closed because of its proximity to a U.S. naval base. The expelled Russians will have just seven days to leave this country and while President Trump takes serious action against Russia on something we didn't see until the final weeks of the Obama administration you might remember when the mainstream media was predicting that Donald Trump would do the exact opposite, that President Trump was some kind of shill for Vladimir Putin, or Brennan saying last week, oh, maybe they've got something on Donald Trump."

But all of this hysterical coverage over Stormy Daniels, you know, we all know sex sells. OK, that's part of it. But this breathless coverage looks like a 'Saturday Night Live' skit and the point, Sean, is that they are so desperate to try to get Trump on anything. And now that the Russian collusion story is falling apart, at least with regards to Trump and his team, it's certainly in play with Hillary Clinton in the DNC and the Democrats. But now that that line is falling apart, they've got to come up with a new narrative. So what they're doing with Stormy Daniels it's not about the consensual sex from over a decade ago. They're trying to nail him on some sort of violation of campaign finance law. They're dying for a Trump stag tape to come out at some point that they can roll anything to embarrass and use as a weapon against Donald Trump they will find."

And so, it is not past history as I said before as we've talked about before to bring up that hypocrisy and make them confront it. What CNN and CBS are guilty of is softcore journalism driven by a hardcore obsession to bring this president down. The greatest hypocrisy and Monica knows this well because we've lived it as conservative women in public for 20, 25, 30 years, is that when these Me-Too radical feminists say believe all women, there is a massive exception in that rule, and that is never believe a conservative woman or a Republican woman who is turning the tables and exposing the sexual predation of Democratic and liberal men."

Then you compare it to rape, groping, grabbing, touching, fondling, kissing against Kathleen as well, Paula Jones and dropping his pants, and they did everything they could do to ignore it, and not hold Hillary accountable for defending him."

I mean, the double standard is glaring, but the idea that the leftist media would think that the Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal stories are going to stick and somehow damage Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, who they aided and abetted all those years ago and continued to do so, by the way, he rewrote the playbook on this. He taught the American voter, taught the American people not to regard this with kind of thing with any kind of real importance, right? To treat it as irrelevant. What happens in a presidential bedroom where before a man becomes president stays in the bedroom, right, especially if it's consensual. We're not talking about non-consensual here. He rewrote the rules here and now Donald Trump is saying, look, he's not saying anything. He's being defended. This is a long-ago thing. So, if we want to apply the rules that Bill Clinton put into place, well, why not? Then it should be the same standard."

If you start what we started a few months ago we believe that there was one red flag, one reason for Barack Obama not to give all this uranium to the Russians in the forms of billions of dollars of contract the Uranium One sale. He approved all those things. We know for the first time that he also was passing along a second red flag. Russia, ROSATOM was assisting Iran's illicit nuclear program. He gave very specific details. And tonight after my story broke I got a call from some intelligence sources they gave me a little bit more information. Doug Campbell was providing information about the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant in Iran. Russia was helping that specifically plant. Why is that important? The U.S. was so concerned about that they eventually unleashed the Stuxnet virus for Israel targeting that very plant. So it was a place we were very concerned about. Doug Campbell was telling the Obama administration early on this is a problem."

So what we are saying here, Sara, is that Campbell identifying this specific nuclear Russian plant, nuclear plant, the Iranian nuclear plant, but the Russians are helping. Now that goes into the Obama deal to give them all of that money. That goes into Campbell knew all this 18 months before they signed off on the Uranium One deal? They knew about all the crimes."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS",

When the Obama administration in 2010 decided to reset with Russia, they basically pulled away the sanctions that have been put in place by the Bush administration. And when they did that, it opened the gateway. It allowed the Russians to enter our uranium market, our energy market. But at the same time it allowed the Russians to continue working with the Iranians. And at that point in time, I mean, that Campbell was providing all of this information the Obama administration was well aware of it. And not only that, it also opened up the door for the SR-300 missiles, their defensive missiles that the Russians were going to sell and did sell to Iran so that they could defend these power plants that we were so intent on finding more information about these nuclear reactors that we believe they were using for their nuclear program. Not just for medical use but to build missiles to build war heads. And these nuclear power plants were so important at that time to our congressional leaders that they didn't want these any of these plants to go through. That's why there were so many people fighting the Uranium One deal."

I know it's not to the level of Stormy Daniels the porn star. But when it deals with -- Sara is laughing. But seriously, this is America's national security.

But to my knowledge, they haven't even requested it. And the other thing that Congress should ask for is the presidential briefings of President Obama during that time as daily presidential briefings. Because Mr. Campbell was told that the president was receiving information about this investigation. What did Obama know when he was sucking up to the Iranians and also sucking up to the Russians in 2009 and 2010?"

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",

Someone made a decision we're going to turn the other way and try to get a deal with Russia. It's didn't happen and we got pleas for a lot of uranium contracts. Congress has interviewed him but they haven't gone further in trying to get these documents.
