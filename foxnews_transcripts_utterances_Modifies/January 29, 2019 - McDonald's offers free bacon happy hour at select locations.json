In many places, it already is, with bone-chilling temperatures and life-threatening windchills, forcing schools already to close and planes to stay on the ground. Nearly 250 Americans are being urged to bundle up because they're right in its path. And so it goes.  Welcome, everybody. And welcome to your frigid world.  We have got Fox team coverage with Mike Tobin in Chicago, where temperatures are plunging, and Adam Klotz at the Fox Weather Center on how fast this thing is going to be spreading.  So, let's first get to read from Adam, what we're looking at. Adam, what is it?",

Some of this snow we saw yesterday moving across the Upper Midwest, and there has been snow in Chicago across Michigan, this now moving to the Northeast, and it's behind this system that we're going to see the numbers really start to fall, already areas getting down to negative 18 now in Chicago, 36 degrees in Minneapolis.  And you would like to think that this is as cold as it's get -- going to get, but we really haven't seen anything yet. These numbers are going to drop drastically farther. So we have got windchill advisory stretching across a large portion of the Upper Plains states, the Great Lakes states and even as far south as Kentucky, so running along the Ohio River Valley.   We have got the advisories in position where these numbers are going to fall in a big way. This is your future forecast. Now, you can pay attention to the time stamp, and you see overnight tonight into early tomorrow morning widespread, negative 32 degrees in Detroit, 30 in Indianapolis, negative 50 degrees tomorrow morning in Chicago, the same as the case up in Minneapolis. It continues. Now, it's bad on Wednesday, all day Wednesday, never getting much more warmer than negative 40-ish in Chicago. And then you say the same thing on Thursday morning, where, again, these temperatures are down into the negative 30- to 40-degree range. At this point, it does begin to push up along the East Coast a bit, never to the negative 30 and 40s, but still temperatures very, very cold. And you know what? It's not just these areas I was highlighting. That's where it's going to get down to those negative 30, 40, 50.   But if you're just looking for freezing temperatures, this is where you get hundreds of millions. Neil, down along the Gulf Coast, things are going to be freezing, temperatures in the upper 20s on Wednesday morning. This is a huge chill that a lot of folks are going to be dealing with.",

That will be next Tuesday. And the president sending Speaker Pelosi back a letter saying: \"It will be my pleasure to come and speak to you. We have got a great story to tell, great goals to achieve.\" Clearly, there will be some talk about the need for border security in the president's speech, but also he's going to be talking about what he believes are the successes of his administration over the last year and some of his priorities going forward, including immigration reform, infrastructure reform, drug pricing and health care, trade and deregulation.

When we did a regime change in Panama in 1989, that was 28,000 troops in a night raid essentially that lasted couple of days. And in Haiti in 1994, that was another close to 28,000. The U.S. led the coalition to do that. So obviously 5,000 does not get you a regime change.

Because right now you can get whatever you want, whatever McDonald's sells -- so if you want to make a McFlurry with bacon, you got it. You want apple pie with bacon, and you got it. Basically, whatever's on their menu, you can get free bacon on the side for this hour. So you said it. It's all participating McDonald's. It's nationwide. And the idea is just to have some fun. I was talking to one of the two people in management here. And they said, look, this just seems like a fun thing to do. It's the middle of winter. Everybody is cold. Everybody's borderline hibernating right now. And the idea is to drive sales, not surprisingly, for some of the more traditional pieces, I guess, or more traditional recipes that we think of. So McDonald's is going to begin to order or promote a little bit more heavily that Quarter Bacon with cheese, Big Mac with bacon and cheese, and then of course, cheese fries, also with bacon. So that is the purpose of this. We also know one of the competitors, Wendy's, for example, offering free Baconator cheeseburgers all week. So, McDonald's not alone in this. We do know McDonald's is going to be posting earnings tomorrow. So, obviously, this will not show up in tomorrow's numbers. But it's pretty festive down here. So, Neil, as people have been coming in and out, I have been talking to them, saying, OK, did you come here for this special hour? And so what a lot of people told me is they didn't come here specifically to have bacon added on to their orders, but now that they're here, I have seen a few people walking around with some bacon strips. So, Neil, even one young lady who came in for one of the coffee drinks actually got a side of bacon. I guess if it's here and it's free, why not, Neil?",

In many places, it already is, with bone-chilling temperatures and life-threatening windchills, forcing schools already to close and planes to stay on the ground. Nearly 250 Americans are being urged to bundle up because they're right in its path. And so it goes. Welcome, everybody. And welcome to your frigid world. We have got Fox team coverage with Mike Tobin in Chicago, where temperatures are plunging, and Adam Klotz at the Fox Weather Center on how fast this thing is going to be spreading. So, let's first get to read from Adam, what we're looking at. Adam, what is it?"

Some of this snow we saw yesterday moving across the Upper Midwest, and there has been snow in Chicago across Michigan, this now moving to the Northeast, and it's behind this system that we're going to see the numbers really start to fall, already areas getting down to negative 18 now in Chicago, 36 degrees in Minneapolis. And you would like to think that this is as cold as it's get -- going to get, but we really haven't seen anything yet. These numbers are going to drop drastically farther. So we have got windchill advisory stretching across a large portion of the Upper Plains states, the Great Lakes states and even as far south as Kentucky, so running along the Ohio River Valley. We have got the advisories in position where these numbers are going to fall in a big way. This is your future forecast. Now, you can pay attention to the time stamp, and you see overnight tonight into early tomorrow morning widespread, negative 32 degrees in Detroit, 30 in Indianapolis, negative 50 degrees tomorrow morning in Chicago, the same as the case up in Minneapolis. It continues. Now, it's bad on Wednesday, all day Wednesday, never getting much more warmer than negative 40-ish in Chicago. And then you say the same thing on Thursday morning, where, again, these temperatures are down into the negative 30- to 40-degree range. At this point, it does begin to push up along the East Coast a bit, never to the negative 30 and 40s, but still temperatures very, very cold. And you know what? It's not just these areas I was highlighting. That's where it's going to get down to those negative 30, 40, 50. But if you're just looking for freezing temperatures, this is where you get hundreds of millions. Neil, down along the Gulf Coast, things are going to be freezing, temperatures in the upper 20s on Wednesday morning. This is a huge chill that a lot of folks are going to be dealing with."

It was a ludicrous gesture. A few weeks ago, she said she would support a dollar for border security. OK, let's talk serious. What is your offer? If it's not $5.7 billion, which is what the experts said, then what is your number and how do you back it up?

The open borders crowd on the left might be representing a narrow element of the liberal base, but most Americans want to secure the border. We're the most generous nation in the world on immigration. We let more than a million people in a year legally. But we have to secure the border, stop the drugs and the criminal elements that are coming into our country every single day."

Do you think that this could be a party revolt if it turns into the president saying, all right, well, shut her down?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "No. And, in fact, I think that's why it's so important that the president latest case out next week. On February 5, I think you're going to see a heightened level of number -- millions of Americans watching a State of the Union that maybe don't normally watch it, because they're hearing about all of this back and forth. OK, what's this really about? What is the debate about? They're going to see President Trump laying out the case for securing America's border, what it's going to take, just exactly what happens every day. There are bad things that happen every day that most Americans never hear about. So let's actually lay that case out, and then we will see where -- where everybody's going to be. If Democrats want to stick with Nancy Pelosi and be for open borders, I think they're going to be on the wrong side of history on this argument."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "It's clearly possible. And I think what you just played there is an example of where a lot of Democrats are. The president said, I don't need a sea-to-shining-sea wall. But there's about 550 miles of completely unprotected area, where we know bad things, drugs, human trafficking, even murders, come across the border. Let's start focusing on that area. And if Nancy Pelosi really doesn't want a wall, President Trump said, hey, I will be willing to let you put in language that bans cement wall, but have some form of physical barriers. The steel slat barriers right now are what the experts say works the best. Let the experts figure that out. You don't need Washington politicians telling you how to build a physical barrier to protect America and keep us safe. Let the people who risk their lives keeping us safe do the best job with the money that they need. Let's have that debate. There's a conference committee now. Let the Republicans and Democrats House and Senate members of that conference committee start the work today. They have got a few weeks to do this. I think we could solve this in a matter of hours if everybody gets in a room, puts the partisanship on the side, and the personality differences on the side. This is about keeping America safe. Let's get it done."

It's been the facts. You will lay the facts on the table. Let's figure out the best way to get it done. So, if there's backstabbing, I haven't seen it in meetings. The meetings I have been in have been focused on results for the American people. And we have delivered some. There are a lot more we need to deliver. That's where I spend my time. So if somebody left to go write a book, they probably weren't in the middle of the action anyway. Why don't we keep focused on what we need to do to get the country back on track and debate the differences, so that we can ultimately flush this out.

Now what happens? Retired Four-Star General Jack Keane on all of this. General, first of all, the back and forth on how we would force the issue in presumably with that 5,000-troop notation on Ambassador Bolton's pad, what did you make of it?"

But what could 5,000 troops realistically do, if the mission is something to do with Venezuela and Maduro? Certainly, it could not conduct a regime change. When we did a regime change in Panama in 1989, that was 28,000 troops in a night raid essentially that lasted couple of days. And in Haiti in 1994, that was another close to 28,000. The U.S. led the coalition to do that. So obviously 5,000 does not get you a regime change. It would be likely in the event that we have a security problem with our Americans who are at the embassy, and it would exceed the capability of some Marines that are also on standby to go in there, which is a smaller group. It's called a FAST group, to use an abbreviation. I apologize for that. So I think it's a -- it's a precautionary measure that's being taken in the event that we have an unforeseen emergency."

We argue that he does not represent the will of the people, and this opposition leader, Juan Guaido, does. And to put the pressure on, besides these 5,000 troops in Colombia, which might or might not be in the plans, but they're raising eyebrows, we have obviously got this move against the state-run oil company to freeze it, essentially, getting its goods out and back to the government. So how does that affect the generals who typically have been and remain behind Maduro? What would shake them off?"

But, like all sanctions, it takes a while for that impact that to occur. The generals are fundamentally corrupt. This is a dictatorship, a repressive regime. They're being paid off by Maduro and other regime leaders. So, clearly, their loyalty and their future is tied to him. I think Guaido has done a good thing by saying, listen, I'm guaranteeing you amnesty if you walk away from supporting Maduro. They have to be convinced that that's a fact. And that alone won't move them, unless they absolutely see total collapse in the country. The other thing, I'm hoping -- and I'm convinced we likely are, because the national security team around the president is so strong -- they are likely working on, Neil, a pathway to exit Maduro to an exile someplace with no recriminations back in Venezuela for criminal activity, repression, et cetera, kind of the way Reagan did Ferdinand Marcos in 1986."

And the administration certainly engineered the right answer to that. This is more complicated, because we may not have the relationships with Maduro that Americans had certainly with Ferdinand Marcos for years, but there are other people in the region who do. Likely, that is going on. And it's not visible to us. And, hopefully, that will be the answer."

By the way, Apple is out after the bell with earnings and revenues that apparently beat the Street and sales of products that beat the Street as well. It's also giving a slightly more than expected upbeat forecast, enough to propel the stock about 2.5 percent in after-hours trading. We will have more after this."

Obviously, it has a large impact, if you look at all or indexes, because it's very heavily weighted. This could be the phase two of this relief rally. The rest of the market has bounced back, whereas Apples been stuck awaiting these earnings. They weren't disappointed. And we're seeing an initial reaction that's positive. Let's see if it can build on these gains. It's a stock that's been stuck between $140 and $160. That target is $180, on a bit of a bounce here. So I'm rather optimistic, and I think everyone's going to realize how much money Apple truly makes every quarter."

But it's better than we expected marginally, like a penny a share. So, again, it's great for the stock right now. But this could be problems. Luckily, they're squeezing money out of the existing monopoly, which is services to the installed user base."

      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this can be a relief rally, like I said, a secondary catalyst for the market comeback, after that extreme low that we have had in December. I think everybody was waiting to see exactly what happened here. They still sold 50 million phones. So we're talking about a lot of phones here. Apple is still doing very, very well. We can't state that enough. I mean, the revenue wasn't -- more than $80 billion. Yes, it was knocked down. They knocked down expectations. But that's what this game sometimes is. So let's see what the next step is. But I would rather be positive, rather than be bullish on that stock at these levels. We have come back to the level where we were in 2017, and we broke out about $150. So let's see if that holds as a long-term support. It's at a discount, and I still think it's a healthy company."

Now, I know what a lot of you are thinking. Neil, do not touch that bacon, because we know you had heart surgery a couple of years, and it's very, very bad. Now, I might point out that my cardiologist at the time and the fellow who did the heart surgery and the keeper of these very embarrassing pictures at the time said, everything is OK in moderation. What he didn't realize, when that picture was snapped, is that, in my other hand, I had a big old wad of bacon there. And that's the cardiologist's assistant telling me, Neil, not a good idea. Anyway, what is going on here with this, even whether you do it in moderation, as my cardiologist said at the time? Deirdre Bolton, this is big, huh?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "This is big, Neil. We're right in the middle -- or, I guess, getting towards the end of bacon hour here at this particular McDonald's at 28th Street, Sixth Avenue. So I have been talking to people who have been coming in and out, saying, did you come here for the bacon? Because right now you can get whatever you want, whatever McDonald's sells -- so if you want to make a McFlurry with bacon, you got it. You want apple pie with bacon, and you got it. Basically, whatever's on their menu, you can get free bacon on the side for this hour. So you said it. It's all participating McDonald's. It's nationwide. And the idea is just to have some fun. I was talking to one of the two people in management here. And they said, look, this just seems like a fun thing to do. It's the middle of winter. Everybody is cold. Everybody's borderline hibernating right now. And the idea is to drive sales, not surprisingly, for some of the more traditional pieces, I guess, or more traditional recipes that we think of. So McDonald's is going to begin to order or promote a little bit more heavily that Quarter Bacon with cheese, Big Mac with bacon and cheese, and then of course, cheese fries, also with bacon. So that is the purpose of this. We also know one of the competitors, Wendy's, for example, offering free Baconator cheeseburgers all week. So, McDonald's not alone in this. We do know McDonald's is going to be posting earnings tomorrow. So, obviously, this will not show up in tomorrow's numbers. But it's pretty festive down here. So, Neil, as people have been coming in and out, I have been talking to them, saying, OK, did you come here for this special hour? And so what a lot of people told me is they didn't come here specifically to have bacon added on to their orders, but now that they're here, I have seen a few people walking around with some bacon strips. So, Neil, even one young lady who came in for one of the coffee drinks actually got a side of bacon. I guess if it's here and it's free, why not, Neil?"

Everybody plays these boxes. And you pick a number, and then -- or you pick a box, and then you find out if you get a shot to win. It's like a lottery at the Super Bowl party. It's still illegal.

The difference for the NFL, why they're going to get it right, you had a sports book in New Jersey that does mobile sports betting. And they told anybody who bet on the Saints, whether it was straight up or with the point spread, we're giving you your bet back. We're going to credit your bet.
