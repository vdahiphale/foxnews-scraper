On the right side of your screen, Hurricane Dorian strengthening into a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it bears down on the Bahamas, and is expected to impact the U.S. mainland.  And on the left, a gunman in West Texas killing at least four people and wounding at least 20, before police shot and killed him. Investigations are under way at multiple crime scenes in the cities of Odessa and Midland, as we await more details on a mass shooting that apparently started with a routine traffic stop.  We will speak with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Meantime, Dorian prompting states of emergency along the Southeastern Seaboard, with Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are in the strike zone.  We will have the latest forecast from senior meteorologist Janice Dean. And we will speak with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper about the preparations under way in his state. But, first, police now looking into a motive for a deadly mass shooting in West Texas. They say a gunman opened fire on officers during a traffic stop on an interstate, Interstate 20 near Midland, then took off, shooting at people randomly from his car as he made his way west to Odessa, even carjacking a U.S. postal vehicle, killing at least four people and wounding at least 20, before police killed him in a shoot-out.  We will hear from the Texas attorney general in a minute.   But we begin with correspondent Mike Tobin in Odessa, Texas. Good morning, Mike.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Mike. And already breaking records with this hurricane, the strongest hurricane now in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, 175 miles-per-hour sustained winds, gusts of 200 miles per hour, and the outer core of winds now moving into the Northwestern Bahamas. They need our prayers. This storm could completely cause catastrophic damage. We're talking about 30 feet of storm surge, perhaps -- rather, 20 feet of storm surge, 30 inches of rainfall, and relentless, major hurricane winds for not only hours, but days, because this storm is going to slow down.  And that's where I'm concerned, not only for the Bahamas, but the East Coast of Florida. And the latest track has this storm moving a little bit more to the west. So, instead of focusing on the center, I need everyone to focus on this cone, because if this storm jogs a little bit, say, 30 miles to the west, we're not talking just tropical-storm-force wind conditions.  We're talking about hurricane-force wind conditions all up the coast, the storm surge piling in, inches of rainfall, and then at least a major hurricane, wind gusts along the coastline for several days. This is Monday. This is tomorrow. This is Tuesday. This is Wednesday, still a major hurricane. And then we get into Thursday and Friday, still talking about a hurricane, perhaps brushing but coming very close to landfall along the southeast coast. But I will tell you, Mike, we have not had a lot of consistency with these computer models. So it's not an easy forecast, because of the fact that it is going to slow down, and, in some cases, four to five miles an hour. And that could make the difference from, again, a tropical-storm-force wind to a hurricane-force wind in a prolonged period of time.  Waters are very warm here. We could see a Category 5 for 12, 24 hours. And there's not that much of a difference between a 5 and a 4 as it comes very close to land. There's the latest computer models. And, as I mentioned, Mike, this is concerning to me, because it gets wider. This is the center, so if you have got the center here moving on shore, that's close to a landfall, and that is a prolonged period of time of major hurricane-force winds, storm surge, and inches, if not feet of rainfall. So, that's the takeaway here. We haven't had a really good, solid forecast here. I can tell you what's going to happen in 12 hours, but what happens in 24 hours, 48 hours still yet to be determined. Don't focus on the center. Focus on the whole cone, and that means the coast is not clear for Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. So important to listen to your local weather forecasters -- they are trying to save lives here -- and your local officials, especially now in Florida. I have a feeling you might be seeing some evacuations very soon.",

One of the things that is key to preparing for a storm is making sure your first responders and swift-water access are deployed where they need to be. Right now, all of our eastern assets are remaining there. And as the storm gets closer and maybe toward a predicted path on the coast, we will move our swift-water assets and more first responders from the west to the east. Our National Guard is on alert. We're working closely with the Red Cross to make sure that their shelter packages are ready. Our Department of Transportation has suspended all roadwork, and they will be ready to clear major passages in the event that storm is here. And we know that we have to take this in a staging -- take a staging approach, because we want to be careful with taxpayer resources. We know that it costs money to get ready. But I think most people would rather us be prepared than caught flat-footed here, so we will be incrementally ratcheting up, particularly as we look at the forecast.

That was the Corona program that put satellites over the Soviet Union for the first time. That was fully declassified in 1995. And if you go back and look at sort of movies and nonfiction since the '90s, it's been a well-established fact. It is not news to anyone that we're taking overhead imagery of Iran. And, of course, the president, as you mentioned, has the complete authority to declassify anything he wants. He doesn't even have to go through a process to do it. It is from his constitutional power to supervise the executive branch. If the national security bureaucracy thinks otherwise, then that's their problem. As far as the issue at hand, Iran launching a supposed satellite space launch vehicle, that is very alarming. That's the path North Korea took to get an intercontinental ballistic missile. And even a failure, even a flight that only lasts a couple of seconds produces very valuable telemetry with which you use to build and perfect your rocket.

And we will see those numbers shift around. But I actually think the real head-to-head matchup that hasn't really happened yet is between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And, frankly, Senator Sanders has a lot on the line. He's trying to hold his performance from 2016. Frankly, I don't think he's doing a very good job of it.

On the right side of your screen, Hurricane Dorian strengthening into a catastrophic Category 5 storm as it bears down on the Bahamas, and is expected to impact the U.S. mainland. And on the left, a gunman in West Texas killing at least four people and wounding at least 20, before police shot and killed him. Investigations are under way at multiple crime scenes in the cities of Odessa and Midland, as we await more details on a mass shooting that apparently started with a routine traffic stop. We will speak with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Meantime, Dorian prompting states of emergency along the Southeastern Seaboard, with Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are in the strike zone. We will have the latest forecast from senior meteorologist Janice Dean. And we will speak with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper about the preparations under way in his state. But, first, police now looking into a motive for a deadly mass shooting in West Texas. They say a gunman opened fire on officers during a traffic stop on an interstate, Interstate 20 near Midland, then took off, shooting at people randomly from his car as he made his way west to Odessa, even carjacking a U.S. postal vehicle, killing at least four people and wounding at least 20, before police killed him in a shoot-out.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JANICE DEAN, METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Hi, Mike. And already breaking records with this hurricane, the strongest hurricane now in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, 175 miles-per-hour sustained winds, gusts of 200 miles per hour, and the outer core of winds now moving into the Northwestern Bahamas. They need our prayers. This storm could completely cause catastrophic damage. We're talking about 30 feet of storm surge, perhaps -- rather, 20 feet of storm surge, 30 inches of rainfall, and relentless, major hurricane winds for not only hours, but days, because this storm is going to slow down. And that's where I'm concerned, not only for the Bahamas, but the East Coast of Florida. And the latest track has this storm moving a little bit more to the west. So, instead of focusing on the center, I need everyone to focus on this cone, because if this storm jogs a little bit, say, 30 miles to the west, we're not talking just tropical-storm-force wind conditions. We're talking about hurricane-force wind conditions all up the coast, the storm surge piling in, inches of rainfall, and then at least a major hurricane, wind gusts along the coastline for several days. This is Monday. This is tomorrow. This is Tuesday. This is Wednesday, still a major hurricane. And then we get into Thursday and Friday, still talking about a hurricane, perhaps brushing but coming very close to landfall along the southeast coast. But I will tell you, Mike, we have not had a lot of consistency with these computer models. So it's not an easy forecast, because of the fact that it is going to slow down, and, in some cases, four to five miles an hour. And that could make the difference from, again, a tropical-storm-force wind to a hurricane-force wind in a prolonged period of time. Waters are very warm here. We could see a Category 5 for 12, 24 hours. And there's not that much of a difference between a 5 and a 4 as it comes very close to land. There's the latest computer models. And, as I mentioned, Mike, this is concerning to me, because it gets wider. This is the center, so if you have got the center here moving on shore, that's close to a landfall, and that is a prolonged period of time of major hurricane-force winds, storm surge, and inches, if not feet of rainfall. So, that's the takeaway here. We haven't had a really good, solid forecast here. I can tell you what's going to happen in 12 hours, but what happens in 24 hours, 48 hours still yet to be determined. Don't focus on the center. Focus on the whole cone, and that means the coast is not clear for Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas. So important to listen to your local weather forecasters -- they are trying to save lives here -- and your local officials, especially now in Florida. I have a feeling you might be seeing some evacuations very soon."

One of the things that is key to preparing for a storm is making sure your first responders and swift-water access are deployed where they need to be. Right now, all of our eastern assets are remaining there. And as the storm gets closer and maybe toward a predicted path on the coast, we will move our swift-water assets and more first responders from the west to the east. Our National Guard is on alert. We're working closely with the Red Cross to make sure that their shelter packages are ready. Our Department of Transportation has suspended all roadwork, and they will be ready to clear major passages in the event that storm is here. And we know that we have to take this in a staging -- take a staging approach, because we want to be careful with taxpayer resources. We know that it costs money to get ready. But I think most people would rather us be prepared than caught flat-footed here, so we will be incrementally ratcheting up, particularly as we look at the forecast.

And then I guess the next step from there is to acknowledge that we have a tremendous problem in this nation and throughout the world even, but this notion of, how do we stop mass violence and prevent mass violence? And it's not just shooting, but it's -- I mean, if you look two weeks ago, the Dayton -- not the four-week-ago Dayton issue, but the two-week-ago Dayton issue, where you had an individual wielding a knife, attacking people, and then turning around, stealing a car, and killing a number of people with that incident.

I think that's important. And I have actually talked with some groups that believe that they can do that. But I don't think that we should step in with false palliatives like red flag laws. And we need to face the fact that we have deteriorating institutions that actually in some way stoke these fires. And we need to change the rhetoric. We need to change our institutions to recognize that we have a severe -- a serious problem here. We don't know enough about this most recent shooting, the one from yesterday, to know why this guy was doing it, where he got his guns, how he got his guns, and why he was attacking the police officers who were stopping him for a routine traffic stop.

We need to build that up, because some of those -- some of those institutions, if we can help those, that will ameliorate some of the alienation that I think drives some of this.

He confirmed that he leaked information to a friend to give to a New York Times reporter because he wanted to manipulate the appointment of a special counsel, which started the whole Russia, the whole Mueller investigation, which is -- basically tried to put a damper on the Trump presidency. And I just felt like, when you read it, it was nothing surprising there. It was what we anticipated. But I think Mr. Comey basically is just dodging and weaving, and I don't think he understands fully what he did was even wrong. And that's a real problem, to realize that the very top guy at the FBI doesn't acknowledge his problems and that what he did was wrong. He's defending it, and he feels he should be apologized to.

And you're going to find that this was a -- there was nothing there. The Fusion GPS dossier, which is basically a set of memos that were basically just put out for oppo research, and some of it was just flat-out lies, were used to try to infiltrate the Trump campaign, and then, in turn, take down the president shortly after he was elected.

We have members of the other side that are actually calling for the abolition of the ICE agency. And ICE is the enforcement arm of the immigration laws.

The American people expect Congress to work together in a bipartisan way and to respond to this epidemic of gun violence. More than -- just about 40,000 people will die at the hand of a gun this year, which is standard in this country. We passed two commonsense proposals back in February, universal background checks and closing the Charleston loophole. They are sitting in the Senate, awaiting action. We have called on the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to bring the Senate back and pass those bills. Universal background checks -- and the reason this is important is, universal background checks work. We know that, because since the Brady law has gone into effect, three million gun sales were denied, which meant people were not allowed to buy a gun because they were criminals or some other disqualifying information, were denied the purchase of a gun. The problem is, one in five guns are sold in this country without a background check."

But, certainly, there ought to be legislation we're going to take up on red flags, which is basically giving medical health professionals and family members an opportunity to alert law enforcement when someone presents a danger to themselves or others if they purchase a gun. Many states have adopted those laws. We know they work. We ought to do that. We have a number of other pieces of legislation that, again, try to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. And we can do a much better job on that, closing some of these loopholes, universal background checks, red flag laws. I also think we -- there ought to be bipartisan support to eliminate some of these high-capacity magazines and assault weapons, which are really weapons of war.

I think the report makes very clear that Mr. Comey didn't violate the law. He didn't act out of any political motivation. He broke some procedures by disclosing to his attorneys a memo. But I think the more fundamental question we need to ask is, why was the FBI director, who had a stellar reputation, man of extraordinary integrity, why did he feel compelled to share that memo, that memo that recorded that the president of the United States asked him for loyalty, to swear loyalty to him, and then asked him to kind of let this thing with Flynn go? That's the underlying thing that ought to concern everyone. And I think, again, this is one of those investigate the investigators. We are going to see more of it with these other two investigations. But we shouldn't lose sight of the conduct of the president at issue here, in which he told the FBI director to lay off Michael Flynn, can he let this thing go? He's a good guy.

      "utterance": "Look, no, that doesn't bother me at all. We have the largest caucus I have ever served with. It is the most diverse caucus in our history. It represents our great country. And people bring their life experiences and their ideas, and I think it produces a better product for us. I don't -- I'm not surprised the president is trying to focus on a couple of members of the caucus. But I think what he's distracting away from, the attention of the work that we are getting done for the American people."

      "utterance": "No. Look, I think these are members who have a following. They have a point of view. I think one of the great strengths of our caucus is that everyone comes with their passion and their ideas and their best thinking. And, out of that, we will produce legislation that's the best for the American people. That's how our democracy is supposed to work. I think to characterize the Democratic Caucus based on two or three people, the American people are smarter than that. They are going to look at the work Democrats are getting done to drive down the cost of prescription drugs, to protect coverage for preexisting conditions, to rebuild the infrastructure of America, to raise family incomes, and, most importantly, to take off the corruption and self-dealing in Washington, the first bill we passed, the biggest, most significant anti-corruption bill since Watergate, HR-1. And that's what they're going to look at that, what we are getting done to get the government to work for the people of this country again."

That's normal if there is a big group, and you are trying to kind of draw attention to your candidacy and your work. So, I think there will be some of that. But I think they all recognize the real challenge is this president and this administration. Whoever our nominee is will have a great opportunity to contrast what we're getting done and what we're fighting for and what the president has done."

Did the commander in chief compromise U.S. intelligence-gathering methods? Or is he well within his right? And what does this mean for the already tense relations with Tehran? I will ask my next guest, a former State Department senior adviser who served under President Trump and former President George W. Bush."

Meanwhile, Tehran has not publicly pointed the finger at Washington, saying the failure to launch was due to a technical error. Christian Whiton is a former State Department senior adviser. He served in the Trump and George W. Bush administrations. He's also senior fellow at the Center for National Interest and author of \"Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.\" Christian, good morning."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Right. I don't know if the document was classified or not. But we have been collecting overhead imagery -- this is a well-known historical fact -- since 1959. That was the Corona program that put satellites over the Soviet Union for the first time. That was fully declassified in 1995. And if you go back and look at sort of movies and nonfiction since the '90s, it's been a well-established fact. It is not news to anyone that we're taking overhead imagery of Iran. And, of course, the president, as you mentioned, has the complete authority to declassify anything he wants. He doesn't even have to go through a process to do it. It is from his constitutional power to supervise the executive branch. If the national security bureaucracy thinks otherwise, then that's their problem. As far as the issue at hand, Iran launching a supposed satellite space launch vehicle, that is very alarming. That's the path North Korea took to get an intercontinental ballistic missile. And even a failure, even a flight that only lasts a couple of seconds produces very valuable telemetry with which you use to build and perfect your rocket. So, this is an alarming development in that sense."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think the use of cyber-warfare, which we have been getting bigger and bigger capabilities -- and, of course, it's sort of again widely known and was leaked, unfortunately, to the public that we used cyber -- we and Israel used cyber-tools to disable part of Iran's nuclear program during the Obama administration. That is a useful tool. It can't be the only tool, though. It must -- we must also have sort of real life deterrents with military forces."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "That's sort of consistent with what they do with messaging. They don't say negative things about the president, but they will say negative things about the secretary of state or national security adviser. I think we're in a good place with North Korea. It seems that progress only occurs when the two leaders get together. When it goes below that level, that really aren't functioning working groups, which is a shame. But as long as they're not testing nuclear weapons or long-range ballistic missiles, we're -- that's much better than where we were in the previous two or three years administrations."

You never get to Donald Trump until you become the nominee of the party. So, this is the equivalent of the Roman Colosseum. And the fans want to see some mix-up. They want to see a fight. They want to see fire in the belly. And they have to start distancing themselves from each other and comparing themselves to each other and showing how different they are. And if they don't do it, it's a huge missed opportunity unity."

      "speaker": "BROWN",
      "utterance": "Mike, I think it's a combination of all of the above. You noted in the lead-in to the segment this is the first time that all the top candidates will be on stage together. It's the first time that Vice President Biden and Senator Warren will face off in one of these debates. And if you look at polling, the top five candidates, so, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, roughly account for about 70 percent of all of primary voter support among Democrats. And so, for these five, this is about not only consolidating their position, but obviously moving ahead. And I agree with Brad that, when you're running against somebody like Joe Biden, who's consistently at the top of the polls, you have got to find a way to differentiate yourself."

You want to frame this debate on terms that are favorable to you against Donald Trump. We know that the president every day is seeking to define the race. Presidents get reelected when they're able to define the race and, by definition, define their opponents."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Right."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "This is also a contest for the future of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden representing the more mainstream Democrat, while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders representing the more progressive wing. How do you expect that battle to sort out, Brad?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLAKEMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Joe Biden's got a real problem. In my opinion, he's been running for president for 30 years. The current state of the Democratic Party has long since passed Joe Biden by in policy and direction. And if you add up the support of Bernie and Warren and Buttigieg and Harris, Biden is underwater. So people are looking for an alternative. And I don't think Joe Biden can out-socialize the younger crowd that he's up against. And I think if he tries to do it, it will not be seen as genuine, not be seen as real, nor credible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Dave, do you worry about some of those progressive voices and liberal freshman members of the Squad in the House taking your party too far left?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROWN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we're having a healthy debate about the future, not only of our party, but of the country right now. And I do think it's striking that Joe Biden is consistently at the top of the ticket right now in terms of where folks are. And Brad can make the point that folks are -- have him as their -- Elizabeth Warren as their second first choice. And so, yes, you will see some attrition once folks start getting out of the race. And we will see those numbers shift around. But I actually think the real head-to-head matchup that hasn't really happened yet is between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. And, frankly, Senator Sanders has a lot on the line. He's trying to hold his performance from 2016. Frankly, I don't think he's doing a very good job of it. You're seeing Elizabeth Warren on the ascendancy. And she's absolutely pulling voters away from Bernie Sanders. So, if anything, Mike, I think that contest is going to be pretty interesting to watch on the debate stage."

Are they going to stick with the liberal fringe, or are they going to come back to some semblance of reality? And all you have to do is look to the fight that's coming, I predict, and it's going to be a battle royal at their at their Democratic platform at their convention."

They are -- they're speaking out on behalf of issues they care about. They were elected by their constituents in districts, not the nation, but in their districts, and they're representing the voices of their constituents. And if they're not, they won't get reelected."
