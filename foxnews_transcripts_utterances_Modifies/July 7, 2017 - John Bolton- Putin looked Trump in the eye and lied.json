The Pentagon says more than 600 civilians have been killed during U.S. led coalition airstrikes against ISIS. Those deaths were unintentional and covers a period between August, 2014, and May of 2017. The Pentagon figures are significantly lower estimates by monitoring groups. Allegations of civilian casualties have spiked in Iraq and Syria in recent months as military operations against ISIS have intensified. The coalition maintains it goes to great lengths to avoid death or injury to civilians. Arkansas is the only state to submit data to President Trump's voter integrity commission. That's according to the Justice Department. Many states are refusing to provide some or any information to the commission. The Electronic Privacy Information Center is suing the Trump administration over the request. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to \"Hannity.\" For all of your headlines, log on to FOXNews.com.

Meanwhile New York City mayor Bill de Blasio is defending his decision to join those protests in Germany after coming under fire. Joining me now with reaction is American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp and co-host of \"The Five\" Juan Williams. Juan, we said, where's Juan. Why is he not here with us? And I said he doesn't want to be on set with us. He's in beautiful big apple New York. All right, Juan, I've got to start with you because this is a hard one to defend, I think. We had had this horrific shooting of a wonderful, beautiful female police officer, single mom with three kids, broke my heart, shot in the back of the head, another fatal shooting of a police officer. The community in the Bronx coming together. Bill de Blasio I believe skipped out at least one of these events to honor this police officer, headed over to Europe. What about that decision? JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE HILL\": I think he said he's going to the funeral, so that's what his statement is. To my mind what's interesting here is that de Blasio went. I was surprised that he was going to Germany. He missed not only the whole upset in New York over the shooting of the officer but also the swearing in of some officers here, a new class of recruits. So I was just surprised that the reason he went was to join the protests. He can be anti-Trump and all. I understand that. That a major part ---",

Number two, I'm not at all sure that this ceasefire -- assuming it holds, and that's a big assumption -- doesn't mostly benefit the Assad regime. In other words, it gives them some calm on this particular front to enable them to move forward on another front."

They're linked at the hip in and Syria. And the agreement today was only -- read the readout -- was only Jordan, the United States and Russia, not the Assad regime and not the Iranians, and by extension, not Hezbollah that's on the ground. So that area just operationally on the ground, the area that we're talking about is very limited. It's not where the Iranian militias and where Hezbollah is operating.

The Pentagon says more than 600 civilians have been killed during U.S. led coalition airstrikes against ISIS. Those deaths were unintentional and covers a period between August, 2014, and May of 2017. The Pentagon figures are significantly lower estimates by monitoring groups. Allegations of civilian casualties have spiked in Iraq and Syria in recent months as military operations against ISIS have intensified. The coalition maintains it goes to great lengths to avoid death or injury to civilians. Arkansas is the only state to submit data to President Trump's voter integrity commission. That's according to the Justice Department. Many states are refusing to provide some or any information to the commission.

We had had this horrific shooting of a wonderful, beautiful female police officer, single mom with three kids, broke my heart, shot in the back of the head, another fatal shooting of a police officer. The community in the Bronx coming together. Bill de Blasio I believe skipped out at least one of these events to honor this police officer, headed over to Europe. What about that decision? JUAN WILLIAMS, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE HILL\": I think he said he's going to the funeral, so that's what his statement is. To my mind what's interesting here is that de Blasio went. I was surprised that he was going to Germany. He missed not only the whole upset in New York over the shooting of the officer but also the swearing in of some officers here, a new class of recruits.

Later, the media is going nuts over comment President Trump is making overseas but they ignored all the times President Obama did the exact same thing. Charlie Hurt will weigh in on that stunning hypocrisy. Stay with us as \"Hannity\" continues."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" President Trump has been very vocal about the unprecedented number of government leaks since taking office. And yesterday the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released an explosive report that found that the Trump administration suffered from national security leaks at the rate of one per day between January 20th and May 25th, which is seven times higher than the previous two administrations. Joining me now is the chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, he's also an attorney for President Trump, Jay Sekulow, and Fox News legal analyst and host of \"The Property Man\" Bob Massi. Good to see you gentlemen. Let's start with you, Jay. When I first heard that, I said it's seven times more than the previous two presidents. I said no way, that's totally wrong. It has to be more than that. That's not very many. Given what we've seen every day in the New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post,\" ABC, leak-o-rama. Yet as far as I can tell, Jay, we have one 20- something eight contractor down south who has been arrested."

But let me read you a headlines from \"Politico,\" because this one makes -- should make everybody that's watching right now realize what we're dealing with. Trump leaks crackdown sends chill through national security world, subtitled, agency officials says measure have been taken to isolate leakers creating a culture of fear. So by isolating leakers, the administration is creating a culture of fear. How about isolating the leakers and prosecute them. So I think what needs to happen now is the Department of Justice needs within its own unit a special that does nothing but go after these leakers, because Laura, you're right, that report is just the tip of the iceberg on those leaks, although significant --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I've got to ask Bob about this. Bob Massi, Jeff Sessions recused himself, which I think was a huge mistake, from this Russia investigation. He did not need to do that. He panicked, and that was a big, big mistake. So he recuses himself, but now is he then unable, or is he boxed-out of appointing what Jay I think properly said is a special division to investigate the leaks? I don't think so, right, because the leaks affect everything. BOB MASSI, HOST, \"THE PROPERTY MAN\": No. No. The leaks affect everything. And I think he could do as he wants to do. No matter what he does, we know as Jay will tell you, you know, Laura, better than anybody is the fact that no matter what he does, yea or nay, it's going to be criticized. The level of the leaks, as you say, quantifiable, God only knows how many, but it also goes to the idea that the issue of concern of national security for our country, that they will go to whatever level they want to go to get back at this man as president. They don't care about our country the way they should, and that's the commentary. I would like to see as Jay has indicated something to be done, because somebody has to teach these people a lesson."

So that's the president of the United States he's in a conversation with, he puts the memo together on his government computer, put it in his government desk, and leaks it out. But here's the thing with him, here's what we know about James Comey, the leaker in chief-- we know for a fact that he leaked information that he took as a government employee and then leaked it when he was terminated. If that was an FBI agent that did that, they'd be in jail."

If he hadn't answered the question directly, they would have accused him of stonewalling. He can't win for losing with these people. They're going to attack him no matter what. And it's absolutely absurd. And don't forget, Laura, remember in 2008 when Obama was running the firs time, he had no credentials for anything."

Is it the speech Trump, the prepared text Trump, or is it the off the cuff Trump. As if no president has ever given a prepared text speech in a foreign country and then stumbled a little bit when speaking off-the-cuff. We just heard that Barack Obama -- ah, if you take out the ahs and the pauses he says like five words."

The reason people like him so much, the reasons his supporters like him so much, is because he is a dynamic guy. I thought was the finest speech I've ever heard."

You're going to want to read it. And follow me on Twitter over the weekend @IngrahamAngle, and reserve your copy of my new book. There it is, my first big book, by the way, in about seven years, I've been busy, \"Billionaire at the Barricades.\" You're going to love it. It's a BarnesandNoble.com and Amazon.com, so order now. And remember, just because July 4th is past does not mean that you have to put your flag in the closet. Fly it this weekend, too. It's a beautiful, beautiful symbol of our freedom. Sean will be back on Monday. We've missed him. But it's been fun here. We'll see you next week on \"Hannity\" when I'm a guest. Have a great, peaceful, and safe weekend.
