      "sentences": "Last week was a victory for mayhem, leftwing violence disguised as justice, and the media gets the assist with the disguise. I remember dystopian science fiction movies I'd watched as a child, \"Soylent Green,\" \"The Omega Man,\" \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,\" and wondered how could that happen? Is it caused by overpopulation, lack of resources, Cocoa Pebbles?  I assumed our society was too rich and resourceful for anything like that to happen. I was wrong.  To say these are weird times is like saying Rome around 476 A.D. was weird times. The purge occurred and sorry, Hollywood scriptwriters, it didn't come from some autocratic right winger. No Stephen King, Cher and anyone else snorting horse tranquilizers behind a gated community who thought Trump was Hitler, it was actually your side.  The purge happened when leftwing Dems endorsed the envy of those who would ruin us. Cuomo, de Blasio, Newsom, CNN. The purge was sponsored by its leftist enablers. Yes, the ones in charge educated in the finest universities where the logic of coercive power and grievance is the language of success. They run the mob.  Before, if a young person wanted success, you'd focus on hard work. Now, you focus on grievance. What's he got and why don't I have it? I'm going to take it. And as the violence unfolded, we saw the disconnect between the horrifying actions and its coverage.  In the daytime, you saw camera crews in front of peaceful crowds working from the same damn script. But at night after they said, well, we really nailed it, chaos reigned. And that's where the lone non-journalists on Twitter did the work.   They filmed the beat downs of the terrified, the torching of buildings owned by minorities, the attacks on police. The stuff CNN and \"The New York Times\" wanted to keep hidden in the darkness. If you paid attention early on, you knew the madness was growing because you saw not just the violence, but the encouragement of violence, the desire to save your hide by supporting the mob. Which brings us to some comic relief.",

The President is among them. They want you to watch the videos of the lootings not the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered. Don't fall for it.\" So, as New York implodes, its Governor thinks the biggest problem is people seeing the implosion, the death, the mayhem, the desecration of Mr. Floyd's memory. Like this video of David Dorn, a retired 77-year-old police chief who bled to death after being shot by looters. I'm sorry, I meant un-peaceful protesters. Please don't watch because you might blur the lines between peaceful protest and looters.  But who is blurring the lines? It's those who accuse you of demeaning protesters when you are pleading for help to stop the violence and that allows cities to burn because it makes it impossible to stop the mob if you continue to deny it exists.

And so by not admitting there's a distinction between protest and pandemonium, it leaves the citizens with no recourse, but to protect themselves. Appease to keep the peace. The left did more to end gun control than the NRA could ever do. I saw my neighborhood destroyed, then it got peaceful. It's the curfew the media said. No, it's because there's nothing left to steal. The victim was left bloody and unconscious, pockets out with nothing left to loot, as the looters were sprung the next day, and why? The government fears the media more than the mob. So you become the scapegoat, the sacrificial lamb to the slaughter. Credit decades of grievance politics, decades of cities run by corrupt Democratic machines, decades of media fanning racial division, decades of romanticizing radicalism and smearing the American system, decades of hating you.   And now, it came to fruition, The Purge, and it went off without a hitch, as it will next year and the year after that until we say stop. And by we, I mean Americans, not black, white, or Asian-Americans, all Americans, because this isn't a race problem, it is our problem.  And when we make it our problem, we can solve it. As it stands, the new explanation is systemic racism, a phrase the system uses to keep the discord in place. Think about it. Discrimination is illegal. Every company has a diversity office. They die to hire a qualified minority.  We've had a black President two terms. We've seen the lowest unemployment among minorities in recent history. There's actual prison reform and help for historical black colleges. We have minority-majority police forces in big cities.  This is the most racially diverse country and the most successful and we just spent 10 days mourning the unjust death of a previously unknown black man that climaxed in televised memorial services. Would a society rife with structural racism do that? Sure, racists exist, but the structure is designed against that not for it, it's illegal, at least today, and it keeps getting better.  The problem with blaming structural racism is this. Even if you want to help, you can't. It's too amorphous. Could it be there are people who prefer it that way? Because if you say progress is being made, then what happens? Well, people no longer need the leftist demagogues, the race baiters, the media who divides us, and if the divide disappears, well then, you immediately double the power of everyone else.   Blacks and whites become one and that's got to scare a lot of the leftwing elites, but the division sea, it keeps everyone busy. We're all fighting amongst ourselves while CNN and \"The New York Times\" are raking it in. What if we change that? We can dream.",

Anybody who has listened to what's happened right now can understand what those last few minutes what we're up against.  And I'll tell you the upside of where we are. Again, there's a lot of bad things that's happened. But we have a conversation as a country that we would not have had before now. First of all, and this is across the board, I love the fact we've now talked to black business owners. We've now talked to good hearted democratic business owners. Those who truly want our country to be great.  And we say, you know, guys, we can see now what happens when we have dictatorial governors and mayors who want to cut down your business and stop your business because they want the economy to suffer. We also see what happens when we have mayors who tell us not to have guns. They take away our guns, then they run. They run like little cowards when it comes down to evil showing up at their door.  So, it shows that our Second Amendment is so, so important. And so we are having the conversation, I believe, at the end of the day, and particularly with this, we will talk about this later on, our economy kicking back in the steamed way the way it is right now.  We have a great time again, a great chance to have the next four years be a remarkable Renaissance for our entire country and I look forward to seeing that for sure.",

We've also seen the best and the brightest and it was universally accepted that we were out all outraged, and for me this was a human being thing more than it was about a race thing.  Yes, there's some racial issues, but the greater good is that we all want to work together. We all want to have positivity and we were all outraged by what happened. I'm mad as hell about what happened to the murder of George Floyd. But I'm also mad as hell about the police chief that was shot in St. Louis. And I want the same justice for him that we're getting for Mr. George Floyd. All four officers have been arrested. Hopefully, we'll have a fair trial. We'll get some good jurors in there and justice will be served. And I want the same thing for what happened in St. Louis and the other, I think it's nine or 10 people that have been murdered as a result of the protests. Just like you have to take responsibility for the lawlessness of those four police officers, which led to more lawlessness, the protests lead to more lawlessness. You joined the protest. You saw the buildings burning down, you didn't drop the sign and grabbed a bucket of water. You're just as culpable. We need to take responsibility for that.  We have a right to be mad.

I mean, that thing was on fire like a target in Minnesota. I mean, you really nailed it, man. But that's the point that we can have an honest discussion about policing, we can have an honest discussion about racism and the rest of it, but not if it's all beneath this veneer of systemic racism, which doesn't exist.  I am a hundred percent sure that everyone on this panel, the five of us and virtually everyone watching this show, if you pointed to a law that is in the United States and said there is a law on the books that is prejudice against people because of their skin color or their religion or gender, any of those things, of course, we would absolutely be against it. But the simple truth is that we don't have a systemic problem with racism. We have what you said, there are racists. There are racist and by the way, there are always going to be racists, bad people exist, bad ideas exist and the best thing that a society can do is exactly what the United States has done better than any other country in the history of the world. We've said, hey, come here, bring your traditions, your food, your ethnicity, your languages, all of those things, and fold into the fabric of the United States. We've done that so well. And the people that are burning buildings down and the people that are quite literally killing retired police officers and the rest of it, they are anarchists who are trying to take out the system.

It's fine to be pissed off and you should be pissed off. But when it comes to peaceably -- I mean, who ever said they had to be peace -- The Constitution literally says that for one thing, okay, I think a lot of people would say, hey, everyone has a right to be mad. I just don't like seeing my city engulfed in flames.  And I thought it was crazy to see Andrew Cuomo saying, oh, people are conflating. Stop conflating the protesters with the looters, because if you think about it, that's actually what Chris Cuomo did, right? Because he was calling them all protesters and he talked about Grand Rapids, that 22-year-old chick who is, you know, being charged with inciting a riot because she's on Facebook Live encouraging people to loot and saying, hey, I'm out here, I need a gold bracelet. I already have some silver ones. He is conflating that with these people who are out there peacefully protesting with a very, very important message.

On a hot and humid day, black, white and brown poured into the Nation's Capital chanting \"enough is enough\" and \"no justice no peace.\" Protesters gathered near the U.S. Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial just before rallying just inches away from the White House. Similar scenes taking place in New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and smaller towns across America. In London, thousands knelt in silence and chanted Floyd's name. Marchers clashed with police and some injuries were reported. Hundreds marched in Paris defying a ban on large protests.

      "utterance": "Last week was a victory for mayhem, leftwing violence disguised as justice, and the media gets the assist with the disguise. I remember dystopian science fiction movies I'd watched as a child, \"Soylent Green,\" \"The Omega Man,\" \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,\" and wondered how could that happen? Is it caused by overpopulation, lack of resources, Cocoa Pebbles? I assumed our society was too rich and resourceful for anything like that to happen. I was wrong. To say these are weird times is like saying Rome around 476 A.D. was weird times. The purge occurred and sorry, Hollywood scriptwriters, it didn't come from some autocratic right winger. No Stephen King, Cher and anyone else snorting horse tranquilizers behind a gated community who thought Trump was Hitler, it was actually your side. The purge happened when leftwing Dems endorsed the envy of those who would ruin us. Cuomo, de Blasio, Newsom, CNN. The purge was sponsored by its leftist enablers. Yes, the ones in charge educated in the finest universities where the logic of coercive power and grievance is the language of success. They run the mob. Before, if a young person wanted success, you'd focus on hard work. Now, you focus on grievance. What's he got and why don't I have it? I'm going to take it. And as the violence unfolded, we saw the disconnect between the horrifying actions and its coverage. In the daytime, you saw camera crews in front of peaceful crowds working from the same damn script. But at night after they said, well, we really nailed it, chaos reigned. And that's where the lone non-journalists on Twitter did the work. They filmed the beat downs of the terrified, the torching of buildings owned by minorities, the attacks on police. The stuff CNN and \"The New York Times\" wanted to keep hidden in the darkness. If you paid attention early on, you knew the madness was growing because you saw not just the violence, but the encouragement of violence, the desire to save your hide by supporting the mob. Which brings us to some comic relief."

All of this is brought to you by liberal government and the media that cradles it. First, the media shows only protests, hiding the violence since the harm undermines their narrative. But in an honest moment, you can get them to admit that when violence comes, it was okay."

Then there's his brother who tweeted this as New York City burned, \"There are those who want to intentionally blur the lines between peaceful legitimate protesters and looters. The President is among them. They want you to watch the videos of the lootings not the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered. Don't fall for it.\" So, as New York implodes, its Governor thinks the biggest problem is people seeing the implosion, the death, the mayhem, the desecration of Mr. Floyd's memory. Like this video of David Dorn, a retired 77-year-old police chief who bled to death after being shot by looters. I'm sorry, I meant un-peaceful protesters. Please don't watch because you might blur the lines between peaceful protest and looters. But who is blurring the lines? It's those who accuse you of demeaning protesters when you are pleading for help to stop the violence and that allows cities to burn because it makes it impossible to stop the mob if you continue to deny it exists.

And so by not admitting there's a distinction between protest and pandemonium, it leaves the citizens with no recourse, but to protect themselves. Appease to keep the peace. The left did more to end gun control than the NRA could ever do. I saw my neighborhood destroyed, then it got peaceful. It's the curfew the media said. No, it's because there's nothing left to steal. The victim was left bloody and unconscious, pockets out with nothing left to loot, as the looters were sprung the next day, and why? The government fears the media more than the mob. So you become the scapegoat, the sacrificial lamb to the slaughter. Credit decades of grievance politics, decades of cities run by corrupt Democratic machines, decades of media fanning racial division, decades of romanticizing radicalism and smearing the American system, decades of hating you. And now, it came to fruition, The Purge, and it went off without a hitch, as it will next year and the year after that until we say stop. And by we, I mean Americans, not black, white, or Asian-Americans, all Americans, because this isn't a race problem, it is our problem. And when we make it our problem, we can solve it. As it stands, the new explanation is systemic racism, a phrase the system uses to keep the discord in place. Think about it. Discrimination is illegal. Every company has a diversity office. They die to hire a qualified minority. We've had a black President two terms. We've seen the lowest unemployment among minorities in recent history. There's actual prison reform and help for historical black colleges. We have minority-majority police forces in big cities. This is the most racially diverse country and the most successful and we just spent 10 days mourning the unjust death of a previously unknown black man that climaxed in televised memorial services. Would a society rife with structural racism do that? Sure, racists exist, but the structure is designed against that not for it, it's illegal, at least today, and it keeps getting better. The problem with blaming structural racism is this. Even if you want to help, you can't. It's too amorphous. Could it be there are people who prefer it that way? Because if you say progress is being made, then what happens? Well, people no longer need the leftist demagogues, the race baiters, the media who divides us, and if the divide disappears, well then, you immediately double the power of everyone else. Blacks and whites become one and that's got to scare a lot of the leftwing elites, but the division sea, it keeps everyone busy. We're all fighting amongst ourselves while CNN and \"The New York Times\" are raking it in. What if we change that? We can dream."

Again, there's a lot of bad things that's happened. But we have a conversation as a country that we would not have had before now. First of all, and this is across the board, I love the fact we've now talked to black business owners. We've now talked to good hearted democratic business owners. Those who truly want our country to be great. And we say, you know, guys, we can see now what happens when we have dictatorial governors and mayors who want to cut down your business and stop your business because they want the economy to suffer. We also see what happens when we have mayors who tell us not to have guns. They take away our guns, then they run. They run like little cowards when it comes down to evil showing up at their door. So, it shows that our Second Amendment is so, so important. And so we are having the conversation, I believe, at the end of the day, and particularly with this, we will talk about this later on, our economy kicking back in the steamed way the way it is right now. We have a great time again, a great chance to have the next four years be a remarkable Renaissance for our entire country and I look forward to seeing that for sure."

We've also seen the best and the brightest and it was universally accepted that we were out all outraged, and for me this was a human being thing more than it was about a race thing. Yes, there's some racial issues, but the greater good is that we all want to work together. We all want to have positivity and we were all outraged by what happened. I'm mad as hell about what happened to the murder of George Floyd. But I'm also mad as hell about the police chief that was shot in St. Louis. And I want the same justice for him that we're getting for Mr. George Floyd. All four officers have been arrested. Hopefully, we'll have a fair trial. We'll get some good jurors in there and justice will be served. And I want the same thing for what happened in St. Louis and the other, I think it's nine or 10 people that have been murdered as a result of the protests. Just like you have to take responsibility for the lawlessness of those four police officers, which led to more lawlessness, the protests lead to more lawlessness. You joined the protest. You saw the buildings burning down, you didn't drop the sign and grabbed a bucket of water. You're just as culpable. We need to take responsibility for that. We have a right to be mad.

I mean, that thing was on fire like a target in Minnesota. I mean, you really nailed it, man. But that's the point that we can have an honest discussion about policing, we can have an honest discussion about racism and the rest of it, but not if it's all beneath this veneer of systemic racism, which doesn't exist. I am a hundred percent sure that everyone on this panel, the five of us and virtually everyone watching this show, if you pointed to a law that is in the United States and said there is a law on the books that is prejudice against people because of their skin color or their religion or gender, any of those things, of course, we would absolutely be against it. But the simple truth is that we don't have a systemic problem with racism. We have what you said, there are racists. There are racist and by the way, there are always going to be racists, bad people exist, bad ideas exist and the best thing that a society can do is exactly what the United States has done better than any other country in the history of the world. We've said, hey, come here, bring your traditions, your food, your ethnicity, your languages, all of those things, and fold into the fabric of the United States. We've done that so well. And the people that are burning buildings down and the people that are quite literally killing retired police officers and the rest of it, they are anarchists who are trying to take out the system. And I think suddenly, good people who have not realized how precious this thing is are kind of waking up to it."

In terms of politeness, I don't think people are saying they do need to be polite because anger is totally warranted here and there does need to be reform and things do need to change. It's fine to be pissed off and you should be pissed off. But when it comes to peaceably -- I mean, who ever said they had to be peace -- The Constitution literally says that for one thing, okay, I think a lot of people would say, hey, everyone has a right to be mad. I just don't like seeing my city engulfed in flames. And I thought it was crazy to see Andrew Cuomo saying, oh, people are conflating. Stop conflating the protesters with the looters, because if you think about it, that's actually what Chris Cuomo did, right? Because he was calling them all protesters and he talked about Grand Rapids, that 22-year-old chick who is, you know, being charged with inciting a riot because she's on Facebook Live encouraging people to loot and saying, hey, I'm out here, I need a gold bracelet. I already have some silver ones. He is conflating that with these people who are out there peacefully protesting with a very, very important message. And he's clearly was trying to be super woke here, but he is not thinking it through. I don't think people are furious about peaceful protesters or even protesters who are mad.

I mean, that is dystopian level stuff. The movie \"Scanner Darkly,\" it's a Philip K. Dick movie with Keanu Reeves, I mean, about masks.

Unfortunately for them, we're not like the cities they have overseen for the last decades. We're not hopeless, we're not helpless. We're not going to sit back and wait for somebody else to come up with solutions. We are innately, we are eternal optimists and we believe in freedom. We are not going to sit around and be totally, you can't go out and go to church and build out businesses. At some point, we will rebel. We will go out and do what we need to do and then force them to prosecute us. So, what I'm excited about is that we have a chance now -- first of all, the last few months we've talked about what drives the engine of our country, which is a small business ownership. When was the last conversation that we've had the chance to talk about what truly makes our country the greatest in the history of mankind? The middle class was driven by small business ownership. And I'll tell you what. We can now go back and say, we appreciate you guys. We appreciate what you go through. We now know that what you do is not easy. We know it takes risk takers, it takes those who want to serve our country and we appreciate that more than ever, and I'll tell you, they have become frontline heroes. Those guys are going to bring us bring us back. They are going to go through this whole thing that these leftists have put on top of us, because they truly believed that they could make us so miserable and so hopeless, that we would give up the way we have done in the black community for the last couple of decades. And that's not the American way. And now we're going to go back, build out businesses, talk to our black business owners, say, guys, this is what we need to continue to do and know who was against you. The leftists. Not those who have been told to propaganda throughout all the years is those who themselves your friends, they are elitists, they're Marxist. And it's time for us to let them go.

Both have embraced their parties in a typical Republican fashion, Trump is going to go with law and order. And you know, which I'm right kind of good for myself. And the stark difference between the two of them is one of them can repeat himself and the other one cannot. Trump will come back to it and say it again. Biden, it is one time.

He didn't just support, but he co-authored the 1994 Crime Bill that created a lot of the mass incarceration we saw in the 90s, which obviously had a disparate impact on black men. He was defending it up until 2016. It wasn't just that, he also co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which instituted mandatory minimums for drug offenses and created the distinction in sentencing for powder cocaine versus crack, which again, disproportionately longer sentences for who? Black men. And ironically enough, more than a thousand of those sentences got reduced recently because of the First Step Act, which was signed by President Trump."

He created the problem. He said we need to overhaul the system. You did this.

He might actually be right. But it's probably the 10 or 15 percent that are his diehard supporters. I can't even find any of his diehard supporters on Twitter. There's just nobody. But the point is that these -- look, these guys who get everything wrong. We know this is how politics works, right? If you get everything wrong, and you keep getting it wrong, what happens? You get reelected. Trump just threw that chessboard up in the air, and you know, remember Trump's line, guys. Remember Trump's line to the black community when he was trying to be elected the first time, what do you have to lose? And what's Biden's line? It's you ain't black if you don't vote for me.

And I would call them Antifa and they're all Democrats. So, he got that part of it right. And I'll tell you what they are dealing with that they just don't know how to deal with. We have a President who is not politically correct. And it's so refreshing because it drives them absolutely nuts. He doesn't hold back. He tells exactly what he feels and thinks and just like the old Reagan days. We need -- we love leaders who are optimistic and positive. I think of all the coaches I had, the ones that the most effective were just they got -- it was the attitude of -- and as you remember, Greg, just win, baby. It doesn't matter about all of the obstacles. Just win baby. Do what you've got to do. And we have a President who is doing that. And not only is he saying he will do it, he is talking to the optimism that that they cannot stand it here. But then he gets results like we just had today and that's what our country needs. I'm so excited about it when we keep this thing going."

Dragon Capsules. I used to take those in the locker room at the gym, and I didn't even work out. It's also the first time American astronauts have launched from American soil since 2011. Meaning, the last time Tom Arnold got a check. Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley docked with the International Space Station after a 19-hour trip. Now, with other aerospace competitors, the privatization of space travel is coming. Elon Musk says space tourism is around the corner. I doubt he can top the thrill ride I designed."

So, Elon, I want to be very clear about this. Let me go, I don't need to come back. I'll go. You know, every science fiction movie, it's like, oh, but am I ever going to be able to come back?

Few people knew that he was also had a little entrepreneurial streak in him. He is the first to take Uber international. He had a chance to Uber from his point where our astronauts in Russian satellites, $8 million per ride. So, he kind of gave an idea today that there is a new way of getting Uber thing done. I'm excited. This is a thing that our kids need to see. I remember growing up and the things that kids love is just the idea of the unknown and to be able to grow into in a society where we are truly pushing the boundaries and gaining control of space.
