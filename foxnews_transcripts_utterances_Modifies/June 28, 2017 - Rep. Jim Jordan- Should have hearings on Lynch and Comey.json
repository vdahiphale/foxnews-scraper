      "sentences": "Wow, how time flies. You remember this famous video, a year after former Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with President Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix no less? You remember that? Well, it was at the height of the Clinton e-mail probe. And, obviously, there have been hearings left and right on that puppy, because, whoa, it looks a little unseemly.  But there haven't been any, not even close. By comparison, on Russia or anything Russia-related, including investigations into Russian salad dressing, 50 hearings on that, anything connected with Russia. Not a one on this. And this one, we have -- that looks like video. I'm just saying. It looks a little awkward.  But, anyway, what does Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan think? He's a member of the Judiciary and Oversight Committees.  I'm just saying, have at it with Russia hearings if that's what people want, Congressman, but even one on this? What the heck?",

This year, he misled the American people again when he furthered the perception that President Trump was under investigation, when, in fact, he wasn't and had been told three times by James Comey that he wasn't being investigated.   So, for all those reasons, even Dianne Feinstein, Neil, has said that we should have hearings and look into the Lynch-Comey calling it a matter, not an investigation. We should look into that issue.
