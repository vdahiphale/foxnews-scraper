This has been a truly historic day in America, and around the world, literally starting with shocking revelations out of Israel. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just gave an unmitigated warning to the international community as it relates to Iran. The mullahs of Iran are secretly advancing their illicit nuclear programs, and Israel, the United States, all of our allies now face extreme danger. And \"The Washington Free Beacon\" reporting tonight that even our own intel community has now confirmed this. Coming up, we're going to show you all the evidence. We will explain why Obama's Iranian appeasement plant did nothing to slow the threat of nuclear proliferation in the world.  And also tonight, more significant progress on the peninsula. The summit between North and South Korea and the United States is moving forward as planned. And now, Kim Jong-un is allegedly prepared to end his nuclear weapons program if the United States promises not to invade.   And the South Korean president is even suggesting that President Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize for his important work in the region. That's going to make liberals heads explode. Plus, another day, another damning revelation surrounding the deep statewide. Former director of national intelligence turned anti-Trump fake news CNN pundit, James Clapper, caught lying directly to Congress yet again. As Congress ever going to face -- will he face the General Flynn standard or does he get the Hillary, oh, we don't have equal justice under the law standard? Also, John Brennan's comments, is this a deep state threat against the president of United States?   And later, we'll address Michelle Wolf's petty, cheap, lame performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner. And, finally tonight, the caravan of Central American migrants is at our southern border scaling the fence. Where is the Mexican government? All of that plus, Candace Owens is fresh off her meeting with Kanye West. She will give us the details later in the program.  Buckle up, we have a busy opening news monologue.",

The prime minister is revealing, according to thousands of pages of official documents obtained by intelligence sources, Iran's nuclear weapons program is alive and well. The Iranians call it Project Amad. It is secret. It is illicit. It is an ongoing scheme to construct nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them, including a very specific plan to develop five warheads, each containing a 10-kiloton yield.  And here's what the Prime Minister Netanyahu said about this program in an incredible press conference, incredible bit of intelligence earlier today.",

Remember, this just comes three years after President Obama signed off on what is the worst to deal in the history of the United States, frankly, the world. That was the multilateral agreement where the United States agreed to unlock $150 billion of frozen Iranian assets and send another $1.7 billion in cash, including an initial $400 million down payment, literally shipped in cargo planes and cash and other currencies. Some critical U.S. sanctions against Iran were lifted at the time. What did we get in return? A promise from radical Islamic mullahs of Iran that they temporarily halt their nuclear weapons program? The same mullahs that actively plan for the destruction of Israel? The same muscles that chant \"death to America, death to Israel,\" that fund terrorism all over the world, that are fighting proxy war after proxy wars in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere? The same mullahs that are responsible for killing U.S. soldiers in Iraq, holding other Americans hostage? Remember, Obama told us, well, this was good for the world? Well, we warned you. This agreement was always a sham.  No different than when Neville Chamberlain declared peace in his time and signed off on a deal trying to appease Adolf Hitler. No different than when Bill Clinton appeased Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, in the agreement Clinton promised this was a good deal for the American people. It will halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program and ambition once and for all.  And in 2015, Obama wanted you to believe once again, if only we kissed the rings of despots and radicals and dictators, somehow, they're going to be nice to us. Faulty, failed logic. Appeasement never works. President Trump now faces a very important decision, whether or not to hold Iran accountable and pull the U.S. out of this deeply flawed agreement.

Peace through strength does work.  This brings us to our next topic: President Trump's historic diplomatic progress on the Korean peninsula. Instead of trying to appease Kim Jong Un or bribe him with boatloads of cash, president Trump took some very tough measures. In the early months of the administration, remember the president increased sanctions on the North Korean regime. He sent multiple carrier strike groups to the region. He squeezed North Korea's most important strategic partner, China, all the while calling Kim Jong Un little rocket man and saying our button works. The media freaked out, proclaimed Trump is going to lead us to a nuclear war. They said the same thing when Reagan called the former Soviet Union an evil empire.  We knew better and now, the president's strategy is now seeing significant progress that is great for the world, because for the first time ever, this is historic, look at this. Kim Jong Un crossing into South Korea for this historic them a positive meeting with South Korean President Moon. And a meeting between President Trump, President Moon, and Kim Jong Un is moving forward as planned. Not done yet. Certainly good progress.  And also breaking today, according to the South Korean sources, the North Korean dictator is willing to give up his nuclear weapons program completely as long as the United States agrees to officially end the the Korean War and promised not to launch an attack. Over the weekend, during a rally in Michigan, oh, the crowd reacted, this is when the president was going to be at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and I proudly, 30 years in radio, 20 years on TV, have never been to a single one.

President Trump reacted on Twitter, writing, quote: 'Clapper lied about fraudulent dossier leaks to CNN. He's a lying machine who now works for fake news CNN.' If Clapper does not face legal jeopardy over this blatant perjury to Congress, it will be yet one more example of what I say is our two-tiered system of justice. He'll go with the Hillary Clinton system of justice.   Let's turn to the mainstream media. If you thought they couldn't get any more anti-Trump or downright vulgar, think again.

The mullahs of Iran are secretly advancing their illicit nuclear programs, and Israel, the United States, all of our allies now face extreme danger. And \"The Washington Free Beacon\" reporting tonight that even our own intel community has now confirmed this. Coming up, we're going to show you all the evidence. We will explain why Obama's Iranian appeasement plant did nothing to slow the threat of nuclear proliferation in the world. And also tonight, more significant progress on the peninsula. The summit between North and South Korea and the United States is moving forward as planned. And now, Kim Jong-un is allegedly prepared to end his nuclear weapons program if the United States promises not to invade. And the South Korean president is even suggesting that President Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize for his important work in the region. That's going to make liberals heads explode. Plus, another day, another damning revelation surrounding the deep statewide. Former director of national intelligence turned anti-Trump fake news CNN pundit, James Clapper, caught lying directly to Congress yet again. As Congress ever going to face -- will he face the General Flynn standard or does he get the Hillary, oh, we don't have equal justice under the law standard? Also, John Brennan's comments, is this a deep state threat against the president of United States?

That was the multilateral agreement where the United States agreed to unlock $150 billion of frozen Iranian assets and send another $1.7 billion in cash, including an initial $400 million down payment, literally shipped in cargo planes and cash and other currencies. Some critical U.S. sanctions against Iran were lifted at the time. What did we get in return? A promise from radical Islamic mullahs of Iran that they temporarily halt their nuclear weapons program? The same mullahs that actively plan for the destruction of Israel? The same muscles that chant \"death to America, death to Israel,\" that fund terrorism all over the world, that are fighting proxy war after proxy wars in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere? The same mullahs that are responsible for killing U.S. soldiers in Iraq, holding other Americans hostage? Remember, Obama told us, well, this was good for the world? Well, we warned you. This agreement was always a sham. No different than when Neville Chamberlain declared peace in his time and signed off on a deal trying to appease Adolf Hitler. No different than when Bill Clinton appeased Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, in the agreement Clinton promised this was a good deal for the American people. It will halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program and ambition once and for all. And in 2015, Obama wanted you to believe once again, if only we kissed the rings of despots and radicals and dictators, somehow, they're going to be nice to us. Faulty, failed logic. Appeasement never works. President Trump now faces a very important decision, whether or not to hold Iran accountable and pull the U.S. out of this deeply flawed agreement.

Instead of trying to appease Kim Jong Un or bribe him with boatloads of cash, president Trump took some very tough measures. In the early months of the administration, remember the president increased sanctions on the North Korean regime. He sent multiple carrier strike groups to the region. He squeezed North Korea's most important strategic partner, China, all the while calling Kim Jong Un little rocket man and saying our button works. The media freaked out, proclaimed Trump is going to lead us to a nuclear war. They said the same thing when Reagan called the former Soviet Union an evil empire. We knew better and now, the president's strategy is now seeing significant progress that is great for the world, because for the first time ever, this is historic, look at this. Kim Jong Un crossing into South Korea for this historic them a positive meeting with South Korean President Moon. And a meeting between President Trump, President Moon, and Kim Jong Un is moving forward as planned. Not done yet. Certainly good progress. And also breaking today, according to the South Korean sources, the North Korean dictator is willing to give up his nuclear weapons program completely as long as the United States agrees to officially end the the Korean War and promised not to launch an attack. Over the weekend, during a rally in Michigan, oh, the crowd reacted, this is when the president was going to be at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and I proudly, 30 years in radio, 20 years on TV, have never been to a single one.

They outdid themselves over the weekend. The White House correspondents association held their annual dinner. I am so proud I have never been, where they take some time to honor the media, pat themselves on the back, just like their Hollywood buddies, for their courageous work of echoing each other.

I've said it before, I'll say it again -- journalism in this country is absolutely dead. They are not journalists. They are opinion advocacy hosts. They don't admit it. Our last story tonight comes from a southern border. For weeks, we have been tracking this large caravan of migrants from Central America as they marched through Mexico headed to the U.S. border.

This is an issue of national security, an issue of U.S. sovereignty. Mexico needs to be held accountable. And most importantly, it is time for the wall to be built on our southern border.

This garbage from \"The New York Times\" tonight, absolute garbage, no attorney will ever let this president sit down with Robert Mueller. Now it's going to go on for a year. It's all executive privilege and Mueller drove this, as I predicted he would, when he hired his hit team of partisans. Joe?"

Peter King mentioned on this network earlier, that that may not very well happen."

Let's start with the presentation by BB. Benjamin Netanyahu. It was, I think the -- first of all I think he did it without notes. The single biggest intel breakthrough that I can think of in our lifetime. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think if we are old enough, we think back to those pictures during the Cuban missile crisis when our ambassador stood up at the United Nations and said to the Soviets, you are lying, here are the U2 photographs of the missiles that you smuggled into Cuba to attack us. It was like that, but on steroids, Sean. We are talking about tens of thousands of documents, half a ton of information, intelligence that our government has confirmed that proves everything that president has been saying. The Iran deal is a sham and the Iranians want and are developing nuclear weapons to use against the west and to use against Israel. It's a slam-dunk and as far as I'm concerned, as of today, thanks to BiBi. Netanyahu, the JCPOA Iran deal, Obama's wonderful legacy is dead."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Mr. Hoffman, beyond that, now the world has clarity to get out of this ridiculous Iranian deal and even more historic, you see North Korean dictator, who not that long ago was firing missiles over Japan and threatening Guam and the world in the United States, crossing over the DMZ, meeting with the South Korean President, and I would say Donald Trump played a big part in all of that."

    {
      "speaker": "DANIEL HOFFMAN, RETIRED CIA SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICER",
      "utterance": "He did. Let me just make a quick comment on the Iran deal. They were three elements of that that were really a problem for us. The first was the sunset clause. The second, that they didn't address Iran's development of ICBM's. And third, it provided an influx of cash for Iran's state sponsored terrorism. One of the really interesting parts of Prime Minister Netanyahu's briefing today related to Iran's plan to integrate ICBM's with nuclear weapons. That has to be cause for great concern for us and I think what we are waiting for right now is the U.S. Intelligence community assessment of the veracity of the intelligence reports. I expect this story to carry on in the days ahead, Sean."

They like to control other people. So, they are sympathetic to dictatorships, whether it is all going over the propaganda minister of North Korea during the Olympics or whether it is worshiping the Iranian mullahs and giving them $150 billion, they are simpatico with these people. So, this is when it stops. No more appeasement. This is not Berlin in 1938. This is not the Cuban missile crisis. It stops on January 20th, 2016, Sean."

This past weekend, Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk went to California to meet with Kanye face-to-face. She joins us with more details. All right. I never got to hang out with Kanye. I did meet Kim Kardashian, though. What can you tell us about him?"

      "utterance": "You know, I can tell you that Kanye has a wonderful, beautiful vision for the future of America. It's a unifying message. And this is really just the beginning of it. I'm incredibly honored to not only be on his journey, but for him to on mine. He understands something and he sees something on both sides. And I really think he is going to be significant in bridging the gap."

It has bothered me to no end as a conservative, the lies told every election here, Republicans are racist, misogynist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. Because, that is not who I am or the people that I know are. And I don't hear solutions for the country for the forgotten men and women. All I hear is the same narrative every election cycle. And it frustrates me and I do believe it is to some extent sadly it is effective."

    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Look, you're exactly right. And listen, it was Andrew Breitbart that said that politics is downstream from culture. And this is why this is so significant with Kanye West, because he defines culture. He is pretty much at the top of it. And he is willing to have these conversations, he is willing to go against the grain, he is willing put on a MAGA hat, and he understands, you know how symbolic that was. How excited people were, because, exactly what you said they were able to say, look, I wear that night the hat and I am not an awful person. So, when Kanye West, wears them, he says, I love Donald Trump, he is my brother, it means so much more and it reverberates around the world. And I'm telling you, he is got a great mind, he is in an incredible space right now."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I look at, for example, I just love iconic class, the people. As much as I hate Bill Maher, and I mean, he hates me and I hate him, just a fact. But it's always been people like Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, the great one Mark Levin, conservatives that defended him, and in cult, just conservatives defend him. Not liberals. Why? Why would that be, considering they claim to be the champions of free and open exchange of ideas, ideals and opinions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a lot of times it's hard for them to step out of their own reality and a lot of the things that they say are not rooted in very many facts. And I have to say, Kanye offered me a very different perspective, you know on the right, we tend to say, this came from Ben Shapiro, that facts don't care about your feelings, but on the latter, you know, the feelings do become facts that at some point, we do have to acknowledge that. You know, their feelings have become facts. And the only way we will combat that is to hear them out and understand where they are coming from and to come up with a different solution. I'm telling you, culture is that solution. They place a lot of emphasis on culture, and you know, who is wearing what hat and who says what they can and cannot think."
