President Trump just wrapped up a huge campaign rally in the battleground state of New Hampshire. Our power panel is standing by to break down the big moments. And shocking new information tonight about the suspect who shot six police officers in Philadelphia in that standoff you saw here last night.  New Jeffrey Epstein autopsy details raise serious questions about what happened in that cell. And more than 100 seizures and dozens of teens hospitalized with severe lung injuries possibly tied to vaping. Dr. Drew Pinsky is here with the prescription to end this. Plus, some information about what's going on in California with homelessness. Plus, the millennial who wants to unseat one of Trump's biggest headaches in Washington is here exclusively.  But first, we start with a Fox News Alert. President Trump holding a massive campaign rally in New Hampshire tonight. Trump hit all his biggest accomplishments in office and promised to keep America great if reelected.",

JAMILA BEY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST & RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: I don't know. That's a hard thing for Democrats to do. And to be blunt, that's what Trump's base wants.

We had 12,000 inside, and getting here was difficult, Jason, because I had to navigate my way through 5,000 people outside. So, do the math. That's 17,000 people who showed up in a blue state. We are in New Hampshire. People came all the way for Massachusetts and all over the New England corridor because blue state voters have been left behind by Democrats. And Jamila, I would challenge the point that policy is going to help the Democrats on the contrary. As President Trump noted tonight, our numbers go up when Democrats proliferate across Iowa.

CHRIS O'CONNELL, REPORTER, WTXF FOX 29 PHILADELPHIA: Jason, investigators just a few hours ago were able to get back into that home where the gunman really paralyzed this section of North Philadelphia last night during that 7.5-hour standoff. Six police officers were injured, and miraculously they were discharged from the hospital before the suspect surrendered after midnight last night. Just miraculous. Now, that suspect, 36-year-old Maurice Hill, he's being described as a career criminal. Police went to his home in North Philadelphia to serve a drug warrant, but they were met by gunfire. More than 200 rounds of gun shots were fired in a barrage of bullets. And at one point, in that were trapped two police officers and three prisoner hostages. They were in there for several hours communicating with police negotiators, but they were able to be freed, rescued by SWAT. And for the next 2.5 hours, Maurice Hill held himself up inside that Philadelphia row home armed with an AK-15 assault-style rifle, and then when teargas was deployed, he came out with his hands up. But in his waistband, another handgun. He was then taken into custody without incident. Tonight, police are just trying to deconstruct everything, especially what went on inside that house. They had to clear it with all the teargas. It took about 18 hours before police could get inside. But now the big question is, how this guy with a career criminal record got his hands on so much weaponry.",

It certainly looks like a suicide to begin with, right. \"The New York Post\" reporting the bed sheet, the bunk bed, which is ridiculous, that it was in the room, that he was alone, that the guards were sleep, that they falsified records, that he had been on suicide watch previously, that he was clearly depressed, all of these things pointed in that direction and pointed towards incompetence. But now you have to wonder because of the report out today that talks about multiple fractures in the neck. You just showed Dr. Wecht talking about that. I spoke to add that I spoke to a trauma surgeon tonight, Jason, a top trauma surgeon, who says multiple fractures in the neck are more consistent, again, not definitive, but more consistent with homicidal strangulation than with hanging. And the hyoid bone, as you get older -- I don't want to be too technical here -- as you get older, the chances of breaking that hyoid bone right around the Adam's apple, as Trace pointed out, goes up with hanging, but it's still far more common with strangulation, with homicidal strangulation. So we don't know yet. We don't have enough information. We don't know if the doors open. We don't know what happened to the arteries in the neck. We don't know where they fractures in the neckwear. We need more information. Were there bruises on the body? These things have to come out and they have to come out in the final report.

And for some reason we are in a moral panic about nicotine. Now, whether or not the vaping products themselves have something in them that could cause lung damage, for instance, that is a concern. In this particular case you guys are reporting on, these were all cannabis or CBD products. These were not nicotine products, at least every one I've read about. And so it may not be the vaping in this case. It may be something about the cannabis products or the way they are being prepared. Now, even though the vaping is a great way to get off cigarettes and tobacco, it doesn't mean it's good for adolescents to expose their brain to nicotine, because we know for sure that nicotine when you are exposed to it early, you become permanently addicted to it.",

KAYLEIGH MCENANY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: The energy was incredible. We had 12,000 inside, and getting here was difficult, Jason, because I had to navigate my way through 5,000 people outside. So, do the math. That's 17,000 people who showed up in a blue state. We are in New Hampshire. People came all the way for Massachusetts and all over the New England corridor because blue state voters have been left behind by Democrats. And Jamila, I would challenge the point that policy is going to help the Democrats on the contrary. As President Trump noted tonight, our numbers go up when Democrats proliferate across Iowa.

And we've heard a lot about these states that President Trump just barely want to put him over the top; Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. New Hampshire is a state that he just barely lost by 2,736 votes. It was really, really close.

Wages have gone down because of China. So America is behind the President. Who they're not behind are the radical Democrats. You have AOC with a 20 percent approval rating; Ilhan Omar, 9 percent; socialism, 18 percent. And these are Democrat poll numbers. So this President stands for America. He's patriotic.

It was Kamala Harris comparing ICE to the KKK. It was Marianne Williamson saying what is happening to illegal immigrants is like what Nazis did in Germany to Jews. This is horrible. And then we see three attacks on ICE facilities. It's disgusting. It's hateful. And the American people stand behind ICE, which is why we stopped hearing the calls to abolish ICE.

But Corey Lewandowski was President Trump's first campaign manager until he was fired. Nobody really leaves Trump world. He's been (ph) running close to the President the whole time.

This is AOC with some of Hollywood's biggest elite. You see John Legend, Chrissy Teigen. You see - you take a look at that picture. There are a lot of Hollywood celebrities there. And I'm telling you, this does not sit well because she can talk all she wants and the Democrats can claim that they are a party of the people, but when they go on to those big Hollywood photos like that, I'm telling you there are people across this country who just say, oh, yes, that's what they're really about, that's really where they're going. And I think you're going to see more of that in this election coming up. I want to thank all of our power panel for being here. There's going to be a lot more to discuss.

CHRIS O'CONNELL, REPORTER, WTXF FOX 29 PHILADELPHIA: Jason, investigators just a few hours ago were able to get back into that home where the gunman really paralyzed this section of North Philadelphia last night during that 7.5-hour standoff. Six police officers were injured, and miraculously they were discharged from the hospital before the suspect surrendered after midnight last night. Just miraculous. Now, that suspect, 36-year-old Maurice Hill, he's being described as a career criminal. Police went to his home in North Philadelphia to serve a drug warrant, but they were met by gunfire. More than 200 rounds of gun shots were fired in a barrage of bullets. And at one point, in that were trapped two police officers and three prisoner hostages. They were in there for several hours communicating with police negotiators, but they were able to be freed, rescued by SWAT. And for the next 2.5 hours, Maurice Hill held himself up inside that Philadelphia row home armed with an AK-15 assault-style rifle, and then when teargas was deployed, he came out with his hands up. But in his waistband, another handgun. He was then taken into custody without incident. Tonight, police are just trying to deconstruct everything, especially what went on inside that house. They had to clear it with all the teargas. It took about 18 hours before police could get inside. But now the big question is, how this guy with a career criminal record got his hands on so much weaponry."

He shouldn't have even been breathing the air that we breathe here in the outside world. That guy should've been behind bars. Even the Philadelphia district attorney said so. What - how in the world was he not behind bars?"

I can tell you 36-year-old Maurice Hill has been described as a career criminal, first entering the criminal justice system in 2001. He was arrested more than a dozen times, convicted six other times as recently as this year. He was arrested, but apparently the District Attorney decided not to prosecute the cases the last time he was arrested. So that is the big question tonight is, why Maurice Hill was out on the street in the first place?"

      "speaker": "O'CONNELL",

First of all, the police won't give in the strategy on how those hostages were rescued, but they did say they were in constant communication with police officers, the Police Chief and the District Attorney by phone throughout these negotiations. So they were in constant contact. In fact, that information they were giving to police helped them make the decision on how to actually go into this house, especially with the teargas. They told this guy they're coming in at 11:45, and shortly after midnight, he came out with his hands up."

Everything that happened with this guy going back to 2007, 2008, was that he was given the upper grade of a two-tier system of justice, and he got cut every break imaginable, and then some that had to get made up as they went along. And right up until the end when he should've been on suicide watch, he should have been on a much higher level of scrutiny, and his lawyers when in and demanded -- think about it. You're the warden of this prison, a lawyer comes in and says we really think he doesn't need suicide watch anymore when you are two and half weeks after an incident where it looks like he might've tried to off himself, you're going to let the lawyer talk you into not doing your job and making sure that these prisoners are kept -- what if you are a federal judge in the next case where the government really needs to keep somebody in custody prior to trial because he might actually flee or intimidate witnesses?

For clarity here, these types of breaks can absolutely happen those who hang themselves. But as your guest noted, forensic experts point out they are much more common in victims of strangulation. That's not to say Epstein was strangled, but it does tend to boost the level of intrigue, especially about context and circumstances. Our corporate cousin, \"The New York Post,\" says that Epstein hung himself with a bedsheet tied to the top bunk in his cell. But the correctional center has not released any details on exactly how he did it, meaning did he jump, roll, or fall off the bunk? Standard prison bunks are five and half feet high and forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht is skeptical about Epstein generated enough force to break several bones. Watch."

Epstein's autopsy was completed Sunday, but the cause of death is still pending, though it's also important to point out the guards ignored Epstein for ours, so we could have been hanging for a while. But in 2008, a Maryland teenager accused of killing a police officer died of an apparent suicide in jail, but two days later the cause of death was changed to homicide because the medical examiner found the teen had a broken hyoid. Nobody was every charged, but the teen's death to this day remains a mystery. Jason?"

Doctor, I've heard you many times on FOX, and I appreciate your reporting. Going back to what the other doctor in Trace's report talked about, the idea of velocity. This is a detention center that's been place for decades. It's not as if they haven't dealt with this before. They do know how to deal with this. So to the other doctor's comment about velocity, this looks so suspicious. What's your medical take on it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. MARC SIEGEL, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I want to start with what the medical examiner, chief medical examiner of New York, has had, which is that all information must be synthesized in order to determine the cause and manner of death. The fact that she is even saying that means that all the information is not in. And we are getting very sketchy information. It certainly looks like a suicide to begin with, right. \"The New York Post\" reporting the bed sheet, the bunk bed, which is ridiculous, that it was in the room, that he was alone, that the guards were sleep, that they falsified records, that he had been on suicide watch previously, that he was clearly depressed, all of these things pointed in that direction and pointed towards incompetence. But now you have to wonder because of the report out today that talks about multiple fractures in the neck. You just showed Dr. Wecht talking about that. I spoke to add that I spoke to a trauma surgeon tonight, Jason, a top trauma surgeon, who says multiple fractures in the neck are more consistent, again, not definitive, but more consistent with homicidal strangulation than with hanging. And the hyoid bone, as you get older -- I don't want to be too technical here -- as you get older, the chances of breaking that hyoid bone right around the Adam's apple, as Trace pointed out, goes up with hanging, but it's still far more common with strangulation, with homicidal strangulation. So we don't know yet. We don't have enough information. We don't know if the doors open. We don't know what happened to the arteries in the neck. We don't know where they fractures in the neckwear. We need more information. Were there bruises on the body? These things have to come out and they have to come out in the final report. But homicide in my opinion has been added to the possibilities here, and that is deeply disturbing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "But my understanding, doctor, is that that autopsy was done days ago. Aren't they going to know at the end of that -- maybe I was watching \"Quincy\" when I was a little kid too often, but you pretty much know at the end of the autopsy, or they are legitimately waiting for some sort of lab report that takes a week. But it seems highly suspicious to me on such a high-profile case. They know, don't they, what happened at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Let me push back a little, Jason. It's highly suspicious, yes, that they haven't released the findings yet, and also that they brought in Dr. Michael Baden, who is a superstar at these things, but if he's on a case overlooking it, you better believe that there's a question mark here. What caused this, because, again, you know somebody suffocated but you don't know how. And with all these fractures, I am more suspicious than before. And again, I can't rule out suicide here. That is still on the table. But now we need more information because homicide is a possibility. Dr. Michael Baden is famous for being brought on cases like this and overruling what the presumption is."

Several Midwest states are investigating dozens of cases of teenagers being hospitalized with severe lung issues after reportedly using e-cigarettes. On top of that, the FDA is already looking into 127 reports of seizures possibly tied to vaping. Joining me now is Dr. Drew Pinsky, radio host and medicine addiction specialist. Dr. Drew, thanks for being here. My understanding of vaping is if you have a cigarette addiction and you're trying to wean your way off of that, maybe this is a good way to do that. But we have millions of young people who are thinking hey, this is safe. Nothing's going to happen to me. I'm just vaping. It's not cigarettes."

You could imagine in the 1930s somebody saying that about cigarettes, right? So a similar kind of phenomenon going on here. But the fact is medical literature shows repeatedly that vaping is one of the best ways to get off cigarettes. Tobacco is the problem, not nicotine. And for some reason we are in a moral panic about nicotine. Now, whether or not the vaping products themselves have something in them that could cause lung damage, for instance, that is a concern. In this particular case you guys are reporting on, these were all cannabis or CBD products. These were not nicotine products, at least every one I've read about. And so it may not be the vaping in this case. It may be something about the cannabis products or the way they are being prepared. Now, even though the vaping is a great way to get off cigarettes and tobacco, it doesn't mean it's good for adolescents to expose their brain to nicotine, because we know for sure that nicotine when you are exposed to it early, you become permanently addicted to it."

They are using all the same mechanisms, the same ideas, addicting people early and young. It's all the same stuff. So that's where our focus should be. It shouldn't be a moral panic about vaping generally or about nicotine products. It should be about the marketing to young people and the fact that these companies, both the THC, CBD, really the THC and the nicotine companies, the vaping companies, are going at us in the very same way that the tobacco companies did."

This is not something you see in third world countries because third world countries take care of their sick people. We are allowing people -- we have privileged a symptom called Anosognosia. Anosognosia is something that happens when you get a stroke in the right side of your brain, let's say the left side goes out. You are unaware of it. It turns out that addiction, psychotic, psychiatric illnesses cause the very same part of the brain to shut off, and we have privileged that in the law now so we can't get near people to help them when they need it. That then sends them to the streets. They languish, and people are dying. My question to Newsom and the rest, what's the body count? How many have to die before they are going to do something about this and change their rhetoric and focus on the mental health crisis this is?"
