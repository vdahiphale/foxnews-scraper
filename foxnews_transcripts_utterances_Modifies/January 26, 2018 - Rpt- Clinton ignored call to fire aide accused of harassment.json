According to the New York Times, a 30-year-old female staffer accused Burns Strider of repeatedly harassing her. The Times says Clinton, nor her campaign manager call to fire Strider opting for administrative sanctioning instead. He was reportedly ordered to undergo counseling and the campaign docked his pay. The young woman was moved to a new job. So Kimberly, now it may have come full circle, like no one has been immune to these accusations. And these allegations written about in the New York Times finally now reach up into Hillary Clinton's campaign. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, it's really only a matter of time, right? This has been something that she has been really trying to own the platform to say that she is for women, she is for children, she is for young girls for their voice and to help, you know, make sure that they are taken care of and aren't victimized. But then you see a situation like this, which is continuing to allow this kind of enabling behavior, but we saw first with her relationship with her, you know, husband. And trying to attack the victims there, or trying to cover up misdeeds. So, if you really look at the historical perspective in terms of what she's done and how she's conducted herself she really isn't a champion of women and young girls.",

He's just listening to this stuff, so people are suddenly shocked that maybe he mentioned it? That's garbage. The other thing too, and I'm going to quote a friend of mine who said this to me that basically what the media is doing is they're waving a red cape in front of a bull and then they're shocked that he charged. And basically, that red cape is this insinuation of an investigation in which people are actually saying there might not be anything there but we're still going to annoy you and bother you every single day about an investigation. That is the red cape, and so, suddenly surprised that the bull, Donald Trump, charges. So basically what you're doing is, are you creating a criminal by investigating an innocent man by constantly chasing somebody, telling them and investigating them, and then he says something like, oh, they should be fired.

And the Center for Immigration Studies this morning said while there's no new applicants for visa lottery and chain migration through this, it provides for the continuation of those categories until the admission of all four million people on the current chain migration waiting list, which based on an estimate for 2007, means it could take 17 years for the current process to run out.

According to the New York Times, a 30-year-old female staffer accused Burns Strider of repeatedly harassing her. The Times says Clinton, nor her campaign manager call to fire Strider opting for administrative sanctioning instead. He was reportedly ordered to undergo counseling and the campaign docked his pay. The young woman was moved to a new job. So Kimberly, now it may have come full circle, like no one has been immune to these accusations. And these allegations written about in the New York Times finally now reach up into Hillary Clinton's campaign. KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, it's really only a matter of time, right? This has been something that she has been really trying to own the platform to say that she is for women, she is for children, she is for young girls for their voice and to help, you know, make sure that they are taken care of and aren't victimized. But then you see a situation like this, which is continuing to allow this kind of enabling behavior, but we saw first with her relationship with her, you know, husband. And trying to attack the victims there, or trying to cover up misdeeds. So, if you really look at the historical perspective in terms of what she's done and how she's conducted herself she really isn't a champion of women and young girls."

But then it's going to comes back and hit your team. So, you can't look at it as team sport. But it also talks about being compromised. These stories compromise you. What could she do about this fellow when she, herself, is compromised because how can she fire a guy who's done 1/10 of 1 percent of what her husband's done? So, she is compromised. I mean, she should know sexism. She had a firsthand front row seat of an Olympic athlete in sexual harassment in her husband. So, she probably goes, oh, I can't do anything about this because look at this. So, I don't know."

I think from what I read, he was put into counseling, and then he had his pay docked, as I understand it. So, essentially, at that point, he was suspended.

But to my mind, the idea that she kept him there is an opportunity for conservatives to secure her as a prime example of liberal hypocrisy, right? So, if that's what the point is here, I think you know what? Conservatives, you win this one because guess what, looks to me like liberal hypocrisy. But I will say that it's not fear as some of my colleagues in this table say, oh, Hillary Clinton had to put up with Bill Clinton and therefore she excuses. I don't think that's what happened. And I will say, I think, most American women trying to keep their marriages and families together will put up with a whole lot of nonsense. So, you know what, I don't think that's fair.

And that's the point, like she has been the one that has positioned herself as sort of the face of this movement and being supportive of women, what she campaign on, etcetera.

I haven't seen the texts, I haven't talked to the people. I do wonder about the leak in the New York Times like -- I was trying to think who does that benefit, right? And it could be that this is all going to come out anyway. And that will be what it will be. But also I'm a realist. And perhaps the two lovers at the FBI in their text messages, they want Clinton to be president and they hate President Trump. But guess what, sorry, Greg, Trump becomes president. It also could be the case that President Trump thought about or wanted to, or maybe even ordered and backed off firing Mueller, but also that didn't happen.

It was actually a topic of conversation and it was like something -- it's probably a bad thing, he shouldn't do that. He's just listening to this stuff, so people are suddenly shocked that maybe he mentioned it? That's garbage. The other thing too, and I'm going to quote a friend of mine who said this to me that basically what the media is doing is they're waving a red cape in front of a bull and then they're shocked that he charged. And basically, that red cape is this insinuation of an investigation in which people are actually saying there might not be anything there but we're still going to annoy you and bother you every single day about an investigation. That is the red cape, and so, suddenly surprised that the bull, Donald Trump, charges. So basically what you're doing is, are you creating a criminal by investigating an innocent man by constantly chasing somebody, telling them and investigating them, and then he says something like, oh, they should be fired.

He's going to have to give something. But he's also going to have to listen and heed some of the warnings and criticisms of his constituents and his core conservative base that came out strongly to support him in the election. So he's in a bit of a tough position. I don't think he minds it. He's not, you know, I guess uncomfortable or unfamiliar with being in a position, you know, like this. But you've got to be able to sit at a table and show that you have an open mind, you're willing to hear all sides of it. It's not nailed down in stone yet. They should be expressing their viewpoint. So should the other side. And hopefully, there's going to be some way in between to get some consensus building while still maintaining his core support."

Now it's 1.8 million. Some estimates say it will be -- end up being four million. It's citizenship when you could have provided some form legal status at the beginning. Or others are saying, hey, this is brilliant. You're calling the Democrats' bluff and forcing their hand by giving them more than they could have expected in the opening bid and then daring them to be against it. Because you don't need Dick Durbin and Nancy Pelosi. They're going to resist, no matter what. You need Joe Manchin. You need eight or nine Senate Democrats to cross the aisle and vote for this. The question is, how far can he go? Because there's a lot of -- the scars for the conservatives on immigration are deep. And the Center for Immigration Studies this morning said while there's no new applicants for visa lottery and chain migration through this, it provides for the continuation of those categories until the admission of all four million people on the current chain migration waiting list, which based on an estimate for 2007, means it could take 17 years for the current process to run out.

So I can imagine going from 25 billion maybe down to 17 billion. Economic growth, of which there was a good GDP number today at 2.6 percent for the last quarter, gives you a lot of running room for that. And it was, I think, actually border security, the Republicans are on the right side of this, now, where public opinion is. And I think the other thing is, for the presidency they're going to get a great compromise, or he thinks the Democrats don't want to make a deal. So if they walk away, he can say, \"Look, I was willing to give almost 2 million people amnesty and the chance to become citizens. We're going to take their tax dollars. We want them to work. We should allow them to be citizens. And the Democrats wouldn't play.\" And I think that is actually a strong hand for him right now."

Speaking of chain migration, I would like to know what Mexico thinks about all of this. Like wouldn't -- shouldn't Mexico be applauding the end of chain migration and the end of sanctuary cities and the end of amnesty? Because these are methods, all of these are methods that allow the fastest desertion from your country of families. People leaving. Wouldn't you want that stuff to end so people stay in your country and make Mexico great again? I would like to hear them -- I'd I like. If you ask, I mean, I would like somebody to ask the Mexican president, you know, what do you think of chain migration?

Like, was it going to expire, something like this? A French supermarket decided to mark it 70 percent off. It actually caused riots in the grocery store, in the little supermarket, because people were so anxious to buy all of the Nutella. I don't if you know, this is extremely popular in Europe."
