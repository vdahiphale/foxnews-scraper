I keep saying this but this was an unbelievable day, an earthquake at the Supreme Court that could change the direction of the nation. The retirement of the Supreme Court Justice, Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's key swing vote will have enormous consequences. It gives President Trump the opportunity to reshape the court for decades.   We're also going to look at how this dramatically affects the midterm election prospects, but first, we begin Democrats racing to the left, that the focus of tonight's Angle. The Democratic Party experienced a seismic shock last night when in the New York City outer boroughs, a 28 year old political novice, primaried and defeated a member of the Democratic leadership. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ended the 20 year run of Congressman Joe Crowley who many thought would succeed Pelosi as the Democratic leader. So he raised three million dollars in the race, Ocasio-Cortez about three hundred thousand. By now you may have heard some of the bullet points here, she a member of the Democrat Socialist of America, who isn't? She supports publicly funded trade schools and universities. Well she worked for Ted Kennedy and Bernie Sanders. She's called for the abolishment of immigration customs enforcement, otherwise known as ICE. Now Ocasio-Cortez even went down to the border a few days ago to protest the Trump immigration policies.",

      "sentences": "Well when I said cheering, that's Mitch McConnell style cheering. Before Republicans don't stop popping the corks, there's a lesson here for them as well. Think about it this way if Republicans start walking back from the Trump agenda, walking away from it. If they get wobbly or try to diffuse the key Trump policies that Trump won on, that he ran on, danger lies ahead. Republicans today failed to pass another immigration bill and this after they rejected the Congressman Goodlatte bill, that was the most faithful and the best, as far as the original Trump agenda went. It's really stupid. Meanwhile the White House backed off threats to strictly limit the Chinese investment in U.S. tech companies. Another disappointment. Although at least Beijing and Wall Street were happy. And despite preliminary data indicating a downturn in arrests at the border this month, the government has reverted, at least for the time being, and they had to disregard Judge Pushden to do so, they've had to revert to this Catch and Release Policy for illegal immigrants who enter the country with children. So that's frustrating. I'd be very careful. If the voters start believing that you're abandoning the core policies that they elected you to advance, they'll remove you from office. No matter how much they initially liked you and no matter how much seniority you have. And when the Democrats stir up young voters as Ocasio-Cortez did last night, promising them the moon, a host of freebies? How are Republicans going to respond? How do they message the conservative populist agenda that's so smart, so right for younger voters? Disruptors create political opportunities for both sides. But their unexpected victories also carry warnings for those who attempt to conduct business as usual. Trump so far isn't doing that but on the few issues, we have to keep a very close watch. And that's the Angle.   Let's get reaction to this leftward turn from my first guest tonight Reagan administration member, what was it, you were Associate White House political director, I'm sorry Jeff, I should have known that off the top of my head. Former Senator Schumer aide, Chris Hahn and former secret service agent Dan Bongino on NRATV. All right let's go right to you Chris, this was a big big night for the Democrats last night. Republicans experienced their own seat change in 2014, but last night we had this young upstart, if you were a Democrat, she's kind of cool. I mean she's young, she's hip, she's using social media, she's out there at the border screaming how ICE is committing human rights violations. But does that win elections nationally?",

She got her people out and by the time Crowley noticed that she was nipping at his heels, in fact, beating him, it was way too late.

Sooner or later when you start painting white versus black, immigrant versus nonimmigrant, union versus union, you eventually start this cannibalistic tendency and it's happening now.  And if I can just comment on one this Chris said too, he's not wrong, all politics is local in a House of Representatives race.

For too long, of course, the court has in key cases, strayed from simple statutory and constitutional interpretation in order to advance a liberal social agenda. So what do they do when they do that? Well they usurp the role of people's duly elected representatives. Well this violates the idea of self-government. Self-government with a purpose when Ronald Reagan called it, is a goal ultimately, is to preserve individual liberty. Consider that 45 years ago, Row versus Wade, where the court found this mythical right to abortion in the constitution, the debate about abortion in America today, all those years later is as intense as ever. It is interesting that in Kennedy's last term on the court, he voted for the majority in the 5-4 cases in all of those 19 instances. And in fact, I can't think of a more reassuring Supreme Court term in recent memory. The court reaffirmed religious liberty rights, and the First Amendment right. Not to be strong armed by unions to fund causes to offend core values, and the majority upheld the president's statutory authority to control immigration for national security in the travel ban case. Yes, these were all wins for the administration, but more importantly they were wins for liberty and sovereignty, the constitution. So this is not the time for the administration to play it safe, to nominate someone who's considered a judicial moderate or to allow concerns about gender or ethnicity over ride pure merit and fidelity to the Constitution. So use this opportunity to nominate another stellar figure to the highest court of the land who respects the limits to the judiciary and respects the Constitution and our Bill of Rights.

I keep saying this but this was an unbelievable day, an earthquake at the Supreme Court that could change the direction of the nation. The retirement of the Supreme Court Justice, Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's key swing vote will have enormous consequences. It gives President Trump the opportunity to reshape the court for decades. We're also going to look at how this dramatically affects the midterm election prospects, but first, we begin Democrats racing to the left, that the focus of tonight's Angle. The Democratic Party experienced a seismic shock last night when in the New York City outer boroughs, a 28 year old political novice, primaried and defeated a member of the Democratic leadership. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ended the 20 year run of Congressman Joe Crowley who many thought would succeed Pelosi as the Democratic leader. So he raised three million dollars in the race, Ocasio-Cortez about three hundred thousand. By now you may have heard some of the bullet points here, she a member of the Democrat Socialist of America, who isn't? She supports publicly funded trade schools and universities. Well she worked for Ted Kennedy and Bernie Sanders. She's called for the abolishment of immigration customs enforcement, otherwise known as ICE.

But then he stood up the Democratic base, the establishment? They put him down. Well you can only do that for so long until your voters rebel which is what they did against Crowley last night. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D—VERMONT: I think what it should tell the American people is that when you have candidates like Alexandria who have the guts to talk about the real issues impacting people's lives.

The Republican Party, let's not forget though, they experienced its own wakeup call back in 2014. Now Eric Canter, remember he was ousted by that barely known econ professor named Dave Brat and then speaker John Boehner was ushered into retirement not long thereafter.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well when I said cheering, that's Mitch McConnell style cheering. Before Republicans don't stop popping the corks, there's a lesson here for them as well. Think about it this way if Republicans start walking back from the Trump agenda, walking away from it. If they get wobbly or try to diffuse the key Trump policies that Trump won on, that he ran on, danger lies ahead. Republicans today failed to pass another immigration bill and this after they rejected the Congressman Goodlatte bill, that was the most faithful and the best, as far as the original Trump agenda went. It's really stupid. Meanwhile the White House backed off threats to strictly limit the Chinese investment in U.S. tech companies. Another disappointment. Although at least Beijing and Wall Street were happy. And despite preliminary data indicating a downturn in arrests at the border this month, the government has reverted, at least for the time being, and they had to disregard Judge Pushden to do so, they've had to revert to this Catch and Release Policy for illegal immigrants who enter the country with children. So that's frustrating. I'd be very careful. If the voters start believing that you're abandoning the core policies that they elected you to advance, they'll remove you from office. No matter how much they initially liked you and no matter how much seniority you have. And when the Democrats stir up young voters as Ocasio-Cortez did last night, promising them the moon, a host of freebies? How are Republicans going to respond? How do they message the conservative populist agenda that's so smart, so right for younger voters? Disruptors create political opportunities for both sides. But their unexpected victories also carry warnings for those who attempt to conduct business as usual. Trump so far isn't doing that but on the few issues, we have to keep a very close watch. And that's the Angle. Let's get reaction to this leftward turn from my first guest tonight Reagan administration member, what was it, you were Associate White House political director, I'm sorry Jeff, I should have known that off the top of my head. Former Senator Schumer aide, Chris Hahn and former secret service agent Dan Bongino on NRATV. All right let's go right to you Chris, this was a big big night for the Democrats last night. Republicans experienced their own seat change in 2014, but last night we had this young upstart, if you were a Democrat, she's kind of cool. I mean she's young, she's hip, she's using social media, she's out there at the border screaming how ICE is committing human rights violations. But does that win elections nationally?"

So she really played on that's. She did a very good job and remember these are very low turnout elections and there had never been June primary in that district. She got her people out and by the time Crowley noticed that she was nipping at his heels, in fact, beating him, it was way too late.

But it points out the cliff you're walking off Laura, with identity politics. Sooner or later when you start painting white versus black, immigrant versus nonimmigrant, union versus union, you eventually start this cannibalistic tendency and it's happening now. And if I can just comment on one this Chris said too, he's not wrong, all politics is local in a House of Representatives race. But the problem with the Democratic Party, Laura is local politics aren't national. This is why the Democrat Party, because of Maxine Waters, Ocasio Cortez, Keith Ellison and his border shirt he had on, this is why the Democrats would win a governorship in California, New Yoke and can't win and probably won't win a national election in 2020."

For too long, of course, the court has in key cases, strayed from simple statutory and constitutional interpretation in order to advance a liberal social agenda. So what do they do when they do that? Well they usurp the role of people's duly elected representatives. Well this violates the idea of self-government. Self-government with a purpose when Ronald Reagan called it, is a goal ultimately, is to preserve individual liberty. Consider that 45 years ago, Row versus Wade, where the court found this mythical right to abortion in the constitution, the debate about abortion in America today, all those years later is as intense as ever. It is interesting that in Kennedy's last term on the court, he voted for the majority in the 5-4 cases in all of those 19 instances. And in fact, I can't think of a more reassuring Supreme Court term in recent memory. The court reaffirmed religious liberty rights, and the First Amendment right. Not to be strong armed by unions to fund causes to offend core values, and the majority upheld the president's statutory authority to control immigration for national security in the travel ban case. Yes, these were all wins for the administration, but more importantly they were wins for liberty and sovereignty, the constitution. So this is not the time for the administration to play it safe, to nominate someone who's considered a judicial moderate or to allow concerns about gender or ethnicity over ride pure merit and fidelity to the Constitution. So use this opportunity to nominate another stellar figure to the highest court of the land who respects the limits to the judiciary and respects the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. Let's discuss all of this with my guests, Texas Lister General, Scott Keller who clerked for Justice Kennedy, Ed Whalen, President of the Justice Policy Center and President of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp. Okay guys, this is like such a dream day, I mean, it's sad because it's the last of Ronald Reagan's nominees, obviously Justice Kennedy was controversial in some cases but he was an amazing justice in so many other ways.

He voted against all of ObamaCare. He obviously had the abortion cases he did, but he also voted to uphold the federal partial birth abortion ban.

And as we noted earlier, she supports the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE. So let's look at the party's future with a sitting Democratic Congressmen who also shares that view, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin. Congressman, first of all, I want to thank you for coming on this show. We invite a lot of your colleagues in the Democratic Party and most of them say no. We really respect you for coming on tonight. So thanks so much. REP. MARK POCAN, D—WISC.: Very glad to be her."

      "utterance": "I think what we saw, not just that win but other wins around the country, a lot of people are progressive, especially in the Democratic primaries. But I would argue a lot of those issues resonate in competitive districts. So we actually did a poll for the progressive caucus, 30 competitive swing districts. The issues that progressive supported mirrored the issues that people in the swing districts supported. So again, I think if you talk in an honest and authentic like Bernie Sanders did when he ran, I think you can do really well with the voters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This is what Ocasio-Cortez said when she was asked today about whether she would support Nancy Pelosi as speaker. Let's watch."

    {
      "speaker": "ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "I think ICE is right there as a part of it. It's extrajudicial nature is baked into the structure of the agency, and that's why they are able to get away with black sites on our border, with the separation of children."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So that was her talking about Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. You also agree with her that ICE should be abolished, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POCAN",
      "utterance": "Yes. So I was down at the border a couple weeks ago and just watching the buildup of how ICE has been misused from its original focus I think after 9/11. And I just think that it's impossible for ICE to still do its functions. Now when people see an ICE jacket, instead of being able to go into community and get information to get someone who might be a bad figure, everyone's afraid and they run from it. You're not going to be able to accomplish the goal. So we think there are plenty of functions that have to continue to happen. You can put those back in other agencies, but the way ICE currently is operating especially under President Trump makes it impossible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Again, they are operating that way because we have a fairly big crush from Central America, not as much from Mexico, but from Central America across the border. We've had tens of thousands of people come over the last several months. You've got to do something with them, and ICE is charged with figuring out why people are coming into the country. If you're not coming through a normal port of entry, they have to be dealt with. You wouldn't submit that they just walk into the country and not be greeted by anybody, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POCAN",
      "utterance": "So here is one of the problems that I found when I went to the Hidalgo Bridge, a legal point of entry where you can claim asylum. They are doing everything possible to make it almost possible for someone to come there to claim asylum. So then you either go back into Mexico where you can be kidnapped by a cartel and held hostage."

    {
      "speaker": "POCAN",
      "utterance": "I don't work for the Mexican government, so I couldn't tell you. But what happens is people get forced into that risk of a cartel or they come in illegally and then they wind up in the system. So really part of our problem is how we are taking enforcement at those legal points of entry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "This is what she said, Ocasio-Cortez, about the Nancy Pelosi issue. I think we have it now. Apparently we have trouble. But she said she wouldn't support her. That's an interesting position your party is in. The Republicans have gone through their own fits and starts, and they elected Donald Trump. They really hit leadership. John Boehner is out. Eric Cantor is out. Donald Trump is president. Are you going to see that in the Democrat Party? Is she more like you, more like the Bernie Sanders wing, is that the vibrant future where you can get blue-collar workers, maybe white working-class workers, to look toward the party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POCAN",
      "utterance": "I think, again, what we are trying to do is if we appeal on an economic message, I think the one thing we can all agree on is Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump ran on actually a pretty similar message about the system being rigged against them, and it resonated. And so I think what we've seen in some of these primaries around the country when people talk about the fact that unfortunately in this town the special interests have way too much sway. People really feel that. Drain the swamp was a brilliant line."

      "utterance": "The recent border crisis may not be the winning issue the left hoped it would be. According to a new Rasmussen poll, most Americans do not blame President Trump for separating children from parents who cross the border illegally. This survey found that 54 percent of likely voters blame the parents. Who would have thunk it? Only 35 percent blame the federal government for actually enforcing the law. Here now Hans Von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, expert in this, and we welcome back Democratic pollster Doug Schoen. Doug, we have to finish this point. Hans has got to come in on this immigration issue, so key."

      "utterance": "But we have now president Trump at 47 percent in the new Harvard-Harris poll. That came out late today. The Democrats I think are, their heads are spinning. Is it 53 percent. Yes, 53 percent. It's 47 percent, excuse me, 47 percent. Not bad. I guess it was 53 percent back in May. But 47 percent given all the negative media coverage, separating families at the border, everyone blaming him for that in the media, that's not bad. So I'm not sure the immigration issue is going to be the gold that Democrats thought it would be."

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "Look, people don't like the images of families being separated. Let's be clear. But what they want is comprehensive immigration reform, not the endless political battles. And to have the Democrats basically saying get rid of ICE or they are fascistic or whatever rather than proposing concrete solutions like build the wall, secure the borders, and have a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers, that's logical and rational and what swing voters want, not just this rhetoric and this extreme behavior that Democrats appear in some way to be encouraging, Laura."

      "utterance": "Yes, but this doesn't help the Democratic Party. You talk to the American voters, one of the reasons that Trump got elected was because American voters said we finally want to see our immigration laws enforced. And this latest polling showing that common sense, they blame the illegal parents for bringing their kids across the border with them. That makes complete sense and that shows you why I think the Democrats with these protests, they are not actually doing themselves any favors."

That becomes the mainstream of the Democratic Party. They do so much work, such important work for the country. Now they are being blamed for people coming into the country because if you have a child, you can never be deported. And now that's ICE's fault?"

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "No, of course it isn't. The congressman was indeed affable, very likable. But I am not for Medicare for all. I'm not for a guaranteed job, guaranteed college. I am for rational economic policies with a social safety net and securing the borders. What is so terrible about that?"

We'll sit there together. It will be fun. We'll live tweet the whole deal. I always love to read your comments on Twitter, most of the time. Some of them are not so nice, but we like those too. It's a big country. You've got to make your views heard, just keep it respectful. Let's hand it off to Shannon Bream and the fantastic \"Fox News @ Night\" team."
