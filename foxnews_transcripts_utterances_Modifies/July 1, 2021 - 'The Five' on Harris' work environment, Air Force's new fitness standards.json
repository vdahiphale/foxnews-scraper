This is \"The Five.\" Well, apparently working for Kamala Harris is no walk in the park, 22 current and former aides telling the \"Politico\" the VP oversees an abusive workplace where morale is low and concerns are ignored. The outlet painting this unflattering picture \"People are thrown under the bus from the very top, there are short fuses and it's an abusive environment, said another person with direct knowledge of how Harris' office is run. It's not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated. It's not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like bleep.\"  And although much of the criticism is aimed at the VP's chief of staff, many of the sources are blaming Kamala Harris herself saying the toxicity all starts from the top. The alleged mistreatment is a big difference from President Biden's promise to staffers.",

But this is not the first time Harris has been accused of fostering a bad work environment. In fact, Jesse, back during her presidential campaign, this letter was sent in as part of a resignation in which the staffer said \"This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat a staff so poorly. It is not acceptable to me that we encourage people to move from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice with no plan for the campaign and without thoughtful consideration of the personal consequences to them.\"  And around that time, there was a \"New York Times\" story that had 50 staffers quoted saying similar things.",

This is 22 people talking to \"Politico,\" not a right-wing publication. So, you know it's 10 times worse than it actually is. It sounds like a jailbreak or a cry for help, people are leaving, they have left. They're looking to get out of there. And it doesn't surprise me because the campaign imploded and now the VP's office is imploding. She is a very insecure person, she's riddled with insecurities, very defensive and you see that when she is cackling like a wacko. But this is early for the disintegration of the VP's office. We are not even six months in, Dana, and the heat is not even on yet. Wait until the summer kicks in and you really see the high gas prices, the crime and the immigration. It's going to really ramp up pressure on her.   And the Biden White House recognizes the problem. They said that in the article, and they are \"concerned\" about it. And that's why I think you see the attempts to raise the profile of Dr. Jill. She is now a policy walk, a senior advisor. She's going to Tokyo for the Olympic Games. Kamala is sidelined for that. So, look for a little bit of that backbiting between those two women. That should be fun to follow. Joe Biden has to be thinking \"thank god it's not me\" because that's the struggling puppet. He is having a hard time basically completing basic tasks and as long as the pressure is on Kamala, I expect to see her getting set up for more failures as the year goes on.",

They did also put her not just in charge of the border and the immigration problem, but also in charge of efforts to protect voting rights.   So, in terms of disintegration, her potential for being the next president of the United States is disappearing. But I personally love Symone Sanders' comment, one of the lines from her was about, \"We are not making rainbows and bunnies all day.\" So she is in essence saying we don't care about your delicate feelings. Our hostile workplace is okay because we are doing hard work. In essence, she is saying that, you know, suck it up and back up, buttercup. We are doing god's work here.

Four years obviously understand, and a go watch. These are tough jobs. And you want smart people, tough people, people who can handle the back and forth, people who don't get afraid with a bad headline or tremble or rattle, and she probably needs to hire some new people. Look, you know, some people have suggested that she gets hard assignments, that's what the vice president gets. I have not heard the vice president complain about that, and we can be critical of other things about her, but I think it's unfair to be critical when these people work at the pleasure of the president.  There's only one person at this table who had that honor. And when the president doesn't want you to work or vice president doesn't want you to work for them anymore you got to move on. So, you know, this is not about a grade about her performance as vice president, but I tend to agree with Symone Sanders, who I don't know very well.   I tend to lean more towards what she is saying. Again, if their allegations that they want to make about the workplace, they should make those allegations, but to come to work and say it's hard and that it's tough and that, gosh, how am I going to do this? You need new people. This is a real job. We've got real challenges to stare down here.",

So, that's that. If Brittany were broke, this would not be happening. You have homeless people in L.A. in camps, you can't get a conservatorship. You can't institutionalize them. You institutionalize her because she's a money machine. This is not designed to conservatorship for people at that age and people that wealthy. It is designed for people at the way end of their lives that can't manage their affairs, can't manage themselves, they're bathing, their teeth brushing, those kinds of things.

This is \"The Five.\" Well, apparently working for Kamala Harris is no walk in the park, 22 current and former aides telling the \"Politico\" the VP oversees an abusive workplace where morale is low and concerns are ignored. The outlet painting this unflattering picture \"People are thrown under the bus from the very top, there are short fuses and it's an abusive environment, said another person with direct knowledge of how Harris' office is run. It's not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated. It's not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like bleep.\" And although much of the criticism is aimed at the VP's chief of staff, many of the sources are blaming Kamala Harris herself saying the toxicity all starts from the top. The alleged mistreatment is a big difference from President Biden's promise to staffers."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Harris' chief spokesperson, Symone Sanders defended the VP and said people who made the claims are cowards. But this is not the first time Harris has been accused of fostering a bad work environment. In fact, Jesse, back during her presidential campaign, this letter was sent in as part of a resignation in which the staffer said \"This is my third presidential campaign and I have never seen an organization treat a staff so poorly. It is not acceptable to me that we encourage people to move from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore only to lay them off with no notice with no plan for the campaign and without thoughtful consideration of the personal consequences to them.\" And around that time, there was a \"New York Times\" story that had 50 staffers quoted saying similar things."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Toxic femininity in my opinion, Dana. And this isn't just like a low-level staffer that worked for Trump saying something that got overheard by \"Politico\" and sensationalized. This is 22 people talking to \"Politico,\" not a right-wing publication. So, you know it's 10 times worse than it actually is. It sounds like a jailbreak or a cry for help, people are leaving, they have left. They're looking to get out of there. And it doesn't surprise me because the campaign imploded and now the VP's office is imploding. She is a very insecure person, she's riddled with insecurities, very defensive and you see that when she is cackling like a wacko. But this is early for the disintegration of the VP's office. We are not even six months in, Dana, and the heat is not even on yet. Wait until the summer kicks in and you really see the high gas prices, the crime and the immigration. It's going to really ramp up pressure on her. And the Biden White House recognizes the problem. They said that in the article, and they are \"concerned\" about it. And that's why I think you see the attempts to raise the profile of Dr. Jill. She is now a policy walk, a senior advisor. She's going to Tokyo for the Olympic Games. Kamala is sidelined for that. So, look for a little bit of that backbiting between those two women. That should be fun to follow. Joe Biden has to be thinking \"thank god it's not me\" because that's the struggling puppet. He is having a hard time basically completing basic tasks and as long as the pressure is on Kamala, I expect to see her getting set up for more failures as the year goes on."

They did also put her not just in charge of the border and the immigration problem, but also in charge of efforts to protect voting rights. So, in terms of disintegration, her potential for being the next president of the United States is disappearing. But I personally love Symone Sanders' comment, one of the lines from her was about, \"We are not making rainbows and bunnies all day.\" So she is in essence saying we don't care about your delicate feelings. Our hostile workplace is okay because we are doing hard work. In essence, she is saying that, you know, suck it up and back up, buttercup. We are doing god's work here. If you, you know, if you don't like it go work for Jenny Granholm. I kind of like that attitude."

Four years obviously understand, and a go watch. These are tough jobs. And you want smart people, tough people, people who can handle the back and forth, people who don't get afraid with a bad headline or tremble or rattle, and she probably needs to hire some new people. Look, you know, some people have suggested that she gets hard assignments, that's what the vice president gets. I have not heard the vice president complain about that, and we can be critical of other things about her, but I think it's unfair to be critical when these people work at the pleasure of the president. There's only one person at this table who had that honor. And when the president doesn't want you to work or vice president doesn't want you to work for them anymore you got to move on. So, you know, this is not about a grade about her performance as vice president, but I tend to agree with Symone Sanders, who I don't know very well. I tend to lean more towards what she is saying. Again, if their allegations that they want to make about the workplace, they should make those allegations, but to come to work and say it's hard and that it's tough and that, gosh, how am I going to do this? You need new people. This is a real job. We've got real challenges to stare down here."

So this is what you call the rhetoric of bullying which is like, the workplace is abusive, it's not healthy, mistreatment and toxicity. When you actually drill down into that it's like, well, he didn't say hello to me in the elevator, right? It's like stuff like that and it's like, you know what, that kind of rhetoric sets me off and makes me think it's a bunch of whiny brats.

Well, because car insurance doesn't require you to cover other people's accidents, right? So this doesn't make any sense. It's absurd on its face.

Now, if you buy 100 guns and all of a sudden all them are stolen, something might be fishy and find about what you're doing. And how these guns, again, I've said over and over again, you can't get a fresh apple, a good book, a dental visit in a lot of these neighborhoods where these people are finding -- these kids are finding guns.

You put the burden on lower income individuals, they can't -- they're not allowed to defend themselves. Lower income communities, neighborhoods, high crime areas, communities of color, that's what's so disgusting. The reason it's theater is because these jackasses on the city council clearly have bigger political ambitions so what they're going to do is have all these gun rights groups pay for the legal fees when they get their pantsuit off of them over this law and then they are going to use it for public relations, but it's not going anywhere."

Brittany's attorney was expected to file a petition to end a conservatorship, but for some reason, her lawyer has yet to do that. So, we've got some opinions around this thing.

From my understanding of this case, the reason the judge denied it is because the court-appointed lawyer botched the paperwork and was late with everything, and they still haven't filed the right paperwork. So, that's that. If Brittany were broke, this would not be happening. You have homeless people in L.A. in camps, you can't get a conservatorship. You can't institutionalize them. You institutionalize her because she's a money machine. This is not designed to conservatorship for people at that age and people that wealthy. It is designed for people at the way end of their lives that can't manage their affairs, can't manage themselves, they're bathing, their teeth brushing, those kinds of things. She's clearly not incapacitated. You heard her read very proficiently. She's performing at a very high level, feeding, paying dozens of people, and this goes on and on. And I do feel bad for her.

Well, then there's another piece, you know, pull the string, that says the court-appointed lawyer didn't tell her that she could file that. And if that's true, then obviously that's wrong.

And they interviewed Brittany fans on Instagram, but they didn't talk to any psychiatrists. Now, I understand. psychiatrists don't want to be on the record about what's going, but there's something very profound that's been happening with this young woman, talented, with her mental health and with other issues, potentially dual diagnosis.

Now, we can say, no, it'd be better for you to be in the office because then you'll be seen and you're more likely to be thought of for opportunities, and that's your way up. But I don't think they necessarily think that they don't want to be called on the telephone. They would rather have a text exchange that goes on for three days to organize one pickup at the airport than to just pick up the phone and get it done really quickly.
