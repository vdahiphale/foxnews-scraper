Well, those people for many times wouldn't ever show up for that court appointment, but they would be in the country and then be here essentially illegally. So, I think what the president is recommending is the right course of action, because if we can't protect our borders, we cannot protect our country.",

And certainly it's not fair for the people of the United States, who sometimes then bear the burden of the additional expenses related to the people who are here illegally. So, I support what the president is doing. I support what the secretary of homeland security has promoted, but it also gets to the cases we need a secretary of state to be dealing with other countries around the world, where some of those people are coming from, because when you look at what is going on in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, all of those countries, there are things to be dealt with there on the ground.",
