But in this case the president has a good trait of wanting to meet with people. With Iran he is right to be skeptical. He should perhaps be more skeptical. It's not just that he said no preconditions. It's that Iran is saying that they have some preconditions, including easing up on sanctions. Our sanctions are doing good work. This policy of maximum pressure is doing good work. So hopefully whatever goes forward, they don't ease up without getting something in return.",

This seems to be about concerns about underage people developing an interest in nicotine, and also they are talking about this smattering of deaths more as a tool to get people to go along with it.  But these deaths actually have nothing to do with vaping products that are sold in stores. They are about doing things on the black market.

It was only as recently as 2016, Grover Norquist, the famous activists of American for Tax Reform was touting the 9 million vapers as a new interest group in America that was going to have its way.

And we saw some indication from Justice Thomas a few years ago, or last year, that this use of nationwide injunctions is getting to be such a problem that it might have to be dealt with by the court. At least five justices have decided to stay here, and it might not just be about the case but about their frustration with overuse of nationwide injunctions.",

So this is potentially a real blow to them. And I was struck by the fact that only two justices, Sotomayor and Ginsburg, recorded the sense against this.

You are absolutely right that people didn't have confidence, if Barack Obama had said some of these things, I don't think they had confidence that he had the nation's best interest, or some people might have had that viewpoint. But in this case the president has a good trait of wanting to meet with people. With Iran he is right to be skeptical. He should perhaps be more skeptical. It's not just that he said no preconditions. It's that Iran is saying that they have some preconditions, including easing up on sanctions. Our sanctions are doing good work. This policy of maximum pressure is doing good work. So hopefully whatever goes forward, they don't ease up without getting something in return."

      "utterance": "Banning vaping products, flavored e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes illnesses and deaths, 450 possible cases of lung illness across 33 states and the Virgin Islands, six confirmed deaths across six states. Just big picture, more than 16 million Americans live a disease caused by smoking, not vaping in particular, but smoking cigarettes, and they would say 480,000 deaths per year in the United States caused by that, leading cause of preventable death. Back with the panel. Mollie, the Vaping Association says in a history of the United States prohibition has never worked. Why does President Trump think that's going to do it?"

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure if it's true that it's never worked, but people should think about the consequences of this type of regulation. As you saw, hundreds of thousands of people die from smoking, millions more have smoking-related illnesses. Vaping has been a very effective tool for many people to cease smoking. This seems to be about concerns about underage people developing an interest in nicotine, and also they are talking about this smattering of deaths more as a tool to get people to go along with it. But these deaths actually have nothing to do with vaping products that are sold in stores. They are about doing things on the black market. So increasing the black market sales that people use where they basically also vape with marijuana and whatnot is not a good way to decrease these deaths."

And I think there is evidence, to follow up on Mollie's point, there is evidence including, a JAMA article just from July, a study in France that shows that use of e-cigarettes, daily use of e-cigarettes actually contributes to the cessation of smoking combustible cigarettes. That's an important finding. We should stack evidence upon evidence, fact upon fact, finding upon finding, and then draw conclusions. This seems preemptive and it seems unwise."

      "utterance": "I have no handle on the science, but I feel I have a better handle on the politics of this because I've been to parent meetings at high schools where the topic is people vaping. Parents all over America are freaked out about underage vaping. And I believe that's what is ultimately underlying this. It was only as recently as 2016, Grover Norquist, the famous activists of American for Tax Reform was touting the 9 million vapers as a new interest group in America that was going to have its way. And it's turned out, people are learning, the president is learning, you want to talk about a powerful interest group, it's parents in the suburbs who are worried about the health of their kids, and I think that's what this is all about."

The president just tweeting out \"Big United States Supreme Court win for border on asylum.\" Mollie, this is not the merits of the case. This allows it to go forward while the legal challenges continue, but you still think it's significant?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "That's why it's significant. We have seen since Trump was elected, a lot of courts issuing nationwide injunctions. And this is an attempt, it's basically a resistance attempt. You see some resistance in the executive, some in the legislative branch. This is the judicial branch's version of it. We don't like who won the election, so we're throwing out the rule of law. And we saw some indication from Justice Thomas a few years ago, or last year, that this use of nationwide injunctions is getting to be such a problem that it might have to be dealt with by the court. At least five justices have decided to stay here, and it might not just be about the case but about their frustration with overuse of nationwide injunctions."

      "utterance": "One reason practically why this is important is that the opponents of Trump's policies on the board have been going to the Ninth Circuit where there are more liberal judges, even though all the action on the border is in Texas which is the conservative Fifth Circuit, and then they've been getting the nationwide injunctions to change of policy all along the border. So this is potentially a real blow to them. And I was struck by the fact that only two justices, Sotomayor and Ginsburg, recorded the sense against this. If that means there were actually seven votes in favor of the administration's policy, that's a very good sign for the administration."
