A group of scientists is calling on Spotify to censor Joe Rogan show, specifically because he featured the inventor of the mRNA vaccine platform, Dr. Robert Malone. Tonight Dr. Malone is here to respond. And since I'm hosting, we needed somebody to fill the Friday Follies void. Thankfully, actor and director Robert Davi stepped up, and we have video of an unhinged professor that you will not believe. Get your space helmet. Stay for that. But first, there is a new Quinnipiac poll that caught my attention. It claims that 58 percent of Americans believe democracy is in danger of collapse, collapse. I can see why they might think that. Oh, I'm not talking about the media fueled January 6th narrative, where a band of goofballs broke windows at the Capitol. No. Citizens even obnoxious trespassing riot as citizens are not the real threat to democracy. Otherwise, the DOJ would have a task force tracking down these rioters too. The real threat is the one the founders identified, a tyrannical government that forces its will on citizens, regardless of what the Constitution says. A good example of this is the Biden administration's push to secure what it calls voting rights legislation. Now, bear in mind, the Democrats have introduced versions of their election reform bill for years. Had they thought it - well, brought it rather to a vote around Flag Day, they might have argued the bill has to be passed, or you'll never see old glory again. But with MLK Day approaching, they made this bill about race. The President and his supporters quickly took up the refrain.",

The bill would, in case you want to check up on it, not require picture IDs; force states to offer no excuse mail-in ballots; prohibit states from requiring witnesses or notarizations on mail-in ballots; and it would limit states' ability to purge their own voter rules to get rid of unqualified voters. Now, these bills introduce exactly the election subversion Mr. Biden claims to hate. It destabilizes and dilutes the votes of every citizens, or citizen, no matter your race, because it will be impossible to verify who's voting or even if they're alive. I would call that a threat to democracy. Oh, and Congress will be taking more of your money. This voting rights boondoggle implements public funding of congressional campaigns. That's right. For every $1 that Liz Cheney or Nancy Pelosi raise in small donations, they'll get six of your dollars, $6. How does that help your voting rights? Don't ask me. It's really just politicians helping themselves. Then yesterday, the Biden administration's draconian vaccine mandate for businesses was struck down.

The flagrant dismissal of the authority of Congress, the Supreme Court, even the states? I thought respect for the other branches of government was at the center of American democracy. But in this mad power grab, we have an administration intent on stripping us of local power, even over our elections. One that uses a virus to impose its will on all people, and anyone who objects is subject to shunning demonization, unemployment, and in some cases, federal prosecution. Being a good American is not doing as we are told by the federal government and then being forced to fund our own subjugation. That is called autocracy.

In other words, they're willing to sacrifice Black bodies for Black votes, even as they hijack the civil rights movement. What they're doing in New York, for instance, they're tipping their hand. They are now - the mayor is saying that 800,000 illegal immigrants now should - or non citizens should be allowed to vote. Governor Newsom is saying that non citizens, immigrants are also eligible for health care, and also open borders undermining jobs. How are those three initiatives contributing to the social justice for Blacks in whose name they are saying - they are making these demands? The other point is voting rights, the biggest deterrent to voter suppression rather is apathy.

I know of one woman who lost all four of her sons to homicide before the age of 30. That's the crisis facing of a low income Black America. It is not voting rights. Some of the same murders and - are occurring in cities that have been run by Black politicians over the past 50 years. If racism were the sole culprit then why are Blacks failing in institutions run by their own people? Why are they failing in political systems where all the control is in the hands of Black politicians? These are the way you can avoid having to address this dilemma, this - what I call, the enemy within the black community is what we must address. And concentrating on voting rights is the reflection away from that reality. It prevents us from coming up with solutions that the Woodson Center has been promoting and will continue to promote.

So this is just another attempt by the Biden administration to impose the federal will on the states. And I know Joe Biden's memory is bad. But I assume that he was around when the Constitution was written. And he should remember that the states created the federal government, the federal government didn't create the states.

And so in this country, we have seen right now the Biden administration, the progressive left trying to nationalize everything, whether it's socializing our economy, nationalizing our elections, and now trying to take control of our local schools. And so there's this fundamental question about, why do we even have a federal Department of Education? Why is the federal government dictating to places like Phoenix, Arizona, or Tucson, that they have to teach critical race theory, or they have to have this mask policy or that policy? Because fundamentally, we need to start getting back to the notion that local issues should be left up to people in those states. It's not up to the federal government to solve every one of our problems. And as we send our tax dollars to Washington, D.C., the federal government keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and it becomes oppressive. And this is why the framers wanted our federal government to be limited. And that's what the Constitution was designed to do, because the framers understood as government gets bigger, it becomes unresponsive. It becomes oppressive. And that's why you end up in situations where Joe Biden and AOC want to dictate to our schools in Arizona that they should teach this, or teach that, or they should have this kind of policy.

A group of scientists is calling on Spotify to censor Joe Rogan show, specifically because he featured the inventor of the mRNA vaccine platform, Dr. Robert Malone. Tonight Dr. Malone is here to respond. And since I'm hosting, we needed somebody to fill the Friday Follies void. Thankfully, actor and director Robert Davi stepped up, and we have video of an unhinged professor that you will not believe. Get your space helmet. Stay for that. But first, there is a new Quinnipiac poll that caught my attention. It claims that 58 percent of Americans believe democracy is in danger of collapse, collapse. I can see why they might think that. Oh, I'm not talking about the media fueled January 6th narrative, where a band of goofballs broke windows at the Capitol. No. Citizens even obnoxious trespassing riot as citizens are not the real threat to democracy. Otherwise, the DOJ would have a task force tracking down these rioters too. The real threat is the one the founders identified, a tyrannical government that forces its will on citizens, regardless of what the Constitution says. A good example of this is the Biden administration's push to secure what it calls voting rights legislation. Now, bear in mind, the Democrats have introduced versions of their election reform bill for years. Had they thought it - well, brought it rather to a vote around Flag Day, they might have argued the bill has to be passed, or you'll never see old glory again. But with MLK Day approaching, they made this bill about race. The President and his supporters quickly took up the refrain."

But this federal takeover of elections would deprive the states of their constitutional authority to regulate elections. It would also relax standards. The bill would, in case you want to check up on it, not require picture IDs; force states to offer no excuse mail-in ballots; prohibit states from requiring witnesses or notarizations on mail-in ballots; and it would limit states' ability to purge their own voter rules to get rid of unqualified voters. Now, these bills introduce exactly the election subversion Mr. Biden claims to hate. It destabilizes and dilutes the votes of every citizens, or citizen, no matter your race, because it will be impossible to verify who's voting or even if they're alive. I would call that a threat to democracy. Oh, and Congress will be taking more of your money. This voting rights boondoggle implements public funding of congressional campaigns. That's right. For every $1 that Liz Cheney or Nancy Pelosi raise in small donations, they'll get six of your dollars, $6. How does that help your voting rights? Don't ask me.

We're going to talk to the Attorney General in Arizona on the receiving end of this in moments. But do you see the utter disregard for norms? The flagrant dismissal of the authority of Congress, the Supreme Court, even the states? I thought respect for the other branches of government was at the center of American democracy. But in this mad power grab, we have an administration intent on stripping us of local power, even over our elections. One that uses a virus to impose its will on all people, and anyone who objects is subject to shunning demonization, unemployment, and in some cases, federal prosecution.

In other words, they're willing to sacrifice Black bodies for Black votes, even as they hijack the civil rights movement. What they're doing in New York, for instance, they're tipping their hand. They are now - the mayor is saying that 800,000 illegal immigrants now should - or non citizens should be allowed to vote. Governor Newsom is saying that non citizens, immigrants are also eligible for health care, and also open borders undermining jobs. How are those three initiatives contributing to the social justice for Blacks in whose name they are saying - they are making these demands? The other point is voting rights, the biggest deterrent to voter suppression rather is apathy. In many of our cities like Washington D.C., in mayoral elections and others, the turnout is under 6 percent in high crime areas.

I know of one woman who lost all four of her sons to homicide before the age of 30. That's the crisis facing of a low income Black America. It is not voting rights. Some of the same murders and - are occurring in cities that have been run by Black politicians over the past 50 years. If racism were the sole culprit then why are Blacks failing in institutions run by their own people? Why are they failing in political systems where all the control is in the hands of Black politicians? These are the way you can avoid having to address this dilemma, this - what I call, the enemy within the black community is what we must address. And concentrating on voting rights is the reflection away from that reality. It prevents us from coming up with solutions that the Woodson Center has been promoting and will continue to promote.

So this is just another attempt by the Biden administration to impose the federal will on the states. And I know Joe Biden's memory is bad. But I assume that he was around when the Constitution was written. And he should remember that the states created the federal government, the federal government didn't create the states. And so when Congress passed the COVID Relief Bill, they didn't impose conditions. And President Biden is not a king. He is the president.

Oregon reported $24 million in unemployment fraud in 2020. Michigan paid up to $8.5 billion in fraudulent jobless claims. And California's unemployment fraud hit $20 billion.

Let us never forget that any government that is big enough to give you everything is big enough to take it away. And so in this country, we have seen right now the Biden administration, the progressive left trying to nationalize everything, whether it's socializing our economy, nationalizing our elections, and now trying to take control of our local schools. And so there's this fundamental question about, why do we even have a federal Department of Education? Why is the federal government dictating to places like Phoenix, Arizona, or Tucson, that they have to teach critical race theory, or they have to have this mask policy or that policy? Because fundamentally, we need to start getting back to the notion that local issues should be left up to people in those states. It's not up to the federal government to solve every one of our problems. And as we send our tax dollars to Washington, D.C., the federal government keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and it becomes oppressive. And this is why the framers wanted our federal government to be limited. And that's what the Constitution was designed to do, because the framers understood as government gets bigger, it becomes unresponsive. It becomes oppressive. And that's why you end up in situations where Joe Biden and AOC want to dictate to our schools in Arizona that they should teach this, or teach that, or they should have this kind of policy. It's fundamentally wrong. And we need to get back to the states and local control."

Now, you all get penalized and targeted. It's outrageous. Thank you very much. Attorney General Brnovich. We will check in the days ahead. And the federal bullying doesn't stop there.

The idea is that if you've received vaccination, you get a priority over somebody who hasn't received vaccination. This whole mandate issue, and as you said in the opening segment, people who are vaccinated can still catch COVID and they can still spread COVID. I have friends and family right now who are vaccinated, who have COVID, and are having to quarantine.

Still ahead, we break down the lowlights from Biden's worst week as president. Don't go away. Wait until you see what they're doing next week."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. I'm Raymond Arroyo. It's been a depressing week for Joe Biden. On Monday, the CDC reported record high new COVID cases, 1.35 million. Tuesday, Stacey Abrams and activist groups ditched Biden's speech in Georgia. On Wednesday, inflation hit a 40 year high, and Biden's approval hit a new low, 33 percent. On Thursday, the Supreme Court blocked his vaccine mandate for large employers, and moderate Dems refused to gut the filibuster. What a week. Joining me now is Tom Bevan, cofounder and publisher of Real Clear Politics, and Jason Chaffetz, former Congressman and FOX News contributor. Tom, do the polls show anything working for Biden at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, COFOUNDER, REAL CLEAR POLITICS",
      "utterance": "No, not really. And most of the polling doesn't even incorporate all the things you just mentioned. We will probably see right now Biden is at 41.6 percent in our Real Clear Politics average. That is just off his all-time low of 41.3. As you mentioned, the Quinnipiac poll had him down at 33 percent among all adults and 35 percent among registered voters. So I expect we will see new lows for Biden in the coming weeks because at every turn now they are just hit with bad news. Nothing seems to be working, and they don't seem to have any sort of course correction or reset in place that will help them get out of the spot that they're in."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "No, it's a miserable situation politically for them. But as bad as it has been for Joe this week, you know it's going to get worse when this is your understudy, Jason."

      "utterance": "The cackle is gone, Jason. That's not giving Dems the confidence they need. Check out these headlines. Today \"The Washington Post\" writes \"Harris team looked to course change to reset her political prospects.\" And here's \"The New York Times,\" \"Heir Apparent or Afterthought? The Frustrations of Kamala Harris.\" A new report says Harris is considering more TV interviews, Jason, hoping it will help resuscitate Democrats' faith in her. Is this the path forward?"

      "speaker": "JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, her biggest mistake was she didn't get out away from the office enough. So the antidote is more television where she can't answer basic television? Are you kidding me? The fundamental problem with Biden and Harris is that their policies suck. They make America worse. And that's only going to exacerbate the problem. They give it their best shot for the first 12 months. They made America worse. They don't have something to fall back on. It's certainly not their oration skills. They're not go out and wow a crowd. I don't know where they fall back to, but they've absolutely blown it. They did it on day one. They did it with exactly what they wanted. Biden was out there saying he wants to build bridges with infrastructure. He hasn't built a bridge with Congress, let alone out in America."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",

      "speaker": "JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Our message to them is that we are still fighting right now. We are dealing with the realities of the fact that we have a very slim majority in the Senate and in the House. That makes things more challenging than they have been in the past."

    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "And that's the predicament that Biden finds himself in. He promised to unite the country, he promised to shut down the pandemic. And at every turn, he has taken the confrontational role, not only with Congress, but with red state government around the country. And so he finds himself in a very difficult position now where he can't -- the bridges are burned. He can't unburn them. And he has thrown his lot in with the leftwing of his party. And while that might energize the base in the short term during an election year, it also risks turning off moderates and independents, which he is doing in droves now. Go back to that Quinnipiac poll, his approval rating among independents is down 25 percent. That is a catastrophically low approval rating among swing voters that are going to decide a lot of these races in swing states."

    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "It's really a delusional type of leadership where he imagines that he's got these super majorities in both houses the way he governs, and yet everything goes down in flames except COVID relief. The RNC is finally getting tough on the presidential debate commission. CNN's Chris Cillizza, I always get that name wrong, had the dumbest take. He wrote \"There is no Republican Party these days outside of Trump and his whims. This move by the RNC is rightly read as the latest example of Trump's successful erosion of any sense that nonpartisan entities can and do exist.\" Jason, the GOP has been unhappy with presidential debate moderators for year now. This is nothing new."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "It's not anything new, you're absolutely right, Raymond. And what they need to do is stand tall and say we are half of this equation, and until we come to a mutual agreement, we're not going to participate in this charade on having these far left moderators out there asking the Republicans tough questions and asking softball of the Democrats. And by the way, the erosion of the support for the Democrats, just like Tom said, that only happens when you lose your base, you lose the moderates, you lose the independents. That is all Biden. It has nothing to do with Donald Trump."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "If you needed another reason to sign on to Laura's \"Not One Minute\" campaign, here's one. According to the \"USA Today,\" Team USA is telling athletes to use burner phones while in Beijing over fears of surveillance by the CCP. Think about this. We are actually teaching our athletes how to evade communist spies in 2022. With China's ongoing record of human and religious rights abuses, no one should be going to these genocide Olympics, and that's before considering their awful efforts to hide the pandemic. Skip the games. Watch not one minute of them. But do send time with those you love. That's it for us. I'm Raymond Arroyo. Thanks to Laura and the Anglers for letting me sit in tonight.
