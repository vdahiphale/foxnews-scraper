Then a video comes out and it shows that she did not take credit for it and he was wrong. This is to me, reminding of what happened yesterday when I thought as President Trump had tweeted that she fabricated everything with regards to this conversation he said was a secret conversation between him and the widow. Well, then it comes out, no, General Kelly says no, that President Trump did say, you know, the soldier knew what he was buying into when he went -- because he enlisted of his own volition. Well, turns out, Frederica Wilson was right again. So I think to myself, wow, why are people beating up Frederica Wilson when she in fact has been right twice.  LISA BOOTHE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No, they're beating up Frederica Wilson because she's essentially hanging her hat on this horrible issue to try to get national attention and to build up her name as evidenced by what she said on air that now she is a rock star. What a despicable way to become a household name for this very issue. And I think -- do anyone else feel like we've hit rock bottom in society? This entire week I just felt so dirty. And I think John Kelly came out there yesterday, and what he said was so sobering. What I think we saw from him was just a desperation to get back to a place in society where there's respect, where there's dignity, where anything is sacred. And what I find so sad is that another widow of a fallen soldier felt so compelled because of this pile on President Trump who released a private conversation that she had with the president, where he told her that her husband was a hero, come to the White House anytime, she said that at such a low point, she felt like she was talking to another human. And I just think we've reached such a sad place in society that this is now a week long story.

But this week, we've also learned what he apparently promise some guy $25,000 and didn't pay him until this week, those families.

Everything that's come under attack, think about it, comprehensive immigration reform, Obamacare, trade deals, climate deals, nuclear deals, NATO, nation-building, and not only that, Trump is going after institutions. He's gone after the CIA, the FBI, the military- industrial complex, the RNC, the DNC, and his attacks against Bush, I think he took it personally. Remember, he went after Jeb pretty harshly, daddy's boys, all that stuff. He made a couple of comment about 9/11 in the debate in South Carolina, that were quite personal. And he's gone after President Obama relentlessly, especially talking about his legacy under attack. The Iran deal, Obamacare, everything has been ripped to shreds, almost. So it's not only policy too. Their demeanors are totally different. You have Bush who came up as an elitist from a political family whose family was about public service. President Obama, mixed race, raised in Hawaii by his grandparents, more of a community organizer. And then you just have a brash businessman who grew up in Queens, hypercompetitive, and much more rough and gruff than these guys. And he doesn't play by the rules.

There were polls during the Obama administration saying that racial tensions have gotten significantly worse under his watch.

You even look at the partisanship and divide in both the parties, the fact that Republicans had 17 candidates in the Republican Party.

But this is acceptable now. You can just call anybody or smear anybody as racist and people just run in fear. And the only thing -- it's so sad. The only thing that can save us from these stories, these emotional spasms, sadly, is real news. We're living in a superficial, ongoing squabble. But when there is a hurricane or terror attack, we suddenly realize what's good, what's real in life, and that's the sadness.

I thought, well, so maybe that's what he means by empty barrel. That she takes credit for things that she didn't do. Then a video comes out and it shows that she did not take credit for it and he was wrong. This is to me, reminding of what happened yesterday when I thought as President Trump had tweeted that she fabricated everything with regards to this conversation he said was a secret conversation between him and the widow. Well, then it comes out, no, General Kelly says no, that President Trump did say, you know, the soldier knew what he was buying into when he went -- because he enlisted of his own volition. Well, turns out, Frederica Wilson was right again. So I think to myself, wow, why are people beating up Frederica Wilson when she in fact has been right twice. LISA BOOTHE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: No, they're beating up Frederica Wilson because she's essentially hanging her hat on this horrible issue to try to get national attention and to build up her name as evidenced by what she said on air that now she is a rock star. What a despicable way to become a household name for this very issue. And I think -- do anyone else feel like we've hit rock bottom in society? This entire week I just felt so dirty. And I think John Kelly came out there yesterday, and what he said was so sobering. What I think we saw from him was just a desperation to get back to a place in society where there's respect, where there's dignity, where anything is sacred. And what I find so sad is that another widow of a fallen soldier felt so compelled because of this pile on President Trump who released a private conversation that she had with the president, where he told her that her husband was a hero, come to the White House anytime, she said that at such a low point, she felt like she was talking to another human. And I just think we've reached such a sad place in society that this is now a week long story.

But I will say that the woman that you're talking about said that the president spoke to her in a way that was comforting. But this week, we've also learned what he apparently promise some guy $25,000 and didn't pay him until this week, those families. And don't forget, he's had a situation now with the woman who, you know, Frederica Wilson, the congresswoman, where his account really varies from the reality.

So the story has been two years. It's been out there. OK. Second thing, when people ask the FBI agent who are around at the time about it, including agents in charge of it say we didn't even know about it. It's possible that Clinton didn't know about it.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right. Because Trumpism is a rejection of Obama policies and Bush policies. Everything that's come under attack, think about it, comprehensive immigration reform, Obamacare, trade deals, climate deals, nuclear deals, NATO, nation-building, and not only that, Trump is going after institutions. He's gone after the CIA, the FBI, the military- industrial complex, the RNC, the DNC, and his attacks against Bush, I think he took it personally. Remember, he went after Jeb pretty harshly, daddy's boys, all that stuff. He made a couple of comment about 9/11 in the debate in South Carolina, that were quite personal. And he's gone after President Obama relentlessly, especially talking about his legacy under attack. The Iran deal, Obamacare, everything has been ripped to shreds, almost. So it's not only policy too. Their demeanors are totally different. You have Bush who came up as an elitist from a political family whose family was about public service. President Obama, mixed race, raised in Hawaii by his grandparents, more of a community organizer. And then you just have a brash businessman who grew up in Queens, hypercompetitive, and much more rough and gruff than these guys. And he doesn't play by the rules. So I don't mind hearing W and Obama saying these things. I didn't think these attacks were that sharp. So I think it's fine. They're getting paid very well. They've got to give the crowd a little, you know, red meat."

They're saying something is wrong in the country when you have this much division, where people are demonized by each other. And in one case that, you know, it's blasphemy, one president said, when you have white supremacy being bantered about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, you also saw President Obama passed something like Obamacare on party lines which is deeply divisive, right? So, I mean, you could go -- and George W. Bush also said that these things have been happening for a really long time in this country. All you have to do is look at congress throughout the previous administrations, the blockade there, the partisanship in congress has been something that's been going on for a long time. You look at something like racial tension, that gallop has been tracking, and it's been increasing year after year even under the Obama administration. There were polls during the Obama administration saying that racial tensions have gotten significantly worse under his watch. So I don't think that it's fair to point to President Trump as somehow the root of all these problems that have been existing for a while. You even look at the partisanship and divide in both the parties, the fact that Republicans had 17 candidates in the Republican Party. The fact that the DNC was on board with Hillary Clinton, which showed a lot of division of the Democrat Party. So I just think it's unfair to point to Trump."

If you look at what's happening right now under President Trump, you know, we've not invaded a country. China is involved in dealing with North Korea. We have a -- highly competent responses to hurricanes. We pulled out of a terrible climate deal. We are routing, destroying ISIS. We've rolled back regulation with no consequences. There has been no large terror attack like 9/11. So one could argue, for now. Knock on wood. [KNOCKING ON DESK]"

Emotional conflicts and arguments, dissent, arguments over phone calls and kneeling and tweets. But actual deeds, actual things that are happening in the world, how has your life changed? If you look at your 401(k), it's probably getting better. The terrorists are vanishing. That's a good thing. Consumer confidence is rising, and unemployment is down.

And there's a band, and it's this beautiful Cinderella story. My story wasn't like that. And certainly, hers was not, because she said there was about four hours between thinking that Sean Spicer was the press secretary and her finding out it was going to be her.
