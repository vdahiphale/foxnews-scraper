Look, this can have repercussions around the globe. Iran is watching, North Korea is watching, China is watching. The credibility of the NATO ally alliance is on the line. It's very serious stuff. And quite frankly, we could get into a cyber war with Russia over this. We cannot allow Vladimir Putin to get away with the first invasion of a major European democracy since World War II. We have to impose consequences on him. I think the Biden administration is doing a good job of going out there and putting out this intelligence about the false flag operations because it takes away his pretext. They keep putting it out. Maybe he uses it, maybe he doesn't. But it's smart policy to try to do it. They are doing everything they can, and we need to be united behind them.",

Of course, Ukraine is not a member of NATO. The Biden administration has kind of sent mixed messages. Partly what they have said has been great, encouraging diplomacy, understanding that there really could have been a reasonable solution for all parties involved. But the rhetoric from many people in the Biden administration, the misinformation from both sides, just like lots of allegations coming out without a lot of sourcing, has not been helpful for what is a very fraught situation. But now that Kamala Harris has found a border that she cares about, the Ukrainian border, perhaps she can remember she is also the border czar for the United States, that January just had the most apprehensions in history, that 2 million apprehensions have taken place since the Biden administration took over, and that that is a very serious issue of major national interest to Americans.",
