Frankly, of all the witnesses that we heard in the Senate and all the witnesses in the House, there were only three that had any firsthand knowledge. And all three of them either contradicted each other, confused each other, or led to the collapse of the fact pattern of the other witnesses. So, whether it was Vindman's conclusion that, from a policy position, he disagreed with the president, or Sondland's conclusion that the president told him specifically, no quid pro quo, I'm not sure how that evidence leads there, except for one thing, Charles. If you start with the presumption of guilty, perhaps you get there.

Now we're talking about the lowest numbers ever recorded for African- Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women at a 70-plus year low.

And we don't salute his service. Or we see a young girl who now knows she can go to a school, and maybe the idea of ever having to work for minimum wage won't be in her vocabulary, or all the other wonderful, beautiful things that we saw.

Can that be repaired?"
    },

And I think that's what was lost yesterday -- on Tuesday night -- during that ceremony."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, we want to celebrate it, but we also have some issues in this country and why we elect folks to go to D.C., hash it out, get over personal animosities, and get some things done.

And it feels like the Democrats have suffered something in the public relations arena. Is it over? Do you think it's over, that there won't be any more impeachment efforts, and perhaps we can get back to the people's work?"

Let's start with Iowa. I got to be honest with. You listen to Mike, and Bernie Sanders by far has the most votes, but he may not get the most delegates, this for a party that wants to get rid of the Electoral College, and now it's -- now it's without a doubt starting to influence New Hampshire.

They go into New Hampshire, they campaign. In theory, voters of New Hampshire say, well, voters of Iowa saw them as electable, maybe give them another chance. What this whole mess has done is, really, whoever wins in Iowa has been basically robbed of that momentum. So we see Buttigieg and Sanders really close.

Sanders was actually asked about this in his press conference, and he didn't say necessarily that he supported a recanvass. What he did say is that his lead, his popular vote, wouldn't change drastically. He's ahead by thousands of votes. So the Sanders campaign is being very careful here, because he is leading with the popular vote, which they are saying means he won. Of course, that's not technically what the state uses, but they don't want to put in too much question into the results, because, at this point, they will either be first or second. But, certainly, I was just on the ground in New Hampshire with him. I am hearing about that from voters who are questioning what happened in Iowa, but also at the same time kind of ready to move on and get an easier process, because, of course, the New Hampshire is a primary, which should be simpler."

If they really thought he was guilty of something, what they would have done was, they would have allowed him to cross-examine the witnesses that they had. They would have allowed him to present information or evidence that was contradictory to the evidence that they would have had. And if they really thought he was guilty of something, they wouldn't have played snippets of 13 witnesses in the House. We had 190-plus video clips of 13 witnesses.

It's -- I can't figure out where it came from. I have been asking myself, which witness actually helped him establish the fact pattern that led to guilty? Frankly, of all the witnesses that we heard in the Senate and all the witnesses in the House, there were only three that had any firsthand knowledge. And all three of them either contradicted each other, confused each other, or led to the collapse of the fact pattern of the other witnesses. So, whether it was Vindman's conclusion that, from a policy position, he disagreed with the president, or Sondland's conclusion that the president told him specifically, no quid pro quo, I'm not sure how that evidence leads there, except for one thing, Charles. If you start with the presumption of guilty, perhaps you get there. If you start with the American form of our legal system, the presumption of innocence, I think it's impossible to come to a conclusion of guilt."

It's one of the reasons why his approval rating in the black community is over 30 percent in the last four polls.

And will -- the question is, will that outweigh impeachment in 2020? Well, let's get the read from Democratic strategist Kristen Hawn, FOX News political analyst Gianno Caldwell, and The New York Post's Kelly Jane Torrance Kelly Jane, let me start with you. The numbers this week from Gallup for President Trump and the country mind- boggling, records across the board."

      "utterance": "Isn't it amazing, Charles? Ninety percent of Americans satisfied with their personal life. I have to say, I'm a single lady that just moved to New York. It's a tough dating city. I might be in that 10 percent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "But, on the whole, I mean, consumer confidence is at a -- nearly a record high. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. The bottom 40 percent of workers are seeing the highest wage gains. They're doing even better than those at the top. So, Americans do have a lot to feel good about. And when they see the Democrats who are constantly angry, who can't even admit that this is a great economy, as we have seen every Democratic presidential contender say, I think Donald Trump is looking pretty good going to November. Wouldn't you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Kristen, it wasn't just personal life. Trump's ratings at an all-time high of 49 percent, GOP, it's at 51 percent, highest in 18 years -- 15 years. Are you better off now? Record high. Will you be better off next year? Record high. Employees are more engaged, record high. The numbers go on and on. As a Democratic strategist, what do you think? How do you -- how do you combat that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTEN HAWN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the -- as somebody who works with a lot of members in the House and Senate, and you have to you have to look at things locally. So, when the economy is doing well, and the economy is doing well, people tend to be happy, and they tend to reelect the sitting president. So I think that some people have issues with the president and the way he deals with things personally. Some might be a little bit different here. But I think that the members, particularly who are running alongside him or down-ballot from him, look -- have to look at issues like health care, jobs, the economy, which a lot of these members have continued to do. A lot of them have not gone home and been focused on impeachment. They have stayed talking about the issues that a lot of the constituents can still -- like, still want to talk about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",

    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "Pocketbook always wins. And let's be honest. Money doesn't buy happiness, but it's a darn good down payment. When we think about the fact that over four million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, over seven million jobs created under this president, we think about the fact that, under the Obama administration, there was 11 times under the Obama administration that African-American unemployment was at 16 percent or exceeded it. Now we're talking about the lowest numbers ever recorded for African- Americans, Hispanics, Asians, women at a 70-plus year low. These are things that are so significant, that it's changing the way people feel. And that was one of the indicators of the Gallup poll, which showed that people feel better because of how they're doing economically. This president has been beating record after record, which I think, for anybody who's looking to run against him in the Democratic Party, anyone, that's going to be very hard to combat, especially considering the fact that a lot those folks, like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the like, are running on raising your taxes and wealth redistribution. This is not going to work. But I do also caution my fellow conservatives that we have to recognize that we have got to speak up. We got to go to the polls. We have to vote."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "And, Kelly Jane, I referenced President Trump being at an all-time high in the Gallup poll, but it is still a 49 number. Some folks are wondering, with all of these things going so great, is -- what's holding him back? Why isn't he at 55, 60? I mean, is there -- is that something that the White House should be worried about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "A little bit, Charles. I mean, you're right. The economy is just gangbusters. So why isn't his approval rating gangbusters? I think part of it is that a lot of people in this country -- it's polarized right now, and a lot of people do not like the president. And they're not going to like the president, no matter what he does. I think he could probably solve the Middle Eastern peace crisis, and Democrats would still be very angry. And, yes, his personal -- the way he tweets, the way he sometimes talks about people, it turns people off. But, once you get into that voting booth, I think sometimes things change, and people -- we know that polling can sometimes be wrong, as we learned in 2016."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, we have learned that the hard way. I have got 30 seconds, Kristen, but I want to give you the last word here. The Democrats are in the middle of some confusion here. Is there any particular candidate that the Democrats want overall that might be able to counter this message?"

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think that we have got to have somebody -- and I have said this before on this show -- I think we have to have somebody that's not talking in divisive rhetoric, meaning the haves and have-nots, and we have a wage gap. But I would like to see somebody like Joe Biden, even Pete Buttigieg, on the ballot."

So we're not that bad. And, here -- I think this is breaking news -- that President Trump twice in one day has said, I recognize that I have messed up on some things. He did say, well, not on purpose, and I'm going to try to do better. That's -- that's pretty big for President Donald Trump."

I wouldn't go that far, because you're -- then you're just -- you're saying that he knows what he's doing is wrong, and he's just using religion. But President Trump, I think, does have a point to say, you can't just say, in good conscience, I'm doing this, without giving any explanation. Conscience always obliges. That's just basic moral theology. Conscience always obliges."
