If you still had any doubt how serious the leaks problem is, all you had to do this week was open your newspaper or turn on your television and see transcripts of President Trump’s conversations with world leaders. And this comes as we learned, again through leaks, Robert Mueller is taking his Russia investigation to a grand jury. On Friday, Attorney General Sessions announced measures to try and stop leaks he says endanger American security. Joining me now for his first Sunday show interview is Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general and the man who appointed the special counsel after Sessions recused himself.  Mr. Rosenstein, welcome to “Fox News Sunday.”",

They’re at press conferences talking about bills they’re working on regarding veterans and reporters are raising their hands and saying, what do you think about this latest leak, this conversational the president had with the -- you know, the leader of Mexico, his comments.

On Friday, Attorney General Sessions announced measures to try and stop leaks he says endanger American security.

That’s more important to us than who it is, who is the leaker. So, if we identify somebody, no matter what their position is, if they violated the law, in that case, warrants prosecution, will prosecute it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "I think that’s an overreaction, Chris. The attorney general has been very clear that we’re after the leakers, not the journalist. We’re after the people who are committing crime. And so, we’re going to devote the resources we need to identify who is responsible for those leaks and who has violated the law and hold them accountable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, there are a couple of aspects to that. First of all, you say you are after the leakers, not the reporters. President Trump has reportedly suggested at one point prosecuting the reporters if they leak -- if they publish classified information. Are you ruling that out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, we have the same position on that I think as Attorney General Holder, that is we don’t prosecute journalist for doing their jobs. We look at the facts and circumstances of each case and we determine whether somebody has committed a crime and whether it’s appropriate to hold them accountable for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "And you don’t consider the publishing classified information as a crime?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, I don’t think you can draw any general line like that, it depends upon the facts and circumstances. You know, generally speaking, reporters who publish information are not committing a crime. But there might be a circumstance where they do. You know, I haven’t seen any of those today, but I wouldn’t rule it out in the event that there were a case where a reporter was purposely violating the law, then they might be a suspect as well. But that’s not our goal here. Our goal is to prevent the leaks. And so, that’s what we’re after here. We haven’t revised a policy with regard to reporters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "OK. But there’s another aspect of this, which is if a reporter gets information from somebody, puts it out in the beginning of the Obama administration, they were very aggressive in going after their sources. And if you subpoena information and they refused to disclose it, they can still end up in jail at the end of the Obama administration after a backlash from reporters, they loosened up on that. And first of all, it had to be approved specifically by the attorney general and it was kind of a last resort to go after reporters sources. Are you are reviewing that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, Chris, that’s a different issue. That policy has been in existence for a very long time. Attorney General Holder revised that in 2015. It’s possible he got it exactly right but maybe he didn’t. We’re going to take a fresh look at that, and we’ve gotten feedback from our career prosecutors and agents that some of the procedural hurdles are delaying their investigation. So, I think it’s important for us to take a fresh look at it and evaluate whether or not there are any improvements that should be made."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "And what that means in your effort to get sources that you end up putting a reporter who refuses to disclose that source in jail?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "I’m not going to answer a hypothetical, Chris. As I said, I think it depends upon the facts and circumstances in each case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "We learned this week that special counsel Robert Mueller is taking his case to a grand jury. I know you can’t and won’t talk about the details of that case, but as a general proposition, does the fact that a prosecutor takes a case to a grand jury, what does that say about the likelihood of indictments?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, I’m -- you are right that I’m not going to comment on the case. I’m not going to comment about whether Director Mueller has or hasn’t opened a grand jury. You know, we read a lot about criminal investigations in the media and some of those stories are false. We just don’t comment on investigations. That’s important for a number of reasons. First of all, we don’t want to disparage anybody who may be a subject of an investigation. Number two, we don’t want to interfere with the investigation by --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "In general, Chris, it doesn’t say anything about the likelihood of indictments because we conduct investigations and we make a determination that at some point in the course of the investigation about whether charges are appropriate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Many of our investigations, Chris, involve the use of a grand jury. It’s an appropriate way to gather documents, sometimes to bring witnesses in, to make sure that you get their full testimony. It’s just a tool that we use like any other tool in the course of our investigations."

When you appointed Mueller, and you were the one who did, you had to sign an order authorizing the appointment of a special counsel, and you said that he was authorized to investigate any coordination with Russia and -- I want to put these words on the screen -- any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. My question is, does that mean that there are no red lines that Mueller or any special counsel can investigate under the terms of your order, anything he finds?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, the special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don’t engage in fishing expeditions. Now, that order that you read, that doesn’t detail specifically who may be the subject of the investigation --"

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I understand it’s not a fishing expedition, but you say any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation. In the course of his investigation of the issues that he is looking at, if he finds evidence of a crime, can he look at that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, if he finds evidence of a crime that’s within the scope of what Director Mueller and I have agreed is the appropriate scope of the investigation, then he can. If it’s something that’s outside that scope, he needs to come to the acting attorney general, at this time, me, for a permission to expand his investigation. But we don’t talk about that publicly. And so, the speculation you’ve seen in the news media, that’s not anything that I’ve said. It’s not anything Director Mueller said. We don’t know who’s saying it or how credible those sources are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I mean, people ask about this, of course, because you had Ken Starr and Whitewater, and this began with a failed real estate deal in Arkansas and ended up with Monica Lewinsky. To expand, he would need to get approval from you to expand the investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",

And we have many other qualified and responsible officials who are going to be joining us as soon, as they get through Senate confirmation to join the department. I can assure you that we are going to do the right thing and follow the rule of law."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "OK. A couple of quick questions on other issues. Let’s turn to the department’s crack down on illegal immigration. The attorney general sent a letter this week to four cities struggling with gun violence, warning they won’t be eligible for federal money to fight drug trafficking and gang crime unless they cooperate with immigration officials. How do you respond to critics who say the solution here, which is to cut off federal funding to the cities that have a real crime problem, is worse than the problem?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, the challenge that the attorney general is addressing there is that cities that release criminal aliens put everybody at risk. They put citizens at risk and we’ve seen that most recently in these horrible case where we had an illegal alien who was subject to a detainer that was ignored by local authorities who released him, and he committed a violent crime. And that’s not the only thing, Chris. We put law enforcement officers at risk because when somebody is already in jail and they’re subject to deportation order, if the local authorities ignore that order, put them back out in the street, that means that our federal agency need to go out and track them down and that puts them at risk. That’s the kind of danger the attorney general is seeking to address."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Finally, the attorney general has told prosecutors to pursue the toughest sentences in all cases, including mandatory minimums. Conservatives like Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, who have been pushing for criminal justice reform, say the result of this, going to end up filling the prisons with nonviolent, low-level drug offenders instead of going after serious criminals, violent criminals. Your response that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROSENSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, first of all, our priority in the Department of Justice is to prosecute high-level drug dealers, not to fill our prisons with low-level drug dealers or drug users. And the attorney general’s policy actually just returns the department to the traditional policy that we’ve been following since the Carter administration, and that is that the presumption in each case is to charge the most serious, readily provable offense. But in the event that our prosecutors believe that’s not justified, they can make an exception. They just need to document it. That’s the policy."

This is an opportunity to put something on the books that applies to this current situation, but it will be in effect going forward. This is very important. It’s an important part of what we need to do to reestablish the public trust in the Department of Justice. That’s why I’m taking the opportunity to do it now because I know the very people on my side of the aisle who have some concerns with it would be pounding the table for this if we were talking about a President Hillary Clinton and similar circumstances and an investigation that may or may not involve her."

That was bipartisan, Republican and Democrat. There’s your bill to protect the special counsel from being fired, and Republicans are keeping the Senate technically in session to block recess appointments.

I will continue to support a measure that would go to reconciliation, the 51-vote threshold. I’m willing to look at what the Democrats maybe are willing to offer. The problem is the going in position seems to be nothing more than nipping around the edges at a failed Obamacare platform, and we simply can’t do that. We can’t sustain it.

After we just got the H-2B visas released a couple of weeks ago, there are a number of communities that have applied to them, up to and including Mar-a-Lago. So, there’s obviously a need out there that’s not being fulfilled by the indigenous workforce, and it puts American jobs at risk if we don’t get this policy right. I’m glad that Senators Purdue and Cotton offered something, at least gets the debate going.

First of all, the fact that the special counsel, Robert Mueller, is taking his case to a grand jury. And, second, now reports that his investigators have gone to the White House and are asking for documents concerning the former national security advisor, General Michael Flynn. Rich, where is this investigation now? RICH LOWRY, EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Well, I don’t think Mueller’s going away until he indicts people. And, obviously, Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort are in a lot of jeopardy. Others could be as well. The signs are it’s an increasingly wide-ranging probe. And the question is, how much tolerance does the president of the United States have for that?

But one last point, Chris, and you -- you brought this up with the deputy attorney general. I think he may have made a really momentous mistake in not being more specific in that initial charge to Mueller about what exactly -- what specific crimes he should be investigating and make Mueller come back and be very public about what new crimes he might be investigating because there’s no way to know now whether it’s a fishing expedition or not and Mueller might be fired on the presumption he’s engaged in a fishing expedition that he isn’t."

So they’re going to be very difficult to stop. I think a problem that Trump has dates back to the campaign, though, and that has been his treatment of the intelligence community. He has a very dicey relationship with people who weaponized information for a living. And it’s dragged into his presidency and it’s still haunting him. And -- and one thing that Attorney General Sessions said during that news conference this week is that the cabinet, the members of the administration, need to be more disciplined in terms of leaking. And I think he’s absolutely right. But the president himself, I think, has to also take the lead here.

What do you make of -- of what Rod Rosenstein said in the interview, which is, look, if it’s a White House official or it’s a member of Congress, we’re going to prosecute them. And as you -- s somebody who covers Congress, how much concern is there up there where leaking, frankly, is rampant? RACHEL BADE, \"POLITICO\": I think that certainly shows that the Department of Justice is suspicious of that, some of the stuff that’s coming from The Hill. I think regarding the leaks announcement, it seems like this was sort of -- had some mixed reception when I talk to lawmakers about it after this press conference, and that was, on the one hand a lot of them are just as upset as Trump about these leaks. They find them to be a distraction from talking about their agenda. They’re at press conferences talking about bills they’re working on regarding veterans and reporters are raising their hands and saying, what do you think about this latest leak, this conversational the president had with the -- you know, the leader of Mexico, his comments. So, in that regard, they’re happy about DOJ going after the leaks. But the second piece of this, they seem a little wary about going after reporters. And I think that that’s where you might see some of the Republicans on The Hill sort of stop short of praising. Right now the last thing the Republican Party needs when they’re trying to get their legislative agenda actually moving is a bunch of headlines saying that the Trump administration is jailing reporters who are refusing to give over their sources.

We are hearing a lot of chatter about a bipartisan bill to basically prop up Obamacare and make a few fixes, which is really interesting because it’s very different from what they campaigned on. But Trump, in trying to get this moving, you know, was tweet at lawmakers calling them quitters, saying that they need to get this done, and he actually made a threat to unilaterally blow up the insurance exchanges by stopping federal payments for subsidies.

And that’s not a problem with John Kelly on either score. He has the rein of authority from the president. He has his military bearings. A little intimidating to people and makes -- makes people pay attention to him. The problem, obviously, ultimately is at the top. And there’s no changing Donald Trump’s character in the way he operates. Although he saw in the campaign, you know, there was a -- there was a marginal difference between Corey Lewandowski Trump and Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Bannon Trump.

In a fight with conservatives who were going after the national security advisor, another general, H.R. McMaster, he has sided -- Kelly has sided with McMaster and strengthened him. And I want to put up this picture that has just come out. This is John Kelly, over there on the far left. This is in the old executive office building addressing the entire White House staff late this week and telling them, you know, their responsibilities, the chain of command and saying, your duties first to country, second to the president. And as far as your own self-interest is concerned, that doesn’t count. Some Trump supporters, Chuck, are suggesting that this could be a turning point in the Trump presidency. It that overly dramatic?"

Some see John Kelly as a savior, somebody who will stabilize and it will be a turning point in that sense. There are some Trump supporters who see this as a betrayal of the true Trump, that John Kelly is in some way being brought into blunt the sharp ideological edges, the nationalism and so forth that Trump had promised. And, look, that White House is a snake pit. You talk about the military bearing of John Kelly impressing people. Well, H.R. McMaster has, I believe, three stars on his shoulder, but his military bearings hasn’t protected him from a campaign of vicious leaks coming from people within the White House who regard him as sort of a sell-out on foreign policy. Kelly has to get --that’s -- he’s got his hands on that problem right now. And I think a lot of people inside the staff are looking to see if he can really get control of it because if he can, well, then I think he’ll have established his authority and people will do what he says. But if somehow people find ways to work around even John Kelly, if the back channeling directly to the president and sending him memos that, you know, reflect the latest Alex Jones conspiracy theory continues, then I think Kelly still has a problem on his hands."

And there’s only so much Kelly can do. Obviously this week Trump was still out there commenting on an ongoing investigation regularly when he should have been answering questions as coyly as the deputy attorney general was with you earlier. I mean that’s the way you handle this, yet the president continues to sound off on this. And these rivalries in the White House that we’re talking about in the West Wing, I think this Russia investigation is going to be hanging over these rivalries. I mean with people from Steve Bannon to Jared Kushner to Corey Lewandowski, under oath, when they are questioned by investigators, assuming that they will be, you know, will they turn on one another? Trump has been encouraging the competition since the campaign. These different power centers. And I think all of these investigations are going to hang over all of this intrigue in the West Wing while Trump is trying to govern and pursue his agenda."

But this is an opportunity to push the reset button with The Hill. I think increasingly you’re seeing a dynamic shift between Hill Republicans and this Trump White House. And -- and that is -- they’re souring on each other. You know, the president’s tweeting out lawmakers. He’s calling them fools. He’s calling them quitters. And convers, really you’re seeing a lot of lawmakers who are now pushing back against Trump and saying, we need to be a stronger check on him. The other day, in a Republican conference, somebody stood up and blamed the president for why health care field. So Kelly can repair those relationships, I think."
