I don't think I can take another standing ovation for a child rapist. But when everyone gets the memo it makes the memo less powerful, one form of lockstep becomes another. But Hollywood therapy is always projection: Lecturing us on us when what's really wrong is Hollywood. For example, Connie Britton's shirt that reads \"poverty is sexist.\" While it's true at least 60 percent of our homeless are men, I'm not sure that what she meant. But my point is this: It makes no sense to inject identity politics into shared suffering, unless of course it looks good on a shirt.  \"The Handmaid's Tale won -- it was a horror fantasy were women are routinely abused. Keep the handmaid's tale from becoming real, says the guy who won. Sadly he wasn't referring to Iran. I think he meant us, because Hollywood tends to miss the real abuses: Iran, Venezuela, the USSR, Cuba -- they're always the last to know or care.

One thing he didn't backtrack was the comments that he made about Mueller's investigation actually zeroing in on money laundering and Jared Kushner. That wasn't part of the statement that he released on Sunday. And then the other thing is, I noticed in chapter seven of the book, there's this little detail, and it doesn't necessarily have to do with Bannon, but it is when Michael Flynn does an interview with Karen DeYoung of The Washington Post on background, and she asks him, \"Did you have contacts with the Russians in which you discussed sanctions?\" And he says no, and he denies it twice. She calls back to the communications director, Michael Anton, and says, \"Hey, Michael Flynn, he just denied this twice.

But Hollywood therapy is always projection: Lecturing us on us when what's really wrong is Hollywood. For example, Connie Britton's shirt that reads \"poverty is sexist.\" While it's true at least 60 percent of our homeless are men, I'm not sure that what she meant. But my point is this: It makes no sense to inject identity politics into shared suffering, unless of course it looks good on a shirt. \"The Handmaid's Tale won -- it was a horror fantasy were women are routinely abused. Keep the handmaid's tale from becoming real, says the guy who won. Sadly he wasn't referring to Iran. I think he meant us, because Hollywood tends to miss the real abuses: Iran, Venezuela, the USSR, Cuba -- they're always the last to know or care."

And so, I think this is a big, one, waste of time by the Democrats because they're ceding all the policy ground to Republicans as they take off their agenda one by one. And the economy is fully recovered and President Trump is pushing down the gas pedal on that with the tax cuts. And so, you're left with the Democrats trying to hang their hat on their hope on some sort of mental instability claim which is really unfortunate. One, I think it's preposterous. But also I would say this, I think it's really unfortunate for this country, who has talked about mental health a lot in the last several years and how we need to do more to address it, and they're basically making a mockery of it.

You can't go out and do a rally and then a speech, and then all of a sudden go back privately and dissolve into some kind -- I don't know, jabbering like mess. That's not how it works. That's what they're suggesting. They're suggesting that when you see him he's fine, but then behind closed doors he just loses it. I've questions about the psychiatrist. I look up on this stuff. There's some interesting things about her that I think warrants further explanation. But in defense of people using this, and I think Juan might agree with me on this, this is the mirror image of the birth certificate. The 25th amendment argument and the birth certificate argument are both identically the same in terms of delegitimizing the person. So everything has a mirror here. When we're saying this is insane, and a lot of people were saying the same thing about the birth certificate. Even there might be a little bit more legitimacy to the birth certificate because we didn't have the real thing, but I think they're kind of similar. I will say this, Donald Trump, you can say that he's odd. People who do extraordinary things are often odd but they're not crazy. They might be a little bit off, you know, a little nutty, Kimberly."

One thing he didn't backtrack was the comments that he made about Mueller's investigation actually zeroing in on money laundering and Jared Kushner. That wasn't part of the statement that he released on Sunday. And then the other thing is, I noticed in chapter seven of the book, there's this little detail, and it doesn't necessarily have to do with Bannon, but it is when Michael Flynn does an interview with Karen DeYoung of The Washington Post on background, and she asks him, \"Did you have contacts with the Russians in which you discussed sanctions?\" And he says no, and he denies it twice.
