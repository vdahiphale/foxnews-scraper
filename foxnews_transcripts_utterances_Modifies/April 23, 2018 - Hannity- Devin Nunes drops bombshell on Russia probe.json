      "sentences": "All right. Tucker, welcome back. We missed you. And welcome to 'Hannity.'  We have huge bombshell new developments to bring you tonight surrounding the FBI's investigation into so-called Trump-Russia collusion. According to the chairman of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes, no actual intelligence was ever utilized to start the Russia probe. None.  That's right. It's now day 341 of Mueller's investigation and questions still surrounding just why the FBI's initial inquiry into the Trump campaign was kicked off in the first place. An incredible development. So much for fair, open and a transparent system of justice.  Now, also tonight, James Comey is on the second week of his whirlwind angry book tour and he now finds himself in big trouble tonight. According to the Office of the Inspector General, the disgraced former FBI director is now under investigation over serious claims of misconduct we tried to warn him right here on this show. And we're going to break down Comey's misdeeds. And coming up, we have new information on what is the DNC's laughable last- ditch attempt at a lawsuit against the Trump campaign and the president's responding.  And we're going to bring you the groundbreaking new diplomatic developments surrounding Korea. We have important economic achievements right here at home that should blow your mind. Nobody else will report them. And then later in the show, you will meet conservative writer Candace Owens. She will weigh in and join us on the left's disgraceful outrage over the public support that she got from Kanye West.  All right. Lots to get into in tonight's breaking news opening monologue.",

The FBI's investigation into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia was started without a single shred, zero intelligence. I'm not making this up. Take a look.   REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The counterintelligence investigation uses the tools of our intelligence services that are not supposed to be used on American citizens. So, we've long wanted to know, well, what intelligence did you have that actually led to this investigation? So, what we found now after the investigators have reviewed it is that in fact, there was no intelligence.",

You can't make this up. Take a listen.   REP. MARK MEADOWS, R—N.C.: But we now see that the State Department and it appears with the White House at the very highest levels, including the president himself, were involved in this whole narrative of investigating Donald Trump. The messages, the text messages that I've had the privilege of reviewing and some of the other correlating information would strongly suggest that there was not only information given to the White House, but indeed that they were involved in directing some of the actions of the Department Justice and FBI in the -- in the fall of 2016. That's troubling when you see one president allowing their DOJ to get involved in a political campaign.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "So, do you still think the Obama White House would never tamper with a politically charged investigation? Think again tonight. And according to a completely underreported part of the recently released inspector general's report about firing Andrew McCabe, quote, listen to this -- 'McCabe said a high-ranking Obama Justice Department official expressed concerns about FBI agents taking overt steps in the Clinton Foundation investigation during the presidential campaign.' Listen to what they say, quote: 'McCabe told us that the conversation was very dramatic and that he never had a similar confrontation like that call with a high-level department official in his entire FBI career.' We got to think about this.  Remember, this was all happening while Andrew McCabe's boss, James Comey, Mr. Book Tour, was giving Hillary Clinton the white glove treatment during the criminal investigation. We know she broke laws, committed felonies as it relates to the private email server.  These two fired career bureaucrats are likely now headed towards a major collision course. This is going to be interesting. You have Andrew McCabe in deep legal trouble over his lack of candor lying under oath while serving as the deputy FBI director number two and McCabe is probably going to have to cut some deal, and this may involve turning on that other guy, James Comey. McCabe should have plenty to say. For example, remember when Comey agreed to call the investigation, a, quote, 'matter' at the request of then-attorney general Loretta Lynch, and we can't forget James Comey looked the other way, while Clinton obstructed justice by the leading 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing with BleachBit, destroying cell phones and devices with a hammer. By the way, try that at home, good luck.   And maybe most damaging of all, it was the exoneration before investigation. Comey and his team cleared Clinton of all charges months before they actually did the interview of her and 17 other key witnesses. Ironically, the initial crime Clinton may have committed and should have been charged with, look at this right up on your screen, our own Gregg Jarrett and others have identified this, 18 USC 793, mishandling a classified information, is now the very same charge that James Comey is now himself being investigated over. I hope he's hoping he has a James Comey in his life after he, of course, leaked those memos dealing with his meetings with President Trump. Those were not allowed to be leaked classified information were in some of them.  This weekend, the president tweeted, quote: 'James Comey's memos are classified. I did not declassify them. They belong to our government. Therefore, he broke the law.'  And additionally, 'he totally made up many of the things he said that I said and he's already a proven liar and a leaker. Where are memos on Clinton, Lynch and others?' According to the Office of Inspector General, Comey is now being probed over whether or not he acted unethically when he leaked those potentially classified memos to his friend. That guy is a Columbia professor, his name is Daniel Richman, and, of course, we now know that Richman went on to leak these memos to the press, putting the wheels in motion for the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel. This is -- it gets very interesting. Congressman Jim Jordan, he's shining a light on this unusual relationship between Daniel Richman and the FBI. I had not known this before. Watch this.    REP. JIM JORDAN, R—OHIO: The Oversight Committee and the Judiciary Committee interviewed Jim Rybicki. And during that deposition, it was brought out that Daniel Richman, the guy who information was leaked through to 'The New York Times,' had this special status called special government employee status where he could sort of come and go in the FBI, which may not mean much, but it seems kind of interesting the guy that Comey leaks through is a good friend who had this sort of unfettered access into the FBI.",

And remember, they lied to the FISA judges, and remember they never disclosed who paid for this.   Make no mistake. This was campaign opposition research bought and paid for by Clinton. Her campaign funneled through that law firm, Perkins Coie, put together by a foreign agent based on Russian and Russian government lies and used as evidence to get a warrant during a political campaign against an opposition party, all the while Comey and his cohorts, they never disclose the true nature of this document and they lied to the FISA court judge. That is a crime, which brings us to our next stop story.  The Democrats' laughable lawsuit against the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks and Russia, now we all know this court file conspiracy theory, it is nothing. Please, understand that this is a desperate publicity stunt. But breaking tonight, the DNC's brand new lawsuit is now revealing what is almost an unbelievable double standard.  So, we told you about the anti-Trump dossier. They presented that to the FISA court. They get the warrant we've been talking about tonight, and nearly every night in this program for the last couple of months. The dossier that was used to get the warrant that supposedly links Trump to Russia in the most salacious, embarrassing ways that was never verified in this lawsuit, it is nowhere to be found. It's not even in there. Let's lie to the judge but let's not lie to the next judge.  OK, I really understand this. So, the Democrats, along with the Clinton campaign, were the ones that paid a foreign spy to piece together this document on Russian lies and rumors and so-called Russian intelligence.

And even some of the Democratic Party, including Claire McCaskill, they're admitting this lawsuit is merely a distraction. By the way, she's up for re-election. That's probably just for political expediency. Meanwhile, President Trump, he announced his response on Twitter. Quote, he wrote: 'Just heard the campaign was sued by the obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they refuse to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz servers and documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton emails.' By the way, we'll bring you more information as that plays out. Luke Rosiak of 'The Daily Caller' has done amazing work. Finally, tonight, we're going to end on some good news you'll never hear from anybody in the media. Despite what I described as the five forces that have been working to defeat this president, one to prevent them from getting elected, then to delegitimize him and get them thrown out of office, you have the media, you have the Never Trumpers, you have weak establishment Republicans, you have Democrats and, of course, the deep state.  You know, the Trump agenda keep seeing massive major progress both right here and abroad. Now, this includes big progress on the economy. Look at this, 14 states, 14, have now hit record low unemployment numbers, including Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, Hawaii, even California, Wisconsin.  Meanwhile, the U.S. is also seeing record low unemployment for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. And on the international front, we'll talk more about these developments later. Late last week, North Korea announcing, this is huge, little rocket man, they will suspend all ballistic missile testings and they plan to close a nuclear testing site. And according to reports tonight, Kim Jong-un also has dropped his demand that all U.S. troops leave the Korean peninsulas. They can stay in South Korea. This comes ahead of the president's upcoming meeting with the North Korean dictator.  These major groundbreaking developments came as a shock to many in the mainstream media.

I have been talking about and this message of these five forces working against the president, these narratives are now dying, especially Trump-Russia collusion and the president's agenda is working, which is good for the American people.

The 93-year-old Bush is suffering a blood infection, but a family spokesman says tonight that Mr. Bush is, quote, responding to treatments and appears to be recovering. This is the fifth time in the last six years the elder Bush has been hospitalized, including a year ago this month where he spent two weeks in the hospital for pneumonia. On Friday, during the public viewing of Barbara Bush's casket, the 41st president greeted some 4,500 people who came to pay their respects. Meantime, in Toronto, witnesses say a van traveling at 30 to 35 miles per hour on the walkways of Yonge Street, one of the busiest avenues in the city, appeared to be swerving back and forth trying to kill as many people as possible. And tonight, the death toll has been raised to 10, with 15 others injured, some of them critically. Toronto police say the attack was deliberate but are not yet calling it terrorism, and they have identified the suspect as 25-year-old Alek Minassian, who lives 15 miles outside of Toronto. Minassian was arrested after appearing to wave a weapon at police. Still no word on motive, but the killing certainly follows a recent pattern of attacks around the world that involved rented vans, including the attack on bike riders last Halloween in Lower Manhattan, the 2016 attack on the London Bridge, and 2017 van attack on Las Ramblas shopping center in Barcelona.

We have huge bombshell new developments to bring you tonight surrounding the FBI's investigation into so-called Trump-Russia collusion. According to the chairman of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes, no actual intelligence was ever utilized to start the Russia probe. None. That's right. It's now day 341 of Mueller's investigation and questions still surrounding just why the FBI's initial inquiry into the Trump campaign was kicked off in the first place. An incredible development. So much for fair, open and a transparent system of justice. Now, also tonight, James Comey is on the second week of his whirlwind angry book tour and he now finds himself in big trouble tonight. According to the Office of the Inspector General, the disgraced former FBI director is now under investigation over serious claims of misconduct we tried to warn him right here on this show. And we're going to break down Comey's misdeeds. And coming up, we have new information on what is the DNC's laughable last- ditch attempt at a lawsuit against the Trump campaign and the president's responding. And we're going to bring you the groundbreaking new diplomatic developments surrounding Korea. We have important economic achievements right here at home that should blow your mind. Nobody else will report them. And then later in the show, you will meet conservative writer Candace Owens. She will weigh in and join us on the left's disgraceful outrage over the public support that she got from Kanye West. All right. Lots to get into in tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

The FBI's investigation into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia was started without a single shred, zero intelligence. I'm not making this up. Take a look. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The counterintelligence investigation uses the tools of our intelligence services that are not supposed to be used on American citizens. So, we've long wanted to know, well, what intelligence did you have that actually led to this investigation? So, what we found now after the investigators have reviewed it is that in fact, there was no intelligence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "That's right. So, the FBI began a serious investigation of an American political campaign unprompted by any intelligence at all? Wow. There's more to this. Listen to what Chairman Nunes went on to tell our own Maria Bartiromo. Take a listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "We do know that longtime associates of Hillary Clinton, including Sidney Blumenthal and another person named I think Corey Shear, were actively giving information to the State Department. They were somehow making its way to the FBI. This is from -- this is from two people within the State Department who have now publicly come out and said this in -- I think in major news publications. We now know that there was no official intelligence that was used to start this investigation. We know that Sidney Blumenthal and others were pushing information into the State Department. So, we're trying to piece all of that together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "This is a deadly serious charge coming from the Intel Committee chairman. And remember, it was just a few days ago that the Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, he made a similar claim and even suggested that the Obama administration played a key and vital role in kicking off the investigation into the Trump campaign. You can't make this up. Take a listen. REP. MARK MEADOWS, R—N.C.: But we now see that the State Department and it appears with the White House at the very highest levels, including the president himself, were involved in this whole narrative of investigating Donald Trump. The messages, the text messages that I've had the privilege of reviewing and some of the other correlating information would strongly suggest that there was not only information given to the White House, but indeed that they were involved in directing some of the actions of the Department Justice and FBI in the -- in the fall of 2016. That's troubling when you see one president allowing their DOJ to get involved in a political campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So, do you still think the Obama White House would never tamper with a politically charged investigation? Think again tonight. And according to a completely underreported part of the recently released inspector general's report about firing Andrew McCabe, quote, listen to this -- 'McCabe said a high-ranking Obama Justice Department official expressed concerns about FBI agents taking overt steps in the Clinton Foundation investigation during the presidential campaign.'"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Listen to what they say, quote",
      "utterance": "'McCabe told us that the conversation was very dramatic and that he never had a similar confrontation like that call with a high-level department official in his entire FBI career.' We got to think about this. Remember, this was all happening while Andrew McCabe's boss, James Comey, Mr. Book Tour, was giving Hillary Clinton the white glove treatment during the criminal investigation. We know she broke laws, committed felonies as it relates to the private email server. These two fired career bureaucrats are likely now headed towards a major collision course. This is going to be interesting. You have Andrew McCabe in deep legal trouble over his lack of candor lying under oath while serving as the deputy FBI director number two and McCabe is probably going to have to cut some deal, and this may involve turning on that other guy, James Comey. McCabe should have plenty to say. For example, remember when Comey agreed to call the investigation, a, quote, 'matter' at the request of then-attorney general Loretta Lynch, and we can't forget James Comey looked the other way, while Clinton obstructed justice by the leading 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing with BleachBit, destroying cell phones and devices with a hammer. By the way, try that at home, good luck. And maybe most damaging of all, it was the exoneration before investigation. Comey and his team cleared Clinton of all charges months before they actually did the interview of her and 17 other key witnesses. Ironically, the initial crime Clinton may have committed and should have been charged with, look at this right up on your screen, our own Gregg Jarrett and others have identified this, 18 USC 793, mishandling a classified information, is now the very same charge that James Comey is now himself being investigated over. I hope he's hoping he has a James Comey in his life after he, of course, leaked those memos dealing with his meetings with President Trump. Those were not allowed to be leaked classified information were in some of them."

    {
      "speaker": "This weekend, the president tweeted, quote",
      "utterance": "'James Comey's memos are classified. I did not declassify them. They belong to our government. Therefore, he broke the law.' And additionally, 'he totally made up many of the things he said that I said and he's already a proven liar and a leaker. Where are memos on Clinton, Lynch and others?' According to the Office of Inspector General, Comey is now being probed over whether or not he acted unethically when he leaked those potentially classified memos to his friend. That guy is a Columbia professor, his name is Daniel Richman, and, of course, we now know that Richman went on to leak these memos to the press, putting the wheels in motion for the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel. This is -- it gets very interesting. Congressman Jim Jordan, he's shining a light on this unusual relationship between Daniel Richman and the FBI. I had not known this before. Watch this. REP. JIM JORDAN, R—OHIO: The Oversight Committee and the Judiciary Committee interviewed Jim Rybicki. And during that deposition, it was brought out that Daniel Richman, the guy who information was leaked through to 'The New York Times,' had this special status called special government employee status where he could sort of come and go in the FBI, which may not mean much, but it seems kind of interesting the guy that Comey leaks through is a good friend who had this sort of unfettered access into the FBI."

He's the one who told Comey, you go and you talk to the present. You're the ones staying on, you briefed him on the dossier, the salacious unverified dossier, and then, of course, right then after that, CNN talks about it, prints it and then 'BuzzFeed' printed the whole thing."

      "utterance": "This is the same dossier that was used to acquire that FISA warrant against the Trump campaign associates. And remember, they lied to the FISA judges, and remember they never disclosed who paid for this. Make no mistake. This was campaign opposition research bought and paid for by Clinton. Her campaign funneled through that law firm, Perkins Coie, put together by a foreign agent based on Russian and Russian government lies and used as evidence to get a warrant during a political campaign against an opposition party, all the while Comey and his cohorts, they never disclose the true nature of this document and they lied to the FISA court judge. That is a crime, which brings us to our next stop story. The Democrats' laughable lawsuit against the Trump campaign, WikiLeaks and Russia, now we all know this court file conspiracy theory, it is nothing. Please, understand that this is a desperate publicity stunt. But breaking tonight, the DNC's brand new lawsuit is now revealing what is almost an unbelievable double standard. So, we told you about the anti-Trump dossier. They presented that to the FISA court. They get the warrant we've been talking about tonight, and nearly every night in this program for the last couple of months. The dossier that was used to get the warrant that supposedly links Trump to Russia in the most salacious, embarrassing ways that was never verified in this lawsuit, it is nowhere to be found. It's not even in there. Let's lie to the judge but let's not lie to the next judge. OK, I really understand this. So, the Democrats, along with the Clinton campaign, were the ones that paid a foreign spy to piece together this document on Russian lies and rumors and so-called Russian intelligence. Listen to what Chairman Nunes had to say about this totally embarrassing political Hail Mary. Take a look."

      "utterance": "We know who colluded with Russians. They don't want to admit that they colluded with Russians, but they hired Fusion -- they hired a law firm that hired Fusion GPS that hired a British spy that went and colluded with Russians. So, I don't understand why they just didn't open up a lawsuit against themselves. They should name themselves and sue themselves so that they can get to the bottom of what do they have on their servers? Why didn't they give those servers to the FBI? This is -- this is nothing more, nothing less than a continuation of fundraising off of this scandal."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "This is unbelievable. Clearly, as many are now nothing, this move from the Democratic Party whiffs of nothing but desperation.

That's probably just for political expediency."

      "speaker": "Meanwhile, President Trump, he announced his response on Twitter. Quote, he wrote",

This can be good news and that we will now counter for the DNC server that they refuse to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz servers and documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton emails.' By the way, we'll bring you more information as that plays out. Luke Rosiak of 'The Daily Caller' has done amazing work. Finally, tonight, we're going to end on some good news you'll never hear from anybody in the media. Despite what I described as the five forces that have been working to defeat this president, one to prevent them from getting elected, then to delegitimize him and get them thrown out of office, you have the media, you have the Never Trumpers, you have weak establishment Republicans, you have Democrats and, of course, the deep state. You know, the Trump agenda keep seeing massive major progress both right here and abroad. Now, this includes big progress on the economy. Look at this, 14 states, 14, have now hit record low unemployment numbers, including Alabama, Arkansas, Texas, Hawaii, even California, Wisconsin. Meanwhile, the U.S. is also seeing record low unemployment for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans. And on the international front, we'll talk more about these developments later. Late last week, North Korea announcing, this is huge, little rocket man, they will suspend all ballistic missile testings and they plan to close a nuclear testing site. And according to reports tonight, Kim Jong-un also has dropped his demand that all U.S. troops leave the Korean peninsulas. They can stay in South Korea. This comes ahead of the president's upcoming meeting with the North Korean dictator. These major groundbreaking developments came as a shock to many in the mainstream media. One fake new CNN reporter literally became speechless and this is priceless. Take a look."

    {
      "speaker": "REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Kim Jong Un's saying North Korea no longer needs any nuclear tests, mid-range and intercontinental ballistic missile, and he's saying the nuclear test site in the northern area near the Chinese border at Punggye-ri has completed its mission, therefore will likely be closed. This is an extraordinarily significant development and frankly a huge win for President Trump. I am really almost speechless here as the pace at which North Korea has done this U-turn, and this all started with Donald Trump agreeing to sit down for a summit with Kim Jong Un."

I have been talking about and this message of these five forces working against the president, these narratives are now dying, especially Trump-Russia collusion and the president's agenda is working, which is good for the American people."

And at the end of the day, I think it's a rounding success, and that's what I think to your point, you don't hear enough about people want to talk about what could have happened, what might happen, speculate a lot.

The 93-year-old Bush is suffering a blood infection, but a family spokesman says tonight that Mr. Bush is, quote, responding to treatments and appears to be recovering. This is the fifth time in the last six years the elder Bush has been hospitalized, including a year ago this month where he spent two weeks in the hospital for pneumonia. On Friday, during the public viewing of Barbara Bush's casket, the 41st president greeted some 4,500 people who came to pay their respects. Meantime, in Toronto, witnesses say a van traveling at 30 to 35 miles per hour on the walkways of Yonge Street, one of the busiest avenues in the city, appeared to be swerving back and forth trying to kill as many people as possible. And tonight, the death toll has been raised to 10, with 15 others injured, some of them critically. Toronto police say the attack was deliberate but are not yet calling it terrorism, and they have identified the suspect as 25-year-old Alek Minassian, who lives 15 miles outside of Toronto. Minassian was arrested after appearing to wave a weapon at police. Still no word on motive, but the killing certainly follows a recent pattern of attacks around the world that involved rented vans, including the attack on bike riders last Halloween in Lower Manhattan, the 2016 attack on the London Bridge, and 2017 van attack on Las Ramblas shopping center in Barcelona. ISIS has called on followers to steal or rent vans and use them to attack civilians -- Sean."

We now know Andy McCarthy's hypothesis is absolutely sound, the work of Sara Carter, John Solomon, our own FOX, Catherine Herridge, it is clear the Obama administration wanted Hillary to win. She was protected by the highest echelons of the DOJ and the FBI. Why? Because her felonious use of a private server to send classified information on implicated the president himself. We know President Obama under a pseudonym contacted her and sent sensitive information on that private home-brew server, which meant if she was prosecuted, guess who has to be prosecuted as well? President Obama. That is why they perverted the course of justice and everything should be renamed not FISA-gate, not surveillance-gate, it must be renamed tonight Sean, Obama-gate."

If they want to get these things out, they're not just innocent whistleblowers. They're looking to push the narrative to hurt people in positions of power. And we've seen that over and over again. So, look, Devin Nunes who is obviously the head of the intelligence committee in the House, he has been dismissed by the media for the most part. He has been called a lackey. And then you look at the other side his counterpart, Adam Schiff. Do you know how many interviews Adam Schiff has done? And I'm not talking print interviews or online.

I look at Pew research right after the election. And here's what they said. The top three issues that voters voted on. 84 percent the economy. Eighty four percent said the economy and jobs. Eight percent terrorism. ISIS in this case, obviously. Seventy five percent foreign policy. So we look at those three issues and foreign policy obviously we have to look at North Korea in those regards. The president is doing quite well on the issues that matter most to people, yet those are the issues that get the least reporting by our media because we're looking too much at Russia and Stormy Daniels and things that people don't care about as much as our media in the bubble thinks they do."

It's the weirdest thing I've ever heard. I love oppression. We're oppressed. Four hundred years of slavery of Jim Crow, which by the way, none of you guys live through it. Your grandparents did. It's an embarrassing that you utilize -- you utilize their history. Utilize their history and you come in here with more emotion than they ever had when they were living through it.

Here are just some of what he tweeted. \"Aside from being an insane alt-right race pimp Candace Owens things Donald Trump is literally the messiah not you at Kanye West so you might want to reconsider.\" He also wrote \"@realCandace, while glomming onto Kanye West. His family already told him you were a phony and a fraud. A former Democratic bad actress.\" I don't even want to talk about this anymore. Candace now joins us. You are a total star.

This is why they are constantly utilizing Hollywood and this develop this underground system of conservative thinkers in Hollywood for fear of losing their job.

Because the Democrats there's every year, every election year, they played the race card. Republicans don't want to count you in the census. The James Beard ad, and so on, and so forth.
