But there's so many others. Remember when time reporters Zeke Miller wrote that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. Outrage ensued but it turns out the bust had been there all along. He just hadn't seen it. I guess the bust of famous black people all look alike to Miller. How about when the media were convinced Trump had photoshopped his hands to make them look bigger for a White House picture? they bought that. Or when the press said that Trump threatened to invade Mexico. These people lie more than I did when I was dating. Then there was the tale of Trump killing the fish in the White House koi pond by overfeeding them. And then Trump renaming Black History Month and Trump easing Russian sanctions, Trump recommending injecting bleach into your veins to beat COVID. All lies but were reported as facts. Then there's stuff that don't involve Trump but harmed you. The dismissal of spikes and violence across the country to protect the defund the cop's narrative. The demonization of law enforcement in the white washing of criminal past to maintain victim status. All is choreographed as Lady Gaga as backup dancers. If I started listing all of these fake fables, we'd have to preempt tomorrow's Fox and Friends which would piss up Brian Kilmeade because he just got a perm. I get it. I'm getting tired of my own ravings about the media, but I can't stop. This is the only industry designed to lie and then create awards to champion their lies. It's the only industry that ruins careers and futures just for the hell of it. And unlike the corporate media, I am not exaggerating. You don't have to like Trump or be Republican or be anything at all to be wary of the punitive power of the press. Like a serial killer on the loose. They think they can get away with (BLEEP) because they always do. It's why every day you must doubt what you hear, including from me. As unlikely as such a thing sounds, I'd love for you to prove me wrong because believe it or not, I can be wrong. Who am I kidding? I've never wrong.",

During her podcast, \"Honestly,\" writer, Barry Weiss, recounts the story of an immigrant family's business that was destroyed over a tweet. The Wadi family ran holy land, a popular Middle Eastern grocery store chain based in Minnesota, which is a state, Kat. But last summer, their company and their family came under attack. Turns out their daughter tweeted racist things back in 2012 when she was just 16. And they were terrible tweets the kind of garbage you'd expect from a 51- year-old son of a president. Those tweets came to light during the George Floyd protests and the backlash was so severe people demanded that the company owner, who is the girl's father, fire his own daughter from the family business. Here's the shocking part, he did, even though she apologized and now marches in protests in the protests. But that didn't stop the mob landlords canceled their leases with the company's largest location, million-dollar contracts were severed with other businesses and dozens of employees were let go. After the Wadi home address became public. The family even had to evacuate their house out of fear a peaceful protest would peacefully burn it to the ground. So, is it me or is public shaming become our national pastime? I tell you, if we were all held accountable for stupid things we did when we were 16. I be in prison right now. A woman's prison. That's a long story. We can't get into it here now. Sean, also, you're Canadian, right? I keep forgetting about that. But I sometimes I'm sure your tweets were really bad. But she was 16. This is like almost 20 years, no 10 years ago. Don't you feel bad for this family? They come here they build a successful business.",

We found that the USPP had the authority and discretion to clear the park and the surrounding areas on June 1st. The evidence we obtained did not support a finding that the USPP cleared the park to allow the president to survey the damage and walk to St. John's Church. Instead, the evidence we reviewed showed that the USPP cleared the park to allow the contractor to safely install the antiscale fencing. Now you'd expect those media hacks to walk it all back, but our media can barely walk at all. I wonder if CNN is covering this."

But there's so many others. Remember when time reporters Zeke Miller wrote that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. Outrage ensued but it turns out the bust had been there all along. He just hadn't seen it. I guess the bust of famous black people all look alike to Miller. How about when the media were convinced Trump had photoshopped his hands to make them look bigger for a White House picture? they bought that. Or when the press said that Trump threatened to invade Mexico. These people lie more than I did when I was dating. Then there was the tale of Trump killing the fish in the White House koi pond by overfeeding them. And then Trump renaming Black History Month and Trump easing Russian sanctions, Trump recommending injecting bleach into your veins to beat COVID. All lies but were reported as facts. Then there's stuff that don't involve Trump but harmed you. The dismissal of spikes and violence across the country to protect the defund the cop's narrative. The demonization of law enforcement in the white washing of criminal past to maintain victim status. All is choreographed as Lady Gaga as backup dancers. If I started listing all of these fake fables, we'd have to preempt tomorrow's Fox and Friends which would piss up Brian Kilmeade because he just got a perm. I get it. I'm getting tired of my own ravings about the media, but I can't stop. This is the only industry designed to lie and then create awards to champion their lies. It's the only industry that ruins careers and futures just for the hell of it. And unlike the corporate media, I am not exaggerating. You don't have to like Trump or be Republican or be anything at all to be wary of the punitive power of the press. Like a serial killer on the loose. They think they can get away with (BLEEP) because they always do. It's why every day you must doubt what you hear, including from me. As unlikely as such a thing sounds, I'd love for you to prove me wrong because believe it or not, I can be wrong. Who am I kidding? I've never wrong."

Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf. So, Julie, you claimed to be a news anchor but it's on the weekend. So, we can't have it. We don't have any proof. Why do the anchors have such a hard time reporting the truth?"

The Interior Department inspector general found that poor communication, they're blaming it on poor communication, which then leads me to my next point between agencies that may have contributed to confusion during the operation.

I haven't gotten to the last part. I'm getting there. But I would say, you know, these people were pepper sprayed over the false narrative that they were clearing this area for a fence, not for the fence at the border, but for a fence that they were clearing out before the President. And it's shameful actually, that the networks are not reporting the facts. I mean, abcnews.com actually had an article on this. But I'm wondering if the evening news on ABC is going to be reporting it because there's a huge disconnect between online like, oh, if we clear up our B.S online then we don't actually have to say it on T.V."

Anyway, the group that does is the most, liberal women. 33 percent said they've cut ties with the friend over political differences.

The state of knowing, knowing knowledge, as distinguished from ignorance or misunderstanding. So, then here we go with the misunderstanding thing, which again, marriage counseling.

He's saying that it didn't prove to be helpful outside of a hospital setting, right? So, it's OK for doctors, but it's not OK for the rest of us. Like those in the nursing home.

The Wadi family ran holy land, a popular Middle Eastern grocery store chain based in Minnesota, which is a state, Kat. But last summer, their company and their family came under attack. Turns out their daughter tweeted racist things back in 2012 when she was just 16. And they were terrible tweets the kind of garbage you'd expect from a 51- year-old son of a president. Those tweets came to light during the George Floyd protests and the backlash was so severe people demanded that the company owner, who is the girl's father, fire his own daughter from the family business. Here's the shocking part, he did, even though she apologized and now marches in protests in the protests. But that didn't stop the mob landlords canceled their leases with the company's largest location, million-dollar contracts were severed with other businesses and dozens of employees were let go. After the Wadi home address became public. The family even had to evacuate their house out of fear a peaceful protest would peacefully burn it to the ground. So, is it me or is public shaming become our national pastime? I tell you, if we were all held accountable for stupid things we did when we were 16. I be in prison right now. A woman's prison. That's a long story. We can't get into it here now. Sean, also, you're Canadian, right? I keep forgetting about that. But I sometimes I'm sure your tweets were really bad. But she was 16.

YouTube sensations Jake and Logan Paul earned millions of followers posting videos of pranks, stunts and other self-absorbed nonsense that I don't understand. Now, they're using their fame to hype pay per view boxing with massive profits. This weekend, Logan Paul fought retired champ, Floyd Mayweather Jr. Was the fight any good? Nope. But it made millions. The fans have spoken. Instead of competitive boxing, they'd rather watch these freak shows. Where else can you get a TikTok star pummeling an ex NBA player with booming hip hop and light shows and tons of trash talking online? The Paul brothers may be annoying but they're living a write your own adventure story. They're winning fights, they're having fun and they're making cash like strippers on Hunter Biden night. All right. Clay, I actually love this story and I have total respect for Logan Paul because he's got this -- I call it the movie theory that he gets up in the morning and he writes his own script so that he's the star of life. That's the only way -- I wish I thought like this. I came to that conclusion years ago that you can do this. But it's, it's so he decided he was going to do this."

And yes, he's famous because he's got a lot of views on YouTube, which I think YouTubers are just annoying because they think that they're like the big celebrity, right?
