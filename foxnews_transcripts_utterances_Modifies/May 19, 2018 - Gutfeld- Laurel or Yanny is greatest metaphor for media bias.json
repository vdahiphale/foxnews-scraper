If they really meant it, they head to a local prison, go straight to death row and snuggle a serial killer. You will die, but you showed Trump.  But the media is worse. Here is a tweet from John Harwood, \"However repugnant, their actions, MS-13 gang members, they are human beings in my humble opinion.\" No, he's right, MS-13, they are humans, but John, so was Hitler, so was Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Carrot Top.

So, another deadly school shooting, this time Santa Fe, Texas. Friday. So, let's assess how we assess this. To me, I hate to say it, it's Laurel versus Yanny yet again. The Yanny, we have too many guns and need to ban some, if not all. The Laurel, you will never get rid of guns, but since good guys with guns protect us from bad guys with guns, we need more armed security. So, it's too many guns versus not enough. We can keep going on this merry- go-round forever or admit that we are going nowhere. Why not choose another way? Maybe a compromise, you want sensible gun control without infringing on your rights? How about a system that tag psychos who are considered high risk by authorities and teachers? That is gun control that does not affect all of us, just the nuts like this recent scum ball.  And meanwhile, schools should start hiring way more trained armed personnel. One variable that reduces injury is time. Meaning, the duration between the first gun being fired and the arrival of a second gun, the more you reduce the duration, the more you reduce casualties. So, that is a compromise. As for the media, be aware that your blanket coverage of a symbolic gesture meant for infamy does not help. It only creates more incentive to unleash such ghastly gestures. This latest shooter picked up tips from those past. Where did he learn them from? Us. So, Dr. Drew, you deal with a lot of pathology and a lot of psychology, what kind of problem is this in your mind?",

And we have really come through a period in this country where every childhood experiences are exceedingly common. You add bullying to that, you add certain kinds of Asperger's and certain other mental illnesses and then you have access to guns.

Recently, The Daily Caller asked people who would you rather date? A felon or a Trump supporter? A majority said felon. Now, they are lying, but the great thing about surveys, you can do that. If they really meant it, they head to a local prison, go straight to death row and snuggle a serial killer. You will die, but you showed Trump. But the media is worse. Here is a tweet from John Harwood, \"However repugnant, their actions, MS-13 gang members, they are human beings in my humble opinion.\" No, he's right, MS-13, they are humans, but John, so was Hitler, so was Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Carrot Top.

We can listen to the same thing and hear two completely different things. The MS-13 discussion was a perfect example of that, and people get heated about it. It's so weird to me. They are really -- you saw those twins, getting upset about it. But I am telling you why, the metaphor that I like even better that you pointed out a minute ago was Trump addiction. I don't know if you want to get into that, but the media needs to go cold Trump. There's really no other way. There's no other way to deal with it."

It was like 12:00 at night and he came to my house and I was like, \"Whoa, Walter Kern, are you a murderer? You look weird.\" He didn't watch the news or anything. We watched \"Jaws\" and he talked during the whole movie. But, no, no, this is what is so great about him. I didn't mind it. He was explaining to me how different it is. And he's like, \"This part, this is -- he's chasing this Moby Dick, and this, this, this.\" And I was like, \"Yes, okay,\" I get why he basically narrated \"Jaws\" to me. It's phenomenal, so...

So, another deadly school shooting, this time Santa Fe, Texas. Friday. So, let's assess how we assess this. To me, I hate to say it, it's Laurel versus Yanny yet again. The Yanny, we have too many guns and need to ban some, if not all. The Laurel, you will never get rid of guns, but since good guys with guns protect us from bad guys with guns, we need more armed security. So, it's too many guns versus not enough. We can keep going on this merry- go-round forever or admit that we are going nowhere. Why not choose another way? Maybe a compromise, you want sensible gun control without infringing on your rights? How about a system that tag psychos who are considered high risk by authorities and teachers? That is gun control that does not affect all of us, just the nuts like this recent scum ball. And meanwhile, schools should start hiring way more trained armed personnel. One variable that reduces injury is time. Meaning, the duration between the first gun being fired and the arrival of a second gun, the more you reduce the duration, the more you reduce casualties. So, that is a compromise. As for the media, be aware that your blanket coverage of a symbolic gesture meant for infamy does not help. It only creates more incentive to unleash such ghastly gestures. This latest shooter picked up tips from those past. Where did he learn them from? Us. So, Dr. Drew, you deal with a lot of pathology and a lot of psychology, what kind of problem is this in your mind?"

      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, these are different things. Each one is a different problem, but I spoke to a kid -- a young adult today who was almost one of these shooters and he said he had been physically abused and emotionally abused by his mom, his dad abandoned him and then he got bullied, he said that he felt that was the recipe for some of these kids. And we have really come through a period in this country where every childhood experiences are exceedingly common. You add bullying to that, you add certain kinds of Asperger's and certain other mental illnesses and then you have access to guns. Now, I don't know if you heard the press conference today, but the governor -- the Lieutenant Governor and Ted Cruz sounded like you. They said they were saying some of the things you were saying just now."

We have to get ahead of this thing and unfortunately, this is about the fourth time in this show we've had to talk about this and it's the same thing. We need fences. We need dogs. We don't just need two armed guards in a 16-football size school. We need teams. Just like -- we talked about it when we talked about 9/11, our airport got hit, we changed the way -- you can't go to the airport the same since then. You can't go to school the same way today. It needs to be preemptive. First responders did the best they could. They are amazing, but something has to happen for them to respond. That first shot is fired before they can save the day. We can easily -- if we did it with her airports, we do did it with our concerts, we do it with our schools. Let's put a bill together. It's a national security issue in my opinion, protecting our kids. We could put it together. We're putting a wall on our borders. We are putting walls around our schools.

It doesn't actually makes us safer, it just kind of moves the checkpoint outside the airport -- or moves the danger zone outside the airport. You have to be careful. But the way that this has been discussed is really kind of disgusting to me because you look at the incident, there is really no constitutional gun control law that could have prevented this. There just isn't one, and still, the left is blaming it on the right and blaming it on the NRA even though it knows there is no law that is constitutional that could have sold this. And so, they are just doing that to further demonize the right for no good reason and shame on them for doing so."

They are going to remember me if I take out a bunch of people, and they look at that, so that's -- it drives me crazy watching coverage of this. Like don't show them, don't talk about them.

We have known that for months. It's bad. All right, I actually contacted a friend of mine, a major higher up in the Democratic Party, and I asked for their potential presidential and Vice Presidential running mate, the pairings, and so we sent the actual bumper stickers that they were preparing for 2020s or the Presidential nominee and his running mate, and so first one here, this is this first -- Liz warren is going to be running, but the bumper sticker will have, Liz Warren and The Kars For Kids Band. The actual running mate. That's the actual running mate, but then it could be that The Kars For Kids are actually going to be running on the front ticket, but their running mate is A Delightful Butterfly. Bernie Sanders will be running and they're pretty sure he is. His running mate will be The Flu. However, you never know, The Flu might declare to run on its own, but with a running mate, Al Gore. This is so good. Joe Biden is running, I am pretty sure. They haven't figured out his running mate, but I heard it could be A Half, Full Bottle Of Robitussin Found Under A Car Seat, so it's really hot and sticky. By the way, remember, Tim Kaine. Yes, he may be running and his running mate will be Tile Grout. However, there has been a contention between the two. Tile Grout might be running. Tim Kaine might be his running mate.

Maybe canceling some plans does not exactly seem below him on the bad person scale, but again, we don't know if it is going to happen or not yet, and I completely agree with Tyrus that it's been disgusting that some people are excited that it's not going will not happen. Because I don't care how I feel about a person, but the person that I hate the most in the world, if their success means I'm not going to get blown up, then I am going say, \"Go for it. I you win."

Are we pasty bores who stay indoors? According to a new report, a quarter of Americans spend nearly all day inside. A survey of 16,000 people across 14 countries found that for Americans, 25% spend 21 to 24 hours inside -- that's me 20% spend 19 to 20 hours inside, 21% spend 15 to 18 hours and the remaining, 30% said, I love Greg Gutfeld. Thank you. Finally. Researchers found a big disparity between how much time we think we spend outside versus how much we actually do. I never go outside unless, of course, it is to do this. That is how I get to work. All right, Walter, you spend a lot of time indoors, but -- no actually, you are an outdoorsman, aren't you?"

Inside there is TV, there's very nice indoor cats, there is the computer which is really interesting and fun.

And even as an adult, I love being outside now because it's not crowded. I've never gone -- I go outside, I've never gone fishing like, \"Damn, there are just so many people here.\" This is great. The parks, swing is always open. Like because people -- like you said, on their phones, but I am always outside and my kids just know to go outside because I was threatened to go outside. We had rules. We had to stay out until the streetlights came on or the friend left."

We are the only animal -- they are some critics that -- critters that build dams and dig holes, but they are still losers and I am talking about beavers and rabbits. They are not humans. We actually continue to evolve and create more complex technologies. You know, we started with the wheel and now we have more wheels. We do electrical work. Dogs and cats don't. This is what we get.
