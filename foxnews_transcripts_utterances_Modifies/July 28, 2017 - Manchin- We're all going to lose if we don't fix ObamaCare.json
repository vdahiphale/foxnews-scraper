So, for some, it certainly did give the impression that this was a big victory for them. And, of course, they were whooping it up in the middle of the morning last night or very early morning after this to do just that.  So, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin on what signal that sends.   Now, if I'm a Republican, Senator, I'm looking at that. I'm saying, wait a minute, you said don't get celebratory about it and all, but you're getting celebratory about it. Can you hear me, Senator?

I think, if you want to be -- look at something that has happened, look at around the country and find out which states have tried different things. Alaska has the re-insurance. Indiana has done something great as far as the managed Medicaid expansion to control costs, but show people how to be more responsible, but use it in a more productive manner. A lot of good things can be done.  But, John, everybody is saying about John McCain. Let me tell you, John came in there and John voted to proceed. Let's get on the bill. If anybody has ever sat in a committee with John McCain -- I have been on Armed Services -- John has his markup on the NDA, national defense authorization bill. And he does it every year.
