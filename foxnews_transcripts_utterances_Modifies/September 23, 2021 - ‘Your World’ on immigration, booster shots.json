They just don't know how much money and how much we're spending hand over fist. Does this look like a performance you would see in stocks if they were taking stock of all of that? No, it does not. But up we are, nevertheless, 507 more points today for the Dow, on top of 338 points yesterday for the Dow, all the major averages now positive on the week with one trading day to go. And they have gone a long way with his double-day performance to sort of trim those losses we were having in the month of September for all the market averages. So what's really going on here? Let's go to Susan Li, keeping track of all these developments right now -- Susan.",

But, with two straight days of gains, we're actually up now on this week. So it's like Monday didn't even happen, which was the worst day for the broader markets since mid-May. And that's being offset by today's rally, which is the best day since July. So, virtually every stock was up on the Dow Jones industrials, technology like Salesforce. you have consumer brands like Nike, industrials, banks all on the up and up today. Now, it's not like everything's OK once again in the world. You still have that looming threat of a U.S. debt default, if that debt ceiling isn't raised. The Federal Reserve has indicated that they are still going to reduce stimulus before year's end. And what about that huge Chinese real estate firm China Evergrande? Still on the brink of collapse. They missed an $83 million interest payment to their foreign bondholders today. Beijing has instructed local governments to prepare for its downfall, which could have a global impact, since we're talking about $300 billion in debt. And then some weakness on the home front, with a surprise jump in weekly jobless claims, still near pandemic lows. But we did see an increase up to 351,000 last week. Hurricane Ida and the Delta variant may have impacted those numbers. But Neil, most of Wall Street, I can tell you right now, is squarely focused on D.C. and where those talks and $3.5 trillion in spending, along with the debt ceiling, goes. And they're hoping that it goes in the right direction.",

Immediately, our cars began to flood the area to secure the scene. As we entered the building, there were multiple people shot. The -- our SWAT team, along with patrol officers and our command staff members, began the process of going aisle to aisle, room to room, clearing, bringing employees out that were in hiding, and helping the victims that were injured. At this time, we have -- still have a couple of active scenes that are working. The suspected shooter's vehicle is in the parking lot. And we are waiting on some additional equipment to get here to be able to safely check that vehicle, as well as some property that's on him. At this time, the shooter is deceased. We believe that's going to be from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We have 13 victims. Our hearts go out to those that were injured. We do have one fatality. And our thoughts and prayers are with those family members. We had -- like I said, we had 13 victims that we know of at this time. Now, please bear with me and know that the situation is probably going to change. And we will do another update, another briefing probably in three hours, somewhere in that range. And we will update you. But we're having -- we know that we have had 12 victims that were transported from this scene. And we also know that we have had one, at least one additional walk-up to local hospitals. Today, I have Assistant Chief Jeff Abeln with me, our fire chief at Collierville, Chief Billings, his assistant chief, king, Assistant Special Agent Charge Jeremy Becker (ph) with the FBI. We have Colonel Smith with MPD, Chief Inspector Mills, Derek Mills, with Shelby County. And I can't say enough about the cooperation and the help. And as bad as the scene is, and it's horrific -- I have been involved with this for 34 years, and I have never seen anything like it. But our teams came together and worked together. That's not just the law enforcement agencies, but the fire. Sometimes, there's a delay. There was no delay with our firemen coming into that scene with us. We just trained on this back two months ago at Collierville High School. So, it is -- just like I said, it's with a broken heart that I have to stand here before you today. So please keep the families in your prayers. Keep the folks from this Kroger. We have a representative from Kroger here as well. I'm not sure if they're going to give a statement at this point.

My plan, throw them in a basket and run out the closest exit. That's the thing to do. Now, if you're an employee, every company in the United States should have an active shooter plan. And they should designate places that employees can go to lock down, the meat locker or wherever, anything that has a solid door on it, because you're trying to bet by time. These shooters are in a hurry. And they want to get this thing over with as quickly as possible. If they get delayed by a locked door, they move on. And we need to remember that.

Now, obviously, this caused widespread panic in the store and around the store, employees and customers, as we understand it, running foot cover. Some were found by the police apparently hiding in freezes. One had escaped to the rooftop and was brought down from there. Now, we should caution, Neil, that, of course, in these instances, as always, preliminary information can change. So the number of victims could go up or down. Some of those, of course, may be suffering very light injuries. Some may be more serious than we currently know. And the police chief, in fact, emphasized that they are trying to check on those numbers and that they may have some people who simply checked themselves into the hospitals, rather than being transported.

Most of the migrants gone from that field now. They're all crammed underneath the bridge, as, again, Border Patrol buses have been pulling up nonstop here.

The feds say about 1, 400 have been deported. We just don't know how many have been released into the United States. We know it's in the thousands. But the Biden administration is not commenting, giving those specific numbers.

And that's why we need a new flu shot. It's unclear, with COVID-19. But this is where, if we have good surveillance systems and good monitoring, we will be able to see if this is something yearly.

And so this is good, because we're learning more about this novel situation. What I would say is, the COVID-19 vaccines that we have, all three authorized in United States, are safe, are effective, and they're preventing the most severe illness, hospitalization and death. And so it's one of those things where, what's the risk, what's the benefit? The risk is very high in terms of getting in contact with somebody that has COVID or you being exposed and getting COVID yourself and suffering the consequences of natural infection, long COVID, things like that, when we now have a preventable tool, a COVID-19 vaccine, that can help prevent all of that suffering that you potentially will go through.

So, virtually every stock was up on the Dow Jones industrials, technology like Salesforce. you have consumer brands like Nike, industrials, banks all on the up and up today. Now, it's not like everything's OK once again in the world. You still have that looming threat of a U.S. debt default, if that debt ceiling isn't raised. The Federal Reserve has indicated that they are still going to reduce stimulus before year's end. And what about that huge Chinese real estate firm China Evergrande? Still on the brink of collapse. They missed an $83 million interest payment to their foreign bondholders today. Beijing has instructed local governments to prepare for its downfall, which could have a global impact, since we're talking about $300 billion in debt.

And they said they would probably be all right with that sliding maybe until Tuesday or Wednesday. Certainly, as you heard from the speaker, she left the door open to not voting on Monday, and a lot of those Blue Dogs would be OK, so long as there was a commitment to do that pretty soon. If you have the votes, you go ahead and vote. But that could affect the $3.5 trillion bill. That's an issue. And, again, messed up in all of this right now is what they do about government funding and the debt ceiling. Where that falls next week -- October 1 is the deadline to fund the government -- that's not clear, Neil."

I think most Americans can argue that we should have the ability to send kids to community college tuition-free, that we should be able to have Medicare pay for vision and dental and hearing care for our seniors and, for the first time in history, have Medicare negotiate pharmaceutical pricing for our seniors, and many other great things that are on this proposal. We just need to be careful that the pay-fors are fair and that they're not overbearing, for example, to our energy sector in America, and that they're not put it in an uncompetitive position when they're dealing with their global foes.

It's -- we need to assure that the pay-fors are fair and that we're not unnecessarily targeting, in a punitive way, any one sector of our economy, for example, the energy sector in Texas.

Immediately, our cars began to flood the area to secure the scene. As we entered the building, there were multiple people shot. The -- our SWAT team, along with patrol officers and our command staff members, began the process of going aisle to aisle, room to room, clearing, bringing employees out that were in hiding, and helping the victims that were injured. At this time, we have -- still have a couple of active scenes that are working. The suspected shooter's vehicle is in the parking lot. And we are waiting on some additional equipment to get here to be able to safely check that vehicle, as well as some property that's on him. At this time, the shooter is deceased. We believe that's going to be from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We have 13 victims. Our hearts go out to those that were injured. We do have one fatality. And our thoughts and prayers are with those family members. We had -- like I said, we had 13 victims that we know of at this time. Now, please bear with me and know that the situation is probably going to change. And we will do another update, another briefing probably in three hours, somewhere in that range. And we will update you. But we're having -- we know that we have had 12 victims that were transported from this scene. And we also know that we have had one, at least one additional walk-up to local hospitals. Today, I have Assistant Chief Jeff Abeln with me, our fire chief at Collierville, Chief Billings, his assistant chief, king, Assistant Special Agent Charge Jeremy Becker (ph) with the FBI. We have Colonel Smith with MPD, Chief Inspector Mills, Derek Mills, with Shelby County. And I can't say enough about the cooperation and the help. And as bad as the scene is, and it's horrific -- I have been involved with this for 34 years, and I have never seen anything like it. But our teams came together and worked together. That's not just the law enforcement agencies, but the fire. Sometimes, there's a delay. There was no delay with our firemen coming into that scene with us. We just trained on this back two months ago at Collierville High School. So, it is -- just like I said, it's with a broken heart that I have to stand here before you today. So please keep the families in your prayers. Keep the folks from this Kroger. We have a representative from Kroger here as well. I'm not sure if they're going to give a statement at this point. But everything is preliminary. So, with that, I'll open it up for just a couple of real quick questions."

We have learned that there are 13 victims, 12 injured, some seriously. The one person also has died. The shooter is dead, we are told. We do know that the situation around this area has been entirely locked down. Don't know what motivated this individual, what time he started firing or why, or whether these individuals were those he knew, just that he is dead, and a few of those others injured, some seriously so, but one known dead at the time.

No link to those here. Obviously, we're just reporting that was a couple of days ago when that was a very big issue in the news at the time. But little more than that is available.

It's up to you and your family, your friends to take action to protect yourself in a situation like this. If you're in the grocery store, and you hear firecrackers going off, that's not firecrackers. There's somebody killing people. And you need to understand that. And when you go to the store, you need to prepare yourself. And I don't want you to be paranoid. I'm not. But you have to be ready, just like ready for a fire. And where are take exits? How do I get my family and kids out of here? Do I put my child in a basket and run out the door? Yes, you do. And get space between you and whatever is going on. But these happen too frequently. And most people don't believe it's happening until after they have already been shot. So, it's a very serious situation. My heart goes out to them. I know the law enforcement community in that area. I work with them a lot. And they're very good. But it's our responsibility to keep care of myself, because the police are minutes away. It's over by the time they get there."

Apparently, they didn't know where the shots were coming from in the beginning. What is the best advice in a situation like this? A good many people did find a way to hide, and the area is still in lockdown. And some, we're told, are afraid, according to the local press, to leave the grocery store themselves, as police are trying to coax them out. But what do you tell people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COULSON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's a great question. It's not easy to answer. But I will tell you this. Where are the exits? Because the shooting is going on inside the facility 90 percent of the time. They're not outside shooting in. They're inside shooting people. So, when you're walking around the story in the produce department, where's the exit? You're in the meat department. Where's the exit, just in case I need to get out of here, and how am I going to get my kids out? I shop with my grandchildren all the time. My plan, throw them in a basket and run out the closest exit. That's the thing to do. Now, if you're an employee, every company in the United States should have an active shooter plan. And they should designate places that employees can go to lock down, the meat locker or wherever, anything that has a solid door on it, because you're trying to bet by time. These shooters are in a hurry. And they want to get this thing over with as quickly as possible. If they get delayed by a locked door, they move on. And we need to remember that. Time is on your on your side here. Buy time. Get yourself out of there, but, more importantly, try to get out the door. Just get -- leave."

They also need to do a great analysis of this situation. And Kroger -- I know Kroger. They're a good organization. And I'm sure, right now, they're reconsidering their active shooter policy. It sounds like their policy was very good, because their employees did get to lockdown. They got people out. They did the right thing. But it's rarely -- and I hate keep saying this over and over, but it's up to us to protect ourself in those situations. Get out. Find a place to defend yourself. If you happen to be armed with a pistol, like I am generally, then maybe you can do some good there. But your best bet is to leave. Get the heck out."

Multiple people were injured. We're told, in all, 13 victims; 12 of those are injuries. One customer, we're told, has passed away. The shooter is dead.

That number of shots appears to be borne out by the number of injuries we are now hearing from the police chief, Dale Lane. He says that at least a dozen people have been injured in the shooting. One person has been killed. Chief Lane also saying that the shooter is dead, apparently killing himself. Now, obviously, this caused widespread panic in the store and around the store, employees and customers, as we understand it, running foot cover. Some were found by the police apparently hiding in freezes. One had escaped to the rooftop and was brought down from there. Now, we should caution, Neil, that, of course, in these instances, as always, preliminary information can change. So the number of victims could go up or down. Some of those, of course, may be suffering very light injuries. Some may be more serious than we currently know. And the police chief, in fact, emphasized that they are trying to check on those numbers and that they may have some people who simply checked themselves into the hospitals, rather than being transported. So those numbers could change. But as we know from the police chief right now, one person dead, the shooter dead, and at least a dozen injured in this latest shooting -- Neil."

It is certainly something that the citizens going into a supermarket cannot plan to defend. All they can do when something like this happen is to shelter in place as best they can, to hide, to go to the rooftop, like we learned that one person has actually done here. But this is the thing that law enforcement is faced with when it comes to these mass shootings. But this happened, as you know, in a Kroger supermarket. You do not go to a supermarket expecting that it will be shot up, and that you will maybe perhaps never leave there. It's a very tragic situation that's occurring right now. And law enforcement has a big monumental job that they will have to undertake since this has occurred."

And that's when they also found that the shooter was dead. And, again, they increasingly think it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. When there are these killings in public places, whether it be a movie theater or a Walmart not too long ago or all that we have seen in mass shootings, is it a target area? Is it a random event? How do these usually break down?"

What is happening right now, Neil, to try to find some of the answers is the determine, what was the motive? So law enforcement officers are going to have to back -- work backwards. We know, allegedly, that we have someone with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Maybe perhaps there's some identification on that person. Law enforcement, if, in fact, they can immediately identify the person, will try to find out the residence or where that person reside. And they will go to that location and they will scrub if he has a computer or they will ask individuals who perhaps know that person. They're trying to determine, why would one individual just walk into a store and spray that store with bullets, at least killing one person, and injuring numerous individuals? That is outside the norm. And they are going to definitely try to run down a motive in this case, Neil. That's so significant and important."

And I know we're still talking about government impasse, spending impasses, whether we're going to run out of money and breach the debt ceiling and all of that, to say nothing of if the Chinese financial concerns tumbling and concerns we're going into a banking mess. But on a day like this people, just going grocery shopping, the last thing they would probably think would happen just did. It puts in perspective the fragility of life. I don't think I'm saying anything profound here, save this. Prioritize. Prioritize. We will have more after this."

      "utterance": "All right, we're just learning now that the CDC is now recommending the COVID-19 vaccine boosters for those 65 and older, at risk- patients as well, those with compromised immune systems and the like. This pretty much mirrors what the FDA had decided, to give the OK to only those who might need it, who might need the booster bump, if you will, from those already vaccinated. This would be a third shot, but only for the vulnerable sector of the population, not for everybody else. We will have much more on this as we talk to a top doctor where this takes us on boosters and vaccines themselves in just a little bit. But, first, take a look at this."

The administration, says in this latest count that 1, 400, a little bit more than that, Haitians, have been returned to Haiti. But it doesn't really account for those who could still be here or might have already been released right, Bill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, that's exactly right. That was a fantastic question by Peter. There are thousands of migrants that are, quite frankly, just kind of unaccounted for right now. We don't know where they are in the count. And one thing is become very clear down here. The feds are now moving at warp speed to get rid of this camp and clear it out behind us. I'm going to step out and give you a look at three live cameras here we have on location, our drone and two ground cameras. Take a look at the difference just this afternoon. They started moving very quickly with bulldozers and all sorts of heavy machinery to literally raze to the ground all those makeshift structures we have been seeing over the past several days that those migrants have been building out in that open dirt field. Most of the migrants gone from that field now. They're all crammed underneath the bridge, as, again, Border Patrol buses have been pulling up nonstop here. They are trying to ship everybody out here as fast as possible. The question is, how many are being deported? How many are being released into the country? The feds say about 1, 400 have been deported. We just don't know how many have been released into the United States. We know it's in the thousands. But the Biden administration is not commenting, giving those specific numbers. Now, earlier today, Peter Doocy had an exchange with Jen Psaki, because Psaki said the ones who aren't being deported, a lot of them are being placed into -- quote, unquote -- \"removal proceedings.\" That makes it sound like people are being removed from the country. Well, a lot of the times, what it means is they're just let go into public with the future court date. Take a listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOOCY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PSAKI",

      "speaker": "MELUGIN",
      "utterance": "And, again, under the Biden administration, they are doing catch and release, letting them go with court paperwork. Now, take a look at this video. Earlier today, Reverend Al Sharpton showed up down here to the camp. He said he wanted to take a tour of the situation, see the conditions these Haitian migrants are living in. Well, it didn't go too well for him because he tried to have a press conference down here and ended up getting shouted down by protesters. Take a listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELUGIN",
      "utterance": "And, again, his press conference only lasted about two or two- and-a-half minutes before he was shouted down. But, last check, the number of people living under this bridge right now has dropped to about 3, 200, a massive decrease from Saturday's climax of about 15,000. Clearly, they're trying to get this opened up as fast as they can. The question we're all wondering, though, is, where most of these people going? We will send it back to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Bill Melugin, thank you very, very much. Indeed, where are they going, to Bill's point? Sheriff Javier Salazar joins us right now from Bexar County, Texas. Sheriff, I'm just curious. Where do all these people go? When the numbers have dropped that significantly, are they all going back to their respective countries?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAVIER SALAZAR, BEXAR COUNTY, TEXAS, SHERIFF",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know. The fact is that a good majority of them may end up in this community here in Bexar County. We're are the first major city that people are going to run into coming up north from the border. And so that was one of the big reasons I wanted to get down there and get eyes on the issue, because the fact is that border issues are Bexar County issues by default."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, this wasn't your county issue either, Sheriff. But, obviously, Al Sharpton was there to protest on how some of these Haitian refugees have been treated on horseback from those trying to apprehend them. And now the administration is saying no more horseback. What do you make of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "I mean, look, I don't know. I think that every law enforcement application has a time and place. I'm a firm believer in that there is a time and a place to use things like horse patrol or vehicle patrol or airborne patrol. So we will see. We will see what ends up happening at the at the end of the investigation. And I have no doubt that they're going to reach -- they're going to try to find out as many answers as they possibly can. And then I'm in favor of making whatever decision that they're going to make."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Sheriff, does it bother you at any level, though, that this was the investigation the administration called for, the treatment of these Haitian refugees the authorities are trying to round up here, because they were coming in by the thousands, but no investigation into the problems that you're dealing with outright at the border itself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "Look, so many things about this situation bother me and bother others in law enforcement. Most notably, we're relegated to getting much of our information through kind of an informal network -- excuse me -- of other sheriffs in the state of Texas, that I'm constantly texting back and forth with other sheriffs, other heads of other law enforcement agencies, federal, state and local, just trying to get more information and trying to -- trying to figure out, how does this affect my county and how best can I combat it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What we do know -- and the numbers are all over the map, and you know these far better than I, Sheriff -- is that many who we apprehend at the border are eventually released into the United States, in fact, maybe thousands that we didn't consider from Haiti. We just don't know the numbers. But there was a recent court ruling where a judge overrode a prior decision that allowed them to be in the United States for this, and instead took the approach the Trump administration did to adjudicate their cases in Mexico, not in the United States. How much of a difference does that make for you and what your men and women have to do if we handle their cases not in this country, where you are, in trying to handle all of this, but in Mexico?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "Well, because that's assuming that they're going to stay in Mexico while their case is adjudicated. The fact is, some of them may find -- do an end-around and find another way to get into the country. And then we don't know what we're dealing with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "So, I don't know the -- all the ins and outs that went into that decision. But what I can tell you is, look, I think that the vast majority of these people are just good people that are looking to get away from something bad and get to something better, a better situation for their family. I can't say that I blame a lot of them for seeking a better life. As a parent, if you told me that a better future for my kids is just beyond that river, I got to say that I would do it as a dad. I would do a lot of things for my children. So, with that being said, are there bad actors mixed in with these folks? I think that there are there may be. I think it's a small percentage, but, still, a small percentage doesn't mean that we can take it lightly."

      "speaker": "SALAZAR",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, look, I don't think we ever have the manpower that we need to deal with every other -- with every eventuality that may come. Look at this poor chief. We see that what he's going through right now in Tennessee. My heart certainly goes out to all those victims' families and the first responders that are dealing with this. So I'm willing to bet that chief at this very moment wishes that he had a work force double what it is. So I don't know that we can ever have enough cops to deal with every particular issue. We're doing the best that we can with what we have. That's what first responders do."

      "utterance": "Sheriff, thank you very, very much on updating us where we stand. Of course, the sheriff was referring to, of course, the shooting in Tennessee today outside a Kroger -- inside a Kroger grocery store. We do know that two are dead, including the shooter, and 12 have been injured. We will keep you posted on that, as well as this latest CDC decision that confirms what the FDA has already said, that these booster shots are OK, but only for a subset of the population, not everyone, older and vulnerable individuals only, for now -- after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, well, this was largely expected after the FDA essentially said the same thing, the CDC, an advisory panel, recommending that a booster shot is OK, but not for everybody, just like the FDA, only those considered vulnerable or those who could benefit from such a boost. That would be the elderly, those with the conditions such as compromised immune systems and the like. Dr. Syra Madad on the significance of all of this, the Special Pathogens Program senior director New York City Health and Hospitals. Doctor, good to have you. Is this what you would recommend?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. SYRA MADAD, NEW YORK CITY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS",
      "utterance": "At this moment, certainly, I think it's the right decision. It's the prudent decision, given what we know with data coming out with this particular population, those over the age of 65, those with underlying health conditions, to give the third boost, along with those individuals that are at higher risk based on occupation and institutional risk settings. But I do think that, by the end of this year, probably into next year, we will probably have the boosters available for the general American population, just as more data is accumulated. So, right now, a subset of individuals are eligible. And then, as year's end, we will probably see booster shots being made available as more data is collected for the general American population."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It seems to be moving, Doctor, toward the way we deal with the common flu, where you get a shot every year, a booster, whatever you want to call it, and that that's how we might be handling this in the future. Is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "Well, what we know about these COVID-19 vaccines is, at first, they were -- they came out as a two-dose. And as more information has been collected over time, given the real-world rollout, with variants and the like, that now we know that this is -- a third dose is something that's going to complete the series. It's unclear whether we need a boost every single year, like we have with a seasonal flu, because the seasonal flu is a different virus. It changes a lot more every single year. And that's why we need a new flu shot. It's unclear, with COVID-19. But this is where, if we have good surveillance systems and good monitoring, we will be able to see if this is something yearly. I don't potentially anticipate. We may need another booth down the line, depending on data, not something in perpetuity annually. But, again, we will need more information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Pfizer is among those leading the push, Doctor, as you know, to vaccinate those as young as 5. How do you feel about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "Well, as we look at the pediatric population, we have seen an astronomical rise in hospitalization rates and infection rates in adolescents, in children. And so having a pediatric vaccine, I think, is important, given the reality. And now it's going to be another -- it's going to be a really great preventative tool. And so, right now, as we know about the timeline, having a pediatric vaccine for those in the age group of 5 to 11 may come out sometime end of this year. Unclear whether it's by Halloween, or by Thanksgiving, or by Christmas. I think things are still, obviously, continuing to evolve. But, certainly, by the end of this year, we may see a vaccine for those 6 months to 4 years, probably by year's end or maybe early next year as well. So I think it's a good development."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Doctor, because of the back-and-forth on this issue of people -- more people getting vaccinated, whether it's done by mandate, as the president seems to be pushing, it's given the unvaccinated pause. And maybe the debate over the booster shot thing illustrates their point, that the medical community can't seem to agree on that. That is, prior to the FDA and the CDC writing off on this, but, again, only for part of the population, many of them come back, Doctor, and say, all right, well, if they're not on the same page on that, if they're saying that the vaccine itself might not be good enough, why the heck should I get it? So what do you tell them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's a really important question to answer. And I think, first, it's OK to have questions. It's OK to be concerned, because what you're seeing in the middle of a pandemic is science evolve in front of you. You're seeing public health guidance change in real time, which is good. So I would say, first, it's good, because, as we're learning more information, we're changing the way that we are doing -- offering boosters based on data, that we're offering and changing public health guidance based on science. And so this is good, because we're learning more about this novel situation. What I would say is, the COVID-19 vaccines that we have, all three authorized in United States, are safe, are effective, and they're preventing the most severe illness, hospitalization and death. And so it's one of those things where, what's the risk, what's the benefit? The risk is very high in terms of getting in contact with somebody that has COVID or you being exposed and getting COVID yourself and suffering the consequences of natural infection, long COVID, things like that, when we now have a preventable tool, a COVID-19 vaccine, that can help prevent all of that suffering that you potentially will go through. So, A, it's good that things are changing, because we're learning. It's a pandemic."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "And then, B, we have a scientific process in this country that is really thorough. And, certainly, these scientists have really great backgrounds in what they do. And so I'm confident in the process, as someone that's an infectious disease epidemiologist, in the trenches and studies a lot of what's happening all around us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Dr. Syra Madad, thank you very, very much. Just to update you on -- those who are curious about what the CDC has decided, it is effectively the same as the FDA, that if you would feel safer and better, if you have a compromised immune system or some other aberrant issue, that it probably would be a good idea to get a booster shot. Only one company has them out right now. It is Pfizer, not surprisingly, Pfizer strongly recommending it for folks. But ask your doctor. You have to be in that population that could use it, nobody else so far. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
