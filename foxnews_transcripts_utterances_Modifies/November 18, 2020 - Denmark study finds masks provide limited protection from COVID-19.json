From the folly of lockdowns to masks to T- cell immunity, now this show has been out and front of all others in separating fact from fiction since last spring. And tonight, we bring you new developments on all of those issues that further validates our commentary. Plus, Leftist leaders from coast to coast are finding inventing new ways to destroy any holiday traditions, and Raymond Arroyo brings us an update in Seen and Unseen. But first, the tempting of AOC; that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  Now, shortly after she stunned House Democrats by beating long-time incumbent Queens Congressman Joe Crowley two years ago, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez was being written off by many Republicans as just a flash in the pan  - just a far left progressive who caught an old establishment Democrat offguard. But I saw things differently.  I think it's a mistake for conservatives not to take her seriously, to brush her off as kind of a flash in the plan or an upstart. She's as close to a thought leader that the Democratic Party has today and she has a massive social media following. She's both charismatic and she's committed to transforming both our economic system and our culture. And while her candidate Bernie Sanders didn't win the 2020 nomination, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has had enormous influence on her party. As a freshman Democrat, her coalition helped pull Joe Biden and her colleagues to the Left on key issues such as the Green New Deal, healthcare and impeachment.  And Democrats will do almost anything, albeit grudgingly, to avoid being primary-ed by her, one of her choices. She has presented herself as a strong voice for working-class Americans and a strong critic of multi- national corporations.",

Now remember, before the pandemic, blue-collar workers, middle-income and entry-level workers were all seeing real wage gains. Average median household income rose more than $6,000 after decades of wage stagnation.  A focus by President Trump on the American worker, protecting American manufacturing and holding China and other trade sheets accountable, that helped him grow his support among working-class Americans this election, including more Latinos, Black men and Asian-Americans.

They are already sharpening their knives to cut wages and ship jobs offshore. This raises a question - will AOC and the squad stand mute while American workers are crushed under this agenda? Or will they work with American populous to resist anti-worker policies?  Here are a few examples of where she could work with Republicans to block corporatist Dems. Number one, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Biden's handlers want him to jump back into this trade agreement that Trump nixed. Well, Trump was right; it's a job killer. Before the pandemic, we had the strongest economy in the G-7 and record-low unemployment, and we still do.  The last thing we need is a jobs killing trade deal. No matter what Biden's gurus claim, ruining lives of working people here will not give us more influence in Asia.

      "sentences": "Well, Hillary knew that working-class voters didn't want this deal because they knew it would mean lower wages for them and fewer jobs at home. There is great chance for AOC here and she should take it. By the way, National Review is also for the TPP - so, that should give her some solace.  Number two, enforce the USMCA. Now, AOC voted against it which was an unfortunate mistake - it was because of climate issues. But, she could still insist that its labor provisions at the very least are honored. So, we force more auto production here in the United States; that's good for American workers. Number three, continue to weaken the world trade organization. Ocasio- Cortez could insist that US trade policy be made here, by Americans and for Americans. After all she's a member of congress, so why would she want to give away congressional power over trade? She shouldn't.   Now number four, AOC could insist that the next US trade rep be a populous, or a corporatist. Heck, I know this seems bizarre or never going to happen, but she might even consider inviting Trump's USTR Ambassador Robert Lighthizer to lunch; he's brilliant. He knows all the tricks of multinational corporations and I think that actually both enjoy the exchange; no harm. And number five, she could work to accelerate efforts to decouple from China both economically and politically. Her caucus members support human rights and China is among the worst offenders in the world. Why should our free economy be open to their worker abusing companies?  And finally number six, she could form a coalition with key conservatives and some Democrats to urge that we bring our troops home finally from the Middle East. If progressives are truly anti-war, then they must not be silent. As a bipartisan establishment, urges - urging that we still sent troops overseas and stop troop withdrawals.  Now, all six of these steps would be popular with Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez's supporters on the Left. And if she doubts that, all she has to do is talk to unions like the steel workers and the UAW, or ask the young millennials, whether they think we should still be sending troops to Kandahar. I know what many of you were thinking though, this is all - common on, Laura, this is just all a pipedream, but I'm not sure. AOC has already shown a willingness on some issues to work with conservatives. She and Ted Cruz signed a letter; they kind of snipe on Twitter sometimes, but they signed a letter criticizing Apple for removing a pro-Hong Kong app, also slammed the NBA for putting its profits from China over free speech rights. They also want to work together to reign in lobbyists.   But look who is Biden's - look who is on Biden's transition team. According to the Wall Street Journal, atleast 40 people serving on President-Elect Joe Biden's transition team are or were once registered lobbyists.  Now, the establishment usually wins because the establishment has enough money to buy off candidates with fat donations and instant celebrity status. Now remember, Donald Trump didn't get the flattering magazine covers and neither did the First Lady despite her grace and beauty because neither agreed to play ball. Most people aren't strong enough to resist the temptation. But this is an old tactic by the elites. Remember back in 1998, Hillary got glamor shots in Vogue; then Huma Abedin, remember her, she was in Vogue in 2007. And of course, Susan Rice got her shot in 2013. It's always the same.  Play ball on the economic issues, don't interfere with globalization or maybe even help out with outsourcing, and we'll make you a star.  We'll give you the cultural power to beat up on conservatives, but when it comes to money and foreign policy, we expect you to go along with the global elites. So Hillary and Huma and Susan, they all thought probably they were going to help the working people too. But in the end, the rich got richer and China got stronger. And the working people, well, they turned to Donald Trump. So, it is going to be interesting to see AOC's next move. In the last few months, the establishment has shown her the carrot, the cover of Vanity Fair of course, and the stick leaks about how AOC is hurting the Democratic Party.  So if she goes along on the China and trade issue and helps the tech pros   The choice is hers and she'll have to make it soon. By working with the populous, she can really help working people. And for many folks, that's even better than being on the cover of Vogue or Vanity Fair, and that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Florida Congressman Michael Waltz. Congressman Waltz, you say that if Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez is serious about what she claims to stand for, the working people, there in fact are a number of issues that comport with America First, explain.",

I will work with anyone who will bring American manufacturing jobs back to the United States that fled in the '90s and the 2000s with the letting China enter the WTO and giving them these unfair trade deals, not only bring them back to the United States but reduce our dependency on China. We've seen in the wake of COVID that they will withhold PPE, they will withhold our pharmaceuticals, they will withhold raw materials, they will withhold all kinds of things to play this geopolitical game. And if AOC is serious, not only we will bring them back to the United States, let's bring them to the opportunity zones, let's bring them to underserved poor minority areas where we can set that manufacturing up.   The other thing big priority for, obviously for her and progressives, Laura, is the Green New Deal. Well, guess what's critical to their utopian vision of the Green New Deal; I don't agree with all of it, but battery storage is critical. Who controls 90 percent of the world's battery production and the raw materials, Lithium, Cobalt and other? China does. So, if - for a lot of their vision that they want - progressives want to see move forward, we can't have this dependency on China and we can't have the human rights abuses that come along with it, the labor abuses that come along with it. They are strip mining our oceans, they are dumping plastic - I mean, they are from environmental to human rights to manufacturing back at home, there are all kinds of things that we can and should be working on.

I think first of all, the items you laid out are very important, but let me add one to the list and that is AOC should work with us on opposing America's re- admittance into the Paris Accord. Because think about this, Laura, the Chinese Communist Party could not have drawn up a better plan to destroy the economies of Europe and America than the Paris Accord. First of all, there is not one country in Europe in compliance, and the exempt China till 2030. So, China literally gets to wreck economies in the United States and Europe, take those jobs.  And by the way, if you are concerned about carbon emissions, China emits five times more carbon from making the same stuff we make in America because we actually have good environmental standards. Plus what the Paris Accord would do to increase the cost of electricity for household families in America, which by the way hits the lowest-income people the hardest, it would destroy manufacturing jobs which are those blue collar jobs you talked about.  So, she should join us in standing up for workers, standing up for low-cost energy and opposing the Paris Accord.",

And if that race had turned out differently, a lot of folks in Kentucky would have a lot more freedom over the next few weeks. Beshear sold himself as a moderate Democrat. Democrat Andy Beshear whose father was a two-term Governor, ran a textbook campaign as a moderate, avoiding talk of impeachment or other hot- button issues that could polarize the electorate. But now, Kentuckians are learning that there is no such thing as a moderate Democrat; they all follow the same playbook. Now, for months THE INGRAHAM ANGLE has been ahead of the curve when it comes to COVID and the potential mitigation efforts that have followed. From the split science on masks to the damaging effect of lockdowns and their effectiveness on a populous and on this virus, we have challenged the consensus, and time and again we have been proven right. Now, that includes highlighting that the immunity to COVID doesn't hinge on antibodies alone but that other cells known as the killer T-cells also played a key role. For questioning the consensus, we were tarred and feathered, essentially, by the media medical cartel, but once again, our independent thinking has been vindicated. The New York Times reporting on a new study that found eight months after infection, most people who have recovered still have enough immune cells to fend off the virus and prevent illness. These cells, including T-cells, may persist in the body for a very, very long time to come.  Joining me now is Dr. William Grace, oncologist and hematologist, and Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter, author of \" Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 2\". Dr. Grace, this has been obvious for months, so why did it take the media and the medical establishment so long to catch up?",

And the good news, Laura, is that the new vaccines produce a greater immunity than the natural infection themselves, so there's a lot of great news here.",

This was done this spring in Denmark and it was done with the coronavirus. It was a very, very well- designed study. Frankly, if a drug company had a drug in trials that had this trial result, they would discontinue the drug. There is just no evidence that masks protect the wearer. We can discuss this other issue of source control. We can discuss my mask protects you. There's not very good evidence for that, but that's much harder to test in a big randomized trial.

He almost won it despite everything they threw at him, he almost won it this time, and he could win next time, especially if the Biden years, if he does all the things we expect them to do, which is to slow economic growth and to lock us down again and all the rest of it. But to do that, Trump has to leave the presidency the right way. So my plan for him is this in short form. One, cooperate with the Biden transition even while you're pursuing the legal challenges. It doesn't hurt to give him the presidential daily brief, that way he can't blame you for screwing it up if we get a terrorist attack after Trump leaves office. When Biden is finally declared the winner by the Electoral College, say you're stepping aside for the sake of the country, don't concede that the election was necessarily fair or that it was legitimate, but you're going to come and reclaim it in four years. Then immediately announce that you are running in 2024, before the inauguration. And then as the 2024 declared candidate, go and lead the Republican Party to keep control of the Senate in Georgia. We are not going to win that election unless Donald Trump does what he did in the closing days of the November election, by holding rallies and bringing on his base. Then he can leave with a big victory, and that will be the first salvo of the 2024 campaign. Then give a farewell address. One of the traditions in politics today is every president gives a farewell address. This will be a farewell address unlike anyone has ever done, because it's going to be MacArthur-esque. It's going to be \"I shall return.\" And then have a gracious transfer of power, invite Biden to the White House, ride with him to the capital, attend the inauguration, and then immediately start your campaign. Go and take back the House in 2022. We almost took back the House under Donald Trump's leadership in this election, and there are 26 seats up that the Democrats won by 52 percent or less. He could win -- in two year's time, he could knock Nancy Pelosi out of the Speaker position, then go win the White House in 2024.",

From the folly of lockdowns to masks to T- cell immunity, now this show has been out and front of all others in separating fact from fiction since last spring. And tonight, we bring you new developments on all of those issues that further validates our commentary. Plus, Leftist leaders from coast to coast are finding inventing new ways to destroy any holiday traditions, and Raymond Arroyo brings us an update in Seen and Unseen. But first, the tempting of AOC; that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now, shortly after she stunned House Democrats by beating long-time incumbent Queens Congressman Joe Crowley two years ago, Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez was being written off by many Republicans as just a flash in the pan - just a far left progressive who caught an old establishment Democrat offguard. But I saw things differently. I think it's a mistake for conservatives not to take her seriously, to brush her off as kind of a flash in the plan or an upstart. She's as close to a thought leader that the Democratic Party has today and she has a massive social media following. She's both charismatic and she's committed to transforming both our economic system and our culture. And while her candidate Bernie Sanders didn't win the 2020 nomination, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has had enormous influence on her party. As a freshman Democrat, her coalition helped pull Joe Biden and her colleagues to the Left on key issues such as the Green New Deal, healthcare and impeachment. And Democrats will do almost anything, albeit grudgingly, to avoid being primary-ed by her, one of her choices. She has presented herself as a strong voice for working-class Americans and a strong critic of multi- national corporations."

Now remember, before the pandemic, blue-collar workers, middle-income and entry-level workers were all seeing real wage gains. Average median household income rose more than $6,000 after decades of wage stagnation. A focus by President Trump on the American worker, protecting American manufacturing and holding China and other trade sheets accountable, that helped him grow his support among working-class Americans this election, including more Latinos, Black men and Asian-Americans. Now, those people did not have to like his tweets to love his results."

They are already sharpening their knives to cut wages and ship jobs offshore. This raises a question - will AOC and the squad stand mute while American workers are crushed under this agenda? Or will they work with American populous to resist anti-worker policies? Here are a few examples of where she could work with Republicans to block corporatist Dems. Number one, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Biden's handlers want him to jump back into this trade agreement that Trump nixed. Well, Trump was right; it's a job killer. Before the pandemic, we had the strongest economy in the G-7 and record-low unemployment, and we still do. The last thing we need is a jobs killing trade deal. No matter what Biden's gurus claim, ruining lives of working people here will not give us more influence in Asia.

      "utterance": "Well, Hillary knew that working-class voters didn't want this deal because they knew it would mean lower wages for them and fewer jobs at home. There is great chance for AOC here and she should take it. By the way, National Review is also for the TPP - so, that should give her some solace. Number two, enforce the USMCA. Now, AOC voted against it which was an unfortunate mistake - it was because of climate issues. But, she could still insist that its labor provisions at the very least are honored. So, we force more auto production here in the United States; that's good for American workers. Number three, continue to weaken the world trade organization. Ocasio- Cortez could insist that US trade policy be made here, by Americans and for Americans. After all she's a member of congress, so why would she want to give away congressional power over trade? She shouldn't. Now number four, AOC could insist that the next US trade rep be a populous, or a corporatist. Heck, I know this seems bizarre or never going to happen, but she might even consider inviting Trump's USTR Ambassador Robert Lighthizer to lunch; he's brilliant. He knows all the tricks of multinational corporations and I think that actually both enjoy the exchange; no harm. And number five, she could work to accelerate efforts to decouple from China both economically and politically. Her caucus members support human rights and China is among the worst offenders in the world. Why should our free economy be open to their worker abusing companies? And finally number six, she could form a coalition with key conservatives and some Democrats to urge that we bring our troops home finally from the Middle East. If progressives are truly anti-war, then they must not be silent. As a bipartisan establishment, urges - urging that we still sent troops overseas and stop troop withdrawals. Now, all six of these steps would be popular with Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez's supporters on the Left. And if she doubts that, all she has to do is talk to unions like the steel workers and the UAW, or ask the young millennials, whether they think we should still be sending troops to Kandahar. I know what many of you were thinking though, this is all - common on, Laura, this is just all a pipedream, but I'm not sure. AOC has already shown a willingness on some issues to work with conservatives. She and Ted Cruz signed a letter; they kind of snipe on Twitter sometimes, but they signed a letter criticizing Apple for removing a pro-Hong Kong app, also slammed the NBA for putting its profits from China over free speech rights. They also want to work together to reign in lobbyists. But look who is Biden's - look who is on Biden's transition team. According to the Wall Street Journal, atleast 40 people serving on President-Elect Joe Biden's transition team are or were once registered lobbyists. Now, the establishment usually wins because the establishment has enough money to buy off candidates with fat donations and instant celebrity status. Now remember, Donald Trump didn't get the flattering magazine covers and neither did the First Lady despite her grace and beauty because neither agreed to play ball. Most people aren't strong enough to resist the temptation. But this is an old tactic by the elites. Remember back in 1998, Hillary got glamor shots in Vogue; then Huma Abedin, remember her, she was in Vogue in 2007. And of course, Susan Rice got her shot in 2013. It's always the same. Play ball on the economic issues, don't interfere with globalization or maybe even help out with outsourcing, and we'll make you a star. We'll give you the cultural power to beat up on conservatives, but when it comes to money and foreign policy, we expect you to go along with the global elites. So Hillary and Huma and Susan, they all thought probably they were going to help the working people too. But in the end, the rich got richer and China got stronger. And the working people, well, they turned to Donald Trump. So, it is going to be interesting to see AOC's next move. In the last few months, the establishment has shown her the carrot, the cover of Vanity Fair of course, and the stick leaks about how AOC is hurting the Democratic Party. So if she goes along on the China and trade issue and helps the tech pros The choice is hers and she'll have to make it soon. By working with the populous, she can really help working people. And for many folks, that's even better than being on the cover of Vogue or Vanity Fair, and that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Florida Congressman Michael Waltz. Congressman Waltz, you say that if Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez is serious about what she claims to stand for, the working people, there in fact are a number of issues that comport with America First, explain."

I will work with anyone who will bring American manufacturing jobs back to the United States that fled in the '90s and the 2000s with the letting China enter the WTO and giving them these unfair trade deals, not only bring them back to the United States but reduce our dependency on China. We've seen in the wake of COVID that they will withhold PPE, they will withhold our pharmaceuticals, they will withhold raw materials, they will withhold all kinds of things to play this geopolitical game. And if AOC is serious, not only we will bring them back to the United States, let's bring them to the opportunity zones, let's bring them to underserved poor minority areas where we can set that manufacturing up. The other thing big priority for, obviously for her and progressives, Laura, is the Green New Deal. Well, guess what's critical to their utopian vision of the Green New Deal; I don't agree with all of it, but battery storage is critical. Who controls 90 percent of the world's battery production and the raw materials, Lithium, Cobalt and other? China does. So, if - for a lot of their vision that they want - progressives want to see move forward, we can't have this dependency on China and we can't have the human rights abuses that come along with it, the labor abuses that come along with it. They are strip mining our oceans, they are dumping plastic - I mean, they are from environmental to human rights to manufacturing back at home, there are all kinds of things that we can and should be working on.

Because think about this, Laura, the Chinese Communist Party could not have drawn up a better plan to destroy the economies of Europe and America than the Paris Accord. First of all, there is not one country in Europe in compliance, and the exempt China till 2030. So, China literally gets to wreck economies in the United States and Europe, take those jobs. And by the way, if you are concerned about carbon emissions, China emits five times more carbon from making the same stuff we make in America because we actually have good environmental standards. Plus what the Paris Accord would do to increase the cost of electricity for household families in America, which by the way hits the lowest-income people the hardest, it would destroy manufacturing jobs which are those blue collar jobs you talked about.

And if that race had turned out differently, a lot of folks in Kentucky would have a lot more freedom over the next few weeks. Beshear sold himself as a moderate Democrat. Democrat Andy Beshear whose father was a two-term Governor, ran a textbook campaign as a moderate, avoiding talk of impeachment or other hot- button issues that could polarize the electorate. But now, Kentuckians are learning that there is no such thing as a moderate Democrat; they all follow the same playbook. Now, for months THE INGRAHAM ANGLE has been ahead of the curve when it comes to COVID and the potential mitigation efforts that have followed. From the split science on masks to the damaging effect of lockdowns and their effectiveness on a populous and on this virus, we have challenged the consensus, and time and again we have been proven right. Now, that includes highlighting that the immunity to COVID doesn't hinge on antibodies alone but that other cells known as the killer T-cells also played a key role. For questioning the consensus, we were tarred and feathered, essentially, by the media medical cartel, but once again, our independent thinking has been vindicated. The New York Times reporting on a new study that found eight months after infection, most people who have recovered still have enough immune cells to fend off the virus and prevent illness. These cells, including T-cells, may persist in the body for a very, very long time to come. Joining me now is Dr. William Grace, oncologist and hematologist, and Alex Berenson, former New York Times reporter, author of \" Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 2\".

And the good news, Laura, is that the new vaccines produce a greater immunity than the natural infection themselves, so there's a lot of great news here."

I mean there wasn't much doubt about that before, there had been a very good meta- analysis done several months ago that was published on the CDC Journal that suggested that. But, this study was randomized. It had several thousand people, and it essentially showed that wearing masks does not protect the wearer at all from the coronavirus, not from the flu. This was done this spring in Denmark and it was done with the coronavirus. It was a very, very well- designed study. Frankly, if a drug company had a drug in trials that had this trial result, they would discontinue the drug. There is just no evidence that masks protect the wearer. We can discuss this other issue of source control. We can discuss my mask protects you. There's not very good evidence for that, but that's much harder to test in a big randomized trial. But the CDC said last week, masks may protect the wearer, and they should just stop saying that. There is no evidence for that. They need to stop."

In the hospital we wear N95 masks and face protection because we're in an environment taking care of COVID patients where the virus is very active and very concentrated. But when you get out into the public, people where neckwear and fashionable masks, and these have been shown to be less than one-100th as effective as the N95 masks. The N95 masks is not something you can wear all day. It's awful thing to have to wear, but we put up with it because of the risks.

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump is the first president in 132 years who has a realistic chance of coming back and reclaiming the White House after losing it four years earlier. The last president to do it was Grover Cleveland in 1888. That's how long it has been. When George H. W. Bush left office, when Jimmy Carter left office after one term, their political careers were finished. Donald Trump is still a very strong political force. So if he wants the Republican nomination in 2024, it's his to have, and I think he could win. But to do it, he has to leave the presidency. How he leaves the presidency is very important. There is a large segment of voters in this country who like Donald Trump's policies, think they're better off now than they were four years ago, but didn't vote for him because they were just tired of the chaos, and that chaos is not necessarily all Donald Trump's fault, but they were just tired of it. And so he has got to win those voters over if he wants to win his next term, so how he leaves is very important."

      "utterance": "-- 72 million people that he can take the presidency. He almost won it despite everything they threw at him, he almost won it this time, and he could win next time, especially if the Biden years, if he does all the things we expect them to do, which is to slow economic growth and to lock us down again and all the rest of it. But to do that, Trump has to leave the presidency the right way. So my plan for him is this in short form. One, cooperate with the Biden transition even while you're pursuing the legal challenges. It doesn't hurt to give him the presidential daily brief, that way he can't blame you for screwing it up if we get a terrorist attack after Trump leaves office. When Biden is finally declared the winner by the Electoral College, say you're stepping aside for the sake of the country, don't concede that the election was necessarily fair or that it was legitimate, but you're going to come and reclaim it in four years. Then immediately announce that you are running in 2024, before the inauguration. And then as the 2024 declared candidate, go and lead the Republican Party to keep control of the Senate in Georgia. We are not going to win that election unless Donald Trump does what he did in the closing days of the November election, by holding rallies and bringing on his base. Then he can leave with a big victory, and that will be the first salvo of the 2024 campaign. Then give a farewell address. One of the traditions in politics today is every president gives a farewell address. This will be a farewell address unlike anyone has ever done, because it's going to be MacArthur-esque. It's going to be \"I shall return.\" And then have a gracious transfer of power, invite Biden to the White House, ride with him to the capital, attend the inauguration, and then immediately start your campaign. Go and take back the House in 2022. We almost took back the House under Donald Trump's leadership in this election, and there are 26 seats up that the Democrats won by 52 percent or less. He could win -- in two year's time, he could knock Nancy Pelosi out of the Speaker position, then go win the White House in 2024."
