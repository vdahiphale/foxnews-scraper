      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". All right. Trump supporters beware. The midterm elections are now fast approaching. Many on the left are now ramping up the insane rhetoric pushing identity politics, demonizing ideological differences because to them, if you support President Trump -- well, it's not just a political choice, it's a mortal sin for which there is no forgiveness, ever.  Now, in a moment, we're going to show you how our own Judge Jeanine Pirro was literally shouted down face-to-face by some of the Trump-hating ladies of \"The View.\" And she will give us the ugly behind-the-scenes story.  Plus, we have the latest, absurd, shark-jumping, psychotic rhetoric from the left, their never-ending obsession with Russia.  And meanwhile, the president, the administration now facing many complex issues all around the world. And today, the FBI director, Wray, he warned that China, not Russia, was the single most significant threat to the United States. Now, tonight, we'll do something the mainstream media won't do, we'll show you how the president is actually countering China with a policy of peace through his strength.  Now, we also have tonight a shocking story out of the state of California. The sanctuary city of San Francisco is now allowing illegal immigrants to vote in elections. I didn't make that up. We have an important new report on deep state actor Peter Strzok from John Solomon.  All of that, plus the president said he will be Putin's worst enemy if their relationship does not work out and that Obama was a patsy for Putin.   Buckle up, it's time for tonight's breaking news multi-pronged opening monologue.",

According to the left, if you support Donald Trump or have conservative opinions, you're no longer a decent human being.   Instead -- well, according to them, you're a xenophobic, Islamophobic, homophobic, racist, sexist, misogynist, you want dirty air, you want dirty water. You'd definitely want to take grandma and throw her right over the cliff. And, by the way, you want children to die. Oh, and by the way, we are the smelly Walmart shoppers, the irredeemable deplorables. We're the people that cling to our god, our guns, our bibles and religion. Now, this is especially true during the age of Trump. Now, we've seen the president's allies kicked out of restaurants, shouted down on the street, harassed in front of their own homes' front yards and the most vicious attacks even against women and even against the president's children and grandchildren. So, it's no surprise that our own Judge Jeanine Pirro wasn't warmly welcomed during her guest appearance on \"The View\" on ABC. By the way, Disney, are you proud of this? Take a look.",

Now, the president's meeting with Vladimir Putin has been compared, let's see, to the Holocaust, Pearl Harbor, 9/11 and the rhetoric has been absolutely psychotic!   Front page of \"The New Yorker\", look at this, featuring a cartoon showing a dead President Trump face down at the bottom of an escalator. Great, his kids have to see that. His grandkids have to see that.  And \"Time\" magazine featuring this ominous looking Putin-Trump hybrid. And, by the way on TV, over -- just the past 24 hours alone -- not the earlier 48 hours -- the anti-Trump hysteria is even worse. They're all in a state of panic. The economy is doing well.

He authorized a counterattack as Putin was backing soldiers inside of Syria, killing hundreds of Russians. And, remember, Russia's -- remember the hostile takeover in Crimea and Ukraine? Well, Putin's power grab in Syria, and all of this election meddling you're hearing so much about, it all happened on Obama's watch. He was the president. Just like giving Putin 20 percent of America's uranium, that was on Obama's watch.   So, the foundational material for nuclear weapons was given to Putin and Russia, the bad actor, the hostile regime, while Obama was president. Nobody in the media mentioned this all week. Now, you think you'll hear about this if you turn on conspiracy TV MSNBC? Fake news CNN? I tend to doubt it.  So, today, President Trump once again, he reiterated his commitment to countering Putin.

We'll have more on the president and the president's geopolitical peace through strength strategy throughout the show tonight. But, first, we got to turn to a very shocking story. It should make your blood boil.  You know the sanctuary city of San Francisco? They're now spitting in the face of every single law-abiding American tonight. City officials are now permitting illegal immigrants, other noncitizens to register to vote in November's election. That's right. You can literally -- you can't make this up. They're allowing this. Barring any future legal action, illegal immigrants will now be among those in San Francisco who get to vote in certain local elections.  Now this is just one more obvious sign that the left in this country, they don't care about the rule of law, our Constitution, about the rights of the many. They don't believe in borders. They have no agenda to improve America. Instead, they want to regain power at all costs. Well, for 2018, it's simple. They want their crumbs back. They want to rescind the tax cuts. They want to impeach Trump, but they're trying to tell everybody not to say it publicly. They want to preserve Obama's legacy, keep your doctor plan and pay less -- they want Obamacare to stay. They want to block the president's Supreme Court choices and the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh and, that's right, you can see that they want open borders also. They're not proposing one thing that will solve any problem for any American citizen. It's without a doubt the most important midterm election in our lifetime. The future of this country is at stake! They want to undo the 2016 election. And finally tonight, we do have a breaking news story from John Solomon. He's highlighting an underreported text from the corrupt FBI investigator Peter Strzok to his girlfriend Lisa Page. Now, the text reads, an investigation leading to impeachment? You and I both know the odds are nothing. And Strzok goes on and he says, quote, there's no big there there. Now, the timing of this text is incredibly telling. It's just two days after Robert Mueller was appointed to conduct this witch-hunt on Trump/Russia collusion. And according to Solomon, while Peter Strzok refused to answer what this text was referring to, Lisa Page behind closed doors did in fact confirm that the text referred to quality of the Russia case that he was leading. So, there's no big there there and there never was and here we are 428 days later, millions of dollars later. This never-ending divide and fishing expedition rolls on.  Show us the evidence, Mr. Mueller, you know and your pit bull Andrew Weissmann. Why'd you ever appoint a guy that had that much corruption in his background? Really? Withholding exculpatory evidence, beaten 9-0 in the Supreme Court, sending innocent people to jail for a year, overturned by the Fifth Circuit, tens of thousands of Americans lost their jobs. He's your number one guy? Really? And then you can't find a single Republican to put on your team? Not one? Just a married band of Hillary supporters and Democratic donors. All right. Here with more from The Hill is John Solomon. John, big story.",

And what's happened over the last couple of weeks is Congress has gone back and reassembled the evidence and looked back. One of the questions they're trying to answer is there actions that were taken that clearly could be attributed to political bias or political influence. And this discussion that you just highlighted has become very important. They have now confirmed, they put all the text messages and e- mails in that period of mid-May and they see a discussion going on between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page in which they're debating. Should we send the FBI and go punch our ticket up the elevator to the assistant director or should we go over and try to get President Trump impeached at the special counsel level? And they get into this discussion and at some point, they actually say, maybe we should stop this discussion. But they keep going any ways. And that famous statement is uttered. There's no there. We don't need to go over there because there's no there there. I mean, there's not going to be a big crime found there.

I think the most important thing going on let's take a look at the five things we now know they did that defy their training. They accepted circular intelligence. They knew everything was coming 48 Hillary-funded dossier. But it made it look like it was coming from multiple sources. Two weeks before the election, they had to hurry the F-up pressure, remember? Trying to force through a warrant on the Trump campaign before the election is over. The day after the election, they get -- make an all- call, we need all derogatory reports on the Trump campaign. Let's start collecting them -- the day after he's elected.  And then you get to this point in May where they're about to turn the case and over allowing the Justice Department to appoint the special prosecutor, encouraging it. And they kind of know it's flimsy evidence. All of the things suggest that they aren't going by their normal training, their normal behavior as counterintelligence agents.

Plus, we have the latest, absurd, shark-jumping, psychotic rhetoric from the left, their never-ending obsession with Russia. And meanwhile, the president, the administration now facing many complex issues all around the world. And today, the FBI director, Wray, he warned that China, not Russia, was the single most significant threat to the United States. Now, tonight, we'll do something the mainstream media won't do, we'll show you how the president is actually countering China with a policy of peace through his strength. Now, we also have tonight a shocking story out of the state of California. The sanctuary city of San Francisco is now allowing illegal immigrants to vote in elections. I didn't make that up. We have an important new report on deep state actor Peter Strzok from John Solomon. All of that, plus the president said he will be Putin's worst enemy if their relationship does not work out and that Obama was a patsy for Putin.

He authorized a counterattack as Putin was backing soldiers inside of Syria, killing hundreds of Russians. And, remember, Russia's -- remember the hostile takeover in Crimea and Ukraine? Well, Putin's power grab in Syria, and all of this election meddling you're hearing so much about, it all happened on Obama's watch. He was the president. Just like giving Putin 20 percent of America's uranium, that was on Obama's watch. So, the foundational material for nuclear weapons was given to Putin and Russia, the bad actor, the hostile regime, while Obama was president. Nobody in the media mentioned this all week. Now, you think you'll hear about this if you turn on conspiracy TV MSNBC? Fake news CNN? I tend to doubt it. So, today, President Trump once again, he reiterated his commitment to countering Putin.

We'll have more on the president and the president's geopolitical peace through strength strategy throughout the show tonight. But, first, we got to turn to a very shocking story. It should make your blood boil. You know the sanctuary city of San Francisco? They're now spitting in the face of every single law-abiding American tonight. City officials are now permitting illegal immigrants, other noncitizens to register to vote in November's election. That's right. You can literally -- you can't make this up. They're allowing this. Barring any future legal action, illegal immigrants will now be among those in San Francisco who get to vote in certain local elections. Now this is just one more obvious sign that the left in this country, they don't care about the rule of law, our Constitution, about the rights of the many. They don't believe in borders. They have no agenda to improve America. Instead, they want to regain power at all costs. Well, for 2018, it's simple. They want their crumbs back. They want to rescind the tax cuts. They want to impeach Trump, but they're trying to tell everybody not to say it publicly. They want to preserve Obama's legacy, keep your doctor plan and pay less -- they want Obamacare to stay. They want to block the president's Supreme Court choices and the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh and, that's right, you can see that they want open borders also. They're not proposing one thing that will solve any problem for any American citizen. It's without a doubt the most important midterm election in our lifetime. The future of this country is at stake! They want to undo the 2016 election. And finally tonight, we do have a breaking news story from John Solomon. He's highlighting an underreported text from the corrupt FBI investigator Peter Strzok to his girlfriend Lisa Page. Now, the text reads, an investigation leading to impeachment? You and I both know the odds are nothing. And Strzok goes on and he says, quote, there's no big there there. Now, the timing of this text is incredibly telling. It's just two days after Robert Mueller was appointed to conduct this witch-hunt on Trump/Russia collusion. And according to Solomon, while Peter Strzok refused to answer what this text was referring to, Lisa Page behind closed doors did in fact confirm that the text referred to quality of the Russia case that he was leading. So, there's no big there there and there never was and here we are 428 days later, millions of dollars later. This never-ending divide and fishing expedition rolls on. Show us the evidence, Mr. Mueller, you know and your pit bull Andrew Weissmann. Why'd you ever appoint a guy that had that much corruption in his background? Really?

      "utterance": "Yes, Sean, I think what's important here is that, you know, the evidence in this case has been produced episodically to Congress. You get a paper blazered and you get a single witness and you get a few documents they forgot to give you and then an another witness. And what's happened over the last couple of weeks is Congress has gone back and reassembled the evidence and looked back. One of the questions they're trying to answer is there actions that were taken that clearly could be attributed to political bias or political influence. And this discussion that you just highlighted has become very important. They have now confirmed, they put all the text messages and e- mails in that period of mid-May and they see a discussion going on between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page in which they're debating. Should we send the FBI and go punch our ticket up the elevator to the assistant director or should we go over and try to get President Trump impeached at the special counsel level? And they get into this discussion and at some point, they actually say, maybe we should stop this discussion. But they keep going any ways. And that famous statement is uttered. There's no there. We don't need to go over there because there's no there there. I mean, there's not going to be a big crime found there. I think that that's essential because it's one of five sort of things that they did that defy the normal investigative work they do."

So, Lisa Page, and this didn't get so much news because the media only focuses on one story at a time, and it's a story they have focused on for two years with no evidence and my question is, so Lisa Strzok is contradicting what -- I'm sorry, Lisa Page is contradicting what Peter Strzok said under oath. And that would mean he lied under oath if she's telling us --"

She's just giving a factual statement. Yes, we were talking about Russia there. Yes, we were talking about special counsel. So, you now know for sure, that's what they were talking about. I think the most important thing going on let's take a look at the five things we now know they did that defy their training. They accepted circular intelligence. They knew everything was coming 48 Hillary-funded dossier. But it made it look like it was coming from multiple sources. Two weeks before the election, they had to hurry the F-up pressure, remember? Trying to force through a warrant on the Trump campaign before the election is over. The day after the election, they get -- make an all- call, we need all derogatory reports on the Trump campaign. Let's start collecting them -- the day after he's elected. And then you get to this point in May where they're about to turn the case and over allowing the Justice Department to appoint the special prosecutor, encouraging it. And they kind of know it's flimsy evidence. All of the things suggest that they aren't going by their normal training, their normal behavior as counterintelligence agents. And that's why the question, of political bias is going to get answered soon."

And that's 20 percent of American uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. The interference of the meddling of the 2016 election, that happened under Obama. Crimea happened under Obama. Ukraine happened under Obama. And the Syria red line was crossed also under Obama. How come the media didn't care about any of this? MICHELLE MALKIN, CRTV \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\" HOST: Because they suffer from selective sovereignty syndrome. They only care about foreign meddling and foreign conflicts when there's a president with an \"R\" by his name and especially when that \"R\" comes in the word Trump, T-R-U-M-P. And you can go all the way back to the Clinton years and China-gate and the dangerous national security implications of all of the campaign contributions that were coming in from shady characters all the way back then. And who was it that was sounding the alarm about all of those scandals? Well, it wasn't the New York slimes and it wasn't the Washington compost, they were too busy printing all of the condemnations from people blowing the whistle on it, and referring to them as xenophobic and racist, which is what you talked about in your monologue. This is the classic left wing playbook of attacking the messenger. And it's a huge cloud, smoke and mirrors, to distract from the fact these people are absolutely treasonous hypocrites.

But it was in the second segment that you just played where I literally was thrown off the set. Whoopi Goldberg basically said I'm done, she pulled the plug off and walked away. But it didn't end there, Sean. And I think the sad part about all this is that, you know, I said in the first segment, we need to start talking to each other. We need to start having a conversation, people who ostensibly hate each other. And the irony is I said that two minutes before she started. And I just felt that today was a microcosm of what is happening in America as the left suffers from this Trump derangement syndrome, shuts the right down, doesn't allow you to talk. She asked me a question and then yells at me, yells about Donald Trump, and yells about -- and when I tried to answer, she continued to yell. But it didn't end there, Sean. What happens was, I realized the segment was over. I got up and I just started -- I left the stage, going downstairs.

You know, look, you live this every day for a while. I told you at the time, I don't know why you do that job. I think Sarah Sanders I said the same thing to her, and I did see her briefly in Helsinki. One particular case, all of the meddling and interference happened under Obama. Uranium One happened under Obama, Crimea and Ukraine happened under Obama, the Syria red line happened under Obama, and I'm looking at this, I'm like, they've lost all sense of any objectivity.

They thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election, they were wrong, and now they refuse to give President Trump the credit he deserves in each of the areas, whether it's the economic policy, foreign policy, what have you. No matter how much good the president does, no matter how he reshapes the judiciary, deregulates the regulatory states, it's never good enough, and there's always a problem. I talk about this extensively in the book. How we face that headwind on every single issue. No matter what we did and it started throughout the campaign, it started on day one. It was literally the press trying to delegitimize the president, to find a way to go into that Oval Office and say, there's something wrong. They falsely accused the president of taking the bust out of the Oval Office of Martin Luther King. I mean, and that's -- throughout my entire book, part of the reason that I wanted to write this book, Sean, was to make people understand the headwinds that we faced every day in terms of this administration and this president."

They come at you with everything they have, and the more successful that you maybe may had -- the more success that you may have, the stronger they are going come at you. And that's -- you've seen that time and time again. No matter what we've done on the conservative side, they are going to come after us in general. This president, I think every one of the studies, whether it's Harvard, pew, the Media Research Center, every single one of them, the preponderance of coverage is highly negative.
