      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is “The Ingraham Angle” with a full accounting of what you just saw on night one of the Democratic National Convention. Now tonight, you're going to get exclusive reaction from Eric Trump, Senator Ted Cruz, Victor Davis Hanson, Sara Carter, Raymond Arroyo, Dinesh D'Souza, and more.  Now, the Democrats build tonight as a program to promote unity. But we're going to show you, and you're not going to see this anywhere else, that this was nothing but a series of bromides and cliches and it turned out to be an empty buzzword.  Now, to discuss racial equality, they trotted out Mayor Muriel Bowser, who cares more about a BLM mural in her city than the fact that homicides are up in her majority black city nearly 20 percent over last year.  Now, to discuss COVID, they brought on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York. Now, he oversaw some of the highest death tolls in the nation. And his nursing home policy was a lone responsible for the deaths of more than 10,000 New Yorkers. To discuss how Democrats are the party of the working man, they tried it out Bernie Sanders to rail against Wall Street and corporate interests? This on the night that they filled their program with lobbyists. And on a day that it was just revealed that they're getting more money from Wall Street, this cycle, than they have in a decade. I wonder why, China. Sorry.  And as you can see, it was a more of a night of contradictions, of course, than unity. And we'll bring you more of this throughout the hour. But first, here to weigh in on the first night of the DNC, Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor for strategy. And Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor, DNC chair and longtime Biden friend.  All right, gentlemen, I want to give everyone a taste of how Democrats tried to woo Middle America tonight.",

You know, I was down there on East Lake Street that was flattened by the riots at the end of May, and then all over the state. And I'm thinking, how does this play to the average Minnesotan? All right. I was flabbergasted at the very negative and depressing presentation tonight. And at times, even the first lady who, of course, gave a great speech because she's a -- she's a very powerful speaker. I'm - - never take that away from her and she's a global celebrity, but is this really connecting with that Middle American voter who still believes that, you know, pre-COVID life should be attainable?  STEVE CORTES, DONALD TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGY: Right. No, it certainly will not connect. It was clear that this was for a crowd in Brooklyn, New York, rather than in places like Beloit, Wisconsin, this was catering to Hollywood, rather than the Heartland. And it was not a celebration of America, it was an indictment of America. And I will tell you as a proud American, I didn't even recognize the country that they were describing in this -- in this ridiculous long commercial that they put on tonight. They were describing some sort of dystopian, racist hellscape.  And I would give you just as a couple points to push back against that, number one, this is the greatest country on Earth in which to be a racial or ethnic minority, and I say that as an Hispanic.  I would also tell you this, if we were the country that the Democrats described tonight, why would tens, if not hundreds of millions of people around the world who are definitively not white skinned? Why would they so yearn to come to this country? They must be fools, according to the Democratic Party to want to come to a country that is systemically racist as the Democrats are trying to get us to believe.",

One, to have Senator Sanders persuade his supporters -- well, all of his supporters to vote for Joe Biden, and I think he did a good job achieving that goal.  Secondly, to get people like two former Republican presidential candidates, John Kasich and Meg Whitman, to endorse Joe Biden, to get one of the greatest governors in the history of this country, Christine Todd Whitman, to endorse Joe Biden, to give suburban women and suburban men the comfort level of switching and voting Democrat for this election, and I think they accomplished that in a big way.  And then thirdly, to have Michelle Obama fire up the base, and she did an absolutely spectacular job. So you can coral with the content of this one night, but take the convention as a four-night story and see if there's more of need on subsequent proposals as we go on, but those were the three things we have to accomplish.

And he is right, the positions that just as recently as a few years ago, were considered extremist and fringe leftist radical views are now considered orthodoxy and really unassailable within the Democratic Party.  And to be specific, what do I mean? Things like effectively open borders, they don't use that phrase, of course. But if you decriminalize border crossing, if you offer generous benefits to illegal aliens who don't belong in this country, and Joe Biden has promised, and even more than that full citizenship in this country, to reward them for breaking and entering into our land, these kinds of policies are now unfortunately within the Democratic Party, the norm, but they are not mainstream policies within America. And therein lies the rub. And that's it's our job on the Trump campaign to make sure that we effectively communicate just how radical the 2020 Biden- Harris Democratic Party is.  And again, I think that -- they did us a favor tonight, by showcasing their cynicism, their skepticism of this country.

So, I mean, John Kasich and Meg Whitman, what is their constituency in the United States of America? I mean, God bless them. I guess they're nice people.

Well, that -- you persuade two thirds of that 10 percent, there goes Michigan, there goes Wisconsin, there goes Pennsylvania. So, you can minimize in an election that will probably be as close as 16 was percentages so the small percentages can make the difference. And that's who they're talking to.

I just -- forgive me, but I do not understand the idea that he is persuasive. I don't think he changes one vote. I mean that's just my view about John Kasich. But you're right, it's going to be a close election, it's going to be a close election. Gentlemen, thank you. And, Ed, it was great to see you as always. All right. In praise of Joe Biden's accomplishments and talents in tonight's DNC, well, in the speeches, it seemed a little bit forced, a little bit consider this. A new NBC Wall Street Journal poll found that 58 percent of Biden's supporters said they're not voting for the former VP, as much as they're voting against Trump.   In fact, only 36 percent of them said they're casting their vote for Biden, a number that's a lot lower than the 49 percent who said they were voting for Hillary Clinton, ahead of the 2016 election. Well, what does that mean for this election? And how is the Trump team responding? Joining me now exclusively is Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization.   Eric, the speeches didn't seem like they were in support of Joe so much as really, they hate your dad, and they think your dad is not empathetic. He doesn't care. He doesn't hug. He doesn't ride Amtrak. I mean, it kind of all that combined. But what was your takeaway from just that aspect of it?",

I mean, how about talking about, you know, after the Democrats signed NAFTA, that we lost 70,000 factories in this country, and our jobs all went overseas.  I mean, why don't they ever talk about that? Why don't they talk about the $150 billion that Joe Biden gave Iran they told he build weapons to use against our country? What about, you know, Michelle Obama comes out and he's the one to rebuild this economy? Well, under Biden-Obama, the Dow Jones went up 4,000 points in eight years, yet, under my father and three and a half years, the Dow Jones has gone up 12,000 points.  I mean, he's not the guy to rebuild the economy. I mean, they had 0.9 percent GDP growth under certain years in the Obama administration under Obama. They don't know the first thing. Joe Biden can't spell the economy, so it's all these little fluffy messages.

Our military was rundown, our educational system was broken. We weren't growing, our economy was an absolute mess. Illegal immigration in this country was absolutely rampant. We're being used and abused by China. We're being used and abused by Mexico; we're being ripped off by the entire world. NATO was taking us to the absolute bank, the European Union was -- I won't even tell you what they're -- you know, they were doing to us.

You can only be one or the other. My father either did a phenomenal job for New York or he didn't, you can't just change your mind midstream.

They want to enable what they've done in California what's called voter harvesting. You know, in Texas, we have, we have tough rules to protect against voter fraud in Texas and some of the history of them. They were actually adopted by democratic legislators in Texas, because there was a long history in South Texas, of voter fraud in democratic primaries were unscrupulous political operatives.  For example, they'd go to a nursing home, they go to each person and say, here, fill out your ballot here and here, honey, let me help you. Just check Joe Biden right here, fill in that dot, and they collect them all. And then magically, all the Joe Biden ones get mailed and you know, if someone was stubborn enough to vote Trump, well, they just kind of happened to throw that ballot in the mail and the Democrats in the trash rather the Democrats, they want to be able to enable voter fraud.

Now tonight, you're going to get exclusive reaction from Eric Trump, Senator Ted Cruz, Victor Davis Hanson, Sara Carter, Raymond Arroyo, Dinesh D'Souza, and more. Now, the Democrats build tonight as a program to promote unity. But we're going to show you, and you're not going to see this anywhere else, that this was nothing but a series of bromides and cliches and it turned out to be an empty buzzword. Now, to discuss racial equality, they trotted out Mayor Muriel Bowser, who cares more about a BLM mural in her city than the fact that homicides are up in her majority black city nearly 20 percent over last year. Now, to discuss COVID, they brought on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York. Now, he oversaw some of the highest death tolls in the nation. And his nursing home policy was a lone responsible for the deaths of more than 10,000 New Yorkers. To discuss how Democrats are the party of the working man, they tried it out Bernie Sanders to rail against Wall Street and corporate interests? This on the night that they filled their program with lobbyists. And on a day that it was just revealed that they're getting more money from Wall Street, this cycle, than they have in a decade. I wonder why, China. Sorry. And as you can see, it was a more of a night of contradictions, of course, than unity. And we'll bring you more of this throughout the hour. But first, here to weigh in on the first night of the DNC, Steve Cortes, Trump 2020 campaign senior advisor for strategy. And Ed Rendell, former Pennsylvania governor, DNC chair and longtime Biden friend. All right, gentlemen, I want to give everyone a taste of how Democrats tried to woo Middle America tonight."

All right. I was flabbergasted at the very negative and depressing presentation tonight. And at times, even the first lady who, of course, gave a great speech because she's a -- she's a very powerful speaker. I'm - - never take that away from her and she's a global celebrity, but is this really connecting with that Middle American voter who still believes that, you know, pre-COVID life should be attainable? STEVE CORTES, DONALD TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISOR FOR STRATEGY: Right. No, it certainly will not connect. It was clear that this was for a crowd in Brooklyn, New York, rather than in places like Beloit, Wisconsin, this was catering to Hollywood, rather than the Heartland. And it was not a celebration of America, it was an indictment of America. And I will tell you as a proud American, I didn't even recognize the country that they were describing in this -- in this ridiculous long commercial that they put on tonight. They were describing some sort of dystopian, racist hellscape. And I would give you just as a couple points to push back against that, number one, this is the greatest country on Earth in which to be a racial or ethnic minority, and I say that as an Hispanic. I would also tell you this, if we were the country that the Democrats described tonight, why would tens, if not hundreds of millions of people around the world who are definitively not white skinned? Why would they so yearn to come to this country? They must be fools, according to the Democratic Party to want to come to a country that is systemically racist as the Democrats are trying to get us to believe."

You'll hear a lot more about specific economic proposals as the week goes on. This can get -- this night had three purposes. One, to have Senator Sanders persuade his supporters -- well, all of his supporters to vote for Joe Biden, and I think he did a good job achieving that goal. Secondly, to get people like two former Republican presidential candidates, John Kasich and Meg Whitman, to endorse Joe Biden, to get one of the greatest governors in the history of this country, Christine Todd Whitman, to endorse Joe Biden, to give suburban women and suburban men the comfort level of switching and voting Democrat for this election, and I think they accomplished that in a big way. And then thirdly, to have Michelle Obama fire up the base, and she did an absolutely spectacular job. So you can coral with the content of this one night, but take the convention as a four-night story and see if there's more of need on subsequent proposals as we go on, but those were the three things we have to accomplish. Right? And we accomplished them big time."

      "utterance": "No, Laura, you're exactly right. This is not your parents' or your grandparents' Democratic Party. And he is right, the positions that just as recently as a few years ago, were considered extremist and fringe leftist radical views are now considered orthodoxy and really unassailable within the Democratic Party. And to be specific, what do I mean? Things like effectively open borders, they don't use that phrase, of course. But if you decriminalize border crossing, if you offer generous benefits to illegal aliens who don't belong in this country, and Joe Biden has promised, and even more than that full citizenship in this country, to reward them for breaking and entering into our land, these kinds of policies are now unfortunately within the Democratic Party, the norm, but they are not mainstream policies within America. And therein lies the rub. And that's it's our job on the Trump campaign to make sure that we effectively communicate just how radical the 2020 Biden- Harris Democratic Party is. And again, I think that -- they did us a favor tonight, by showcasing their cynicism, their skepticism of this country. Again, this was an indictment that we saw tonight and also the people they put forward. OK."

Let's move on from that point, though, because I want to just -- for a moment, Ed, touch back to Kasich and Meg Whitman and Christine Todd Whitman, just for a moment, because I'm thinking the last, even CNN poll, 91 percent of Republicans, and I think another poll show that 95 percent of Republicans, 96 even on one poll, supported the president of Republicans. So, I mean, John Kasich and Meg Whitman, what is their constituency in the United States of America? I mean, God bless them. I guess they're nice people. But that that to me, is just a waste of airtime. I don't see how that gives comfort to anyone that Joe Biden is going to have the plan for magically stopping COVID other than shutting down the whole country through, I don't know, next year."

And they're still Republicans in the Philadelphia suburbs. For example, in the Cleveland suburbs, there are still registered Republicans who, you know, you say nine percent, percent. Well, that -- you persuade two thirds of that 10 percent, there goes Michigan, there goes Wisconsin, there goes Pennsylvania. So, you can minimize in an election that will probably be as close as 16 was percentages so the small percentages can make the difference. And that's who they're talking to. That's pretty shocking when you have two presidential candidates from not way in the past, but from four years ago..."

I just -- forgive me, but I do not understand the idea that he is persuasive. I don't think he changes one vote. I mean that's just my view about John Kasich. But you're right, it's going to be a close election, it's going to be a close election. Gentlemen, thank you. And, Ed, it was great to see you as always. All right. In praise of Joe Biden's accomplishments and talents in tonight's DNC, well, in the speeches, it seemed a little bit forced, a little bit consider this. A new NBC Wall Street Journal poll found that 58 percent of Biden's supporters said they're not voting for the former VP, as much as they're voting against Trump. In fact, only 36 percent of them said they're casting their vote for Biden, a number that's a lot lower than the 49 percent who said they were voting for Hillary Clinton, ahead of the 2016 election. Well, what does that mean for this election? And how is the Trump team responding? Joining me now exclusively is Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization. Eric, the speeches didn't seem like they were in support of Joe so much as really, they hate your dad, and they think your dad is not empathetic. He doesn't care. He doesn't hug. He doesn't ride Amtrak. I mean, it kind of all that combined. But what was your takeaway from just that aspect of it?"

I mean, here they are saying we'd like to heal the soul of our nation, yet., Kamala Harris is going out there and effectively comparing ICE agents to KKK. I mean, there's no specificity to anything. I mean, how about talking about, you know, after the Democrats signed NAFTA, that we lost 70,000 factories in this country, and our jobs all went overseas. I mean, why don't they ever talk about that? Why don't they talk about the $150 billion that Joe Biden gave Iran they told he build weapons to use against our country? What about, you know, Michelle Obama comes out and he's the one to rebuild this economy? Well, under Biden-Obama, the Dow Jones went up 4,000 points in eight years, yet, under my father and three and a half years, the Dow Jones has gone up 12,000 points. I mean, he's not the guy to rebuild the economy. I mean, they had 0.9 percent GDP growth under certain years in the Obama administration under Obama. They don't know the first thing. Joe Biden can't spell the economy, so it's all these little fluffy messages. I think he said, you know, best with Kasich before, I mean, washed up Republicans that got zero percent of the vote back in 2016 that, quite frankly, are still bitter that my father beat them so badly, but there is no specificity or anything. Our military was rundown, our educational system was broken. We weren't growing, our economy was an absolute mess. Illegal immigration in this country was absolutely rampant. We're being used and abused by China. We're being used and abused by Mexico; we're being ripped off by the entire world. NATO was taking us to the absolute bank, the European Union was -- I won't even tell you what they're -- you know, they were doing to us. I mean, I could go on and on, Laura, and there was none of that -- it's, you know, he's not a nice guy, and, you know, the soul of our nation is quote unquote, broken. Yet, there's sparking divisiveness every single day. They're painting Black Lives Matter in front of Trump Tower in big yellow letters every single day while shootings are going on in the streets of New York and Chicago, and Minneapolis and Seattle, in Portland."

You can only be one or the other. My father either did a phenomenal job for New York or he didn't, you can't just change your mind midstream. And the reason, quite frankly, Cuomo is, is because he killed 11,000 people in nursing homes based on his horrible, horrible policies. And so, we have to shift the blame to somebody else and it's tragic. My mother has done a greater job in the last three and a half years in any present history. The way he turned around the country, the way he turned around the military, the way he turned around immigration, the way we're no longer being used by every country around the world.

Well, taken together, those states have lost 29,219 people, it's very tragic. But that's the death rate four times lower than New York's at just 42 per 100,000."

Bernie Sanders didn't believe John Kasich because Bernie Sanders stood up there and said, our radical, socialist agenda has won. We've taken over the Democratic Party and Joe Biden is ours. And that really underscores the stakes of this election. If the Democrats win, you are looking at Bernie in ascension, you're looking at AOC, you're looking at, mark my words, Elizabeth Warren as treasury secretary. Bernie might be Secretary of State.

They -- the Democrats don't have a message for, for, for teamsters. The Democrats don't have a message for, for, for right now. Antifa mobs are burning police union halls. It used to be that unions, the union leaders would stand together but the Democrats have said we care more about the woke mob than we do about standing with cops or firefighters or working men and women and to go tonight without saying a meaningful word about the riots, about the police officer being murdered.

But look, we also know what this is all about, which is the Democrats are desperate to beat Donald Trump. And so, they're pushing for this scheme that they call universal mail-in voting because they want everyone to vote by mail, and the reason they want it is that mail-in voting is particularly susceptible to voter fraud. They want to enable what they've done in California what's called voter harvesting. You know, in Texas, we have, we have tough rules to protect against voter fraud in Texas and some of the history of them. They were actually adopted by democratic legislators in Texas, because there was a long history in South Texas, of voter fraud in democratic primaries were unscrupulous political operatives. For example, they'd go to a nursing home, they go to each person and say, here, fill out your ballot here and here, honey, let me help you. Just check Joe Biden right here, fill in that dot, and they collect them all. And then magically, all the Joe Biden ones get mailed and you know, if someone was stubborn enough to vote Trump, well, they just kind of happened to throw that ballot in the mail and the Democrats in the trash rather the Democrats, they want to be able to enable voter fraud. That's what this whole post office nonsense is about. Is because they're trying to be in a position to steal the election. It's about their hatred for Donald Trump."

They're playing with fire here with these types of lies. And are you worried about that real quick? Well, listen, you're exactly right. And we've seen whether it's representative Presley or earlier, Maxine Waters, who urged people to engage in civil unrest essentially encourage the rioters you had in Minneapolis, when Antifa, when mobs, where firebombing, stores, and police cars, yet the Attorney General of Minnesota holding up the Antifa handbook and his son, the Minneapolis city councilman saying I stand with Antifa. The Democratic Party, when given a choice between the safety and security of the men and women in this country versus the radical mob, they've said, we side with the mob. And I got to say, I feel for the residents of places like Seattle and Portland, where the mob has taken over and the Democratic politicians have said, to hell with you, to the men and women that they're responsible to protect, because we're not willing to stand up to the radicals who are burning our cities down.

And we're not going to loot the million-dollar-mile and we're not going to destroy Seattle and New York's going to -- because we're going to tell them to stop, because their message is what we embold -- that what we represent, and they can get it through us so there'll be no need. So, that in a weird way, they're holding the nation hostage because there's -- the subtext is, this all, this is Donald Trump disunity but it's not, they've whipped it up and they can stop it if they get what they want -- and that's the, the bargain of the election. The other thing is they're talking about these April-May issues as if they're in a time warp. I felt like they were back in May, you know, in May. George Floyd is never mentioned in these demonstrations anymore. This has gone way beyond him. We're in the, the ultimate phase of the revolution. This is about destruction, and Antifa and anarchy and they still talk about George Floyd. And then they still talk about this virus. Well, the virus is here, but for 30 days daily, it's gone down. It's a very fluid situation. It's changing. And the lockdown, the lockdown is defined by one point. Now, 50 million children are suffering some dramatically so because it can't go to school, when there's less risk than facing influenza. We can take care of teachers that are vulnerable. That's the issue. And that's a losing issue for them. They keep -- they don't understand that this is August and Trump's polls are going up because they're talking about things in April and May and they have no solutions or alternate policies for this and the final thing is, whatever this, I have an empathy for them with the virtual world we live in, but this is a bad infomercial doesn't work and I hope that Republicans can find some way to tweak it or get actual live, people talking, or interviews, or a candidate parking lot, you know, impromptu."

To, to, basically, they want to defund the police instead of protecting the, the businesses in their community.

These have been -- these have been the most hateful people on the left to vilify Trump from day one. Victor's right giving style points to Michelle Obama tonight is not exactly, you know, difficult to do. What's difficult to do is rattle off what he just did, and educate the American public.

I mean, you're looking at an American Cold War right now, where you see conservatism and you see the, the communists on the other side and conservatism wins. They're angry. They're deflecting, they're saying it's us, no, it's them. We're watching right now in real time, a contest between who's right and who's wrong. And we're right, you don't see us rioting, you'll see conservatives rioting, and burning about neighborhoods that destroying our schools, our property, shooting and killing one another. The left is cannibalizing itself, as evil always does. And if you want to understand who's right, you look at us, and because, because Kamala Harris and Joe Biden said they're proud of their record. It's coming to a city near you, and it's coming to your city. If they get elected, this is what they're going to do to America."

Other way, he decided to take his message right to a small, small neighborhood so they, they want -- they aim to, to move into the suburbs. That's for sure. Panel, great to see all of you tonight. Thank you so much. And the theme again, for the DNC is \"Uniting America,\" which sounds so nice, until you realize as long as you deal with actually bringing people together. They're not interested in seeking common ground. There's no way. They're sure as hell not interested in reaching across the aisle Obama never did. So, what does it really mean? Here to tell us, Raymond Arroyo Fox News Contributor and Dinesh D'Souza, Conservative Author and Filmmaker. Dinesh, what do Democrats want to do in uniting America against something or for something?"

So, they don't make any effort to find genuine middle ground either in policy or in rhetoric. I mean, if they wanted to find a middle ground in rhetoric, for example, you -- they would say things like: Well, you know, we know there are all these riots going on in the streets, and of course, we don't approve of that, and we support law and order, but in this particular case, you know, they would, in other words, attempt to address the reality in front of us. Instead, what they're doing is trying to create, economics call it an alternative reality, an alternative universe to get us to live in that. And in that alternative universe, all their forces are unified against us, against Trump, against the people who support Trump. Notice there's no effort to reach out to them. Notice there's no effort to ever find middle ground with them. There's an effort to stigmatize them and demonize them, and all the talk of unity cannot hide the fact that these are actually very vitriolic, hateful people."

Raymond, you notice something and they build up. Like, it's like the early red carpet at the Oscars. You know, we had Eva Longoria there. So, it's like the early red carpet.

And tonight, I have to tell you as I watched this, I kept thinking, this is like a modeling MDA telephone after they fired Jerry Lewis. Remember, they used to have the pre-taped segments and they raised no money, that's what we saw tonight. This was like a string of those State of the Union response videos that nobody pays attention to. It was very hard to watch a dark maudlin vision of America really promoting fear, politicizing death, and it, and it, it was a frightening evening in some ways. Despite Michelle Obama and her speech, and Bernie's, you know, energetic talk there, between the cracks of this, the imaging, the pictures, was of a very dark and dreary America with no solutions offered other than Joe Biden is a decent guy."

But the most interesting thing to me is they're trying to depict and frame Joe Biden as a decent man, a good man, a moral man, a good man, a decent, respectful, normal man.

The opening of the video reads: \"There's some whores in this house.\" I'll stop there. I can't say anything up. It is the filthiest video. So, he's attached himself in a vain quest, I guess, for African American votes and young voters. He is attaching himself to someone who definitely does go low, admittedly, and probably one of the purveyors of a debased culture. If I had to name two or three people, she would be on that list.

But it's kind of like the old people. Like if I ever -- you both have permission to smother me with a pillow, if I, you know, at age 73 and trying to interview rappers, OK. It's just not going to work whoever is popular at that time. But I think it just accentuates Dinesh, the fact that he's so, sorry, seemingly out of it. He can't handle that."

And here's Kamala Harris, a product of identity politics descended from a Jamaican slave owner who owned five plantations and more than 200 slaves.
