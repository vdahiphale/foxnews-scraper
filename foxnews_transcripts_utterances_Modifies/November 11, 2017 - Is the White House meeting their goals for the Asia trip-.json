And with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win even bigger than before,\" end quote.  So is the president right or were the voters taking a stand against Trumpism? Let's asked FOX news contributor and \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist, Karl Rove. So, Karl, welcome. KARL ROVE, COLUMNIST & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.",

I think the president needed to impress that on the Chinese. We have had 25 years of on-again and off-again negotiations, North Korean commitments, North Korean violations of their commitments. Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, said a few weeks ago that North Korea might be within months of having the capability of dropping thermonuclear weapons on any target in the continental United States. We are at a point very close to a go/no-go decision on the use of military force. Otherwise, we'll face North Korea with nuclear weapons as far as the eye can see."

And yet, if you looked at South Korea before the visit, the new president of South Korea, the new government, which is left-leaning, basically agreed with China not to deploy new THAAD antimissile batteries in the peninsula in the future, which was a Chinese demand. So you see evidence that our core ally there, the ally we're protecting, has been moving towards China's position on what you can deploy militarily on the peninsula."

    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

I think it was, I though, a subtle appeal to the South Korean people to disregard what they have been taught at their schools for many years, which is life in the North is pretty much what life in the South is like. And it's to draw the distinction that we are just not going to put up with this bizarre regime in Pyongyang with nuclear weapons. The president said in his U.N. un speech, denuclearization is the only way forward. He continued to maintain that. I'm sure that's what he said to China. We'll have to see now what happens."

Look at the rest of northern Virginia. Alexandria City, up 26 percent. Fairfax County, the biggest voting jurisdiction in the state, up 23 percent. Arlington, up 26 percent. But Loudon County, 31 percent. A third more voters voted in that county this year than four years ago.

So there's a contention among some of the Steve Bannon types, Donald Trump supporters, that if Gillespie had somehow wrapped himself around the president's agenda, for example, if he came out strong for a wall on the Mexican border, if he hit hard on illegal immigration, somehow that would have driven up that Republican turnout. Does that sound plausible to you?"

He had a very substantive campaign and that allowed him to escape some of the gravitational pull of the president in the state, but not all of it. Look, Washington, D.C., suburbs, which cast over a third of the vote in the state, they pay a lot of attention to what goes across the river there in Potomac. A lot of government employees and they pay close attention to the president and what he's doing, and they sent a resounding \"no\" message this year."

In other races around the country, Washington State, Manchester, New Jersey, it wasn't a lot of good news for Republicans anywhere."

It is now the southernmost northeastern state. So there are changes inside the state that, over the long haul, which have been bad for Republicans. But in this election, this was all about President Trump. The Democrats made it about President Trump and then Ed Gillespie had to parry that. And he ran ahead of Trumps favorability rating in the state. But the rating was too low to allow him to escape the gravitational dark hole, if you will, black hole of the president's unpopularity."

Ralph Northam is a - voted for George W. Bush for president twice, contemplated running as a Republican candidate when he entered politics, represented a relatively conservative part of the state, a Republican part of the state, the Tidewater, Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. He was not the kind of left-wing lunatic that the Democrats seem to insist upon nominating for office. But having said that, what this say is, if your state or district is like Virginia Hillary Clinton won it by five points, you better batten down the hatches and get prepared and be able to share with the people what it is that you need to achieve, what it is you want to do, who you are. And you want to cover that district in the state like the morning dew in order to make people know who you are and don't confuse you for being Donald Trump. The second thing is the president had better work on getting his numbers up. Otherwise, on Election Day 2018, he is going to turn around and there will be a lot of people who got defeated, who should have won, and who have an \"R\" behind their name, and he will be blamed for it."

They talked about Nelson County, which is actually one that Gillespie won, in the southern part of the state. And what defines Nelson County is it's one of those pivot counties. It had gone for Obama twice and then for Donald Trump. What also defines these counties is that they have been subject to great economic distress. They've lost more jobs than they've gained over the past eight or nine years. And these are the folks that wanted Trump. They were willing to overlook some of his problems because of his promise of free-market growth reviving the American economy. I think that is a message that Gillespie pushed, and it did help him with many types of voters in the state. And I think it's a way that, if Republicans are going to use it, they will have to do it by building on some legislative accomplishments, like tax reform.

Two executives from the company previously invoked the Fifth Amendment right to avoid incriminating themselves. We're back with James Freeman, Mary Anastasia O'Grady, Mary Kissel and Kim Strassel. Kim, you are the global expert on the Steele dossier, really digging into the story."

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "I don't know if that is true!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "But let's back up, big picture here. Why should we care about this document and how it came about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "OK, we should care about this document because the narrative all along the last year has been, was there Trump collision with the Russians in the elections? It's not been proven yet. It's possible. We don't know, but there's no evidence so far. But here what we have on the other side is some pretty tangible evidence that the Democratic National Committee, the Hillary Clinton campaign paid an opposition research firm to put together a dossier based on anonymous Russian sources that may have inspired the FBI to investigate the Trump campaign, that may be behind a lot of these arguments of collision that are out there, and that the Russians might have known about this project and, therefore, influenced its content."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So the Democrats paid Fusion, who hired Christopher Steele, the former British spy, who produced the dossier that then made its hands into the FBI, which then sought a FISA court warrant to investigate a member, someone, Carter Page, who was associated with the Trump campaign. All that is pretty solid evidence. We know those things are true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, we are not entirely sure yet, for instance, if it was the dossier that provoked the FISA warrant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK, that's a question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "And that is the question that needs to be answered. Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "It may have provoked it. And \"The Washington Post\" has reported that it actually did. I believe, that is correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "There has been a lot of allegations, yes. And what is important is the House Intelligence Committee has also come to an agreement with the FBI, finally, to get to see the FBI's dossier file, which should provide some more information about how big a role the document played."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. This is really, I think -- granted, we want to investigate and find out if there was any Trump/Russia occlusion. But this is the other side of the story. Shouldn't we want to know the full story, particularly when it comes to a U.S. criminal and intelligence service like the FBI?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISSEL",
      "utterance": "There something more, which Kim has covered in her column, which is that this opposition research was also being fed to major news organizations in the United States during the campaign. And it was being delivered to the public as if it was some kind of official information. And so that was also very misleading during the campaign. And now, Hillary Clinton continues to say, no, this did not matter at all, this is just things we did in the background. That is not true. They fed it to the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "There was another development this week. We found out through some good reporting that Glenn Simpson, one of the principals at Fusion GPS, met with the Russian lawyer, who then went on to meet with Don Jr, another meeting which has drawn scrutiny. It's unclear if they were discussing the upcoming meeting with Don Jr or and if they were --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump Jr."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, Donald Trump Jr. Or if they were discussing other business that Fusion also had about the same Russian attorney. So more questions here, Paul."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Yes. And is this being investigated, in your view, to your satisfaction, by Robert Mueller, the special counsel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "We will see. I would say, certainly, there's a great lack of curiosity among the American media. We remember, during the Bush years, how controversial it was that the United States was looking at telephone metadata for non-Americans overseas. We now have, in the 2016 campaign, the government using its surveillance powers against the party out of power. And this is the question, to what extent did that Steele dossier, this opposition research, drive the use of surveillance powers against political opponents by the party in power?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Is the key here the Intelligence Committees on Capitol Hill, Kim, briefly? Will we get anything on this from Mueller?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Everything that we've got, so far, has been from the committees, and everything we're going to get is from them. I do not have any confidence that Mueller has an interest in this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right. Thank you all very much. When we come back, this week marks 100 years of Communism. We will look at what happened over the last century and lessons we have learned, hard lessons, after the break."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "A century ago this week, the deadliest political system in human history took root in Russia, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew Russia's provincial government and established the world's first Socialist state. Communism was born. The promises made of equality and freedom from oppression were soon replaced with torture and murder. All told, the past 100 years have seen nearly 100 million deaths as a result of Communist regimes. The White House issued a statement commemorating the national day for the victims of Communism, which read, in part, \"The Bolshevik revolution gave rise to the Soviet Union and its dark decades of oppressive Communism, a political philosophy incompatible with liberty, prosperity, and the dignity of human life.\" We are back with James Freeman, Mary Kissel, Mary O'Grady and Kim Strassel. Mary, giving away our ages. We grew up with this Communism as a defining struggle in our lifetimes. It went away with the collapse - substantially, with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union years later. But remind us of what it left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Paul, the centerpiece of Communism was that they had to destroy private property. Everything was going to be collective. And destroying private property is much easier said than done because human beings basically hold private property as a center of who they are. They strive to create, and the fruits of their labor become part of who they are. To destroy property, you actually have to break the human spirit, which is what they try to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "They break human beings physically, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Through mass deportations, executions, and basically state terror, which is characterized with the Soviet Union and China. The other thing I think that is worth really paying attention to in this day and age is that although Communism has these high numbers of murders and so forth in the 20th century, they have -- states have learned how to sort of repress people, but refine their tactics so they do not have to kill as many people in order to hold onto power. And you are seeing that in places like Cuba and Venezuela."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Cuba and North Korea are probably the last really pure forms of Communism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Mary, I have an idea, which is that every American college should have a Communist term abroad. Give them three months, a semester, a quarter, send them to Cuba, send them to North Korea and say, just feel what it's like, so you can learn what that kind of a system is like. I bet you the vote for Socialism goes down in the future. OK, I am going to be serious. But, there's a serious point, which is the dream never dies. We still have people who think and look at Cuba and say, oh, that is a great system. Health care is wonderful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISSEL",
      "utterance": "Including the previous presidential administration. But let's set that aside. Paul, I think you put your finger on the real problem here, which is that it's easy to forget history. And in our high schools and in our universities here in the United States, they're not teaching the history and the horror that Mary so artfully outlined. There was a study done by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation recently, a great organization. They found that 44 percent of Millennial's prefer to live under Socialism than under Capitalism. And 7 percent -- that sounds like a small number, it's single digits -- but it should be zero. But 7 percent say they would rather live in a --"
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

      "speaker": "KISSEL",

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right, Kim, why does the dream -- why do you think the dream never dies, the Communist dream?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Look, people -- it's probably because of the media that demonizes the rich and success and all of the things that come with private property and success. And this is a very idealistic idea, that we are all living in peace and harmony. And of course, and the problem, too, is history and that no one has taught it anymore. So, too many of these students and young Americans have no idea of some of the things that we are talking about here today and the legacy of Communism."

For those of us that already hate the fact that so much of our civic discourse happens in a form where everything that comes into someone's head immediately goes online in 140 characters -- -- the idea that this can be expanded is just terrifying. But if Twitter is unconvinced by that, I just want it to close his eyes and imagine Donald Trump with 280 characters at his beck and call, and please, reconsider."
