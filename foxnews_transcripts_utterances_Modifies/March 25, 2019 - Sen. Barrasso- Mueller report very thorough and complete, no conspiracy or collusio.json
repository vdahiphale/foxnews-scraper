I think yesterday was a great day for America. I mean, this charge of colluding with a foreign government, I mean, that's treason. That was very, very serious, and wonderful news. Mueller, who's been held up to be an icon, found -- and he used the word found -- that there was no collusion with -- by the president, by anyone in the president's campaign. And we should all be celebrating that. Representative Joe Kennedy about three weeks ago, certainly no friend of the president's, said he hoped that there would be a finding of collusion.  So I thought we could all move on. And so Mueller comes out with this report. And, once again, the people who have held him up as a deity are questioning the validity of it. So, there's no collusion. But now we turn to obstruction. I don't understand frankly, why Mueller, who made a conclusion as to collusion, why he didn't make a judgment as to obstruction. I mean, that's his job. It's like a judge saying, hey, this -- this is too hard. This issue is just too hard. I'm not going to decide.  But he didn't decide. So the attorney general, together with Rod Rosenstein, the man who was talking about wearing a wire on the president, jointly decided there was no obstruction. So it is exoneration for the president.

Now let's circle back to find out why we were led down this path in the first place.  Do you think that's a good idea?"

      "utterance": "Charles, I woke up this morning thinking we're going to have a little bit of bipartisanship. Well, that lasted about 30 seconds, until I turned on the television. I think yesterday was a great day for America. I mean, this charge of colluding with a foreign government, I mean, that's treason. That was very, very serious, and wonderful news. Mueller, who's been held up to be an icon, found -- and he used the word found -- that there was no collusion with -- by the president, by anyone in the president's campaign. And we should all be celebrating that. Representative Joe Kennedy about three weeks ago, certainly no friend of the president's, said he hoped that there would be a finding of collusion.  So I thought we could all move on. And so Mueller comes out with this report. And, once again, the people who have held him up as a deity are questioning the validity of it. So, there's no collusion. But now we turn to obstruction. I don't understand frankly, why Mueller, who made a conclusion as to collusion, why he didn't make a judgment as to obstruction. I mean, that's his job. It's like a judge saying, hey, this -- this is too hard. This issue is just too hard. I'm not going to decide. But he didn't decide. So the attorney general, together with Rod Rosenstein, the man who was talking about wearing a wire on the president, jointly decided there was no obstruction. So it is exoneration for the president. So, I say, let's move on. Let's move on to working on the president's agenda best for the American people.  But why have the Republicans look into the source of this, the Democrats look into the president, and nothing gets done? But that's not going to happen."

So, clearly, we have had a significant rebound. And what the market is concerned about right now is getting some things right. And it feels like we're getting closer to getting China right on trade negotiations. Sounds like they're getting closer to the end of that process, which I think would be great for global growth. I think it would certainly be an inflection point for Chinese growth, which is going to help European growth and certainly help investors get more comfortable with where we are right now the marketplace. So I think that's what we're looking at towards right now. The market is keenly focused on getting trade right with China. It feels like we're on the right path there. And there's light at the end of the tunnel."

The market wants certainty. The market really -- the market now really doesn't care if it's a good, significant, substantial deal. I think the market expects it.

So I think the economic data we have seen coming out of China has stabilized. I think, over the last two months, it's gotten to that point where we think that putting tariffs behind them would certainly help that stabilization, and help inflect light higher. I think a better Chinese economy is going to help the European economy in large part. Germany needs a healthy Chinese economy for the exports that Germany moves into the Chinese economic system. So I clearly think this goes hand in glove. Get trade right. Get that inflection point right on the Chinese economy, and put tariffs behind us, and not have the U.S. immediately pivot to tariffs on European autos.

Mr. Mueller, after, what, two years, 2,800 subpoenas, Mr. Mueller and his team of 40 FBI agents and 19 lawyers said there was no conclusion. In terms of obstruction of justice, they said they couldn't draw any conclusions, but they weren't bringing or recommending an indictment -- an indictment. This is over.

Now Mr. Mueller has drawn his conclusions, finding that there's -- there's no evidence of conclusion -- of the conclusion. And it's important that the American people be able to see that. Part of the problem, Charles, with Washington, D.C., there are too many permanent Washington types up here that think they're smarter and more virtuous than the American people, and that they ought to be able to make decisions for the American people.

At the time that the Republican deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, launched this investigation, there was significant evidence of contacts between senior Trump officials and Russian agents. At this point, it's pretty much undisputed that the Russians did actively seek to undermine the 2016 presidential election. And the president himself, when he fired FBI Director Comey, said he fired him in part because he wanted to ensure that there wasn't a potential investigation into potential Russian collusion. So, the full Mueller report should come out, so that the public can evaluate all of his findings. And if, in fact, what has been reported is true, then there can be some arguments about moving forward.

It was clearly a hoax from the beginning. But I wanted to point out, we can recall when the president said that he believed that Trump Towers and his campaign was being tapped, wiretapped, bugged. And he was correct about that. And he blamed the Obama administration for that. So I would love for this full report to come out, because I want to see all the facts also. Mitch made a great point.

I think Vladimir Putin saw Barack Obama as a swinging open door and he just pushed it open and came on in. That was the genesis of where this started. But what Russia did, Russia is a malignant actor around the world. And we, as Americans, do have to unify against Russia. An attack on one political party is attack on all political parties. And that is something I want to see in the Mueller report. But the other thing, Charles, that it has got to get to the bottom of is, what did Barack Obama know and what and when did he authorize it?

That really does ensure that the debate surrounding the Mueller probe, as well as the findings of it, which I think many people will agree bode very well for the president, are kept in the national conversation, particularly as election season really ramps up, we head to the primaries and eventually the general election."

      "utterance": "Well, we have had two Republican senators on this show today.  They're fine with it. They want it released -- 420 to zip a vote in the House to release it. President Trump saying he's fine with it being released. So I don't see where there could be a conspiracy to hold this information back from the American public. Do you think, at some point, William Barr will release as much as he can?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUINN",
      "utterance": "Yes. And the attorney general has said as much, that he does want to make as much of the report public as he is legally allowed to do. I think the fact that you do have the president of the United States, who is obviously a central figure in this two-year-long investigation, him saying that he's fine with the report's full release, he said earlier today that it doesn't bother him at all. That certainly bolsters the argument for why as much of the report as possible should be made available to the American public."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you, Melissa. A week ago, USA Today had a poll where 50 percent felt that the Mueller investigation, that President Trump was a victim of the Mueller investigation. They called it a witch-hunt. This is USA Today. Could these Democrats be overplaying their hand now that the conclusion has been made by a man, Mueller that they said was the best man for the job, and now this looks like sour grapes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUINN",
      "utterance": "Well, the findings of the report, no collusion between members of the Trump campaign or any American with Russia, certainly puts these Democratic presidential candidates in sort of a tricky position. On one hand, you have the Democratic base, the activists who really want to see all of the president's actions, including those surrounding the 2016 presidential campaign, investigated in earnest. And they want to see Congress and particularly the Democrat-led House undertaken those efforts."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Since the Mueller report found no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, can Congress switch their focus from investigation to legislation? Let's ask Massachusetts Democratic Congressman Stephen Lynch. He joins us now. Congressman, thanks for joining us. What will your focus be from -- going forward? Do you still want to dwell on what's going on with the Mueller report, or is it time to move forward with this country?"
    },

      "speaker": "REP. STEPHEN LYNCH, D-MASS.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "It's going to be tough, though, to relitigate it. It feels like maybe some of your colleagues are preparing to assault the credibility of the report, or to try to open up different avenues of investigation. And is that sort of a waste of time, after all of these years, the millions of dollars, and a huge distraction that this has been for the American public?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LYNCH",
      "utterance": "Well, ironically, it was the president who was attacking the investigation from the outset. And we still believe, we give great credibility to Bob Mueller's investigation. He spent almost two years on it. We would like the opportunity to read the entire report and then see the underlying evidence that he relied upon on making those decisions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Do you think, though perhaps someone, for instance, like a Representative Nadler, who seems already -- he's got a list of 81 folks he's asked her for information from. Some of those names, some of those requests may become subpoenas at any moment now, that he's already made up his mind that he's going to launch additional investigations, no matter what reads -- what we read in the Mueller report?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LYNCH",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure about Judiciary. I know, from our standpoint, I'm the chair of the National Security Subcommittee on Oversight. So we have specific issues that we want to look at. And we have been holding them in abeyance, waiting for special counsel Mueller's report to be concluded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Sir, I want to also ask you about the Green New Deal, a vote coming on that. It's a cornerstone -- it's a central cornerstone of the Republicans (sic) who are running for president. And yet a lot of -- a lot of Democrats are pretty upset and frustrated that there's going to be a vote on this. I thought they would want to be on the record for supporting this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LYNCH",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, right now, it's -- in our -- in the House, it's a nonbinding resolution. So it's more aspirational than anything. It's not -- it's not actually a bill that's going to do anything. It's sort of a sense of Congress type resolution. So I do realize that maybe some in the Senate are not ready to embrace that, but I think that, to be honest with you, it is merely aspirational and sets some goals out there, rather than actually does anything."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
