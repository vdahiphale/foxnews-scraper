Remember, the DOJ had strenuously argued for limited review, so as not to slow down their investigation. Well, this ruling tonight puts the brakes at least temporarily on this aspect of the ongoing harassment of Donald Trump. More on this breaking story in a few moments. Also huge news from the financial world, as the CEO of FedEx is predicting a worldwide recession after the companies reporting that it will miss its revenue expectations. Well, Wall Street wanted Biden and now Wall Street has Biden, unfortunately sort of the rest of us, more reaction from the panel on that coming up. But first, 'Hate United', that's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now we've been waiting for it, and now the White House's closing argument for the midterms, is coming into sharper focus.

He DM-ed me another video that I had also reposted from a different account that cut out the audience clapping in it basically to claim that that was doctored and made his speech issues look worse than they were.

And the way I thought journalism was supposed to work is journalism is supposed to challenge powerful people and challenge powerful institutions in America. But in this case, this NBC News reporter is accusing me of doctoring video and then going to big tech companies asking them to censor me, the unholy alliance between media and big tech.

And according to the Oz team, Fetterman wants to have two practice sessions in studio ahead of time. Joining me now is the other participant in that debate, Dr. Mehmet Oz U.S. Senate candidate, Republican, Pennsylvania. Dr. Oz we spoke to the Fetterman campaign and they denied the practice sessions claim, saying \"Both campaigns will be doing pre-debate walkthroughs that are very standard in every political debate.

He doesn't show up for his lieutenant governor's job. But you brought up something that's really important. The liberal press has been hiding this issue of his health. They've been hiding his radical positions. This man cares more about criminals than the innocent. Not only has he hired two murderers, convicted murderers serving life sentences that he had released on his campaign, but he's backed a massive middle class tax hike but did not pay his own taxes 67 times. So if this bothers you, please go DoctorOz.com and support me, because money is pouring into his campaign to facilitate getting this election to the Democratic candidates. They're literally manufacturing a candidate. He's not out on the campaign trail talking to people, answering questions. So folks don't know what he stands for.

But he has serious issues speaking about it, or serious issues speaking. And when you're running for the United States Senate, that's a legitimate criticism, as even \"The Washington Post\" editorial board said. And so I've made about like three or four really viral supercuts of John Fetterman, of clips of him at his rallies where he's barely get through them, and obviously his handlers don't let him speak for very long periods at a time. And so after my latest one I get this DM from this NBC News reporter, and he basically is asking me about the edits that I made and why I did them about the supercut. He DM-ed me another video that I had also reposted from a different account that cut out the audience clapping in it basically to claim that that was doctored and made his speech issues look worse than they were. And so in my head, I was thinking to myself, OK, he's probably writing some stupid article about how Republicans are being mean to John Fetterman. And then publishes it, and he accuses me of doctoring the video, not selectively editing, not taking out of contest, but doctoring them, as if I had somehow deep-faked these videos to make it look like John Fetterman had worse speech issues than he actually does. And the way I thought journalism was supposed to work is journalism is supposed to challenge powerful people and challenge powerful institutions in America. But in this case, this NBC News reporter is accusing me of doctoring video and then going to big tech companies asking them to censor me, the unholy alliance between media and big tech.

And forget just his health issues. This guy has really bad ideas that would be bad for Pennsylvania and the country, and they're trying to pull the same playbook that they did with Joe Biden by essentially just keeping him in the basement and trying to convince Pennsylvania voters what's the worst this guy could do? But this guy wants to release one-third of prisoners from prison. He has a lot of terrible ideas, and if he gets elected, he's going to enact them. And they're basically just trying to trick P.A. voters into doing it."

So there's a few caveats, though, from Uncle Festerman (ph). He wants to use live, real-time closed captioning monitors. And according to the Oz team, Fetterman wants to have two practice sessions in studio ahead of time. Joining me now is the other participant in that debate, Dr. Mehmet Oz U.S. Senate candidate, Republican, Pennsylvania. Dr. Oz we spoke to the Fetterman campaign and they denied the practice sessions claim, saying \"Both campaigns will be doing pre-debate walkthroughs that are very standard in every political debate. That's not a practice debate or whatever the hell the Oz team is spinning this as.\" Your response?"

      "utterance": "All I know is John Fetterman, he's been dodging all questions, not just debate questions, but those from the press and from voters, which is, frankly, insulting in a democracy. I think he's doing it to avoid this radical left ideology that he has, and he doesn't want to defend it. But under a lot of pressure, he has agreed to this short debate, as you point out. He does want closed captioning. And we were told that he wanted a few rehearsals, which I get. I'm a physician. I understand how hard it is to deal with a stroke and with heart failure. I'm fine with him taking rehearsals. I would like to have extra time in the debate so we can ask more questions. As many, including \"The Washington Post\" have said, you have to have multiple debates. Please have them early so that voters who are getting absentee ballots next week don't have to wait a month-and-a- half --"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But Dr. Oz, sorry to interrupt, but are you going to agree to these terms with the closed captioning situation that he's asked for? I'm not really getting that. Are you agreeing to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OZ",
      "utterance": "I'm going agree to allowing him to have closed captioning and other conditions that he may desire to make it easier for him to debate. I do believe he owes Pennsylvanians an honest assessment of his health, not double secret probation tests that we find out about on television, but really give voters access to what's going on so that we can have, all voters, transparency into the process. Listen, I'm skeptical of what's going to happen, if he'll show up in this debate that's scheduled two weeks before the election. He's often a no show. He doesn't show up for his lieutenant governor's job. But you brought up something that's really important. The liberal press has been hiding this issue of his health. They've been hiding his radical positions. This man cares more about criminals than the innocent. Not only has he hired two murderers, convicted murderers serving life sentences that he had released on his campaign, but he's backed a massive middle class tax hike but did not pay his own taxes 67 times. So if this bothers you, please go DoctorOz.com and support me, because money is pouring into his campaign to facilitate getting this election to the Democratic candidates. They're literally manufacturing a candidate. He's not out on the campaign trail talking to people, answering questions. So folks don't know what he stands for. You can only find out by watching his commercials. I've been out there every single day doing multiple interviews."

That's why the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed me unanimously. When that happened, people who are worried about crime vote for me. They don't want him legalizing drugs, having an open border to fentanyl pours into our state. We're number three for fentanyl overdoses and creates huge areas of our cities like Kensington and Philadelphia that are uninhabitable with zombies walking around with needles sticking out their neck, they don't want that. So Fetterman loses those votes. He believes he's above the people and above the law, and it's catching up to him. We will win in Pennsylvania."

This is -- the whole hoodie thing is just, it's all a costume, it's all wardrobe. And we appreciate you. Thank you so much for coming on. Greasy used car salesman Gavin Newsom has found a way to insert himself into the migrant story. We're going to explain. Plus, we've shown you a lot of bizarre moments from Joe Biden, but we just got our hands on video from tonight that might top them all. You don't want to miss it, so stay there."

California Governor Gavin Newsom sent a letter to A.G. Merrick Garland calling on him to open an investigation into the states transporting the migrants. He calls it kidnapping and he argues that interstate travel provides a basis for federal jurisdiction. Federal jurisdiction, that's interesting for Newsom to enter that into the conversation because it just so happens that illegally entering the country in the first place also falls under federal jurisdiction, which they're just normalizing. Joining us now, Harmeet Dhillon, chairwoman of the Republican National Lawyers Association. Good to see you in person, Harmeet, as always. What about this? I mean, Newsom is really, talk about a Hail Mary. This is just desperate at this point."

There's no way to avoid covering it, and then it brings the issue to the fore. And then people are like, wait, we're bussing people? Why are they coming to the country? So it was brilliant, both of DeSantis and of Abbott. I have got to get to this tonight. Judge Cannon, Aileen Cannon, denied the DOJ's request for a partial stay of her decision to appoint that special master. And now the DOJ is going to proceed to the appeals to the 11th circuit court of appeals. And we have the name of the first special master who has been appointed, Judge Raymond Dearie, I guess. He was proposed by the Trump lawyers, but interestingly, he also signed the Carter Page warrant before the FBI misconduct was discovered. Harmeet, your reaction to all this tonight? Big news."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge Dearie was accepted by the DOJ as well after the Trump folks objected to their judges. And so I think it's a good appointment, and it's really brilliant by Judge Cannon to pick this special master, because one of the objections of the DOJ was how can you possibly let this like random special master look at these super classified documents. Of course, a recent FISA judge has all the clearances necessary to look at all of those documents. And so she's checkmated the government on that issue. And the order also rejects government arguments that there is somehow some compelling need for DOJ prosecutors. And she also calls out the government for the leaks and otherwise. It's an excellent balanced order, and I don't think the 11th circuit is going to take issue with it."

So the court pointed out a large volume of documents, and the court has set a very aggressive schedule for the court, but that aggressive schedule itself only requires conclusion by November 30th, which is after the midterm elections, but it requires regular reports to the court. And the court reserves the final decision as to whether accept, reject, or otherwise pursue the recommendations of the special master. This is a standard special master type order, and it's excellent."
