Here's some of the biggest things that we've seen in our Fox News \"VOTER ANALYSIS\" election survey of more than 3,000 Democratic primary voters. The big debate within the Democratic Party, should they nominate a candidate who will restore the system in Washington to the pre-Trump era, or one who will burn it down completely and change how the political system works? Twice as many as you can see these numbers here want to change the political system. Now, among Bernie Sanders supporters, not surprisingly, nearly 90 percent want the change? Some candidates have cried foul over the DNC debate roles, and as they've changed then, they had the mess in Iowa last week. So, we asked Democratic primary voters here, how much faith they had in the party's process for picking a nominee. Is it fair? Well, just about six and 10 think it is fair.  Now, among folks backing Bernie Sanders, though, over half of them say they're actually not confident in this system. Amongst supporters of every other candidate, voters have faith in how the party is picking their nominee this time around.  Now, so, the economy no doubt, President Trump is out there touting his economic record on the campaign trail, who do primary voters here Democrats think can do the best job handling the economy. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the top picks, after that, it's a pair of billionaires, in Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. And as you know, Bloomberg isn't even on the ballot here in New Hampshire, although he's getting a lot of right and attention. Now, what about foreign policy, who do they think can best handle that job here? Joe Biden is the clear choice, followed by Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard.  One more, how much did Iowa make a difference in New Hampshire? What about Friday's debate? How did they weigh in? Well, one in five granite staters knew all along who they were going to support. But more than one in three, just days ago, they have just made their decision. Some of them actually as they're going into the ballot box today. There's a whole lot more of our data coming up. So, we'll be back soon. Bret, Martha, back to you.",

That way and as Peter mentioned, he'll be delivering those remarks later tonight in South Carolina. Now, a top Biden surrogate here in New Hampshire tells Fox News that no doubt, some of his supporters are discouraged by Biden's decision to leave the state early. It's unclear there whether or not at this point that means fewer people show up to watch the results come in. Biden's poll numbers in New Hampshire have slipped over the last few weeks. Biden's sister, she is expected to thank those supporters later on tonight in place of the former vice president. Thank those people that have been working on the ground for the last several months.

Then, the Department of Justice early this morning said, wait a minute that is too harsh. They are calling for a \"far less sentence\" but not giving a specific number. Roger Stone is looking at prison time for witness tampering and lying to Congress. The new U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, Tim Shea is close to eight of Attorney General Bill Barr. He actually just left his post here at DOJ just recently.  A source says once DOJ officials saw the sentencing memo yesterday, they were upset, arguing it was too stiff. Then, came the tweet from President Trump, 1:49 this morning, calling the potential Stone sentence, \"a miscarriage of justice.\" The attorney general's spokeswoman tells Fox News, the decision to change the sentencing guidelines came before the Trump tweet and there was no communication between DOJ and the White House to change those sentencing guidelines.

When Joe Biden went on the attack, Warren talked of party unity. When Joe Biden skipped ahead to South Carolina, Warren stayed here fighting for every last vote. And as you can see she has a huge army of volunteers on the ground across New Hampshire, perhaps the strongest ground game of any candidate in this race, which is why a disappointing finish here tonight would be all the more devastating for the future of her campaign. We have seen an 11th hour shift and strategy. Over the last few hours both Warren and her campaign has really started finally going on the offensive, criticizing Biden and Buttigieg and really drawing some distinctions between her and Bernie Sanders. But it may be too little, too late, especially with someone like Senator Amy Klobuchar nipping at her heels. And that is where we find my colleague Ellison Barber live in Concord.",

We are told her staff will be in a room nearby watching the results. Klobuchar supporters are excited. They think that she could hit her stride in this state, especially with New Hampshire's independent voters. A key part of Klobuchar's pitch is that she believe she can pull in all kinds of voters, Republicans, Democrats, independents, people from big cities, the suburbs as well as rural communities. Klobuchar likes to say that she has the receipts to prove it. In 2016 President Trump's came within two percent of caring Minnesota. Two years later Senator Klobuchar won reelection to the United States Senate with 60 percent of the vote. At a Manchester polling location earlier today I spoke to a number of voters who said they were undecided or at least deciding between someone more moderate like Biden or Buttigieg, and then they saw Senator Klobuchar at the debate this week, and they said that is what made them move over and to support Klobuchar. The people here tonight are hoping that she has enough of those people to carry her through in this state. Bret, Martha?",

So we will see it populate, and the colors will start to fill in throughout the night. If you are watching trying to figure out New Hampshire and understand where the votes are going to coming from, I would divide the state into the three different parts. Number one, the southern tier, that's down here in Rockingham County, a lot of votes down here, bordered with Massachusetts over here and Hillsborough County where we are as well. A lot of votes as you can see based on four years ago. That is one section of the state, southern tier here. The other section you call maybe the liberal left, where Bernie Sanders did very well in 2016 and may do very well again today. This is the border with Vermont over here and Cheshire County, ran up the numbers four years ago. Up here in Grafton County, very similar for Bernie Sanders. So I'd look at those two areas. And the third area I would point to is what Stirewalt likes to call the capital corridor. This is the county of Merrimack. It has the capital city of Concord, and you could see strength there for maybe a Klobuchar, maybe a Buttigieg, maybe for a Warren. So we will see how that unfolds tonight. And again, first polls close at 7:00, then you get another batch at 7:30, then all the polls officially are done at 8:00 eastern time, about an hour and 15 minutes from now.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Bret and Martha. Our team has been investigating what is motivating voters here in New Hampshire. Here's some of the biggest things that we've seen in our Fox News \"VOTER ANALYSIS\" election survey of more than 3,000 Democratic primary voters. The big debate within the Democratic Party, should they nominate a candidate who will restore the system in Washington to the pre-Trump era, or one who will burn it down completely and change how the political system works? Twice as many as you can see these numbers here want to change the political system. Now, among Bernie Sanders supporters, not surprisingly, nearly 90 percent want the change? Some candidates have cried foul over the DNC debate roles, and as they've changed then, they had the mess in Iowa last week. So, we asked Democratic primary voters here, how much faith they had in the party's process for picking a nominee. Is it fair? Well, just about six and 10 think it is fair. Now, among folks backing Bernie Sanders, though, over half of them say they're actually not confident in this system. Amongst supporters of every other candidate, voters have faith in how the party is picking their nominee this time around. Now, so, the economy no doubt, President Trump is out there touting his economic record on the campaign trail, who do primary voters here Democrats think can do the best job handling the economy. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the top picks, after that, it's a pair of billionaires, in Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer. And as you know, Bloomberg isn't even on the ballot here in New Hampshire, although he's getting a lot of right and attention. Now, what about foreign policy, who do they think can best handle that job here? Joe Biden is the clear choice, followed by Sanders, Buttigieg, Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard. One more, how much did Iowa make a difference in New Hampshire? What about Friday's debate? How did they weigh in? Well, one in five granite staters knew all along who they were going to support. But more than one in three, just days ago, they have just made their decision. Some of them actually as they're going into the ballot box today. There's a whole lot more of our data coming up. So, we'll be back soon. Bret, Martha, back to you."

They will not be seeing the former vice president take the stage behind me. Instead, there are some video monitors that have been set up. Biden is expected to deliver an address. That way and as Peter mentioned, he'll be delivering those remarks later tonight in South Carolina. Now, a top Biden surrogate here in New Hampshire tells Fox News that no doubt, some of his supporters are discouraged by Biden's decision to leave the state early. It's unclear there whether or not at this point that means fewer people show up to watch the results come in. Biden's poll numbers in New Hampshire have slipped over the last few weeks. Biden's sister, she is expected to thank those supporters later on tonight in place of the former vice president. Thank those people that have been working on the ground for the last several months. Biden's campaign says they do envision more travel ahead past South Carolina, including stops in Nevada. Bret and Martha."

But for right now, there is way more members of the media inside of this building. Mayor Pete's day began at 6:00 this morning at a voting center in Manchester. And then, we caught up with him a short while later at a polling center in Nashua, where he told the crowd he was feeling fantastic. And over the past couple of days, Mayor Pete has been greeted by his supporters chanting what has become signature cheers, President Pete and Boot-Edge-Edge, which is the campaign's humorous attempt to help support us trying to pronounce his last name. We have seen very energized Buttigieg supporters across this state. Buttigieg clearly has momentum here in New Hampshire. His campaign claims he has held 20 events since Friday, the most of any candidate.

That's a striking number. I mean, here we are with record low unemployment -- record low unemployment among minorities, you know, times, political battles aside are good in America. And yet, you have this vote. I think it's fair to say we have an angry Democratic Party in the state of New Hampshire and probably an angry Democratic Party around the country. And the cause of that is -- there's no doubt about what the cause of that, it's all about Mr. Trump."

That's not what Joe Biden is doing, Joe Biden is getting out of dodge. I mean, he is carrying zero momentum. And he is basically trying to avoid the carnage of what's going to happen to him tonight. I'm looking in three stories tonight. First of all, let's assume that Bernie Sanders wins. What's his march are going to be? Four years ago, he beat Hillary Clinton by 22 points, 60 percent to 38. So, let's wait and see just how he does, maybe against Buttigieg, whoever it is. Second story, Amy Klobuchar. She really does seem to have been the hot candidate, really doesn't seem to have gotten some momentum from the debate on Friday night. Let's see how high she rises. And then, the third is how low Joe Biden falls. I mean, is he going to be third? Is he going to be fourth? Is he going to be fifth? If this guy was the front runner for the last six months if he finishes fifth in New Hampshire? I don't know how you come back from them."

    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I think one of the things that these numbers tell us is, that there's not a lot of nostalgia among these people for the Obama-era, right? Which is only four years behind us. And he -- you know, left office, still wildly popular, great hero to Democrats. And now comes his, you know, his right-hand person, and he's not getting any traction, and it looks like he could -- this could be the -- you know, the death knell. I mean, he's probably got enough money to keep going for a while, but if he loses that badly here, that's going to bound to bleed over into South Carolina and Nevada coming Havana -- South Carolina coming up. And it's pretty hard to imagine how you can survive."

He didn't have any great new ideas, he wasn't offering -- when you talk about Barack Obama hope and change. That's why I think the idea of tying yourself to Obama, there's a lot of affection for Barack Obama and the Democratic Party. But -- and I also wonder about the restoration versus structural change. Nobody wants restoration. Everybody always wants change. And people are always going to vote over the future over the past.

Then, the Department of Justice early this morning said, wait a minute that is too harsh. They are calling for a \"far less sentence\" but not giving a specific number. Roger Stone is looking at prison time for witness tampering and lying to Congress. The new U.S. Attorney overseeing the case, Tim Shea is close to eight of Attorney General Bill Barr. He actually just left his post here at DOJ just recently. A source says once DOJ officials saw the sentencing memo yesterday, they were upset, arguing it was too stiff. Then, came the tweet from President Trump, 1:49 this morning, calling the potential Stone sentence, \"a miscarriage of justice.\" The attorney general's spokeswoman tells Fox News, the decision to change the sentencing guidelines came before the Trump tweet and there was no communication between DOJ and the White House to change those sentencing guidelines.

Senator Elizabeth Warren supporters are fired up and fairly optimistic even though the Massachusetts senator has really struggled in this state despite almost having the homefield advantage here. She's been on par with Joe Biden in most of the polls, though the two have really employed some different tactics in the final days leading up to tonight. When Joe Biden went on the attack, Warren talked of party unity. When Joe Biden skipped ahead to South Carolina, Warren stayed here fighting for every last vote. And as you can see she has a huge army of volunteers on the ground across New Hampshire, perhaps the strongest ground game of any candidate in this race, which is why a disappointing finish here tonight would be all the more devastating for the future of her campaign. We have seen an 11th hour shift and strategy. Over the last few hours both Warren and her campaign has really started finally going on the offensive, criticizing Biden and Buttigieg and really drawing some distinctions between her and Bernie Sanders. But it may be too little, too late, especially with someone like Senator Amy Klobuchar nipping at her heels. And that is where we find my colleague Ellison Barber live in Concord."

At some point we expect the senator to come out here and address her supporters. You can see some of the chairs still being set up. We are told her staff will be in a room nearby watching the results. Klobuchar supporters are excited. They think that she could hit her stride in this state, especially with New Hampshire's independent voters. A key part of Klobuchar's pitch is that she believe she can pull in all kinds of voters, Republicans, Democrats, independents, people from big cities, the suburbs as well as rural communities. Klobuchar likes to say that she has the receipts to prove it. In 2016 President Trump's came within two percent of caring Minnesota. Two years later Senator Klobuchar won reelection to the United States Senate with 60 percent of the vote. At a Manchester polling location earlier today I spoke to a number of voters who said they were undecided or at least deciding between someone more moderate like Biden or Buttigieg, and then they saw Senator Klobuchar at the debate this week, and they said that is what made them move over and to support Klobuchar. The people here tonight are hoping that she has enough of those people to carry her through in this state. Bret, Martha?"

It means absolutely nothing, by the way. Klobuchar at eight, Sanders, four, and Elizabeth Warren, four down here. So we will see it populate, and the colors will start to fill in throughout the night. If you are watching trying to figure out New Hampshire and understand where the votes are going to coming from, I would divide the state into the three different parts. Number one, the southern tier, that's down here in Rockingham County, a lot of votes down here, bordered with Massachusetts over here and Hillsborough County where we are as well. A lot of votes as you can see based on four years ago. That is one section of the state, southern tier here. The other section you call maybe the liberal left, where Bernie Sanders did very well in 2016 and may do very well again today. This is the border with Vermont over here and Cheshire County, ran up the numbers four years ago. Up here in Grafton County, very similar for Bernie Sanders. So I'd look at those two areas. And the third area I would point to is what Stirewalt likes to call the capital corridor. This is the county of Merrimack. It has the capital city of Concord, and you could see strength there for maybe a Klobuchar, maybe a Buttigieg, maybe for a Warren. So we will see how that unfolds tonight. And again, first polls close at 7:00, then you get another batch at 7:30, then all the polls officially are done at 8:00 eastern time, about an hour and 15 minutes from now. But on the calendar, here's where we need to go. Here's where we are right now in February, right. It's Tuesday on the 11th, New Hampshire, 24 delegates at state. Between, you need to get to 2,000 to get the nomination. We got a long way to go, guys, that's coming up here tonight."
