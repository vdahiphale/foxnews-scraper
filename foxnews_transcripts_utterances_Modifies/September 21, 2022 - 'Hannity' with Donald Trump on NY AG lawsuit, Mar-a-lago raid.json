      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY. And tonight, we are in beautiful Palm Beach, Florida, broadcasting from Mar-A-Lago, where in just a moment the 45th President of the United States Donald J. Trump, he will join us for his very first sit-down interview since roughly 30 federal agents, guns drawn, stormed through the doors right here in the president's own home, now, in what was obviously an unprecedented raid historically. But we begin with a few serious questions to everybody watching tonight. Do we have, in America today, equal justice under the law? Do we have equal application of our laws in this country? Do our local, state, and federal officials, do they investigate crimes or prosecute people? If America's justice system is ever weaponized and politicized beyond repair, this country that we all love, we are in big trouble. Take a look at New York Attorney General Letitia James. Now, today she filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children and other entities, claiming that they inflated the value of the Trump Organization. It is nothing short of a very obvious political stunt. It is not a criminal case. It is a civil case. But after three years of non-stop obsessive investigations into every aspect of the president's life by Letitia James, she had to do something because during her race for attorney general in the state of New York, she seemed totally, completely uninterested with investigating crimes or keeping New York safe from violent offenders. It's less safe than it's ever been. Instead, her main campaign pledge was to go after one man, Donald Trump, and Donald Trump's family and Donald Trump's organization. Well, today in front of the entire nation, she fulfilled her campaign promise. Take a look.",

The state of New York set a brand-new record for the month of August: 5,838 residents in the state of New York have now switched, in 30 days -- 31 days, their driver's licenses from New York to Florida. That's in one month. Now, the attorney general isn't even trying to hide her efforts to weaponize justice in New York State. Her conduct is deeply unethical at best. But she's not alone, you know, from the Trump haters on Capitol Hill, high- ranking deep state bureaucrats in the DOJ, the FBI. Now we have witnessed, going on many years, the 45th president has been the subject of what is non-stop, never-ending legal scrutiny focused not on a specific crime but on the man himself. Now, this is an intense legal scrutiny that no Democrat has ever faced, no other president has ever faced. For example, for the first time in history, an American president's home was raided by the FBI. Biden, his main opponent in 2020 -- maybe 2024 -- well, his DOJ is accusing former President Trump of holding on to 103 classified documents after his presidency, and they have 1,100 that were not controversial in any way. And, by the way, the president can declassify any of these documents -- unlike, for example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, she cannot. We'll get to that in a minute. Still, she stored 110 classified documents on unsecured private servers. Hillary Clinton was never forced to endure a federal raid. She was never charged with any crime. Now here is James Comey, in his own words, outlined all the classified information that he and his FBI at the time, that they found. And then stating, no reasonable prosecutor would ever bring a case against Clinton. Take a look.",

And eight contained confidential information at the time. Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in our handling of very sensitive and highly classified information. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.",

SIM cards removed from phones and Blackberrys. One set of rules for Trump, another for Hillary Clinton. Now we see the same thing, by the way, with the Bidens -- Joe Biden and his family. As President Trump was impeached over a routine phone call with Ukraine saying, I hope you're not going to be like your predecessors and abuse the money of my taxpaying fellow Americans. Well, they accused President Trump at the time of a quid pro quo. They went to an impeachment over that. Apparently, though, on the other hand, it was perfectly fine, Joe Biden bragging on tape that he literally leveraged $1 billion of your taxpayer dollars to get a prosecutor in Ukraine fired.

When the investigation for his son Hunter, for public corruption, for years has been going on, zero-experience Hunter, that prosecutor was investigating. He went on GMA. No experience in oil, or gas, or energy, or Ukraine. And he was traveling the world with his father, selling access to the office of then-Vice President Biden, making millions of dollars from Communist China. $150 billion deal there, again, no experience. A Russian oligarch, the former first lady of Moscow, $3.5 million -- Kazakhstan and every corrupt country they could on the face of the Earth. And then, by the way, he allegedly funneled that money back to the United States. There were issues involving taxes there. Tony Bobulinski told the country that he had -- that he was the \"Big Guy.\" He sat in the meetings, saying were going to give him his percentage, meaning Joe Biden. And meanwhile, Hunter was on video with the laptop that everybody said three weeks before the 2020 election was Russian disinformation. It wasn't. But there he is smoking crack, soliciting foreign prostitutes and according -- and recording all of it on the laptop that the FBI has now had for years. Oh, and he also lied on a gun application, lost track of that gun. It ended up in a dumpster near an elementary school. But Hunter's home? His home was never raided. Joe's home, it's never been raided. We now have all the evidence that one could ever want that Joe Biden knew of, and knowingly profited from, his son's Hunter foreign business dealings. He lied to the country when he said, I've never one time talked to my son about his foreign business dealings. Now the media mob -- I'll know you're watching tonight, welcome aboard. They won't even ask him about why he lied. All the evidence exists. He did meet many of Hunter Biden's business partners -- foreign business partners. And according to whistleblowers, we're expecting a lot of them in the coming weeks and months, high-ranking federal officials intends to either slow walk or, in fact, block investigations into these apparent crimes. So, tonight, I ask the media mob, I know you're watching; I ask the attorney general, Merrick Garland, I know you're watching; I ask FBI Director Wray, I'm sure you're all watching, is this really the America you want? Is this the justice system that the American people deserve where political justice and vengeance is doled out by those in power while others are protected and shielded from prosecution? Because the pendulum, by the way, I will remind you, it will swing. And right now we are headed down a very dark path. And I want to be very clear, I'm very clear I'm a conservative. And I would never want in the United States of America, I believe the greatest country God gave man, any Democrat, any socialist to be treated unfairly, not to have equal justice or application of our laws. That would be unconstitutional. All right. Joining us now for the full hour, the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Mr. President, good to see you.",

I built a great company. You take places like this, so many other places that I have like this, frankly. I mean, just among the finest places anywhere in the world. I actually thought that they would never bring a case, and she brought it. And the reason I thought, because she didn't have a case. I was of the impression she wanted to settle. But I had a problem because how do you pay something, even if it's a small amount of money, if you're not guilty? This was just a continuation of a witch hunt that began when I came down the escalator at Trump Tower with our -- who would know? Our great future first lady who has done a great job and people love her. But we came down the escalator and it started. But I'm so proud of what we did. We had the strongest border in the country. We had the biggest tax cuts and regulation cuts. We had the best employment ever in the country. We were energy independent. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We would have been energy dominant throughout the world in a very short period of time. Much larger than Russia, much larger than Saudi Arabia put together. We were all set. And then they came along and they just dismantled that. They wouldn't finish the wall. The wall was completed, the original section was completed. And I said, let's do more. We did more. He could have had that finished in three weeks. And now you have millions and millions of people pouring through. We had the strongest border in history. And by the way, that included drugs too. We had drugs down 19 percent from what they were the previous year, and 20 percent from what they were that previous year.

      "utterance": "And welcome to HANNITY. And tonight, we are in beautiful Palm Beach, Florida, broadcasting from Mar-A-Lago, where in just a moment the 45th President of the United States Donald J. Trump, he will join us for his very first sit-down interview since roughly 30 federal agents, guns drawn, stormed through the doors right here in the president's own home, now, in what was obviously an unprecedented raid historically. But we begin with a few serious questions to everybody watching tonight. Do we have, in America today, equal justice under the law? Do we have equal application of our laws in this country? Do our local, state, and federal officials, do they investigate crimes or prosecute people? If America's justice system is ever weaponized and politicized beyond repair, this country that we all love, we are in big trouble. Take a look at New York Attorney General Letitia James. Now, today she filed a lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children and other entities, claiming that they inflated the value of the Trump Organization. It is nothing short of a very obvious political stunt. It is not a criminal case. It is a civil case. But after three years of non-stop obsessive investigations into every aspect of the president's life by Letitia James, she had to do something because during her race for attorney general in the state of New York, she seemed totally, completely uninterested with investigating crimes or keeping New York safe from violent offenders. It's less safe than it's ever been. Instead, her main campaign pledge was to go after one man, Donald Trump, and Donald Trump's family and Donald Trump's organization. Well, today in front of the entire nation, she fulfilled her campaign promise. Take a look."

That man of the White House who can't go a day without threatening our fundamental rights. Yes we need to focus on Donald Trump and his abuses. We need to follow his money. We need to find out where he has laundered money. We need to find out whether or not he is engaged in conspiracy."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, is it any number these numbers came out today? The state of New York set a brand-new record for the month of August: 5,838 residents in the state of New York have now switched, in 30 days -- 31 days, their driver's licenses from New York to Florida. That's in one month. Now, the attorney general isn't even trying to hide her efforts to weaponize justice in New York State. Her conduct is deeply unethical at best. But she's not alone, you know, from the Trump haters on Capitol Hill, high- ranking deep state bureaucrats in the DOJ, the FBI. Now we have witnessed, going on many years, the 45th president has been the subject of what is non-stop, never-ending legal scrutiny focused not on a specific crime but on the man himself. Now, this is an intense legal scrutiny that no Democrat has ever faced, no other president has ever faced. For example, for the first time in history, an American president's home was raided by the FBI. Biden, his main opponent in 2020 -- maybe 2024 -- well, his DOJ is accusing former President Trump of holding on to 103 classified documents after his presidency, and they have 1,100 that were not controversial in any way. And, by the way, the president can declassify any of these documents -- unlike, for example, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, she cannot. We'll get to that in a minute. Still, she stored 110 classified documents on unsecured private servers. Hillary Clinton was never forced to endure a federal raid. She was never charged with any crime. Now here is James Comey, in his own words, outlined all the classified information that he and his FBI at the time, that they found. And then stating, no reasonable prosecutor would ever bring a case against Clinton. Take a look."

Eight of those chains contain information that was top-secret at the time they were sent, 36 of those chains contained secret information at the time. And eight contained confidential information at the time. Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in our handling of very sensitive and highly classified information. Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case."

Well, she washed those servers -- those hard drives clean with Bleach Bit. Now, the country knows what it is. Also, communication devices, they were destroyed with hammers. SIM cards removed from phones and Blackberrys. One set of rules for Trump, another for Hillary Clinton. Now we see the same thing, by the way, with the Bidens -- Joe Biden and his family. As President Trump was impeached over a routine phone call with Ukraine saying, I hope you're not going to be like your predecessors and abuse the money of my taxpaying fellow Americans. Well, they accused President Trump at the time of a quid pro quo. They went to an impeachment over that. Apparently, though, on the other hand, it was perfectly fine, Joe Biden bragging on tape that he literally leveraged $1 billion of your taxpayer dollars to get a prosecutor in Ukraine fired. We find out why, for investigating his son who's making millions with no experience. Is this equal justice? Take a look."

When the investigation for his son Hunter, for public corruption, for years has been going on, zero-experience Hunter, that prosecutor was investigating. He went on GMA. No experience in oil, or gas, or energy, or Ukraine. And he was traveling the world with his father, selling access to the office of then-Vice President Biden, making millions of dollars from Communist China. $150 billion deal there, again, no experience. A Russian oligarch, the former first lady of Moscow, $3.5 million -- Kazakhstan and every corrupt country they could on the face of the Earth. And then, by the way, he allegedly funneled that money back to the United States. There were issues involving taxes there. Tony Bobulinski told the country that he had -- that he was the \"Big Guy.\" He sat in the meetings, saying were going to give him his percentage, meaning Joe Biden. And meanwhile, Hunter was on video with the laptop that everybody said three weeks before the 2020 election was Russian disinformation. It wasn't. But there he is smoking crack, soliciting foreign prostitutes and according -- and recording all of it on the laptop that the FBI has now had for years. Oh, and he also lied on a gun application, lost track of that gun. It ended up in a dumpster near an elementary school. But Hunter's home? His home was never raided. Joe's home, it's never been raided. We now have all the evidence that one could ever want that Joe Biden knew of, and knowingly profited from, his son's Hunter foreign business dealings. He lied to the country when he said, I've never one time talked to my son about his foreign business dealings. Now the media mob -- I'll know you're watching tonight, welcome aboard. They won't even ask him about why he lied. All the evidence exists. He did meet many of Hunter Biden's business partners -- foreign business partners. And according to whistleblowers, we're expecting a lot of them in the coming weeks and months, high-ranking federal officials intends to either slow walk or, in fact, block investigations into these apparent crimes. So, tonight, I ask the media mob, I know you're watching; I ask the attorney general, Merrick Garland, I know you're watching; I ask FBI Director Wray, I'm sure you're all watching, is this really the America you want? Is this the justice system that the American people deserve where political justice and vengeance is doled out by those in power while others are protected and shielded from prosecution? Because the pendulum, by the way, I will remind you, it will swing. And right now we are headed down a very dark path. And I want to be very clear, I'm very clear I'm a conservative. And I would never want in the United States of America, I believe the greatest country God gave man, any Democrat, any socialist to be treated unfairly, not to have equal justice or application of our laws. That would be unconstitutional. All right. Joining us now for the full hour, the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump. Mr. President, good to see you."

She knew nothing about me. I never heard of her. But I saw this woman, I saw the statements she was putting out without knowing anything. And she said, we're going to get him. Her whole campaign was based on that. And then she came after us. We've been going over this for years. And I actually thought because our values are really high. The company is great. I built a great company. You take places like this, so many other places that I have like this, frankly. I mean, just among the finest places anywhere in the world. I actually thought that they would never bring a case, and she brought it. And the reason I thought, because she didn't have a case. I was of the impression she wanted to settle. But I had a problem because how do you pay something, even if it's a small amount of money, if you're not guilty? This was just a continuation of a witch hunt that began when I came down the escalator at Trump Tower with our -- who would know? Our great future first lady who has done a great job and people love her. But we came down the escalator and it started. But I'm so proud of what we did. We had the strongest border in the country. We had the biggest tax cuts and regulation cuts. We had the best employment ever in the country. We were energy independent. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We would have been energy dominant throughout the world in a very short period of time. Much larger than Russia, much larger than Saudi Arabia put together. We were all set. And then they came along and they just dismantled that. They wouldn't finish the wall. The wall was completed, the original section was completed. And I said, let's do more. We did more. He could have had that finished in three weeks. And now you have millions and millions of people pouring through. We had the strongest border in history. And by the way, that included drugs too. We had drugs down 19 percent from what they were the previous year, and 20 percent from what they were that previous year. We were doing great and now the drugs are pouring into our country at a level that nobody has seen. And the people, they're emptying out their prisons --"

I have the best property. What happened, Sean, is we have a disclaimer right on the front. And it basically says, you know, get your own people. You're at your own risk. This was done by management. It wasn't done by -- it was done by management. So don't rely on the statement that you're getting. And it's -- and by the way, it goes on for like a page-and-a-half. It's a very big disclaimer. It's a very powerful disclaimer. It basically says to an institution, you're going to loan money, you have to go out and make sure that, you know, you get your own appraisers, your own lawyers, everything.

I built a great company, a powerful company, a company that's very lowly leveraged with among the best assets anywhere in the world. I mean, you look at this asset, she has this down as $75 million. I can tell you it's many times that number. She said, oh, he valued it at 75 or whatever it was worth, she valued at 75, what does Letitia James know? But if I were going -- I don't have a mortgage on this property (ph). If I was going to put a mortgage on this property, the institutions are going to be coming over.

It's a big complex. And you had 100 -- you had a lot of people here, I don't know how many, but you had a lot of people. They wouldn't let anyone inside. And, you know, if you look at NARA and if you look at the FBI over the last 10, 15 years, and if you look at all of the things that the Justice Department what's taken place. When you look at what took place with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax -- Sean, they spied on my campaign, what could be worse? Could you imagine -- take Obama, if we spied on his campaign, it would probably be death sentence. They spied on my campaign even when I was in the White House.

Well, you could also say 33 million documents or pages with President Obama. That's very questionable. Thirty-three million, not 33,000. Happens to be a similar number, 33 million, they're fighting over `em or arguing over `em. The problem that you have is they go into rooms -- they won't let anybody near -- they wouldn't even let them in the same building. Did they drop anything on those piles? Or did they do it later? There's no chain of custody here with them."

If you're the president of the United States, you can declassify just by saying, it's declassified. Even by thinking about it, because you're sending it to Mar-a-Lago or to wherever you're sending it. And there doesn't have to be a process. There can be a process, but there doesn't have to be. You're the president, you make that decision. So when you send it, it's declassified. We -- I declassified everything. Now, I declassified things, and we were having a lot of problems with NARA. You know, NARA is a radical left group of people running that thing, and when you send documents over there, I would say there's a very good chance that a lot of those documents will never be seen again. There's also a lot of speculation because of what they did, the severity of the FBI coming and raiding Mar-a-Lago. Were they looking for the Hillary Clinton e-mails that were deleted but they are around someplace. Or were they looking for the spying on Trump's --"

So, my -- my next question is, if in fact they couldn't get the -- they couldn't get the FISA warrant according to Andrew McCabe without Hillary's dossier, they ruined Carter Page's life and then because there was a connection to you that was a backdoor to your campaign, your transition team, and your presidency. Here's my question, Danchenko was the source for Christopher Steele."

Think of this, with the Mueller witch hunt, another one of the witch hunts, at least I tell you what, we've shown the people of this country there is such corruption whether it be elections, whether it be open borders, whether it be the kind of things we're talking about right now. The corruption is unbelievable. They have a high man in the FBI and I think they just perp walked him out of the building a couple of weeks ago, right, when they found it. They were paying -- he was in charge of -- think of this, he was in charge of for Mueller, for the Mueller group of 18 radical left Democrat haters who said no collusion, there was collusion after two years. But he was in charge, he worked for the FBI. They walked him out of the building. They walked him out. They got rid of him. But how is that fair to me? So when somebody says like you're not very trusting of the FBI, there have to be changes made, Sean, because our country is sick. Our country has so many problems right now. Our country is sick.
