      "sentences": "Great to see you tonight, Dana. Thank you so much. We begin with a Fox News alert.  I'm Shannon Bream in for Bret Baier.  With just four days to go there appears to be some signal that President Trump and congressional Democrats may strike a deal to keep the government open past the Friday midnight deadline. At least that's what White House is saying. The President is insisting on billions of dollars for border security and his wall.  White House officials think they can strike a deal. On the Hill though, it's anybody's guess because folks there aren't aware of any plan. Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight with breaking details. Good evening -- John.",

      "sentences": "Good evening to you -- Shannon. The White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight has been up on Capitol Hill all afternoon looking to put together some sort of Christmas miracle and it's beginning to look like the White House's hard line on a border wall may not be so hard after all.  Out there already is a proposal for a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded through the end of fiscal year of '19 -- that's September 30 of 2019. It would provide $1.6 billion for about 65 miles of border fence through the Rio Grande sector of the southern border. That is one of the most active areas when it comes to cross border migration. It wouldn't all be dedicated toward building a wall but certainly a lot of it would.   Democrats have already indicated that they may be able to support such a proposal in the House. And there is an increasing sentiment among many Republicans that they would rather go for a continuing resolution than shutdown the government over Christmas. Now the $1.6 billion is far less than the $5 billion that the President has been looking for. So I'm told by sources, watch for the White House to seek a legal opinion on whether it can use money from the Defense Appropriation, and this would be for Defense construction about $3.4 billion to start building portions of the wall through the Department of Defense budget. Now such a move would likely provoke howls of outrage among lawmakers on Capitol Hill who would complain and make the case that the President can't just shift around money in the Defense budget as he pleases. But the White House may try to find a legal opinion allowing them to at least do some of that.   Now while the President is likely going to have to accept less if he wants a deal this week than what he was looking for, he did find other reasons to be optimistic that some of the other changes that he is looking for in other areas may in fact come to pass.",

      "sentences": "Good evening - - Shannon. So like you mentioned, it was a rocky day on Wall Street with a huge selloff in actually the last hour of the trading day. You had U.S. equity indexes slide to their lowest close in 14 months. So all markets pretty much like you mentioned down 2 percent.  Investors though have to grapple with several issues. Firstly, there is a high chance the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates on Wednesday making it the fourth hike of the year.  Investors will pay close attention to Chairman Jay Powell and his wording.  Will we see just two rate hikes in 2019 or more? Keep in mind when the Fed hikes interest rates that affects all debt, like corporate debts, student loans and mortgages. Secondly there is this continuous concern about global growth slow down.  Weaker economic data from China and Europe are pushing analysts to trim forecasts. Those fears weighed heavily on oil today which closed below $50 U.S. a barrel, a 14-month low.   Also the U.S. dollar continues to climb higher and that makes oil more expensive for other countries further hurting demand. And you've got a supply glut so these are all reasons why we saw the energy sector lowered today. And lastly, you've got healthcare stocks that did take a tumble after a Texas judge ruled that Obamacare was unconstitutional. So you have three stocks on your screen right now -- Molina, HCA, and Community Health Systems. Look at that, down 13.5 percent because of the ruling.  Overall though, the Dow and the S&P are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression even though December is typically a positive month for markets. So investors are still waiting for that Santa rally -- Shannon.",

It's extraordinary. Having said that, I also think it's kind of extraordinary that Comey over time now has become so enmeshed in this, so partisan. I am not sure that's necessarily to his personal benefit. But on this one, at least on the substance, I think he is right.",

We have the FBI and Department of Justice going after Hillary Clinton for breaking the law and classified information in which we saw the Department of Justice and FBI just bend over backwards, giving immunity, handing it out like candy, getting nothing in return, declining to prosecute anyone for false statements even though a ton of people had made false statements. And then just a few months later you have them going after anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign and squeezing them to within and inch of their life. Whereas Hillary Clinton, all of her attorneys got immunity, you have the FBI going after Cohen and seizing his records, and using this pretext of Russia collusion that we now know -- a lot of headlines today were about how that whole Russia collusion story is falling apart. The centerpiece of that, that Michael Cohen had gone to Prague and traded money for information, it's all falling apart.

All fair.

With just four days to go there appears to be some signal that President Trump and congressional Democrats may strike a deal to keep the government open past the Friday midnight deadline. At least that's what White House is saying. The President is insisting on billions of dollars for border security and his wall. White House officials think they can strike a deal. On the Hill though, it's anybody's guess because folks there aren't aware of any plan. Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight with breaking details. Good evening -- John."

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening to you -- Shannon. The White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight has been up on Capitol Hill all afternoon looking to put together some sort of Christmas miracle and it's beginning to look like the White House's hard line on a border wall may not be so hard after all. Out there already is a proposal for a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded through the end of fiscal year of '19 -- that's September 30 of 2019. It would provide $1.6 billion for about 65 miles of border fence through the Rio Grande sector of the southern border. That is one of the most active areas when it comes to cross border migration. It wouldn't all be dedicated toward building a wall but certainly a lot of it would. Democrats have already indicated that they may be able to support such a proposal in the House. And there is an increasing sentiment among many Republicans that they would rather go for a continuing resolution than shutdown the government over Christmas. Now the $1.6 billion is far less than the $5 billion that the President has been looking for. So I'm told by sources, watch for the White House to seek a legal opinion on whether it can use money from the Defense Appropriation, and this would be for Defense construction about $3.4 billion to start building portions of the wall through the Department of Defense budget. Now such a move would likely provoke howls of outrage among lawmakers on Capitol Hill who would complain and make the case that the President can't just shift around money in the Defense budget as he pleases. But the White House may try to find a legal opinion allowing them to at least do some of that. Now while the President is likely going to have to accept less if he wants a deal this week than what he was looking for, he did find other reasons to be optimistic that some of the other changes that he is looking for in other areas may in fact come to pass."

      "utterance": "Good evening - - Shannon. So like you mentioned, it was a rocky day on Wall Street with a huge selloff in actually the last hour of the trading day. You had U.S. equity indexes slide to their lowest close in 14 months. So all markets pretty much like you mentioned down 2 percent. Investors though have to grapple with several issues. Firstly, there is a high chance the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates on Wednesday making it the fourth hike of the year. Investors will pay close attention to Chairman Jay Powell and his wording.  Will we see just two rate hikes in 2019 or more? Keep in mind when the Fed hikes interest rates that affects all debt, like corporate debts, student loans and mortgages. Secondly there is this continuous concern about global growth slow down.  Weaker economic data from China and Europe are pushing analysts to trim forecasts. Those fears weighed heavily on oil today which closed below $50 U.S. a barrel, a 14-month low. Also the U.S. dollar continues to climb higher and that makes oil more expensive for other countries further hurting demand. And you've got a supply glut so these are all reasons why we saw the energy sector lowered today. And lastly, you've got healthcare stocks that did take a tumble after a Texas judge ruled that Obamacare was unconstitutional. So you have three stocks on your screen right now -- Molina, HCA, and Community Health Systems. Look at that, down 13.5 percent because of the ruling. Overall though, the Dow and the S&P are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression even though December is typically a positive month for markets.

Up next, residents of a California community destroyed by wildfire return to what is left of their homes -- we talk about how to prevent disasters like this in the future. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 11 in Los Angeles, as California backs off a proposal to impose a tax on text messaging. The move came after the Federal Communications Commission in Washington declared text messaging to be an information service, not a telecommunication service and thus not subject to a surcharge under California law. Fox 13 in Tampa as Republican Governor Elect Ron DeSantis wants to delay an amendment restoring voting rights to more than a million felons who have served their time. The amendment passed with nearly 65 percent of the vote in November. DeSantis says the legislature should clarify the language in the bill before sending it to his desk. Supporters of the amendment say the Governor-elect is dragging his feet. And this is a live look at New York from Fox 5.

All of us this afternoon, our phones blowing up, the back and forth what's happening, senators on the Hill going into meeting, saying I don't know about any kind of deal. John Roberts reporting from the White House tonight that the president is considering getting it to $3.4 billion of the defense budget, of their budget, Chuck, to get this wall done. Can he do that?"

If they don't know, how would I know? But the big picture is that, once again, they are fighting over this wall funding, which, let it be remembered, was supposed to come from Mexico back at the beginning. But now it's gone down, even from $20 billion was the price of the big thing now to $5 billion, and they can't even get that. I think the president threw his own team, his own fellow Republicans kind of a curve when he said I will be proud to shut down the government over this, and I think a lot of them on the Hill are like, wait, what do you mean? We are trying to avoid the blame for this. And ever since then he hasn't been able to organize a response. I think people up on the Hill are a little nervous that their leader in the White House doesn't understand their predicament, doesn't quite understand the politics of this. On the other hand, I do think what the president understands is the politics of the Republican base which does appreciate seeing him fight tooth and nail for what he promised to do in the campaign."

I think Chuck is absolutely right that this has been a curveball for Republicans. But of course, the problems with border enforcement and border security, they developed in a bipartisan fashion. Both parties seem to have an interest in not solving anything. I think a lot of people thought President Trump actually had a stronger hand several months ago.  But he knows that enough budgets have been passed that this won't be a complete shutdown of the government, and that it might be something that he thinks he can get through in part because you can't play all of the tricks and gimmicks that you usually do with the government shutdown of closing the most popular destinations and acting like the end of the world is at hand."

I think they are tired of being in the majority, they're tired of having to pass legislation and say things, and this will let them just be a bunch of boo-birds in the back of the House hollering at Democrats and what they're doing. But we will remember this -- we are talking about, at the current, 900,000 federal employees, half of whom would be furloughed, not go to work, not get paid and not go to work.

That's also something that's probably going to radically change in January once Democrats gain control of those committees. But there is some tweeting back and forth amongst all of this. The president tweeting on this about Michael Cohen. \"Remember Michael Cohen only became a \"Rat\" after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable and unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started.  They broke into an attorney's office. Why didn't they break into the DNC to get the server or Crooked's office?\" Assuming he means Hillary there.  Comey tweeting back, \"This is from the president of our country lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge.

There was a properly executed warrant. It wasn't like they barged in the door or broke it down or something. And the president is adopting a tone and a language that's totally unbecoming of the office to refer to somebody as a rat even if you don't like him, even if he testified against you. It's extraordinary. Having said that, I also think it's kind of extraordinary that Comey over time now has become so enmeshed in this, so partisan. I am not sure that's necessarily to his personal benefit. But on this one, at least on the substance, I think he is right."

And this comes after just days ago that we reported on he publicly said that they got away with something in the way that they took the Flynn interview, told him he didn't need an attorney, didn't advise him that lying could get you in trouble, which, hey, as a military guy and national security expert most folks would assume he would know. But for him to publicly talk about getting away with something against this administration doesn't help his case."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "No, and the fact that people laughed when he said it, or cheered, was also unbecoming of the country. I totally agree with what Chuck is saying about the tweet being unbecoming for the president to use that type of language. But the deeper issue at hand is in fact about whether we are seeing abuse of prosecutorial discretion. We have a really good test case. We have the FBI and Department of Justice going after Hillary Clinton for breaking the law and classified information in which we saw the Department of Justice and FBI just bend over backwards, giving immunity, handing it out like candy, getting nothing in return, declining to prosecute anyone for false statements even though a ton of people had made false statements. And then just a few months later you have them going after anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign and squeezing them to within and inch of their life. Whereas Hillary Clinton, all of her attorneys got immunity, you have the FBI going after Cohen and seizing his records, and using this pretext of Russia collusion that we now know -- a lot of headlines today were about how that whole Russia collusion story is falling apart. The centerpiece of that, that Michael Cohen had gone to Prague and traded money for information, it's all falling apart. And yet we still have this investigation, and it really was done differently than how Hillary Clinton was investigated."

And I believe that Mollie and other fair-minded, patriotic minded Americans would say, they just want equal protection.  Michael Cohen did a lot of bad stuff. Michael Cohen did a ton of bad stuff not related to the president, and some of it related to the president, some of it related and the campaign. He has pleaded guilty. He is going to prison. I know that there are a lot of Republicans that say Hillary should be gone back after. It's time to drive the bus back around and look at Hillary Clinton again, and do it right this time, and take the findings of the inspector general's report and do it right with Hillary again, and that she should be held to account for her mishandling of state secrets as secretary of state, or for misdeeds of the Clinton Foundation. All fair. The political predicament for this administration and for this president is the damage done because of the lies told about Stormy Daniels and campaign finance and really relatively minor stuff compared to what we're talking about in the rest of the investigation. And polls have illustrated it clearly, the president's credibility weakened. Trust in Mueller is up.  And as Mueller continues to get results, people are going to be less likely to hear from Trump as the aggrieved party."

We had a heated email from him over the weekend about how they're going to use or share data. Chris, there's some internal differences on this."

      "utterance": "Your context here is that the Democrats are right badly, badly, badly outgunned on their data operation. Hillary Clinton ate alone. She left a DNC that was a laughable shell. She ran her own campaign, everything through Brooklyn. Republicans, meantime, the Trump campaign teamed up with the RNC. They have a robust data operation that they have continued humming along with.  They know lots and lots and lots, and have already a track record to prove that they can take it to the field. The Democrats are stumped on this. And here's what's going on. You have the chairman of the Democratic National Committee that says to his party, screaming we are in huge trouble. We have to do something dramatic here. And what he is getting is that the fiefdoms on the state level, these state chairmen say we are not sharing our data with you. We're not breaking down our stuff. And Perez is frustrated because he knows they're only going to have a matter of weeks to ramp up their data operation once they have a nominee."

      "utterance": "There further might be a little bit of context that there's some competing financial interests, one party wants a private firm to handle it, the other wants the trust to handle it. But it's also true that this is in the context of this great centralized control of the Democratic Party that didn't work out so well for them in 2016. It was a very top down measure of making sure Hillary Clinton was the nominee. That really angered some of the more progressive wing, and they understand that who controls various assets also controls the direction of the party, and there's needing to be a debate about whether you go for a 50-state strategy, which Tom Perez is very much in favor of, or whether you let some of the more progressive elements experiment and try and get votes that way."

      "utterance": "I'm old enough to remember when we as Democrats thought we had a significant advantage in digital and targeting in data and all that kind of stuff ahead of the 2016 election. And lo and behold we were lapped by the Republican operation, the Trump operation on this."

      "utterance": "I have to say it's a little bit over my head because I'm in the generation that doesn't know that much about data. But I will say this. I think part what went wrong with Hillary Clinton and data was that they modelled the electorate the wrong way and they put their resources in the wrong places, and she didn't go to Wisconsin because they told her they had Wisconsin locked up and all that kind of stuff. But this is really inside baseball to voters. Who has the data, and we are not even in 2019 let alone 2020 yet. I understand why the Republicans have been blast emailing this story out to all journalists because they want to change the narrative a little bit. The truth of the matter is Tom Perez is right. The Democrats are back. They did just won a big victory and put the Republicans back on their heels in this last fall. And I guess the frustration of Tom Perez must be, gee, guys, we are going great now.  Everything is fine. I presided over the victory would be his point. So why aren't you listening to me and following my suggestions? And I do think Mollie has a part. Part of what's going on is that lingering distrust of the DNC left over from the whole fight between Bernie and the left and Hillary and the center. But I think Democrats other than this little spat are doing pretty well right now."

So we'll see if they get this ironed out.  And listen, you know we've been on 2020 since the midterms, since before the midterms. This election is well under way. All right, thank you all very much. Stick around. When we come back, a surprise visit from the president."

Every December the organization places wreathes on the graves at veterans' cemeteries. If you ever get a chance to do this, you should. It is an amazing day. This even this year was the 27th at Arlington, honoring the men and women who have served in the military. That is it for “Special Report” tonight. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington.
