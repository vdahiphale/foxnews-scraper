Speaker the House at that time was Newt Gingrich, who presided over the vote. He will join us in just a few minutes to talk about this moment, 21 years later, only this time the party's roles are reversed with House Democrats preparing to vote on their resolution to begin a formal impeachment inquiry into the Republican President Donald Trump. But aside from the party in power, not much about the language surrounding this process seems to have changed.",

The fact is that they're not doing anything that's serious. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader is already listed a whole series of things wrong with what they're doing.

Remember they've had months now of gathering secret information, totally controlled by Adam Schiff, and what is almost a Stalinist model of a closed system. All of that should become public as part of this. And now they're basically trying to say, now that we've done all this work and laid all this groundwork and have all the secret information, now we want to talk about things. Part of the deal ought to be, make available to the Republicans and to the White House every single memo, every e-mail, every interview that they've undertaken in secret.

This is an unusual proceeding, neither the Democrats in 1973 nor the Republicans in 1998 did anything as one-sided, secretive, and destructive as what Pelosi and Schiff have done.

And you go through district after district.  Then, the numbers when you go out to individual districts -- you know, in Los Angeles and in New York, there's overwhelming support for this.

The fact is we've never in American history had this kind of process where people are saying, I'm against Trump as a person, I don't care if he did something or not impeach him anyway. And so, she has a huge base of her party that absolutely insists that they move forward on impeachment. And people like AOC now probably have more emotional power in the conference than Nancy does.

Today, a top NSC Ukraine expert became the latest to invoke the name of the president's former national security advisor.  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, recounted a key meeting with Ukrainian officials in July, claimed that Bolton was present, but that he stopped the meeting short after hearing what sounded like a quid pro quo from the E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland. Prior witnesses who claimed that they raised similar concerns to Bolton testified that he directed them to talk to legal counsel at NSC, adding, \"I'm not part of whatever drug deal, Sondland, and Mulvaney are cooking up.\" Now, that quote comes from the testimony, not from Bolton himself, but that was the recollection of two people who testified.  Now, the question now is does he become key in this process? And considering his less than amicable exit from the White House, whose side would he be on?  A new CNN op-ed puts it this way, \"As a private citizen, Bolton doesn't have to coordinate his testimony with anyone and no longer being at the White House, probably isn't worried about retribution.\" Here now, Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary under George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. And just happy he didn't have to deal with impeachment when he was at the White House, but these folks do.  So, what you make of John Bolton? Always an interesting person, an interesting dynamic. Very -- you know, sort of strong in his belief system, very conservative. What do you think here?",

Senior defense officials tell me he was referring to an operation that occurred following the Baghdadi compound raid when U.S. forces targeted the so-called ISIS spokesman Abul-Hasan al-Muhajir whom Kurdish SDF leader General Mazloum tweeted about two days ago. Muhajir was killed by a joint U.S.-Kurdish operation. This individual, I'm told, was more than a spokesman. I'm also told the killing of the two top ISIS leaders in Syria is significant because beneath them are much weaker successors and killing these top two leaders will leave a leadership vacuum inside ISIS in Syria. Intelligence from Baghdadi's compound is still being exploited. Baghdadi's number two was living about three hours from Baghdadi's compound in Idlib province also just miles from the Turkish border. General Mazloum, the Kurdish general who leads the Syrian Democratic Forces who partnered with the U.S. military to defeat ISIS told fox's Ben Hall that Kurdish intelligence had a source inside Baghdadi's inner circle inside the compound who led U.S. special operations forces there. The source even collected Baghdadi's dirty underwear and a sample of his blood for DNA verification before the raid. According to Mazloum, the Kurdish intelligence asset in Baghdadi's inner circle was one of the two adult males captured alive and mentioned yesterday at the Pentagon press briefing.",

He stormed onto the scene, built a terrorist army, invaded a country with 40,000 troops and had his headquarters in Syria. No other modern terrorist organization has ever achieved that. That's why worldwide he had 30 or 40 affiliates. He conducted dozens of attacks outside of the region. He conducted multiple attacks on nine NATO nations to include the United States. Either directed or inspired. This will impact him adversely. Are they going to go away? No. They are in ideology. They don't go away into these youngsters who were drawn to this fanaticism no longer see that as a purposeful life.

The fact is that they're not doing anything that's serious. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader is already listed a whole series of things wrong with what they're doing. They're not giving the president real access for his lawyers. They're not allowing the Republicans to have real parity. They're also are not releasing all the stuff. Remember they've had months now of gathering secret information, totally controlled by Adam Schiff, and what is almost a Stalinist model of a closed system. All of that should become public as part of this. And now they're basically trying to say, now that we've done all this work and laid all this groundwork and have all the secret information, now we want to talk about things. Part of the deal ought to be, make available to the Republicans and to the White House every single memo, every e-mail, every interview that they've undertaken in secret. And I think it's a -- this is totally -- this totally fails the test they'll sent by Lindsey Graham in the Senate."

You know, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution guarantees us due process. This president has been denied due process. This is an unusual proceeding, neither the Democrats in 1973 nor the Republicans in 1998 did anything as one-sided, secretive, and destructive as what Pelosi and Schiff have done. And you can go back and look at the record, you can read a terrific book by Jim -- Congressman Jim Rogan called catching the flag.

They basically have to beg to get what they want. The ranking members, they don't just get it automatically, they've got to go through a process to get, you know, sort of equal time in this process.

You don't have to answer that, which is just weird. So, let's talk about the politics here because Nancy Pelosi was resistant for quite some time on impeachment. So, why do you think now she is moving forward? What has changed for her? And do you think she's made a smart calculation as a politician?"

      "speaker": "GINGRICH",

I think that the Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell resolution served notice that they had to do something or was literally dead on arrival in the Senate. I think the White House blocking them and refusing to do things until there was a vote moved them. But she has a real problem, and I said months ago, now having been Speaker of the House, she can probably pass this resolution if she's suicidal, which he's going to kill their majority. I mean, if you're Congressman Peterson and you're in northern Minnesota, and you're in a 30-point Trump district, voting yes on Thursday, basically is the end of your career. And you go through district after district. Then, the numbers when you go out to individual districts -- you know, in Los Angeles and in New York, there's overwhelming support for this. You go out into marginal districts held by Democrats that Trump either carried or came close. There's not support for this and I think that she would destroy her majority."

    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "No, I think, Nadler failed so badly in his two public hearings were so embarrassingly bad. That she had to do something just to catch -- just to sort of reclaim the momentum. But here is the core problem. This is a sore loser impeachment process. 70 percent of the people who favor impeachment favored it the morning after the election. The fact is we've never in American history had this kind of process where people are saying, I'm against Trump as a person, I don't care if he did something or not impeach him anyway. And so, she has a huge base of her party that absolutely insists that they move forward on impeachment. And people like AOC now probably have more emotional power in the conference than Nancy does. She is presiding over it but I don't think she anymore has the capacity to lead it. I think their left is leading it and they're leading it, I think, in a disastrous direction."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, there's one name that keeps coming up in the impeachment hearing's discussion and that is John Bolton. Today, a top NSC Ukraine expert became the latest to invoke the name of the president's former national security advisor. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, recounted a key meeting with Ukrainian officials in July, claimed that Bolton was present, but that he stopped the meeting short after hearing what sounded like a quid pro quo from the E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland. Prior witnesses who claimed that they raised similar concerns to Bolton testified that he directed them to talk to legal counsel at NSC, adding, \"I'm not part of whatever drug deal, Sondland, and Mulvaney are cooking up.\" Now, that quote comes from the testimony, not from Bolton himself, but that was the recollection of two people who testified. Now, the question now is does he become key in this process? And considering his less than amicable exit from the White House, whose side would he be on? A new CNN op-ed puts it this way, \"As a private citizen, Bolton doesn't have to coordinate his testimony with anyone and no longer being at the White House, probably isn't worried about retribution.\" Here now, Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary under George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. And just happy he didn't have to deal with impeachment when he was at the White House, but these folks do. So, what you make of John Bolton? Always an interesting person, an interesting dynamic. Very -- you know, sort of strong in his belief system, very conservative. What do you think here?"

What do you see him -- I mean, you know, you can't put yourself obviously in his mind, but you know, is it the \"this is not an impeachable offense, this is what happened but I don't see it that way,\" is that what you would --"

He still might be covered under executive privilege and that's the decision he and his lawyers will have to make so we shouldn't get too far ahead. But if he goes, I think on the key quote which has been attributed to him about a drug deal, I think what he's going to say is the obvious. He had some questions. There were some things he heard that gave him pause and he thought it was appropriate not to pursue that but it's the President's judgment at the end of the day that gets to make those decisions. I think knowing John, that's where he's going to go on this. If he had doubts, he kept them to himself, and he excused himself from participating any event that led to something he didn't support."

The President tweeted that Baghdadi's number two is now dead. Senior defense officials tell me he was referring to an operation that occurred following the Baghdadi compound raid when U.S. forces targeted the so-called ISIS spokesman Abul-Hasan al-Muhajir whom Kurdish SDF leader General Mazloum tweeted about two days ago. Muhajir was killed by a joint U.S.-Kurdish operation. This individual, I'm told, was more than a spokesman. I'm also told the killing of the two top ISIS leaders in Syria is significant because beneath them are much weaker successors and killing these top two leaders will leave a leadership vacuum inside ISIS in Syria. Intelligence from Baghdadi's compound is still being exploited. Baghdadi's number two was living about three hours from Baghdadi's compound in Idlib province also just miles from the Turkish border. General Mazloum, the Kurdish general who leads the Syrian Democratic Forces who partnered with the U.S. military to defeat ISIS told fox's Ben Hall that Kurdish intelligence had a source inside Baghdadi's inner circle inside the compound who led U.S. special operations forces there. The source even collected Baghdadi's dirty underwear and a sample of his blood for DNA verification before the raid. According to Mazloum, the Kurdish intelligence asset in Baghdadi's inner circle was one of the two adult males captured alive and mentioned yesterday at the Pentagon press briefing."

That is remarkable intelligence and that's some of the best I've actually seen. And it just goes to point out how important this relationship is that we have with the locals. When you have the locals on the ground dealing with ISIS, they're going -- my definition, get more information. They're in the culture, they speak the language, people talk to them. And having that presence there and having the United States there, I may say, even in smaller numbers truly makes a difference. If you're not on the ground, you're not going to get the intelligence."

That these that the prisons where they were being held we're going to be released. So now in this short period of time, you have al-Baghdadi out, the top lieutenant under him also out, what's the structure look like of ISIS right now, and how concerned are you about that rebuilding at this point?"

When they kill Osama bin Laden, al- Qaeda was dead, not just Osama bin Laden, the organization was done, and that was the furthest thing from the truth. This organization has 14,000, 18,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria as stated by the President's special envoy to Syria Ambassador Jeffries, and there's 10,000 in detention. I'm not talking about the families in detention. These are the fighters that by themselves in detention. That's a significant number and we have got to keep our foot on the throat of these guys. So bringing troops into the eastern part of Syria, secure oil fields but they'll also be making certain that ISIS does not re-emerge. That terrorist network, (INAUDIBLE) the institute I'm associated with, they track it every single day. And every single day, they are working on coming back. They actually have a plan that brings them back by the end of next year where they believe they're going to be taking territory again. So they're committed. But this is a setback here.

This year they lost their caliphate after four years of defending it. Now they've lost their number one leader and obviously -- we haven't had a leader like Baghdadi. He stormed onto the scene, built a terrorist army, invaded a country with 40,000 troops and had his headquarters in Syria. No other modern terrorist organization has ever achieved that. That's why worldwide he had 30 or 40 affiliates. He conducted dozens of attacks outside of the region. He conducted multiple attacks on nine NATO nations to include the United States. Either directed or inspired. This will impact him adversely. Are they going to go away? No. They are in ideology. They don't go away into these youngsters who were drawn to this fanaticism no longer see that as a purposeful life. But in the meantime, we have to -- we have to be very serious about them when we get the opportunity to kill them, and we have to be honest about that word. Because they want to kill us, they want to take our life away from us, they want to kill our children and our grandchildren. When we have the opportunity to do that, we do that and we capture them if we can. But also, we have got to have some presence and some determination. And I will give you -- listen, I don't like the politics stuff of criticizing President Obama should never have been criticized. I don't believe he was when he made the decision to conduct that attack. And this thing here, I mean, we know for a fact that President Trump deserves some credit not just for the decision but for his dogged determination to pursue Baghdadi. He kept bugging his national security team, when are we going to get this guy? When are we -- you can just hear him, knowing his personality that we see on television all the time. So, they felt that presence. You know, the boss really wants to get this guy, and let's make sure -- and that helps analysts, you know, who are working in those cubicles 24/7."

Now not all priests agree with that. Some go even farther. Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke when he was the archbishop -- you're chuckling, I don't know why -- was the archbishop of St. Louis ordered priests to deny the Blessed Sacrament to Catholic politicians who favored abortion and he named them by name.

Their only concern pre-viability is the health of the mother, not the life of the baby. The Alabama statute did outlaw abortions pre-viability. Under the natural law that you and I follow, the Alabama law is respect for human life, but that's not the law of the land. Why did the Alabama legislature do this?

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That was new England Patriots tight end, Benjamin Watson reacting to a sweeping law out of California allowing NCAA athletes to be paid. And today, and even more seismic change in college sports. The NCAA board of governors voted unanimously to allow all college athletes to profit off of their names, images, and likenesses. Here now sportscaster, Jim Gray, also, a Fox News contributor. Jim, always good to see you. Thanks for being here tonight. What's your reaction to this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JIM GRAY, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Thanks, Martha. Well, it's long overdue and they follow the lead of California and they were forced by California to do this and there should have been reformed so long ago and this is a good first step, but I only see it as a first step because they are generating all of this revenue, billions of dollars. The coaches touch it, the institutions touch it, the television networks, the sneaker companies, all profit here. Everybody except for those who are preventing the service. And now this is an opening and it's just a sliver. Those people who own their own likenesses they should be able to be commercial and profiteer on themselves. So, it's a good start."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's take a look at what LeBron James said. It's a beautiful day for all college athletes going forward from this day on. Thank you, guys for allowing me to bring more light to it. I'm so proud of the team uninterrupted bringing focus to this and everyone who has been fighting this fight, not a victory, but a start. And here is a look at some potential payout to some of the big stars. Zion Williamson could get 2.5 million for one NCAA season. Jalen Hurts, the Oklahoma Sooners player -- $250,000 per national ad campaign. But one of the things that, you know, people I've spoken to who are very much against this, Jim, just talked about the change that it has on the team. You know, when you've got one or two guys on your team who are making all this money, everybody else is putting in the same amount of effort, the same amount of teamwork, and yet, it will, you know, sort of, will it break down the fabric of the college athletic experience?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, there is the potential for that but like LeBron said and like I just said, this should be a first step. These guys and gals who produce all of this revenue should be paid. You know, they are not student athletes, they are athlete students. And if you and I can go to college for whatever we want to pursue, they should go and be able to pursue whatever they want to pursue. Forget that the odds are long to make the NBA or make the NFL. If that's what they want to do that and that's why they're there, then they should be able to pursue that dream and they are generating all of this cash. So, this is just the start. I mean, we had guys --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "utterance": "-- that make peer when he won the champion got up there and said he couldn't afford a pizza."

      "utterance": "No."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Which is ridiculous. Yes, I understand that. I'm just saying a lot of that money goes to support other teams at the universities. You know, it goes to repay the recruitment fees, we need to cover the scholarships for a lot of those players so, you know, it doesn't always just sort of fall into the profit margin. Quick thought."

      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, the rule is wrong. It's been wrong for a long time."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, the teams have to support the other teams in title nine and all of that."
