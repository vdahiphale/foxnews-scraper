You decide if you are feeling that data.  Welcome, everyone. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  And I want you to try this number on for size, 304,000. That is how many jobs were added to the economy last month. That was a lot more than anyone thought, continuing a trend that's been going on a lot longer than anyone predicted. Try 100 straight months of this, the longest uninterrupted job stretch ever. That's right, ever.  So much to get to, so let's get going with Blake Burman at the White House on what the president is saying, and Hillary Vaughn on how some Democrats who want his job are responding.

Lots of good feelings over here at the White House involving this one. In fact, the White House Twitter account just a little while ago put out a video of Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, in which Kudlow said, I hate to tell you so, but the pessimists are wrong.

Now, some of that, of course, dates back to the Obama years. But Hassett told me the fact that it is 100 months in, and you're seeing 300,000-plus - - a 300,000-plus number, that is a very, very good sign.   Secondly, he pointed to the 3.2 percent year-over-year in earnings. He thinks that that vindicates the tax cuts. That is part of the reason why we're seeing, in his estimation, that 3.2 percent number. And also they said, even though the unemployment number ticked up from 3.9 to 4 percent, Hassett says they believe that that is strictly due to the government shutdown and would have stayed at 3.9 had there not been that -- Neil.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil.  Well, four of the nine Democratic candidates to announce plans to run for president in 2020 support the idea that the way to add jobs is to give one to everyone over 18 and pay them more than twice the federal minimum wage.   Senator Cory Booker was the brainchild behind a three-year pilot program last year that would guarantee that anyone over 18 would get a job that pays $15 an hour with paid family and sick leave, plus health care. It would be tested out in 15 locations around the U.S. before going nationwide. Senator Kamala Harris co-sponsored the plan. And fellow Senators and 2020 hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand supported it. Trump's job growth plan has largely been focused on tax cuts and cutting back on regulation for businesses big and small. The Trump administration touts these cuts and his Jobs Act for lower unemployment rates and more jobs, cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and a 20 percent deduction for small business income.  Democrats, though, settings sights on 2020, want to undo all of that, but are divided over who to tax more and who to tax less. Warren championing a billionaires tax on the ultra-rich, including family and sick leave and health benefits, also pledging to reverse this trend of the administration that she says she wants to help workers capture economic growth that they are helped -- helping create.  Kamala Harris proposing more tax cuts for the lower-middle-class in her multi-trillion-dollar tax plan called Lift the Middle Class Act. She said she will pay for it by undoing some of Trump's tax cuts and also adding new taxes and fees on some banks and financial institutions. Harris also encouraged work force training for people being phased out by automation. Democrat billionaire Michael Bloomberg, though, on the rocks about a 2020 run, called Warren's plan probably unconstitutional.   You also have candidate Andrew Yang that's running on a plan for universal basic income that would cut out the middleman, the employer, entirely, and is promising, as president, to give everyone $1,000 cash, no questions asked, not a job needed. They would get that 1,000 bucks every month -- Neil.",

Ralph Nader -- Ralph Nader didn't cause George -- Al Gore to lose in 2000. He competed for votes. Al Gore could have won those votes if he -- in a competition. But he didn't cost.",

You decide if you are feeling that data. Welcome, everyone. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And I want you to try this number on for size, 304,000. That is how many jobs were added to the economy last month. That was a lot more than anyone thought, continuing a trend that's been going on a lot longer than anyone predicted. Try 100 straight months of this, the longest uninterrupted job stretch ever. That's right, ever. So much to get to, so let's get going with Blake Burman at the White House on what the president is saying, and Hillary Vaughn on how some Democrats who want his job are responding.

I was told last night, when Hassett did just that, when he put the numbers before the president, President Trump responded with a fist bump to his CEA chair. Lots of good feelings over here at the White House involving this one. In fact, the White House Twitter account just a little while ago put out a video of Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, in which Kudlow said, I hate to tell you so, but the pessimists are wrong. The president saying today that he wasn't surprised at all by the numbers."

Now, some of that, of course, dates back to the Obama years. But Hassett told me the fact that it is 100 months in, and you're seeing 300,000-plus - - a 300,000-plus number, that is a very, very good sign. Secondly, he pointed to the 3.2 percent year-over-year in earnings. He thinks that that vindicates the tax cuts. That is part of the reason why we're seeing, in his estimation, that 3.2 percent number. And also they said, even though the unemployment number ticked up from 3.9 to 4 percent, Hassett says they believe that that is strictly due to the government shutdown and would have stayed at 3.9 had there not been that -- Neil."

      "speaker": "HILLARY VAUGHN, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Well, four of the nine Democratic candidates to announce plans to run for president in 2020 support the idea that the way to add jobs is to give one to everyone over 18 and pay them more than twice the federal minimum wage. Senator Cory Booker was the brainchild behind a three-year pilot program last year that would guarantee that anyone over 18 would get a job that pays $15 an hour with paid family and sick leave, plus health care. It would be tested out in 15 locations around the U.S. before going nationwide. Senator Kamala Harris co-sponsored the plan. And fellow Senators and 2020 hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand supported it. Trump's job growth plan has largely been focused on tax cuts and cutting back on regulation for businesses big and small. The Trump administration touts these cuts and his Jobs Act for lower unemployment rates and more jobs, cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent and a 20 percent deduction for small business income. Democrats, though, settings sights on 2020, want to undo all of that, but are divided over who to tax more and who to tax less. Warren championing a billionaires tax on the ultra-rich, including family and sick leave and health benefits, also pledging to reverse this trend of the administration that she says she wants to help workers capture economic growth that they are helped -- helping create. Kamala Harris proposing more tax cuts for the lower-middle-class in her multi-trillion-dollar tax plan called Lift the Middle Class Act. She said she will pay for it by undoing some of Trump's tax cuts and also adding new taxes and fees on some banks and financial institutions. Harris also encouraged work force training for people being phased out by automation. Democrat billionaire Michael Bloomberg, though, on the rocks about a 2020 run, called Warren's plan probably unconstitutional. You also have candidate Andrew Yang that's running on a plan for universal basic income that would cut out the middleman, the employer, entirely, and is promising, as president, to give everyone $1,000 cash, no questions asked, not a job needed. They would get that 1,000 bucks every month -- Neil."

      "utterance": "All right. Then the question becomes how you pay for it all. Hillary, thank you very, very much. Again, those tax hikes that are planned on the rich just part of a Democratic plan that has everyone united. Let's get the read from GOP strategist right now Holly Turner. We have got former Clinton adviser Mark Penn, GOP pollster Lee Carter. Obviously, Lee, they have crunched the numbers and realize what their base that these are popular lines of attack. Are they, within the Democratic Party?"

      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",

Mark was saying before that a lot of these, we're talking about bumper sticker policies here, where it's like, of course you can look at them. That's red meat for the base. And so I think that we're going to spend some time and these things are going to get torn apart. But the bottom line is, people love taxing the wealthy, they love attacking what the Republicans are doing. And there's no way to spend for all of this. In many ways, we're talking about free recess, more recess and no more classes. And let's get everybody excited. And that's where we are right now."

      "utterance": "Yes, we're going to be getting into that in a little bit here. But I'm wondering -- and, to Mark's point, it's still early in the going here, and anything and everything changes. But don't you need a more moderate type in either party to connect with voters, and that the secret is, of the 40 that gained jobs in the House, 32 of them were considered moderate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "That's right. Yes, I think to win in a general election, you need to be more moderate. The problem is the primaries. If you're going to have 20-something candidates, even if we're going to have 15 candidates, let's say, on a conservative thing -- and I don't think that's -- that's -- I think we're looking at a lot. We're going to get a lot of those -- those moderates are going to split up. And so you're going to get the more extreme candidates getting a lot of attention, much like what happened in 2015, 2016 with President Trump. There were 17 candidates on the right. And all of them, many of them were sort of traditional conservatives. They split the votes and then Trump was able to rise up. And he got his base. And I think the Democrats are going to be facing the very same thing. And part of me thinks that that's why Howard Schultz's strategy isn't stupid at all. I think he's saying, I'm going to stay out of all of this, let them go far left, and here I'm going to be able to rise up as the moderate and have a different..."

But, Mark, is it your sense that -- I know in my state of New Jersey, when Murphy was running, the Democrat for governor, and got the job, everyone was for a lot of things that he wanted to do, because it wouldn't touch them. In other words, high taxes on the rich, why not? Higher pay for teachers, why not? As long as I don't have to pay for it. That's a strong asset, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think class warfare is back at the Democratic Party. I spent a lot of time in '96 working with the Clintons taking it out, right? And I think, unfortunately, it's back. And I think we're going to run through a cycle. But, remember, when the Republican Party went through I think the resurgence of conservative bases, it was actually McCain and Romney that got the nomination. So I think not so fast here. The base voters in the primaries in California and Iowa may be very liberal, but there's a wide swathe of moderate Democrats who have yet to have their voices heard, and will be heard later on. So let's not count this out. I agree. If the Democratic Party goes too far to the left, it'll create an opening for Schultz and others."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Holly, I think, at the end, most parties prefer that they win. The worst of their choices is still better than the other guy's choice. Right? So maybe that pragmatism wins the day. But to get to that day, given the front-loading of the primaries, particularly in California, that might benefit a Kamala Harris, or what have you, that it favors those who might be more left-leaning, or might be more inclined to raise taxes, or might be a part of this populist pitch. What do you think it?"

      "speaker": "TURNER",

And so when we see all of these candidates talking about the people left behind and needing income for all, why are we even talking about that? Why are we talking about raising taxes on the rich? I mean, we're doing great right now. It's the lowest unemployment on record. So to some degree..."

Obviously, Speaker Pelosi is taking a firm line. I don't know if she sees that as the opening negotiating position or not. We will find out. But to get to an agreement, you have got to have something that funds border security. Everybody's saying that. Everybody at our meeting said, OK, we're all for strong border security.

We know they're cheating. We know they're violating it. Why are we doing this? It doesn't make sense. And I think that -- I think that what he is doing was done the right way.

Now he's kind of saying in a tweet they're all on the same page. What do you make of that?"

What we saw was, we saw the intelligence community giving an unbiased, nonpolitical assessment of where the world threats stand today, what affects America. That is -- that is exciting to me, because, during the last eight years under the Obama administration, we actually feared the intelligence community because of what they were doing to or against Americans. And now you have got a very open and candid assessment that came out. I think the president's reaction initially was just exactly what we have seen before. It was a knee-jerk reaction. But I think that he is now walking that back. And, look, he is allowing these people, good people that he selected to run these agencies, he's allowing them to give an honest assessment here. And it -- I -- it restores my faith in the intelligence community, Neil."

But I can assure you that, if the president wanted to, if the advisers around him wanted him to take their briefing and get at least the highlights of what they were going to say, it's available to him. But he is a president United States and probably the busiest man in the world. So I don't know why he didn't know that ahead of time. But that's something for his -- his administration to work out."

And, of course, Dan Coats has a statutory responsibility for the entire intelligence community. So he has to know what Gina Haspel is going to say from the CIA. So there is that kind of collusion and coordination. But, again, I want to say that I was not surprised by anything that they said. Anybody that watches what's going on in the world, that stays on top of this, was not surprised by that. The only thing that surprised me was when Dan Coats called for a restructuring of the intelligence community, and I thought he was dead on with that, but I did not expect to hear that."

Guess who we got with us to discuss this? One of the most remarkable individuals in recent political history, Russell Verney. You might recall he was Ross Perot's campaign manager. I want to take you back to 1992, when Ross Perot was thought to be just an asterisk. Well, that asterisk got 19 percent of the vote, the most successful two-party challenger we have seen in history, 19 percent of the vote. And he was a late entrant, remember? He had quit the race, then rejoined the race. Russell was the guy who made it happen. And, Russell, I know you and I were chatting about this on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand. And you brought up to me the notion that we dismiss third candidates to our detriment, and that they -- they're not jeopardizing other candidates, as much as they're speaking to something.

Well, this is competition. Competition is the backbone of America. And if they can't win in a competition, whether there's two, three, four or five candidates, they shouldn't get into the race. Right now, there's a potential of 25 candidates for the Democratic nomination. They have got competition. They can have competition in the general election. In fact, there should be more competition, Neil, so that people who have a very right-wing viewpoint can express it, a very left- wing viewpoint can express it through a candidate, me in the center can express it through the candidate of my choice, without having to go to just the selection of the Republican club or the Democratic club. I think that, with the ability to vote for multiple candidates, we do get to impact the future. He may not win. Ross Perot didn't win in '92, but, in 1994, Newt Gingrich's Contract With America was written half out of Perot's \"United We Stand\" book...."

And then, in 1996, Bill Clinton did triangulation, and for the first time since probably the late '50s, we had a balanced budget, because they were trying to appeal to the Perot voters.

In 1992, the exit polling is clear that, if Ross Perot was not in the race, the outcome would have been the same, except Bill Clinton would have had a mandate. With only two candidates, you got to have more than 50 percent of the vote. So Bill Clinton would have been a mandate candidate, instead of a 40 percent candidate -- or president in '92 through '96. Ralph Nader -- Ralph Nader didn't cause George -- Al Gore to lose in 2000. He competed for votes. Al Gore could have won those votes if he -- in a competition. But he didn't cost."

And I think, if we can reframe the conversation away from a wall or no wall, and talk about safety and security at the border, I think there's common ground. And that's -- that's going to be technology. I was meeting with somebody earlier today about thermal radar and some things like that. You may have a technological wall in some places.

I mean, I love Robert Kraft. I was friends with him when he was a fan, and then he bought the team, then, of course, being friends with Bill and Tom Brady. It's great. Oh, it's a great time to be a Patriot fan."

People are talking about, well, what about, if they win, should we declare it a national holiday? No. Only if your city wins the day, you get the day off. If not, go to work, loser. You lost!"
