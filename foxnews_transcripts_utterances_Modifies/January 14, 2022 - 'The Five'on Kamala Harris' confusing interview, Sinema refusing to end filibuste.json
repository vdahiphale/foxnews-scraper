So, some of these setbacks this week will actually be great for the country and the economy and may be even by extension, Biden and company and the White House. The Supreme Court knocking down the vaccine mandates, well, it will help companies keep and hire workers. It will prevent the supply chain problem from getting worse and prop up the economy. Again, it's -- they wanted to throw wrenches into the works of our economic system. That's not going to happen. The Build Back Better monstrosity is dead, $5 trillion welfare program. It's -- that would have made inflation worse. So that helps the Federal Reserve fight inflation. And then keeping the filibuster intact means that the nation is -- it stays the course. It's not -- it's good for the country. It's not far left or far right. But how bad is it for Joe Biden?

Can someone fill an invoice in that department and just order the test? We are not asking him to innovate the test, not ask him to even innovate the therapeutics, not ask him to innovate the vaccines. We are asking him to execute. Execute because you said that you guys had all the experience, you know how to do this, you are for years prior you had it for eight years. This is basically the same group. You've got Susan Rice, you got Ron Klain who is helping the vice president last time, they've been friends for years. You've got to fire everybody. You've got to clean house. This is a flat-out disaster. And so, I always say to myself, what is, for a Democrat, where do you go from here? So, I'm thinking to myself, see if you can get some wins. The infrastructure deal was a win. When they both agree on Electoral College decide, when the vice president, whether it's Joe Biden or it's Mike Pence, or it's Al Gore, when they have to go gavel in the official tally, it seems to be an issue. There seems to be blow ups every time. So, let's just forget about that. We both sides agree on that, take that. And then I looked down and I say, what did he talk about today? He talked about doing police reform. What? Police reform? We have these cities overrun in crime. In two blocks we are to be talking about carjacking 101. And now he's talking about police reform. You are going to crackdown on cops? If there's anything that should be left on the side, it is that. And I don't want to take Harold Ford's talking points, but you've got to look for thing you can get some wins on. So, talk to Joe Manchin now. And Bill Clinton, a great advice by the way, talk to Manchin, find out what he wants, the Build Back Better and pass it. And the rest of the stuff, run on it. So, you run on it next time, you want four more years? Then you go ahead and say, I've got some of Build Back Better. And instead of vilifying these moderates, include them in and say this is the best I can do. And lastly, the worst thing to happen to Joe Biden I think historian to write is for him to invite those historians to the White House to talk about FDR and LBJ and for him to win those two Senate seats in Georgia. It gave them the sense that he could do anything even though you think he knows reality. He can't do anything.",

You've got to -- if you are in that White House now, and Dagen had a lot of good points, I would disagree with some of them, but I think the overall trash (Ph) is that it's not going well. She got to reset your whole frame. When you are president, you have two jobs. Your first is your commander in chief. So, you think about the geopolitical threats. China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The challenges that we face in our own hemisphere, obviously with the border, and obviously in the Middle East. And then you think about the domestic challenges, and we've had a few really emerge. COVID. Obviously, the president won because of it. Crime. Again, our border and supply chain the pressure it's creating on inflation and our economy. If I'm him, I'd sit back and say, what is it, to Brian's point, how do we create within these thin majorities we have in the House and Senate, an agenda that's going to begin to address these concerns? Frame those concerns and frame them consistently. And I would argue constantly. We've had this conversation around the table before, and we all a very strong opinions about it, but I'm root for whomever the president it is. We want COVID defeated, we want inflation changed, we want our geopolitical adversaries to know that they can't push us around. So, the president has got to reset, reframe. And if that means bringing new personnel around, he should consider that. I'm not sure that's what he has to do, but if he does, he should consider it. But he's got to get a frame, a set, and a reset and go out and meet people where they are, the American people. And again, grab those winds that are easy wins in front of you, because one victory can produce another victory, and another victory after that.",

I mean, Jesse, when you are going down the list of all these failures just this week alone, I checked them off so that I could go where you left off and you left out inflation had its highest level since 1982. McConnell taking to the Senate floor to go after that speech he came in Georgia on Tuesday where he was stabbed -- snubbed by Stacey Abrams. And he finished the week Thursday with that lunch on Capitol Hill coming out to the microphone acknowledging that his voting legislation is unlikely to pass. I mean, really couldn't have gotten worse. And I'll just leave off of on this. Jen Psaki announced this morning that he is going to hold a formal press briefing on Wednesday, press conference I should say, on Wednesday, the eve of the first year in office for this presidency.

Her handling of the border and it's probably reasons for this. It's just not gone well at all. I come back to what I said with the president. I think the vice president has got to understand what her theory or develop a theory of the case around the things that she's been challenged or tasked with doing, and they're all challenging things. I know she's hired a new communications person, Jamal Simmons, who I know well, who is smart, he is seasoned, he is tough. But it's not going to be - - it's going to be staff alone. The vice president has to understand that if she is going to be judged and sometimes the judging is going to be favorable, sometimes it's not. But you can't -- you can't swerve off the court if you know where you are trying to go. She's been tasked with two big things. One being the border. I would tackle that. If she is able to show progress there, a victory there, a coherent policy there that we can follow, the country can point to, I think she can find herself staring down an alley, or a street, path, a victory that could come her way.

So, some of these setbacks this week will actually be great for the country and the economy and may be even by extension, Biden and company and the White House. The Supreme Court knocking down the vaccine mandates, well, it will help companies keep and hire workers. It will prevent the supply chain problem from getting worse and prop up the economy. Again, it's -- they wanted to throw wrenches into the works of our economic system. That's not going to happen. The Build Back Better monstrosity is dead, $5 trillion welfare program. It's -- that would have made inflation worse. So that helps the Federal Reserve fight inflation. And then keeping the filibuster intact means that the nation is -- it stays the course. It's not -- it's good for the country. It's not far left or far right. But how bad is it for Joe Biden? Today a group of Senate Democrats, including Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, sent a letter to the White House wanting -- and I'm going to paraphrase here -- wanting to know what the hell is going on with the COVID response?

Can someone fill an invoice in that department and just order the test? We are not asking him to innovate the test, not ask him to even innovate the therapeutics, not ask him to innovate the vaccines. We are asking him to execute. Execute because you said that you guys had all the experience, you know how to do this, you are for years prior you had it for eight years. This is basically the same group. You've got Susan Rice, you got Ron Klain who is helping the vice president last time, they've been friends for years. You've got to fire everybody. You've got to clean house. This is a flat-out disaster. And so, I always say to myself, what is, for a Democrat, where do you go from here? So, I'm thinking to myself, see if you can get some wins. The infrastructure deal was a win. When they both agree on Electoral College decide, when the vice president, whether it's Joe Biden or it's Mike Pence, or it's Al Gore, when they have to go gavel in the official tally, it seems to be an issue. There seems to be blow ups every time. So, let's just forget about that. We both sides agree on that, take that. And then I looked down and I say, what did he talk about today? He talked about doing police reform. What? Police reform? We have these cities overrun in crime. In two blocks we are to be talking about carjacking 101. And now he's talking about police reform. You are going to crackdown on cops? If there's anything that should be left on the side, it is that. And I don't want to take Harold Ford's talking points, but you've got to look for thing you can get some wins on. So, talk to Joe Manchin now. And Bill Clinton, a great advice by the way, talk to Manchin, find out what he wants, the Build Back Better and pass it. And the rest of the stuff, run on it. So, you run on it next time, you want four more years? Then you go ahead and say, I've got some of Build Back Better. And instead of vilifying these moderates, include them in and say this is the best I can do. And lastly, the worst thing to happen to Joe Biden I think historian to write is for him to invite those historians to the White House to talk about FDR and LBJ and for him to win those two Senate seats in Georgia. It gave them the sense that he could do anything even though you think he knows reality. He can't do anything."

You've got to -- if you are in that White House now, and Dagen had a lot of good points, I would disagree with some of them, but I think the overall trash (Ph) is that it's not going well. She got to reset your whole frame. When you are president, you have two jobs. Your first is your commander in chief. So, you think about the geopolitical threats. China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. The challenges that we face in our own hemisphere, obviously with the border, and obviously in the Middle East. And then you think about the domestic challenges, and we've had a few really emerge. COVID. Obviously, the president won because of it. Crime. Again, our border and supply chain the pressure it's creating on inflation and our economy. If I'm him, I'd sit back and say, what is it, to Brian's point, how do we create within these thin majorities we have in the House and Senate, an agenda that's going to begin to address these concerns? Frame those concerns and frame them consistently. And I would argue constantly. We've had this conversation around the table before, and we all a very strong opinions about it, but I'm root for whomever the president it is. We want COVID defeated, we want inflation changed, we want our geopolitical adversaries to know that they can't push us around. So, the president has got to reset, reframe. And if that means bringing new personnel around, he should consider that. I'm not sure that's what he has to do, but if he does, he should consider it. But he's got to get a frame, a set, and a reset and go out and meet people where they are, the American people. And again, grab those winds that are easy wins in front of you, because one victory can produce another victory, and another victory after that."

I mean, Jesse, when you are going down the list of all these failures just this week alone, I checked them off so that I could go where you left off and you left out inflation had its highest level since 1982. McConnell taking to the Senate floor to go after that speech he came in Georgia on Tuesday where he was stabbed -- snubbed by Stacey Abrams. And he finished the week Thursday with that lunch on Capitol Hill coming out to the microphone acknowledging that his voting legislation is unlikely to pass. I mean, really couldn't have gotten worse. And I'll just leave off of on this. Jen Psaki announced this morning that he is going to hold a formal press briefing on Wednesday, press conference I should say, on Wednesday, the eve of the first year in office for this presidency. That's Thursday, that marks one year. What are they going to say? How do they spin this? And it's tough to really even guess what victory is they are going to be able to tout on Wednesday.

Her handling of the border and it's probably reasons for this. It's just not gone well at all. I come back to what I said with the president. I think the vice president has got to understand what her theory or develop a theory of the case around the things that she's been challenged or tasked with doing, and they're all challenging things. I know she's hired a new communications person, Jamal Simmons, who I know well, who is smart, he is seasoned, he is tough. But it's not going to be - - it's going to be staff alone. The vice president has to understand that if she is going to be judged and sometimes the judging is going to be favorable, sometimes it's not. But you can't -- you can't swerve off the court if you know where you are trying to go. She's been tasked with two big things. One being the border. I would tackle that. If she is able to show progress there, a victory there, a coherent policy there that we can follow, the country can point to, I think she can find herself staring down an alley, or a street, path, a victory that could come her way.

Still, to this day, kids are out with no structure and discipline. They've emptied the juvenile detention centers because of COVID. And right now, a lot of these crimes because of bail reform in Philadelphia, car theft or even second-degree robbery, you can get booked and then walk right out afterwards. And if you do it with a taser instead of a firearm, it's going to decrease the charge as well. So, I don't know. I mean, you got to look at the tips, Harold.

I mean, you don't feel safe walking a block. You certainly don't walk a few blocks. And that's what the city -- that's what the city is all about, because this is happening in broad daylight. I mean, that attack there in Manhattan -- midtown Manhattan, 55th and Broadway, it's absolutely disgusting. And it's not just on the coasts that we're seeing this happen. You go to middle America, in Ohio, Cleveland, you mentioned the spike they're seeing. Carjacking is up 21 percent and 2021 over 2020. I mean, that's a double digit increase. That's scary. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Mike O'Malley is saying this brazen, aggressive, and violent crimes, the individuals that are doing this, they will destroy our city. And so many great American cities are just crumbling under these far-left policies on crime. They're destroying these cities.

Because when you don't prosecute crime, you get nothing but crime. And we're seeing that over and over again. I'm talking about dumb moves by Democrats. My goodness, how -- what do you have -- what pie charts do you have to look at to be anti-crime and be reasonable when it comes to people who are incarcerated, but first and foremost, make people feel safe. The other thing that's scary to Jesse's point is suggesting I was looking at the tips. And I'm not saying they haven't well thought out, but I'm saying we can't avoid it. Look out for hotspots like your driveway. Really? Parking lots, what else am I going to do with my car? What about gas stations? Someone's got to fill it up. My Butler is fired or he called in sick. I forget which one it was. And look out for times when you get in and out of the car. Every day, what are we going to do, go out the moonroof? So, this is kind of scary.

They had more murder, record number of murders last year, more than New York City, despite the fact that New York has more than five times the number of residents. So, I think New York is watching Philly and thinking man, it can get a whole lot worse here. But this is your -- just watch Philadelphia. This is the beginning of the death of a city where you will have criminals not only feel like this is you know, open bazaar for them. But criminals moving into the city if they know they can get away with this. Higher-income Philadelphians, they can leave and go elsewhere, to Sandra's point, but it's the low-income individuals who can't leave. The money leaves and that's how you begin the downward death spiral of what is a great city and there's no coming back.

You probably have good solid points. You're certainly passionate. Ian Pryor is a great example of it. He's a teacher -- excuse me, he's a parent and saw the teachers were off the reservation. So, he organized the parents to fight back, and that started this whole movement. It was organic, it was real. And I would just say this. Get the kids back in school as the overarching thing. It looks like kids are organizing. They're making their own demands. That's the new trend. And in New York City, Mr. Mayor, do not cave to the unions. Cases are down for 90,000 to 30,000.

Microsoft playing to the woke crowd and rolling out a new update to their popular word software, that only 250 million people use, that will autocorrect some term seen as not politically correct. So, instead of for example, postman, we need -- they'll do it automatically, they're going to use mail carrier or postal worker. If you actually do the drop-down menu, don't say mankind, they'll correct it to humankind or humanity. And heroine becomes hero. What is the problem with heroine? It's also comes with the inclusiveness drop-down menu which allows users to filter by text, by age, and gender, and gender bias. So, Jesse, are you saying to yourself, about time, I'm so glad they did this?"

So, I think Microsoft is messing with the wrong folks there. This is -- so, nobody uses Microsoft Word at home. Everybody uses Google Docs. It's free. Why am I talking like Joe Biden? Anyway, Microsoft Word is in use at work. Microsoft is trying to help you avoid -- every company has a couple of people who are going to get mad about you using the word mankind and they're going to report you to human resources.
