Right now its' a 75-25 split with three quarters having to be spent on payroll. I think it should be changed to 50-50. I think some of the ideas the president laid out around liability insurance relief and finding ways in which to perhaps extend the 2019 tax deadline are all smart things. But if you allow states to go bankrupt, if you don't ensure that every household in America, whether they be rich or poor, because we are all in this together, gets $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 over the next several weeks or the next few weeks, that's the way you ensure that there's demand when the public health issue becomes improved and people feel more confident and comfortable going back to work. Finally, I disagree with Ari just a little bit. I don't think the government is solely responsible for the shutdown. I think people, and maybe Ari feels this way as well, but I think people, until they feel confident going to a restaurant or a theater or taking their kids on an airplane, and that probably won't come until we have a therapeutic or vaccine, we're going to have a long time in which we are dealing with this. You have got to give people resources to survive.",

We've long since forgotten deficits and debts collectively, both parties have. But this could be something to see once it's unveiled, probably next week. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and obviously they are responding to something that is truly unprecedented. But at the end of the day, the federal government can't spend its way out of this crisis. The only way that we are going to get out of the crisis is by growing out of the crisis, and the way we do that is by figuring out a way, while keeping public health, obviously, forefront in our minds, figure out how to open the economy back up and growing out of the problem. Of course, the problem with all this spending is added to what you just noted, which is that, of course, we are doing all of this on top of tens of trillions of dollars worth of debt that both parties have heaped on taxpayers, on American citizens, before now. And that debt is looking a whole lot more dangerous today than it did even a year ago. But one other point that I think that all politicians in both parties should be careful about, and that clip you just played of Joe Biden. Voters will forgive politicians for making mistakes, errors, in an unprecedented crisis like this. Politicians have to be very, very, very careful about trying to play politics or trying to take political advantage in a crisis like this, because if voters view them as trying to make some sort of personal advantage out of this, it will come back to bite them very badly. And I think this goes for President Trump, Joe Biden, Democrats, Republicans, everybody needs to be very careful that voters right now feel like we all are in this together right now, and anybody viewed as trying to capitalize on this in some unseemly way will get punished harshly at the polls for it.",

More than 33 million Americans have filed jobless claims since the outbreak started.

Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., currently chairman of RxSaver, and former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.

It's the millions upon millions who have lost their jobs which always hurts, and in this case it particularly hurt low-income workers and minorities the most, people who have the smallest cushion to be able to get by. But it's also hurt many people who are working who have had their -- I know many who have their salaries cut, who have accepted diminutions in what they receive just to stay and make the company they work for stay whole. So this hurting everybody everywhere in every way, and I don't think this is going to rebound as fast as the administration thinks it will. This seems to have legs.

      "utterance": "I don't disagree a lot with Ari's analysis of this. I would add one caveat. I think that the public health issues and the revitalization of the economy are coming back in some ways. They are inextricably linked. I do think, to your question, Bret, about demand is how you create that. One of the reasons I'm a huge proponent of another CARES Act being large, helping states, more money for small businesses, and even changing the ratio for how the money can be spent or what money can be forgiven. Right now its' a 75-25 split with three quarters having to be spent on payroll. I think it should be changed to 50-50. I think some of the ideas the president laid out around liability insurance relief and finding ways in which to perhaps extend the 2019 tax deadline are all smart things. But if you allow states to go bankrupt, if you don't ensure that every household in America, whether they be rich or poor, because we are all in this together, gets $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 over the next several weeks or the next few weeks, that's the way you ensure that there's demand when the public health issue becomes improved and people feel more confident and comfortable going back to work. Finally, I disagree with Ari just a little bit. I don't think the government is solely responsible for the shutdown. I think people, and maybe Ari feels this way as well, but I think people, until they feel confident going to a restaurant or a theater or taking their kids on an airplane, and that probably won't come until we have a therapeutic or vaccine, we're going to have a long time in which we are dealing with this. You have got to give people resources to survive."

      "utterance": "Charlie, I want to ask you about, we're getting ready to have whatever phase four looks like. Democrats are in the process of writing some kind of legislation. We've long since forgotten deficits and debts collectively, both parties have. But this could be something to see once it's unveiled, probably next week. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and obviously they are responding to something that is truly unprecedented. But at the end of the day, the federal government can't spend its way out of this crisis. The only way that we are going to get out of the crisis is by growing out of the crisis, and the way we do that is by figuring out a way, while keeping public health, obviously, forefront in our minds, figure out how to open the economy back up and growing out of the problem. Of course, the problem with all this spending is added to what you just noted, which is that, of course, we are doing all of this on top of tens of trillions of dollars worth of debt that both parties have heaped on taxpayers, on American citizens, before now. And that debt is looking a whole lot more dangerous today than it did even a year ago. But one other point that I think that all politicians in both parties should be careful about, and that clip you just played of Joe Biden. Voters will forgive politicians for making mistakes, errors, in an unprecedented crisis like this. Politicians have to be very, very, very careful about trying to play politics or trying to take political advantage in a crisis like this, because if voters view them as trying to make some sort of personal advantage out of this, it will come back to bite them very badly. And I think this goes for President Trump, Joe Biden, Democrats, Republicans, everybody needs to be very careful that voters right now feel like we all are in this together right now, and anybody viewed as trying to capitalize on this in some unseemly way will get punished harshly at the polls for it."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I don't think he particularly cares about how much heat he's taking. He's doing what he thinks is right, and what we are beginning to see is the fact that you have the previous administration, operatives inside the previous administration launching not only an investigation into a political campaign at the height of an election, but continuing that pursuit of members of this incoming administration after they got elected, and that raises all sorts of very important constitutional questions. And the fact that Attorney General Bill Barr is doing this is a very important step."

You can't have a forum of justice to the president's friends and allies, and people who are not. Remember, General Flynn pled guilty. It seems like his real quarrel might be with his original lawyers. At the end of the day, this matter will be resolved by Judge Sullivan, and I'll be curious to see if he asks those prosecutors to come in and explain what accounted for, what attributes to this about-face in this case."

When the top Obama administration officials said in private testimony they had no evidence, there was no empirical evidence tying the president and his campaign to Russia. Why did we go through three years of misery over Russia collusion allegations against President Trump? It's as if the outgoing Obama administration just wanted to plant landmines all around the incoming Trump administration, the facts be damned. And that's what we've now learned with these no transcripts coming out. There was no evidence. Yet a special prosecutor was appointed anyway to pursue what we know was a lack of evidence."
