GOP Senator John McCain also expressed concerns that the president accepted Putin's word over the consensus by U.S. intelligence community that Russia meddled in the election. But what Mr. Trump set aboard Air Force One is this, quoting: \"Every time he sees me,\" meaning Vladimir Putin, \"he says, I didn't do that, and I believe, I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.\"  But the audio wasn't released and our chief correspondent John Roberts, who heard the interview says, the president's voice inflection is very important because it's clear the president is not saying he believes Putin, he saying he believes Putin means it when he says he didn't do it.

These people are being not only disloyal, they're being destructive. People -- they're actually involved, as far as I can tell, in a campaign to disrupt everything. Clapper, Comey, Brennan all testified there was no hack. What President Trump said, to clarify the issue regarding Putin was that, yes, there were three agencies and one DNI who said that it was hacked; he's got his current guys in there right now. Martha, I talked to the current folks. They are very much aware of the Russian threat, but to the president's point, we cannot go around trying to poke people in the eye for what happened last year when we are now aware and we need to hold them accountable, but we have other things we have to do.

This is no small thing. And as my information, he's done other things before he left office to leak to the media to The New York Times in particular. So, he has no record to stand on, and as John's point is. I believe that these men have become political ponds in a larger political game. They don't like -- they don't want to walk away.

Remember, General Clapper once said the Muslim Brotherhood was \"a largely secular organization.\" That was the Obama administration ideology that radical Islam doesn't exist.

So, the president is, I think, responding correctly. We've got a deal with them in Syria. We've got to deal with them on North Korea.  We've got to convince them that there are some areas that we have to cooperate on, at the same time understand that they're up to no good; they will do whatever they can to undermine what we're doing.

But the real tremors are being felt on the Democratic side of the aisle were Hillary Clinton has simply refused to leave the stage one year later, making it difficult for her party to rebuild with a new generation of leaders.   And while you heard Donna Brazile there tell MSNBC she wants to help lead the healing of her party, her new book has torn some liberals apart with the revelations about the Democratic National Committee appearing to collude with the Clinton Camp. And some conservative lawyers pushing for the Justice Department to investigate whether the effort to tilt the Democratic nomination away from Senator Bernie Sanders was more than just unethical. Republican Attorneys Cleta Mitchell and (INAUDIBLE) -- today writing in The Wall Street Journal that the law does not \"allow a single candidate to control a political party's operations and expenditures.\" And the memo signed by the Clinton Camp allowed them full access to all research work and tools paid for by the DNC \"despite Federal Election Commission Regulations that prohibit private sharing such research with the candidate without either reporting the cause as an in-kind contribution or having other disclosures.\" Then, there's the fact that even the notoriously liberal \"Saturday Night Live\" on MSNBC, this weekend took aim at the advancing age of the Democratic leaders.

Can they expel him from the senate for something he is alleged to have done before he was in the senate? There's no precedent for that whatsoever. In the history of the United States congress, no one has been expelled from the house or the senate for something they did before they were in congress.

And Jeff Flake may have come up with a more desirable solution, defend the rights of women, condemn this behavior, because the allegations appear to be more credible than the denial, and lived with the Democrat.",

These people are being not only disloyal, they're being destructive. People -- they're actually involved, as far as I can tell, in a campaign to disrupt everything. Clapper, Comey, Brennan all testified there was no hack. What President Trump said, to clarify the issue regarding Putin was that, yes, there were three agencies and one DNI who said that it was hacked; he's got his current guys in there right now. Martha, I talked to the current folks. They are very much aware of the Russian threat, but to the president's point, we cannot go around trying to poke people in the eye for what happened last year when we are now aware and we need to hold them accountable, but we have other things we have to do.

I think it's wrong in, this sense, to have supposedly career officials out in public like this. I think as many people in the military have said just because you become a civilian when you retire from the military, it impairs the civil-military relationship to become a public figure. I think much the same applies to the intelligence agencies, especially when you're dealing with military figures.

Look, John Brennan, as far as I'm concerned, should've been at least twice brought up on charges, for one thing, he leaked to reporters before when he was still working at the White House, President Obama, leaked information to the press that resulted in MI-6 losing a critical humid net in Yemen. This is no small thing. And as my information, he's done other things before he left office to leak to the media to The New York Times in particular. So, he has no record to stand on, and as John's point is. I believe that these men have become political ponds in a larger political game. They don't like -- they don't want to walk away.

They're based on their reading of the political atmosphere. And I think it's reflective of the sad and very unfortunate politicization of the intelligence community under the Obama administration, and not necessarily gross things like distorting specific facts or adding in facts, it's the ideology that they carried out. Remember, General Clapper once said the Muslim Brotherhood was \"a largely secular organization.\" That was the Obama administration ideology that radical Islam doesn't exist.

So, the president is, I think, responding correctly. We've got a deal with them in Syria. We've got to deal with them on North Korea. We've got to convince them that there are some areas that we have to cooperate on, at the same time understand that they're up to no good; they will do whatever they can to undermine what we're doing. It's just the way they operate. We have to have the relationship with our eyes open, but with some level of the idea of what we want to do with that relationship."

But the real tremors are being felt on the Democratic side of the aisle were Hillary Clinton has simply refused to leave the stage one year later, making it difficult for her party to rebuild with a new generation of leaders. And while you heard Donna Brazile there tell MSNBC she wants to help lead the healing of her party, her new book has torn some liberals apart with the revelations about the Democratic National Committee appearing to collude with the Clinton Camp. And some conservative lawyers pushing for the Justice Department to investigate whether the effort to tilt the Democratic nomination away from Senator Bernie Sanders was more than just unethical. Republican Attorneys Cleta Mitchell and (INAUDIBLE) -- today writing in The Wall Street Journal that the law does not \"allow a single candidate to control a political party's operations and expenditures.\" And the memo signed by the Clinton Camp allowed them full access to all research work and tools paid for by the DNC \"despite Federal Election Commission Regulations that prohibit private sharing such research with the candidate without either reporting the cause as an in-kind contribution or having other disclosures.\" Then, there's the fact that even the notoriously liberal \"Saturday Night Live\" on MSNBC, this weekend took aim at the advancing age of the Democratic leaders. And as if on cue, this morning, former Vice President Joe Biden, turning 75 next week, went on NBC's Today show to say he may be running yet again."

But Zac, let me start with you with this Wall Street Journal story, which basically says that Hillary Clinton's group basically monopolized the funds of the DNC, and didn't, like, sort of, adhere to the idea that everybody puts their money in and it becomes sort of a common pot of money.

But as it currently is, I cannot vote for it, because what it does: it takes away most of the property tax deductions, and all the state income tax deduction and that would be devastating to people in my district -- middle and upper-middle-income people -- who are, by the way, the backbone of Trump supporters.

But our property taxes and state income taxes would come to at least between 25 and $30,000, the cost of living is much higher. And for them to lose that deduction, and in addition to that lose other deductions such as the personal exemptions, which comes to $18,000 for a family of four, that ends up definitely being a tax increase for them -- and that's wrong. And these are, again, are not wealthy people; they're hard-working people, and they're very high cost part of the country. Again, if they want to do this -- indexing, maybe, I mean, some states you can buy a mansion for $100,000. In my district you would need a half a million just to get started."

Marc, this is the problem with this bill, because you have people like the couple that was just described by Congressman King, who certainly do not consider themselves wealthy and, in fact, would probably have to cut back dramatically on buying a new car, or building another house, or expanding.

And let's remember, too, for the vast majority, about 80 percent of the people who benefit from the deductions of the state and local income tax deductions are making six figures.

At the end of the day, the house will vote on their bill today, or this week. The senate will come back next week after thanksgiving and vote on theirs. And then the two sides will hash out the final details on an agreement that can pass both chambers, but that's one of the areas that they're going to have to definitely address. The house does make an attempt of doing it, the senate does not. And I have faith they'll get there at the end."

So under the senate rules, you're capped at $1.5 trillion over the ten years before the taxes, you can deal with the other stuff on the budget side in a separate bill, and you know that the Republicans will do that. The president introduced a budget blueprint that was definitely shrinking the size of government earlier this year when he introduced that. So all of those things do go together. This is going to be one of those areas, especially when it deals with state and local income tax -- state and local tax deductions that is definitely have to be something that's going to be..."

The NRSC chairman, Senator Cory Gardner says Moore should not run, and if he wins he should be expelled from the senate. Moore is accused of making inappropriate sexual advances on at least five women when they were in their teens and Moore was in his 30's. Moore denies the allegations. He says they're a political witch hunt, and now he is threatening legal action against the Washington Post, the paper that first broke the story. Reporters at the post said they spoke to over 30 people, including four accusers, a fifth accuser, Beverly Young Nelson spoke out today. She says Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 15 years old. Nelson says Moore offered to drive her home from work, but instead of taking her home the then-district attorney parked his car near a dumpster and began touching her chest."

Expulsion, which is what Cory Gardner suggested, it's a rare move, two-thirds of the senate would need to vote in favor of it. According to senate records, the last time a senator was expelled it was 1862. The ethics committee recommended expulsion for Senator Bob Packwood back in '95, but Packwood resigned one day after that recommendation. Martha?"

      "utterance": "Well, the short answer is no. If he's elected senator, congress can't add to the qualifications in the constitution, there's only two, that he's 30 years old and that he's a resident of the state from which he's elect. So they can't add the following. You shall have behaved properly, unlawfully, throughout your life before you're in the senate, so they have to see him. Can they expel him from the senate for something he is alleged to have done before he was in the senate? There's no precedent for that whatsoever. In the history of the United States congress, no one has been expelled from the house or the senate for something they did before they were in congress. The rules contemplate expulsion only for behavior while in congress. So I think the Republicans will be stuck with him. And Jeff Flake may have come up with a more desirable solution, defend the rights of women, condemn this behavior, because the allegations appear to be more credible than the denial, and lived with the Democrat."

It seems like everybody was deserting him at that point. He ended up, of course, getting elected as president. Stay the course and you'll get elected, you'll be seated, and they can't expel you. That's the message that's coming from Steve Bannon. So there's a lot of things at play here. There's Steve Bannon against Mitch McConnell. Steve Bannon against his former boss, the president of the United States. There is the fear on the part of the Republican establishment that they may lose the vote of married women, which they did lose in New Jersey and in Virginia just last week. And there's the belief that it might be better to have a Democrat in the senate making their majority at razor-thin, 51-49, but stand up for the rights of women."

Jeff Sessions is not going to leave. The write-in campaign is not going to work. It's beginning to look more and more like it's either going to be Judge Moore, and he's going to for his seat, or it's going to be the Democrats.
