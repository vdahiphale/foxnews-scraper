There's been a real change on the Sessions story because of a change of the Senate that we have seen. Up until now, Sessions' old Republican colleagues in the Senate, especially in the Judiciary Committee, have basically told the president, if you fire the attorney general a new one will have to be confirmed by us and we just don't have time, so don't do it. But this week we saw Lindsey Graham, member of the Judiciary Committee, saying, look, this is a dysfunctional relationship between the president of the attorney general and it really needs to change.
