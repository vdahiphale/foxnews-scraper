But the president today seeming to dial back just a little bit the imminence of a potential border closing, saying that, in recent days, Mexico has really sort of stepped up to the plate and is apprehending people who are coming in from the Northern Triangle countries to try to get up to the United States, but insisting that Mexico and Congress need to do more, or he will shut down the border.

The White House is coming up with some plans to mitigate that impact.  One idea being kicked around is that they would close off pedestrian and personal travel across the border, but they would leave open the truck lane, so the commerce could still get across. I mentioned at the top there's already an impact here, because of the fact Customs and Border Protection officials have been moved from ports of entry to areas in land. At Brownsville, Texas, the average wait to get across the board and yesterday was three hours. And in Otay Mesa, which is east of San Diego, the border crossing there, there were 150 trucks lined up on the Mexican side waiting to get in.  So, already, we're seeing cross-border commerce being affected, but Charles, nothing compared to how it would be if the president shut down the border.",

If you recall, in the summer, they tried to pass an immigration bill that included changes to the asylum law, because, again, it's the enticing of people to come using our asylum laws, abusing our asylum laws that is causing this crisis at the border.   I will say, Charles, that, up until now, Democrats and the media outside of Fox have been able to say this is not a crisis. I think you're seeing a little crack in that. Last week, my husband, Representative Sean Duffy, was on CNN on Chris Cuomo's show and he said there was no crisis. This week, he did a -- he did a series or a show on the border. And now he even admits that the word crisis doesn't even begin to explain what's happening and how bad it is. So, my guess is, if the president keeps drawing attention to the problem and, more importantly, if Border Patrol keeps educating the American public, there's a chance, a chance that maybe the American people will actually demand even of their Democrat Congress men and women that they do something about this problem.",

But now that it's a divided Congress, I think that, realistically, if he wants a deal, he's going to have to come to the table on a lot of issues, including something like DACA. I will also say, though, I think that, politically, it would be an absolute disaster for him to close down the border. Some of the seats that actually flipped Congress include Southern California, some of the border states. We have got a 2020 election in Arizona that could help decide the balance of the Senate.  They would have catastrophic economic impacts if he shut down the border. So, I think, politically, it actually doesn't make a lot of sense for him move forward on that.  But I couldn't agree with you more. And I also agree with Rachel on this, that, realistically, we need to cut through the partisanship here, because we do have a significant issue. I would argue it's a humanitarian crisis, more than it's an illegal immigrant crisis. But, either way, it's still some sort of crisis that needs to be addressed by both parties.",

Either way, this is an incident that made its way all the way up to the Secret Service. And when those officers caught up with this woman, she had two Chinese passports on her. Here's what we know, according to the federal complaint. Her name is Yujing Zhang. And according to that complaint, when Secret Service agents finally detained her, she had four cell phones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive and a thumb drive with malware. Now, according to the complaint, she's being arrested for essentially lying to those Secret Service officers. They say, when she first approached a checkpoint outside of Mar-a-Lago, she was -- she said that she was just going to go there to the pool. At that point, though, according to the complaint -- quote -- \"Due to a potential language barrier issue, Mar-a-Lago believed her to be the relative of a member, Zhang, and allowed her access onto the property.\" Once on the property, she told a receptionist at the club that she was going to a United Nations friendship event between China and the U.S. No such event was taking place at the time. That raised suspicions on the ground there -- grounds there. She was taking off the grounds of Mar-a- Lago, interviewed, and now she faces two different charges. Serious questions, though, Charles as to how she was able to make it onto the grounds at Mar-a-Lago in the first place, whether or not they will change their practices or policies going forward.

And the fact that they have now had to reallocate a lot of Customs and Border Protection officials to areas that are usually patrolled by the Border Patrol is having an economic impact already. But the president today seeming to dial back just a little bit the imminence of a potential border closing, saying that, in recent days, Mexico has really sort of stepped up to the plate and is apprehending people who are coming in from the Northern Triangle countries to try to get up to the United States, but insisting that Mexico and Congress need to do more, or he will shut down the border.

The White House is coming up with some plans to mitigate that impact. One idea being kicked around is that they would close off pedestrian and personal travel across the border, but they would leave open the truck lane, so the commerce could still get across. I mentioned at the top there's already an impact here, because of the fact Customs and Border Protection officials have been moved from ports of entry to areas in land. At Brownsville, Texas, the average wait to get across the board and yesterday was three hours. And in Otay Mesa, which is east of San Diego, the border crossing there, there were 150 trucks lined up on the Mexican side waiting to get in. So, already, we're seeing cross-border commerce being affected, but Charles, nothing compared to how it would be if the president shut down the border."

Let's ask Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy, Democratic strategist Zach Friend, and The Washington Examiner's Siraj Hashmi. Rachel, let me start with you. Ultimately, this is Congress' responsibility. They either punt, look the other way, have just fumbled this time after time."

If you recall, in the summer, they tried to pass an immigration bill that included changes to the asylum law, because, again, it's the enticing of people to come using our asylum laws, abusing our asylum laws that is causing this crisis at the border. I will say, Charles, that, up until now, Democrats and the media outside of Fox have been able to say this is not a crisis. I think you're seeing a little crack in that. Last week, my husband, Representative Sean Duffy, was on CNN on Chris Cuomo's show and he said there was no crisis. This week, he did a -- he did a series or a show on the border. And now he even admits that the word crisis doesn't even begin to explain what's happening and how bad it is. So, my guess is, if the president keeps drawing attention to the problem and, more importantly, if Border Patrol keeps educating the American public, there's a chance, a chance that maybe the American people will actually demand even of their Democrat Congress men and women that they do something about this problem."

      "speaker": "ZACH FRIEND, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I sure as heck hope not, Charles, but I will say that it is also true that the president had both houses of Congress for the last couple of years, and so it would have been good to work with them during that time. But now that it's a divided Congress, I think that, realistically, if he wants a deal, he's going to have to come to the table on a lot of issues, including something like DACA. I will also say, though, I think that, politically, it would be an absolute disaster for him to close down the border. Some of the seats that actually flipped Congress include Southern California, some of the border states. We have got a 2020 election in Arizona that could help decide the balance of the Senate. They would have catastrophic economic impacts if he shut down the border. So, I think, politically, it actually doesn't make a lot of sense for him move forward on that. But I couldn't agree with you more. And I also agree with Rachel on this, that, realistically, we need to cut through the partisanship here, because we do have a significant issue. I would argue it's a humanitarian crisis, more than it's an illegal immigrant crisis. But, either way, it's still some sort of crisis that needs to be addressed by both parties."

And certainly that hurt a lot of farmers in Middle America. But if you're looking at, obviously, the immigration issue right now, there's very little incentive to actually get things done in Congress and at the White House, given the fact that we have got an election coming up in about a year-and- a-half. And Democrats and Republicans find it in their interest to push and demagogue the issue and blame the other side in particular, so that they can really resonate with their base."

It does underscore the fact that the system is so broken, that, if you are desperate, even if you're not a legal asylum seeker, but even if you're looking for economic opportunity, you're going to take that risk."

And so there's one party that says, let's make legal pathways for people to come. And there's another party that's saying, no, we think it's in our electoral interest to do this. Frankly, I -- as a Hispanic person myself, I think it's a cheap way of winning Hispanic votes. I think President Trump is actually winning Hispanics the proper way, which is by enhancing their -- their economic opportunity in this country, which is the data is undeniable that Hispanics are doing better under this presidency."

And I think the Democrats think it's a way to win the Hispanic vote, that maybe these illegal immigrants today might be future voters for them tomorrow. I think it's a cheap way to win votes. I think it's a bad way to win votes. And I think that, in the end, again, if the American people are properly educated on what's happening at the border by the people on the ground, the Border Patrol, who, by the way, a 52 percent Hispanic force, so no calls of racism there. If the American people know what's happening, I think they will demand change from the Democrats. And they may have to move, but it's difficult in a presidential year."

If you ask me literally, can Bill Barr, the attorney general, take that report and hand it to Congress, the answer's no, because he is regulated by -- and this is a phrase everybody's going to here pretty soon -- something called a 6(e) -- 6(e) is a section of the federal rules of criminal procedure, which prohibits the government, when it has evidence of guilt of someone who has not been indicted, from -- from revealing that -- from -- sorry -- from revealing that evidence. This is the rule that James Comey violated when he said, we're not going to prosecute Mrs. Clinton, but here's all the evidence we have against her. So if the attorney general wants to reveal this to Congress, or if Congress feels it's been short-circuited and didn't get everything it wants, they have to go to a federal judge. Only a federal judge can override 6(e)."

There may be some evidence there that was presented to a grand jury of behavior that didn't rise to the level where they could prove guilt. There may be others. Everybody thought, for example, Jerome Corsi was going to be indicted. So there may be some evidence in there against him, but he wasn't indicted.

Release at all. I have nothing to hold back. That might have been a dangerous statement, because it might very well be taken by the federal judge who will make this decision as a waiver of his privacy rights. We don't know.

And so our legislation attempts to get at that issue, and then also allows the telecommunications companies, gives them more tools to authenticate calls, and so that they can start -- start to filter some of these calls when they come in. So there's really three prongs or three -- three parts of this process. But we believe that this is something that ought to move.

But, obviously, the violators, the bad actors come up with new technologies to get around some of the filters that have been put in place already. But we think that there is a real deterrent if you have the threat of criminal prosecution. Today, like I said, a lot of these financial penalties are simply something that they build into their business model. And I think we have got to have more tools in place, not only when it comes to the threat of criminal prosecution, but also tools that the companies, the providers can use to authenticate these calls and make sure that whoever's calling you -- if someone's calling you to tell you that your flight has been canceled or your doctor appointment has been moved, things like that, obviously, we want to be able to allow to get through. But most of the bad actors, the violators, are these folks who are just preying on people. And I think that's -- that's what we're trying to get at.

And so that's where Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in the House are coming from. And I think the president recognizes that, in order for us to get the kind of health care that will really lower costs and provide people in this country greater access, it's going to take a Republican House. And I think he's concluded that the best way to get that is, after this next election, to go out and win the House, get him reelected. In the meantime, work incrementally on things that we can do, like prescription drug pricing. And that's an issue that's a big priority for a lot of Republicans here on Capitol Hill."

But now, with reduced staffing, there are fewer lanes open and the result of that is longer wait times. One cross commuter in Texas said he barely moved half-a-mile and three hours waiting to get over the border.

The problem that we face today, of course, is that back then the entire country was unified that we had a -- we had to take a security measure that was pretty extreme. Today, we're trading more. And we actually have 50 percent of the country that probably doesn't even think there's a problem. Certainly, 50 percent of Congress doesn't think there's a problem along the border.

We do know that, though he was not actually on the premises, on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago at the time this incident occurred. Instead, he was at a different property of his playing golf. Either way, this is an incident that made its way all the way up to the Secret Service. And when those officers caught up with this woman, she had two Chinese passports on her. Here's what we know, according to the federal complaint. Her name is Yujing Zhang. And according to that complaint, when Secret Service agents finally detained her, she had four cell phones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive and a thumb drive with malware. Now, according to the complaint, she's being arrested for essentially lying to those Secret Service officers. They say, when she first approached a checkpoint outside of Mar-a-Lago, she was -- she said that she was just going to go there to the pool. At that point, though, according to the complaint -- quote -- \"Due to a potential language barrier issue, Mar-a-Lago believed her to be the relative of a member, Zhang, and allowed her access onto the property.\" Once on the property, she told a receptionist at the club that she was going to a United Nations friendship event between China and the U.S. No such event was taking place at the time. That raised suspicions on the ground there -- grounds there. She was taking off the grounds of Mar-a- Lago, interviewed, and now she faces two different charges. Serious questions, though, Charles as to how she was able to make it onto the grounds at Mar-a-Lago in the first place, whether or not they will change their practices or policies going forward.
