A lot of this is thanks for the hand grenade --. Everything is going to blow up on my watch. So I know it's not easy, but he should have handled this a year ago, just the way he handled the red, white, and blue cleats and the pink cleats all year long. But the NFL has to meet with the union right now, and I hope they're doing it. Don't tell the press. Just get it done. In a way that the players are going to feel comfortable and that nobody walks out feeling like they lost, because right now the only people losing are the fans. They're getting angry.

He said it before. He's associated himself with the flags, with the anthem, with the country, and everybody kneeling is against that. So, I think he's clean on that. Trump just not president. He's a crusader, especially on this issue. And that's what drives the left so crazy. So in an effort to destroyed Trump, they're actually destroying the football season. And it's unfortunate because I think now a lot of people, like a Ben Roethlisberger said, wait a minute, I don't really like the way we handled that by not coming out into the field. Jerry Jones -- exactly, I mean, it's kind of the coaches' deal, so he was trying to do the team thing.   Jerry Jones tried to have it both ways. They knelt before the anthem and then stood during the anthem, but still got booed. You have Von Miller, the linebacker for the Broncos lost an endorsement deal because he knelt. Yet, the guy, Villanueva, from the Steelers, best-selling jersey right now in the league. So, freedom isn't always free, there's consequences. The market usually determines what's right and wrong, and they pulled the issue. Thirty eight percent don't support kneeling. Seventy two percent find the protest to be unpatriotic. So the left is losing the culture war, and they don't even realize it tearing down monuments to the founding fathers, by supporting kneeling during the anthem, by supporting sanctuary cities, by siding with Kim Jong-un over Donald Trump. This is going to be a blowout in 2020 if they keep this up.",

He's essentially -- absolutely, and now it festers. It's half the size. And now we have this where everybody feels uncomfortable.  And the viewers, the fans -- what price are they going to continue to do this and alienate their customers? You see what I'm saying?

They are intentionally blinding themselves to reality.  And when you get 70 percent of the NFL players who are black saying there's something wrong here, and all we're trying to do is call it out. Guess what? You get people like Bill Russell, the famous NBA star, taking a knee. You get someone like this. Look at this picture. This is an army veteran, 95 years old, taking a knee in support of the NFL players, 97 years old, World War II vet in Missouri. You also get people -- you ask Dana. Is this thing going to continue, is it going to grow? Look at what happened in baseball? Look at the Oakland A's player taking a knee yesterday. OK. Now it seems to me these are white people taking a knee.

That's not what's happening. So I find it fascinating. And we're going to see if anybody is living on Regret Island. We're going to find that out, tomorrow.",

The interesting thing for me on this and I asked Sean Hannity about it yesterday, is I can understand supporting Roy Moore for a lot of reasons, but saying that he would be more supportive of Trump's agenda than Strange would be seems strange to me because Roy Moore up until recently was against the wall, he's also against the Graham- Cassidy, and Luther Strange has been for those things from the beginning.

That's how we have a lot of the information that we have. She was a hero. And Greg is much deserving of this award. The American Spectator itself turns 50 years old this month. So that means that Greg is older than the American Spectator.",

And Roger Goodell, I think, has just given unfortunate set of circumstances and challenges that previous commissioners did not have to tackle. I'm being totally honest. A lot of this is thanks for the hand grenade --. Everything is going to blow up on my watch. So I know it's not easy, but he should have handled this a year ago, just the way he handled the red, white, and blue cleats and the pink cleats all year long. But the NFL has to meet with the union right now, and I hope they're doing it. Don't tell the press. Just get it done. In a way that the players are going to feel comfortable and that nobody walks out feeling like they lost, because right now the only people losing are the fans. They're getting angry. There forced to say to themselves, am I giving up on my patriotism if I spend 500 bucks at a game with my kid?"

      "utterance": "I don't think the kneelers benefit at all. The fans are sick of it, and the owners are going to probably get the point very, very soon. Trump is on the side of the country. He said it before. He's associated himself with the flags, with the anthem, with the country, and everybody kneeling is against that. So, I think he's clean on that. Trump just not president. He's a crusader, especially on this issue. And that's what drives the left so crazy. So in an effort to destroyed Trump, they're actually destroying the football season. And it's unfortunate because I think now a lot of people, like a Ben Roethlisberger said, wait a minute, I don't really like the way we handled that by not coming out into the field. Jerry Jones -- exactly, I mean, it's kind of the coaches' deal, so he was trying to do the team thing. Jerry Jones tried to have it both ways. They knelt before the anthem and then stood during the anthem, but still got booed. You have Von Miller, the linebacker for the Broncos lost an endorsement deal because he knelt. Yet, the guy, Villanueva, from the Steelers, best-selling jersey right now in the league. So, freedom isn't always free, there's consequences. The market usually determines what's right and wrong, and they pulled the issue. Thirty eight percent don't support kneeling. Seventy two percent find the protest to be unpatriotic. So the left is losing the culture war, and they don't even realize it tearing down monuments to the founding fathers, by supporting kneeling during the anthem, by supporting sanctuary cities, by siding with Kim Jong-un over Donald Trump. This is going to be a blowout in 2020 if they keep this up."

And I feel like there might be getting toward some way for people to find -- not common ground. Standing for the anthem is an absolute in my mind, but some understanding of like, you have problems, you have concerns, let's talk about them and try to work them out, and not have to use it as a way to sort of protest and ruin the football season."

I couldn't agree with you more. I think this is really an issue straight up with Roger Goodell, because I think this could have been avoided. In my opinion, it's bad management. He's essentially -- absolutely, and now it festers. It's half the size. And now we have this where everybody feels uncomfortable. And the viewers, the fans -- what price are they going to continue to do this and alienate their customers? You see what I'm saying? When you look at the numbers and what's Jesse is saying it's just approaching it from, sort of, you know, a business perspective, but yet balancing the interest - - yeah, sure.

But secondly, that's not what the flag is about. America, as represented by the flag is about our values, our freedoms, our right to protest, to raise our voices, to come together as an American people when we think that there is something wrong. And today, Dana mentioned this in the Weekly Standard, you know, it was written, anybody who doesn't know that black people have a different experience than white people with cops id living in a bubble. They are intentionally blinding themselves to reality. And when you get 70 percent of the NFL players who are black saying there's something wrong here, and all we're trying to do is call it out. Guess what? You get people like Bill Russell, the famous NBA star, taking a knee. You get someone like this. Look at this picture. This is an army veteran, 95 years old, taking a knee in support of the NFL players, 97 years old, World War II vet in Missouri. You also get people -- you ask Dana. Is this thing going to continue, is it going to grow? Look at what happened in baseball? Look at the Oakland A's player taking a knee yesterday. OK. Now it seems to me these are white people taking a knee. They understand there's something bigger at stake here than the way the president all of a sudden wants to wrap himself in the flag, like anybody who would say this, oh, what happens when we fly the flag at half-staff, Mr. President?

The president sees it as patriotism. I don't think you have to join the army or navy or marines to be a patriot and salute the flag. I think you'd agree with that. So the president thinks is patriotism. And the fans who are upset, let's say like me, see it's about patriotism. And the people taking a knee, the athletes taking a knee say it's about race. So what we're trying to say is, I can't even get to the race issue because you're disrespecting the flag. If you found a way to get me to that race issue, I'll meet you there. But fundamentally, we're in the same family. We live in the same house. Don't comment on the house. Fix the house. But let's live in it together. And someone is saying, hey, this country isn't even good enough for me to stand and salute the national anthem. So it's race against patriotism. They're not mixing."

But when they do it during the anthem, they're disrespecting servicemen. That is the problem. People died for the flag. People were shot and paralyzed, Juan, and can't kneel for the anthem because they were shot by a sniper in Iraq or Afghanistan.

It's now become attached in a way that I think it's kind of productive to the anthem, so now even more people feel alienated and upset. And it's in no way to diminish or disqualified or demeans people's feelings about what's going on in this country, or the need to shine a light on any kind of brutality, or -- by the way, crime in neighborhoods, or black on black crime, I mean, there's a lot of things that are upsetting that we should do something about."

You would know as well as me. And he said, we wanted to find out why he was not going into the draft? But before he made a comment, they went and met behind closed doors with Bill Russel, it might have been Wilt Chamberlain, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and they met and they came out and go, he saw me, this is really something that I respect.

So if you put this man in office, Donald Trump, because you believed that he would be the best person to make the decisions, to make the choices, and the calls, and put forth the agenda, you would perhaps think, OK, well, maybe we should honor his choice and his selection.

That left an opening in the senate. Luther Strange is the appointed person. That's why we're having this runoff between the two Republicans. If you ask Lindsey Graham, who was a senator of South Carolina, really attacked during his primary by five or six different opponents, and that really spread it all out and he was able to scoot by and he was fine."

Roy Moore is super popular in Alabama. I wouldn't be surprised if he is able to win tonight. But the reason incumbents are supported like Luther Strange is because that's how you build majorities if you support the incumbent person. The interesting thing for me on this and I asked Sean Hannity about it yesterday, is I can understand supporting Roy Moore for a lot of reasons, but saying that he would be more supportive of Trump's agenda than Strange would be seems strange to me because Roy Moore up until recently was against the wall, he's also against the Graham- Cassidy, and Luther Strange has been for those things from the beginning. And yet, they think that somehow President Trump have the wool pulled over his eyes by the establishment. And therefore, they'll be able to -- by getting in with the real guy that he wants in there. It's very strange in Alabama."

But the most important audience, I think, for him right now, is he's got to be talking to little rocket man as often as he can to make sure that he understands, like -- no, I'm not distracted. I'm on top of this. And don't you worry because we have a military option and we aren't afraid to use it. I know that makes some people uncomfortable. They think the rhetoric is getting too high. But the truth is that rocket man is on a path to getting a nuclear weapon if he doesn't already have that. Marrying that technology is a concern. What I'm very interested in is how in the next -- two weeks, President Trump figures out how to deal with the Iran issue because by October 15th he has to decide to certify or not that agreement under the congressional law.

If you look at the fact that the president puts out a list with North Korea on it, and people say, \"North Korea and terror? What, are you kidding?\" That's why Mr. Warmbier came out and said, \"Of course. They terrorized my son. They're terrorizing their own people, and they're getting away with it.\" And that's the message of today. That's what we're up against.

We want to make sure that it's equitable. I think that's fair. And this is a place that's suffering tremendously in terms of the devastation at the ports. Roads need to be repaired, ports rebuilt so they can actually get in the right amount of help, and supplies and resources that are necessary. I talked about it on the show the other night. Dr. Manny is down there now, doing a tremendous job and working with the hospitals and the doctors and nurses. So many of those talented professionals had moved elsewhere during the economic time -- crises with Puerto Rico. So they were already in a financial state of instability. Then hit by a brutal blow by Mother Nature. It couldn't be, you know, more of a disaster for them. So I'm really happy the president is paying attention and that he is letting the world know that he's going to, you know, focus eyes and attention and resources on Puerto Rico and by actually, you know, going there to help these people. And Geraldo is there, as well."

I think he was just telling the truth and framing the issue to say that, yes, they have a lot to recover, because this is where they started from. The new line of attack with the left now is that President Trump is so obsessed with the NFL controversy he's not paying enough attention to Puerto Rico. That just means the left was losing the NFL snafu and now are retreating and circling back to attack him on Puerto Rico. From what I heard, the governor of Puerto Rico said that the president has been very supportive. Although I saw Geraldo down there earlier. And you've got to trust Geraldo when he's on the ground."

But the most important thing, once you get the relief and the recovery, and I've been there. El San Juan Hotel, Conquistador hotel. Beautiful places. Everybody, if they want to, book a trip when this place gets back up on their feet. Book a trip to Puerto Rico, go spend some money there, because that's really what the island needs, is our support."

And you have an immediate crisis with the dam that is about to break. Hopefully, it will not. But you have 700,000 people in the wake of that dam that could actually be in grave danger. So the need is overwhelming. And so we've got to get all sorts of things down there. But to rebuild agriculture, that means -- if there's no agriculture, that means there's no fruit; there's no vegetables; there's no food and sustenance. So we have a big job to do in Puerto Rico."

She's a Republican."

They need a brand-new grid. This is going to be like rebuilding a mini- Iraq when we took over. So that's what's going to need. And we're writing checks on overdraft right now.

So those who were arrested, paying the price, possibly in prison for driving, I hope will be free.

She was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77, which flew into the Pentagon. She was a real hero, because she called her husband to tell him. That's how we have a lot of the information that we have. She was a hero. And Greg is much deserving of this award. The American Spectator itself turns 50 years old this month.

It's a move to expand STEM programs -- That's you know, science, technology, engineering, and math -- in American schools. The president directed the Department of Education to invest $200 million in grant money to the program. The private sector kicking in another 300 million.
