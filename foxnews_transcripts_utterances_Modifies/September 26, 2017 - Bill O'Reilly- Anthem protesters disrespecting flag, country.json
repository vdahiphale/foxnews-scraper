We will be talking about the NFL national anthem controversy. The mainstream media. The political world. Donald Trump and his brand new book. A best-seller. \"Killing England.\"  Also, Michelle Malkin is here. She will join us in a few minutes.  But first, President Trump doubling down on his criticism of NFL national anthem protesters by defending the military, and the flag and the anthem and those who keep us safe. All while the Democrats, the liberal mainstream destroy Trump media, they do what they always do. What are they doing? Making this about race when it's not. And that is tonight's very important breaking news Opening Monologue.  So, first tonight I want to take a few moments and I want to thank all of you for your support and your loyalty. Last night you did make this show number one in cable by far. You know, there's a lot of people and the mainstream media on the left, they want the voice of this show silenced, they want your voices silenced. And by the way, there are even efforts this very day silence and boycott and they want to get me fired. This threat is very real. Here is the sad truth. If you're a conservative and have a conservative worldview, people in the media today, guess what? There are people that paid a lot of money, well-funded to sit and watch every single second, minute of every single day in the hopes that I say one word, one phrase, one sentence that they deem politically incorrect and then they can use it to get me fired.  Now with that said, every night, I made a promise last night to you. We will not stop on this program until my dying breath as long as they'll have me to give you news and strong opinion and information you won't get anywhere else. We do hope that you and your friends, you'll tell your friends to join us every single night, we hope you set your DVR. Again I thank you. And now tonight's top story. President Trump, he is refusing to back down. He is now calling out the NFL national anthem protesters who are disrespecting the flag, the military and our country. Here is what the President said earlier today in the Rose Garden.",

And they were fighting for our country, they were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem. And for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful. I think it's a very important thing for the NFL to not allow people to kneel during the playing of our national anthem. To respect our country and to respect our flag.",

      "sentences": "Now, the president is dead on when it comes to this kneeling issue. The national anthem, the flag is about saluting, honoring our military. Remember, it was written after the battle of Fort McHenry. And for all the president's critics out there, \"Oh, he shouldn't talk about this,\" he was right to call attention to this issue. So, all these NFL players coaches, owners, the ones that are kneeling because of apparent social injustice or protest the president himself or to raise awareness for whatever other leftist issues they may be promoting, well, I make the argument they're completely uninformed. If they are about inclusion and unity and understanding, then why don't they sit down with the brave men and women who fought and bled for this country? Maybe they should learn why every American should proudly stand for the flag, for \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" Why don't they talk to the mothers and fathers -- I've interviewed them -- who lost their sons and daughters or why don't they talk to those who had their limbs blown off fighting for this country. I'm pretty sure they would be happy to explain why people should in fact stand. This is about respect. This is about respect for the military, for our country, for our flag and those who fought under that flag. It is plain and simple, which is why these acts of protest are beyond disrespectful.  Now, if some NFL players, coaches, owners, you want to keep doing it, you go for it. But here is my prediction: people are going to continue to change the channel and they'll stay home on football Sunday. And like I said last night, Saturday is now my official football day unless and until this is resolved.   And according to the Wall Street Journal, Direct TV is now letting at least some customers cancel subscriptions to its Sunday ticket package of NFL games and obtain refunds if they cite players national anthem protests as the reason. Also, look at what is happening around the country. Look at this. People who spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on NFL memorabilia, they are burning their jerseys. They were the once prized possessions and treasures, they are that upset. Now, while President Trump is defending the flag, the military, Republicans like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who will be on the show tomorrow night, are coming out and they are supporting the president. Let's take a look.",

It is simply an affirmation and respect for the United States of America and this great heritage of freedom and for these football players' prosperity that they have.

      "sentences": "So, taking the knee or staying in a locker room during the national anthem, you know what? That is pretty easy to do. Addressing real problems that impact real people and doing something about that is a lot harder. Let's start by helping the people we always talk about, the millions of forgotten men and women in this country. Fifty million Americans in poverty, 50 million on food stamps, ninety plus million Americans out of the labor force. The NFL, you want to continue to disrespect the country, the military -- well, that's giving players by the way and owners the opportunity to make millions and even in some cases billions of dollars -- then it is time to stop taking hand-outs from the American taxpayers.  I doubt you'll hear this elsewhere in the media. Let's look at the numbers. The average public subsidy for an NFL stadium is $266 million taxpayer dollars. Since the year 2000 it is estimated $3.2 billion in federal taxpayer money has gone to help build private sports stadiums. And then you factor in local and state funding for stadiums. Well, that number grows to $5.9 billion and $6.7 billion, that is over just the last 20 years.  And if that's not shocking enough, well, there is the NFL's paid patriotism scandal. There was a Senate report, if found, that from the years 2012 to 2015, the Department of Defense, they actually paid the NFL $6.1 million to honor troops and for recruiting promotions. Now, the league did pay back $700,000 of that, but only after coming under intense criticism. What about the rest of the money? Now, those numbers are astounding. Now if some in the NFL, they don't want to stand, they don't want to honor the flag, the country, the military, then stop taking all the money from the American people. Because let's be honest, you know what? They don't need it in the NFL.   Now, while this national anthem issue is clearly about respecting the military, the country, our flag, well, the Democrats and members of the mainstream left wing establishment, ideological media predictably are trying to make this all about race. This is what they always do. It's part of their playbook. I pointed out so many times on this program. Every two years, every four years, the Democratic Party plays the race card creating division and causing unrest in the country. And I played those spots and SOTs over and over again. And now Democrats are doing the same thing with the national anthem protest. They're also using this opportunity to attack President Trump. Watch this from just two prominent Democrats.

They've been doing it since last November.

It's about patriotism and it should be obvious to everyone except, of course, those that want to play the race card like they do in every two and four years.  President Trump never mentioned race when he called out the NFL because it has nothing to do with race. And since Democrats, they are claiming President Trump is trying to create a racial divide in this country, well, we have to ask, where was the outrage when President Obama was jumping to conclusions without any facts or information, high-profile race cases in this country, and saying outrageous things that did have an impact on the public? You may remember this.  THEN-PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, JULY 22, 2009: The Cambridge police acted stupidly.  There is a long history in this country of African- Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact. OBAMA, JULY 19, 2013: When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. OBAMA, SEPT. 27, 2014: And we have to close the justice gap. How justice is applied but also how it is perceived, how it is experienced. That's what we saw in Ferguson this summer when Michael Brown was killed and the community was divided.  Stains the heart of black children who feel as if no matter what he does, he will always be under suspicion.",

They didn't do it because playing the race card, dividing the country along racial lines is how Democrats think they need to win and get votes. You know what?

Somebody sent me a very moving picture which I posted on my Instagram that said, we stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen.

      "utterance": "It's coming. It's coming. All right. Thanks, Tucker, it's always a great show. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Yes. Bill O'Reilly will be joining us right here in studio. We will be talking about the NFL national anthem controversy. The mainstream media. The political world. Donald Trump and his brand new book. A best-seller. \"Killing England.\" Also, Michelle Malkin is here. She will join us in a few minutes. But first, President Trump doubling down on his criticism of NFL national anthem protesters by defending the military, and the flag and the anthem and those who keep us safe. All while the Democrats, the liberal mainstream destroy Trump media, they do what they always do. What are they doing? Making this about race when it's not. And that is tonight's very important breaking news Opening Monologue. So, first tonight I want to take a few moments and I want to thank all of you for your support and your loyalty. Last night you did make this show number one in cable by far. You know, there's a lot of people and the mainstream media on the left, they want the voice of this show silenced, they want your voices silenced. And by the way, there are even efforts this very day silence and boycott and they want to get me fired. This threat is very real. Here is the sad truth. If you're a conservative and have a conservative worldview, people in the media today, guess what? There are people that paid a lot of money, well-funded to sit and watch every single second, minute of every single day in the hopes that I say one word, one phrase, one sentence that they deem politically incorrect and then they can use it to get me fired. Now with that said, every night, I made a promise last night to you. We will not stop on this program until my dying breath as long as they'll have me to give you news and strong opinion and information you won't get anywhere else. We do hope that you and your friends, you'll tell your friends to join us every single night, we hope you set your DVR. Again I thank you. And now tonight's top story. President Trump, he is refusing to back down. He is now calling out the NFL national anthem protesters who are disrespecting the flag, the military and our country. Here is what the President said earlier today in the Rose Garden."

      "utterance": "I was at Walter Reed hospital recently. And I saw so many great young people and they are missing legs and they're missing arms and they've been so badly injured. And they were fighting for our country, they were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem. And for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful. I think it's a very important thing for the NFL to not allow people to kneel during the playing of our national anthem. To respect our country and to respect our flag."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, the president is dead on when it comes to this kneeling issue. The national anthem, the flag is about saluting, honoring our military. Remember, it was written after the battle of Fort McHenry. And for all the president's critics out there, \"Oh, he shouldn't talk about this,\" he was right to call attention to this issue. So, all these NFL players coaches, owners, the ones that are kneeling because of apparent social injustice or protest the president himself or to raise awareness for whatever other leftist issues they may be promoting, well, I make the argument they're completely uninformed. If they are about inclusion and unity and understanding, then why don't they sit down with the brave men and women who fought and bled for this country? Maybe they should learn why every American should proudly stand for the flag, for \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" Why don't they talk to the mothers and fathers -- I've interviewed them -- who lost their sons and daughters or why don't they talk to those who had their limbs blown off fighting for this country. I'm pretty sure they would be happy to explain why people should in fact stand. This is about respect. This is about respect for the military, for our country, for our flag and those who fought under that flag. It is plain and simple, which is why these acts of protest are beyond disrespectful."

      "utterance": "people are going to continue to change the channel and they'll stay home on football Sunday. And like I said last night, Saturday is now my official football day unless and until this is resolved. And according to the Wall Street Journal, Direct TV is now letting at least some customers cancel subscriptions to its Sunday ticket package of NFL games and obtain refunds if they cite players national anthem protests as the reason. Also, look at what is happening around the country. Look at this. People who spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on NFL memorabilia, they are burning their jerseys. They were the once prized possessions and treasures, they are that upset. Now, while President Trump is defending the flag, the military, Republicans like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who will be on the show tomorrow night, are coming out and they are supporting the president. Let's take a look."

      "utterance": "President of the United States has free speech. He believes and I believe that people should take a moment before a football game and stand when the national anthem is played. What's wrong with that? It's not political, it is not an affirmation of Trump or Hillary Clinton or any other agenda. It is simply an affirmation and respect for the United States of America and this great heritage of freedom and for these football players' prosperity that they have. So, I think that's a perfectly appropriate thing for the president to say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So, taking the knee or staying in a locker room during the national anthem, you know what? That is pretty easy to do. Addressing real problems that impact real people and doing something about that is a lot harder. Let's start by helping the people we always talk about, the millions of forgotten men and women in this country. Fifty million Americans in poverty, 50 million on food stamps, ninety plus million Americans out of the labor force. The NFL, you want to continue to disrespect the country, the military -- well, that's giving players by the way and owners the opportunity to make millions and even in some cases billions of dollars -- then it is time to stop taking hand-outs from the American taxpayers. I doubt you'll hear this elsewhere in the media. Let's look at the numbers. The average public subsidy for an NFL stadium is $266 million taxpayer dollars. Since the year 2000 it is estimated $3.2 billion in federal taxpayer money has gone to help build private sports stadiums. And then you factor in local and state funding for stadiums. Well, that number grows to $5.9 billion and $6.7 billion, that is over just the last 20 years. And if that's not shocking enough, well, there is the NFL's paid patriotism scandal. There was a Senate report, if found, that from the years 2012 to 2015, the Department of Defense, they actually paid the NFL $6.1 million to honor troops and for recruiting promotions. Now, the league did pay back $700,000 of that, but only after coming under intense criticism. What about the rest of the money? Now, those numbers are astounding. Now if some in the NFL, they don't want to stand, they don't want to honor the flag, the country, the military, then stop taking all the money from the American people. Because let's be honest, you know what? They don't need it in the NFL. Now, while this national anthem issue is clearly about respecting the military, the country, our flag, well, the Democrats and members of the mainstream left wing establishment, ideological media predictably are trying to make this all about race. This is what they always do. It's part of their playbook. I pointed out so many times on this program. Every two years, every four years, the Democratic Party plays the race card creating division and causing unrest in the country. And I played those spots and SOTs over and over again. And now Democrats are doing the same thing with the national anthem protest. They're also using this opportunity to attack President Trump. Watch this from just two prominent Democrats. Take a look."

      "utterance": "So, the Democrats' fake moral outrage, it knows no bounds. They will literally do and say anything to try to damage and delegitimize President Trump. They've been doing it since last November. And that includes playing the race card every single chance they get even though President Trump has explicitly said that his criticism of the NFL has nothing to do with race. It's about patriotism and it should be obvious to everyone except, of course, those that want to play the race card like they do in every two and four years. President Trump never mentioned race when he called out the NFL because it has nothing to do with race. And since Democrats, they are claiming President Trump is trying to create a racial divide in this country, well, we have to ask, where was the outrage when President Obama was jumping to conclusions without any facts or information, high-profile race cases in this country, and saying outrageous things that did have an impact on the public? You may remember this. THEN-PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, JULY 22, 2009: The Cambridge police acted stupidly. There is a long history in this country of African- Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. That's just a fact. OBAMA, JULY 19, 2013: When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. OBAMA, SEPT. 27, 2014: And we have to close the justice gap. How justice is applied but also how it is perceived, how it is experienced. That's what we saw in Ferguson this summer when Michael Brown was killed and the community was divided. Stains the heart of black children who feel as if no matter what he does, he will always be under suspicion."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

And we can go back even further to Barack Obama's book, \"Dreams of my Father.\" The media never pointed it out, we did, where he quoted the reverend from the church of G-d America. Jeremiah Wright. Listen to then candidate Obama saying this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OBAMA",
      "utterance": "It is this world, a world where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of Port-au-Prince see in a year, where white folks' greed runs a world in need, apartheid in one hemisphere, apathy in the another hemisphere."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "These are things you'll never hear and see from members of the mainstream media because, you know what? They're so abusively biased and corrupt. But by the way, they want to silence shows like this and they work hard at it. For example, where was the left rushing to condemn those comments? He wasn't a candidate but he was in politics. They didn't do it because playing the race card, dividing the country along racial lines is how Democrats think they need to win and get votes. You know what? They just do whatever they want and they'll never change, sadly, because it is not good for the country. But people I think now are on to their game. It is getting old, it's pretty disgusting. So, tonight, we have a challenge for the left. Instead of you trying to take down President Trump 24/7, 365, exploiting this NFL issue, why don't you stand up for things that matter? Our country, our flag, our brave men and women who fight and bleed and die for all of our freedoms? All right. Joining us now, the host \"Michelle Malkin Investigates\" on CRTV Michelle Malkin.

      "utterance": "Well, I think you have it exactly right, Sean. The resistance movement has jumped the shark and the race baiting that you have outlined here is so noxious and it is a shame that so many NFL leaders and the NFL brass have put themselves squarely on the wrong side of the majority of Americans who act every day in good faith. I've heard such an outcry from people in my email box and I'm sure you have on your show and who watch your show on both TV and radio, Sean, for military families especially. And it was very symbolic and important that Donald Trump this weekend declared Sunday gold star mothers and families day because these are the forgotten people that you've already paid tribute to and are talking about, Sean. Somebody sent me a very moving picture which I posted on my Instagram that said, we stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen. And the fact that you had so few NFL players who had the guts to do that, it just shows you how much the social justice mob has hijacked not just the sports industry but the entertainment industry as well. And they're paying for it. Bottom-line, viewership is down, attendance is down, advertising is down. And if they keep doubling down on stupid, NFL is going to stand for no fans left."

Their average salary is 2.44 million a year. I'll grant you they have short careers, average career three or four years. That's not the point. That's a lot of money and families pay a lot of money to go see these games. So, I'm kind of trying to understand, do they not get that this is a big deal for a lot of people? And that this is going to backfire against them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALKIN",
      "utterance": "Yes. There is a huge disconnect here between the elites of the entertainment and sports industry and the people who pay their salaries and who consume their products. And again, this is an industry-wide thing. It's the same reason why you see the summer box office movie was a bomb. All of these awards shows for entertainment. All of their viewership is down. You cannot afford to insult the very customer base that keeps you afloat. And lasts for long. And I think you made a very transient point, a point I've made for years, Sean, about how the NFL is essentially a quasi-public entity. Subsidized to the tune of billions of dollars at the local, state and federal level. So, for all of these fair weather friends of the corporate free speech and First Amendment now to be up in arms about the President criticizing them because they are so-called private entity. Give me a break. What a joke. The NFL hogs have had their noses in the trough of the public for decades now and yes, they are going to be held accountable by taxpayers."

But anyway, you've got to -- you've got to -- who is going to stop -- who's going to stop this madness? You. You the American people. You have to go to the Dallas school board meeting and you have to say, I know who George Washington was and Thomas Jefferson. Yes, they were slave holders, but this is what they did to give Hannity and O'Reilly the freedom to talk to millions of people and this is how they suffered. They suffered."

But in the civil war, hundreds of thousands of whites died -- died to free the slaves. So, this isn't a white supremacist nation. This is the biggest bunch of bull I've ever heard. So, I want to give people, I want to make them armed and dangerous with facts.
