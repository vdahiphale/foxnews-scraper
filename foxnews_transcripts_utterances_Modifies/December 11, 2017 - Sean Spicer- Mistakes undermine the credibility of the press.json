Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, the destroy-Trump media is spiraling out of control by manufacturing made up stories, spreading lies like we have never seen before. Fake news CNN, conspiracy TV, MSNBC and other so-called news outlets have created what is an informational crisis that affects every American. It is so egregious, so damaging and so dangerous to you, the American people.  President Trump is now calling it a, quote, \"Stain on America.\" We'll going to dissect tonight. The anatomy of these fake new smears meant to damage and destroy the President you elected. Now, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, he will join us with reaction. And he has a major announcement that you'll going to want to hear.  And also tonight, an explosive Fox News report. The wife of the now demoted DOJ official who met with Fusion GPS worked for the Opposition Research Firm that produced the fake news, anti-Trump Russian dossier during the 2016 election. We will have more on that breaking news tonight.  And an ISIS-inspired terrorist with a pipe bomb strapped to his chest exploding the device in the heart of New York City during morning rush hour today. Sebastian Gorka is here to explain how Americans have to get much tougher in this war on terror. But first, our breaking news opening monologue.",

Liberal, mainstream destroy-Trump media, they have a vendetta and they're showing it every day. Their number one goal is to damage and destroy the president you elected and clearly by any means necessary, and spreading fake news helps them to do this. Now, we've been saying it since '08, journalism in America is dead. But what is happening now is far worse, more destructive. more than anything we could have imagined. This is now outright propaganda every day.  For example on Friday, fake news CNN, they go wall-to-wall, breathless reporting on the story, it turns out to be a big fat lie. Now, the Clinton News Network falsely claimed that Donald Trump Jr. received an email on September the 4, 2016 that gave him special access to hack DNC emails that were later released by WikiLeaks. Unfortunately, the report, as usual completely wrong.   Here's the truth. The email that was sent to Donald Trump Jr. was actually dated September 14, not fourth, 2016, which is the day after Wikileaks put out the DNC documents. Now, fake news CNN, they hyped the story as the big smoking gun about Trump and Russia collusion and claimed they had not one but two sources verifying this false claim.

Jeff, are you proud of your network? By the way, not the first time this year. Do facts come first, Jeff Zucker? When your network repeatedly tries to smear and slander the president with outright lies? You have become nothing but an extension of the DNC. And I have to tell you that Donald Jr. story was devoid of facts.  And after being humiliated on Friday, Zucker then sent to stenographer, \"Humpty Dumpty\" Brian Stelter to try and clean up this whole mess. Now, instead of profusely apologizing like he should have, \"Humpty Dumpty\" tried to use his network's complete and utter fake news failure to attack President Trump.

      "sentences": "Fake news CNN isn't alone in spreading lies in fake news aimed at hurting the president. A Washington Post reporter was forced to apologize this weekend after tweeting out this highly misleading photo about the crowd size at President Trump's rally on Friday. Turns out that image that you see right there, that was taken well before President Trump ever stepped on the stage.   And President Trump responded to that fake news report by tweeting out photos during his speech that showed a packed house. I'm writing, quote -- oh, very different -- \"@DaveWeigel over at The Washington Post put out a phony photo of an arena empty hours before I arrived at the venue with thousands of people outside on their way in. Real photos now show as I spoke, packed house. Many people unable to get in. Demand apology and retraction from fake news Washington Post.\"  The president added this. Quote, \"Dave Weigel of The Washington Post just admitted his picture was a fake, a fraud showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed as shown also on TV. Fake news, he should be fired.\" Now, that photo is the perfect example of how the destroy-Trump media, the biased media in this country attempts to embarrass, delegitimize this president over insignificant, superfluous things at every turn. And just like other examples, this one blew up in the fake news media faces because the truth eventually hopefully does come out and because President Trump, he refuses to sit back and let the media spread lies day in and day out. But for the press in this country, nothing is too small and too petty. They will literally attempt to use anything and everything to attack the president.   Take a look at this headline from The New York Times this weekend. Quote, \"Inside Trump's hour by hour battle for self-preservation.\" Now, The Times, the so-called investigative reporting over there, includes explosive information like the President has up to 12 Diet Cokes a day. That's pretty laughable. It is right up there with CNN's two scoops of ice cream for him but only one for his guests. Now the other bombshell facts from The New York Times report claims that President Trump watches up to eight hours of television a day. Now President Trump rightfully blasted the paper by tweeting, quote, \"Another false story, this time in the failing New York Times that I watch four to eight hours of television a day. Wrong. Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider fake news. I never watched Don Lemon, who I once called the dumbest man on television. Bad reporting.\" The media in this country has a massive credibility crisis. Look at the headline. Recent Politico morning (INAUDIBLE) poll. Forty six percent think the media make up stories about Donald Trump. The American people don't trust the media anymore and nor should they. It's because they are constantly, regularly peddling an agenda and fake news.   Now, here's another couple of examples. Now, last week both Bloomberg and Reuters, they ran wild with that story claiming that the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team had subpoenaed President Trump and his family's bank records from Deutsche Bank. Now, President Trump's legal team, they shot down those rumors and eventually Bloomberg and Reuters had to admit they were wrong yet again and issued corrections.  And if you think that's bad, that is of course, last week ABC News' Brian Ross. Well, he takes the crown for pushing fake news because earlier this month Ross claimed that General Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that candidate Trump ordered him to contact the Russians.

You would think with all these fake news embarrassments that may be the media would end this hysterical and reckless ongoing daily reporting of the president and maybe just focus on facts and trying to get it right, supposedly for consumers of news.  Here's the thing: The destroy Trump media, they have been getting worse and spreading more lies about Donald Trump since the minute he decided to run for president. This is not going to change. Mainstream media has now taken a point of almost zero accountability and reporting fake news.  Now, Glenn Greenwald from the intercept sums it up perfectly with this headline. Quote, \"The U.S. media suffered its most humiliating debacle in ages, now refuses all transparency over what happened.\" Now, the media's hatred for the president is so profound and so extreme that nothing else matters to them. They don't care about the truth. Now, think about that. They don't care -- or being fair or being balanced, not bias. By the way, we've been saying that the press is fixated on taking this president down. I believe that to be true. That's their shared mission. It's precisely why President Trump is calling this a concerted effort and a, quote, \"stain on America.\" And in that sense the president is right. Members of the mainstream media, they are just an extension of the DNC and they are fraudulent. Now, they are rigid, they're radical left-wing ideologues. They masquerade. They call themselves journalists, they are not journalists. They think they are keepers of the truth.  The press, remember, got caught colluding with Hillary Clinton and her campaign and they've been doing everything possible to inflict maximum damage on the president you elected regardless of whether it's true or not. Now, everything we've just shown you proves all of this. Now, the truth, facts don't matter to the media. Let me put it more simply. They are morally bankrupt. They have an agenda. They don't care about the truth. The agenda is the Democratic Party's agenda, the Clinton's agenda. And as a result, the press has now created a massive informational crisis in this country. And by the way, they are doing a tremendous disservice to all of us. Joining us now with reaction, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.

Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, the destroy-Trump media is spiraling out of control by manufacturing made up stories, spreading lies like we have never seen before. Fake news CNN, conspiracy TV, MSNBC and other so-called news outlets have created what is an informational crisis that affects every American. It is so egregious, so damaging and so dangerous to you, the American people. President Trump is now calling it a, quote, \"Stain on America.\" We'll going to dissect tonight. The anatomy of these fake new smears meant to damage and destroy the President you elected. Now, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, he will join us with reaction. And he has a major announcement that you'll going to want to hear. And also tonight, an explosive Fox News report. The wife of the now demoted DOJ official who met with Fusion GPS worked for the Opposition Research Firm that produced the fake news, anti-Trump Russian dossier during the 2016 election. We will have more on that breaking news tonight. And an ISIS-inspired terrorist with a pipe bomb strapped to his chest exploding the device in the heart of New York City during morning rush hour today.

Their number one goal is to damage and destroy the president you elected and clearly by any means necessary, and spreading fake news helps them to do this. Now, we've been saying it since '08, journalism in America is dead. But what is happening now is far worse, more destructive. more than anything we could have imagined. This is now outright propaganda every day. For example on Friday, fake news CNN, they go wall-to-wall, breathless reporting on the story, it turns out to be a big fat lie. Now, the Clinton News Network falsely claimed that Donald Trump Jr. received an email on September the 4, 2016 that gave him special access to hack DNC emails that were later released by WikiLeaks. Unfortunately, the report, as usual completely wrong. Here's the truth. The email that was sent to Donald Trump Jr. was actually dated September 14, not fourth, 2016, which is the day after Wikileaks put out the DNC documents. Now, fake news CNN, they hyped the story as the big smoking gun about Trump and Russia collusion and claimed they had not one but two sources verifying this false claim.

Now keep in mind, this is the same CNN, they use the model, \"facts first.\" So, we have a question tonight for the head of CNN, the chief of fake news, Jeff Zucker. Jeff, are you proud of your network? By the way, not the first time this year. Do facts come first, Jeff Zucker? When your network repeatedly tries to smear and slander the president with outright lies? You have become nothing but an extension of the DNC. And I have to tell you that Donald Jr. story was devoid of facts. And after being humiliated on Friday, Zucker then sent to stenographer, \"Humpty Dumpty\" Brian Stelter to try and clean up this whole mess. Now, instead of profusely apologizing like he should have, \"Humpty Dumpty\" tried to use his network's complete and utter fake news failure to attack President Trump.

      "utterance": "Fake news CNN isn't alone in spreading lies in fake news aimed at hurting the president. A Washington Post reporter was forced to apologize this weekend after tweeting out this highly misleading photo about the crowd size at President Trump's rally on Friday. Turns out that image that you see right there, that was taken well before President Trump ever stepped on the stage. And President Trump responded to that fake news report by tweeting out photos during his speech that showed a packed house. I'm writing, quote -- oh, very different -- \"@DaveWeigel over at The Washington Post put out a phony photo of an arena empty hours before I arrived at the venue with thousands of people outside on their way in. Real photos now show as I spoke, packed house. Many people unable to get in. Demand apology and retraction from fake news Washington Post.\" The president added this. Quote, \"Dave Weigel of The Washington Post just admitted his picture was a fake, a fraud showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed as shown also on TV. Fake news, he should be fired.\" Now, that photo is the perfect example of how the destroy-Trump media, the biased media in this country attempts to embarrass, delegitimize this president over insignificant, superfluous things at every turn. And just like other examples, this one blew up in the fake news media faces because the truth eventually hopefully does come out and because President Trump, he refuses to sit back and let the media spread lies day in and day out. But for the press in this country, nothing is too small and too petty. They will literally attempt to use anything and everything to attack the president. Take a look at this headline from The New York Times this weekend. Quote, \"Inside Trump's hour by hour battle for self-preservation.\" Now, The Times, the so-called investigative reporting over there, includes explosive information like the President has up to 12 Diet Cokes a day. That's pretty laughable. It is right up there with CNN's two scoops of ice cream for him but only one for his guests. Now the other bombshell facts from The New York Times report claims that President Trump watches up to eight hours of television a day. Now President Trump rightfully blasted the paper by tweeting, quote, \"Another false story, this time in the failing New York Times that I watch four to eight hours of television a day. Wrong. Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider fake news. I never watched Don Lemon, who I once called the dumbest man on television. Bad reporting.\" The media in this country has a massive credibility crisis. Look at the headline. Recent Politico morning (INAUDIBLE) poll. Forty six percent think the media make up stories about Donald Trump. The American people don't trust the media anymore and nor should they. It's because they are constantly, regularly peddling an agenda and fake news. Now, here's another couple of examples. Now, last week both Bloomberg and Reuters, they ran wild with that story claiming that the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team had subpoenaed President Trump and his family's bank records from Deutsche Bank. Now, President Trump's legal team, they shot down those rumors and eventually Bloomberg and Reuters had to admit they were wrong yet again and issued corrections. And if you think that's bad, that is of course, last week ABC News' Brian Ross. Well, he takes the crown for pushing fake news because earlier this month Ross claimed that General Michael Flynn was prepared to testify that candidate Trump ordered him to contact the Russians. Take a look."

He's prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate, Donald Trump ordered him directly to make contact with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    {
      "speaker": "ROSS",
      "utterance": "A clarification tonight on something one of the confidantes told us and it we reported earlier today. He said the President has asked Flynn to contact Russia during the campaign. He's now clarifying that saying, according to Flynn, candidate Trump asked him during the campaign to find ways to repair relations with Russia and other aspects. And then after the election, the President-elect asked him -- told him to contact Russia on issues including working together to fight ISIS."

Now, there's obviously a huge difference between Brian Ross's original report and what actually happened. That's why he got suspended for four weeks without pay and he's been banned from reporting now on the president in the future. You would think with all these fake news embarrassments that may be the media would end this hysterical and reckless ongoing daily reporting of the president and maybe just focus on facts and trying to get it right, supposedly for consumers of news."

      "speaker": "Here's the thing",
      "utterance": "The destroy Trump media, they have been getting worse and spreading more lies about Donald Trump since the minute he decided to run for president. This is not going to change. Mainstream media has now taken a point of almost zero accountability and reporting fake news. Now, Glenn Greenwald from the intercept sums it up perfectly with this headline. Quote, \"The U.S. media suffered its most humiliating debacle in ages, now refuses all transparency over what happened.\" Now, the media's hatred for the president is so profound and so extreme that nothing else matters to them. They don't care about the truth. Now, think about that. They don't care -- or being fair or being balanced, not bias. By the way, we've been saying that the press is fixated on taking this president down. I believe that to be true. That's their shared mission. It's precisely why President Trump is calling this a concerted effort and a, quote, \"stain on America.\" And in that sense the president is right. Members of the mainstream media, they are just an extension of the DNC and they are fraudulent. Now, they are rigid, they're radical left-wing ideologues. They masquerade. They call themselves journalists, they are not journalists. They think they are keepers of the truth. The press, remember, got caught colluding with Hillary Clinton and her campaign and they've been doing everything possible to inflict maximum damage on the president you elected regardless of whether it's true or not. Now, everything we've just shown you proves all of this. Now, the truth, facts don't matter to the media. Let me put it more simply. They are morally bankrupt. They have an agenda. They don't care about the truth. The agenda is the Democratic Party's agenda, the Clinton's agenda. And as a result, the press has now created a massive informational crisis in this country. And by the way, they are doing a tremendous disservice to all of us. Joining us now with reaction, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. I know that in the time that you were press secretary, you try to get along, you try to be nice. It seems nothing you could do whatever appeased that group that was in that White House Press Corps.

But there's a bigger point here, Sean, which is that in the Brian Ross story, it moved markets. People lost money because of this mistake. And here's what I think the true egregious nature of this is. And what Brian Ross did in the clip that you played is something that happens all too often. They don't correct it, they don't apologize for it, they, quote, \"update it.\" And that's a copout. When they are wrong, they update their story and just say, we have additional information. When someone else makes a mistake or add something to it, they say that they lie or misled them. They hold everybody else to one standard and themselves to quite another."

And it spread like wildfire. Isn't that the same as colluding to influence the American people in the middle of an election with Russian lies?"

And that literally they are writing her exoneration without doing the complete investigation. Now, didn't the media get a little suspicious about 33,000 deleted emails in the bathroom of a mom-and-pop shop that it did have classified top secret special access program information on it. Mishandling information, that type of information is a felony. Destroying that information is a felony. And then just for good measure she used Bleach Bit and acid washed the hard drives and then busted up all of the devices that were connected to that.

I just arrived yesterday back from Australia.

That in fact he had met with the Fusion GPS people. Now we find out his wife worked for them and it turned out Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies to influence the election and the American people."

I mean seriously. Did they go down the Clinton foundation donor list and the Fusion GPS source list and employee list and say hey, we need you guys in the DOJ and on the special counsel. Sean, this woman works there. She said she is married to a guy who had a very powerful position in the DOJ, who by the way didn't feel they need to disclose this, that this may have been a conflict of interest. By the way, why wasn't all of the stuff told to the House Intelligence Committee a long time ago? Why so cryptic about it if there's nothing to hide? Listen, this is one big joke on the American people, but unfortunately it will have real-world ramifications."

Do you think Hillary, now that we know they denied a for a year, that her campaign and money of the DNC she was running according to Donna Brazile, that they paid for this Russian propaganda, these lies to influence the American people, is that collusion?"

Just go to Hannity.com and you can put in your vote. Is it fake news CNN and their botched report on the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks? Or ABC's story that candidate Trump order Flynn to contact the Russians or Bloomberg's false scoop on Trump's bank records being subpoenaed or a Washington reporter's grossly misleading tweet about the size of Friday's Trump rally. It's so good, which one do you pick? We'll add more every day, because you get fake news every day. All right. Unfortunately, that is all the time we have left this evening. We promise we will never ever be the destroy Trump fake news media. We are going to be fair and balance. Thanks for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled. The news continues. Laura is next.
