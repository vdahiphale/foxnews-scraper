For two years on this program, we have watched a political persecution, all based on lies and a hoax driven by anti-Trump hatred, and literally wrecking the very fabric of our society. We have massive developments tonight on many fronts.  The Attorney General William Barr went before the Senate appropriations committee today and the boomerang that I have been telling you about is emotion. It is headed right back in the direction that I told you it would head.  And we also have a brand-new just released today closed-door testimony from the general counsel of the FBI under Comey. And it is full of massive examples of upper echelon FBI DOJ abuse of power.  And also just breaking moments ago, multiple outlets, including \"The Wall Street Journal\", reporting Greg Craig, the White House counsel for Barack Obama, expects to be indicted over his work in Ukraine. We'll have more on that in a moment. Also, we begin with the “Hannity” truth watch with a question. How did all of this happen? How did it begin?  We've got to get to the bottom of this or we will not have equal justice and equal application of our laws. Future elections, and yes, potential presidential deep state coups will occur. Now, today, the attorney general, he delivered a bombshell development during his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee -- exactly what we have been telling you, over two years is true.

They have no character, no ethics, no integrity. They should be apologizing, retracting, correcting all of the damage that they have done. They just double down on lying. And the media, the Democrats, they are so blinded by this hate, this rage, they are incapable of seeing the stone cold truth right before their eyes. Let's look at this: July 2016, we know that the FBI opened up a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos after he spoke with an informant, maybe even before this.   We know in that same month, the FBI attempted to wiretap campaign associate Carter Page for no good reason. We know that in July 2016, top Obama officials including Susan Rice, the year 2016, they ramped up their own masking efforts a whopping 350 percent.  Final year, the election year, in October 2016, the FBI began successfully spying on Carter Page after getting that FISA warrant by committing a fraud on multiple levels to the FISA court, using Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies. They never told the judges that. The bulk of information were unverified, uncooperated, information paid for by Hillary. And guess what, they denied an American citizen his constitutional rights. And they got their back door right into the Trump campaign through Carter Page. And in December the 15th of 2016, we know that the Obama officials, oh, they just incidentally spied on Trump officials after Rice -- well, she reportedly unmasked the names of Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, lieutenant general 33 year veteran Michael Flynn. Yes, there was fine -- as we have reported, more rightly so many, many times.   Now, sadly, that is only one small part of this abuse of power and corruption. Now, throughout the night we will show you in full timeline. We have reported everything. But guess what, after months and months of waiting. The truth and justice and facts in spite of all of them are now becoming cascading down and will drown the proper people. Criminal referrals, the Horowitz report, the Huber report, the release of more closed-door testimony. Yes, we'll get those FISA applications, Gang of Eight materials, 302s. We are waiting on a Florida court to release information on Christopher Steele, that should be very revealing and enlightening. And an answer to this important question. Watch.",

      "sentences": "Clearly, there was extreme corruption by a powerful few at the highest level of our government. The evidence of this is riddled throughout the now public transcript of the bigger testimony.  Today, Congressman Doug Collins released yet a second day of closed-door testimony from the FBI's former top lawyer. Tonight, we are learning very revealing brand-new bombshells, according to Baker. The DOJ was having open discussions about appointing an independent counsel to investigate the Trump campaign long before Comey was fired. Quote: I don't even remember who said it quite honestly, but I am telling you that the topic did come up before the firing. Now, wait, we are told that the eight days in May after Comey was fired, that's what triggered the special counsel. Well, as it turns out, it was in the works all along. Why? Because Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, and all of these other deep state officials that thought that Hillary should win 100 million to zero, and that we are all smelly Walmart people that are going to vote for Trump, they were desperate to remove Trump from office, remember, they had an insurance policy.  In fact, Baker alleging that McCabe, Page, Rod Rosenstein were discussing removing President Trump, undoing an election by using the 25th Amendment. Even allegedly breaking that they had two administration cabinet members on board with the scheme, this plot, this coup. No joking matter. Baker testified, quote: I took it seriously, because my assessment was that they took it seriously. Baker also revealing that Rod Rosenstein offered to wear that wire and spy on the president of the United States without cause, and that no one alerted the president or anyone else about this illegal plot. And keep in mind, prior to Trump's inauguration, James Baker was fed Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier by liberal reporter David Corn, and a lawyer associated with the Clinton campaign. Now, the contents of the dossier were being passed around at the highest levels of the DOJ, FBI, intel community, around the same time that Clinton was cleared of all charges. Baker testified that he thought Hillary Clinton should have been indicted. He has the top lawyer under Comey. Quote, I had that belief initially after reviewing a large binder of her emails that had classified information in them. That is a violation, 18 USC 793, that's the Espionage Act. Baker said that he was persuaded out of it by his colleagues.  Well, they want to the Clinton matter swept under the rug, even Page and Strzok said that the fix was in. They have no there there, but all of that decisions are made by Loretta Lynch and the Democrats at the Department of Justice.  Now, look at our new timeline, how did we get to this point? Let's start July 10, 2015, FBI opened a criminal investigation, code name \"Midyear Exam\" into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information on that private server. September 2015, Obama's A.G. Loretta Lynch asked the FBI Director Comey to refer to Clinton's criminal investigation, not as an investigation it is, but as a matter. On March 4th, 2016, top FBI officials Strzok and Page are texting about their utter contempt for Donald Trump, one time calling him an idiot, saying that Clinton should win, oh, 100 million to zero, and that we are smelly Walmart voters of Trump. And in March 2nd, May 2nd rather of 2016, Comey, Strzok, others drafting a letter exonerating Hillary, changing the language from gross negligence to legal standard to extreme carelessness, which it is not before they ever investigated or interviewed Hillary. And then on June 27, 2016, that's when Lynch met Bill Clinton in a secret meeting at a private plane on a tarmac in Phoenix. July 22nd, 2016, two months after the beginning of the exoneration. Other key witnesses, Hillary Clinton finally interviewed by Peter Strzok who hates Trump, and other FBI agents.  And on July 5th, Comey officially exonerates Clinton. In that very same month, then the FBI opens a counterintelligence investigation into Trump- Russia collusion. That one is called Crossfire Hurricane. In the very same month, the associate director Bruce Ohr meets with Christopher Steele on multiple occasions, but his wife Nellie works with Steele, and shares the dirty Russian dossier with McCabe, Strzok, Page, even Andrew Weissmann and others. Ohr warns them that the dossier is campaign op research tainted with bias. It's not verified, Hillary paid for it and Steele hates Trump. In July, one-time CIA operative Stefan Halper reportedly meets with Trump advisors, Page, George Papadopoulos secretly gathering information for the FBI. Then on August 15th, again, 2016, before the election, Strzok text Lisa Page about a scenario where President Trump gets elected, quote: we can't take that risk. And they speak of needing the insurance policy. September 2nd, 2016, Page and Strzok text that President Obama wants to know everything we are doing. October 22nd, 2016, that's when the FBI obtained the FISA warrant to surveilled Trump campaign associate Carter Page, the bulk of the application relying on Steele's dirty dossier, with Russian lies paid for by Hillary. Wow, a whole entry into the entire world of Donald Trump and his campaign. On November 1st, 2016, the FBI fires Christopher Steele for lying and leaking.   December 15th, President Trump is president-elect, Obama intel officials accidentally, quote, spy on Trump officials. Obama national security adviser Susan Rice reportedly unmasking the names of Bannon, Kushner, and General Flynn. January 2017, Comey briefed the president that the dossier's contents were salacious and unverified, but in October, well, he signed the first FISA warrant. May 9th, 2017, the president fired FBI director Comey making Trump hater Andrew McCabe the acting FBI director. He is friends with page and Strzok. May 17th, 2017, Robert Rosenstein appoints Robert Mueller special counsel, Mueller immediately hires Strzok, Weissmann, Jeannie Ray. Weissmann, of course, was at the Clinton victory party, the attorney for the Clinton foundations, and all Democrats and builders to lead the investigation. The majority of the staff, big time Democratic donors, zero Republicans hired.  June 8th, 2017, former FBI Director Comey admits having engineered a leak of his own, memo to \"The New York Times,\" to spur the appointment of the special counsel. Flash forward, march 2nd, this year. Nearly two years, $30 million later, no collusion, no obstruction, nothing. The evidence is clear. The president was set up by a powerful group of unelected individuals desperate to stop him into getting elected, and help his opponent, Hillary Clinton get elected and then try to destroy him after the election. Joining us now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan.  Mr. Jordan, Congresswoman, anything I said you know is wrong?

That's one thing that I think that people really need to understand.  This is not going to drag out for years on end. Barr says the I.G. report is coming out in May or June.

      "utterance": "Welcome to “Hannity.” Tonight, this is the real deal. We are now inching closer and closer to truth and to justice, and we're holding those that abuse power accountable. For two years on this program, we have watched a political persecution, all based on lies and a hoax driven by anti-Trump hatred, and literally wrecking the very fabric of our society. We have massive developments tonight on many fronts. The Attorney General William Barr went before the Senate appropriations committee today and the boomerang that I have been telling you about is emotion. It is headed right back in the direction that I told you it would head. And we also have a brand-new just released today closed-door testimony from the general counsel of the FBI under Comey. And it is full of massive examples of upper echelon FBI DOJ abuse of power. And also just breaking moments ago, multiple outlets, including \"The Wall Street Journal\", reporting Greg Craig, the White House counsel for Barack Obama, expects to be indicted over his work in Ukraine. We'll have more on that in a moment. Also, we begin with the “Hannity” truth watch with a question. How did all of this happen? How did it begin? We've got to get to the bottom of this or we will not have equal justice and equal application of our laws. Future elections, and yes, potential presidential deep state coups will occur. Now, today, the attorney general, he delivered a bombshell development during his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee -- exactly what we have been telling you, over two years is true. Take a look."

We know in that same month, the FBI attempted to wiretap campaign associate Carter Page for no good reason. We know that in July 2016, top Obama officials including Susan Rice, the year 2016, they ramped up their own masking efforts a whopping 350 percent. Final year, the election year, in October 2016, the FBI began successfully spying on Carter Page after getting that FISA warrant by committing a fraud on multiple levels to the FISA court, using Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies. They never told the judges that. The bulk of information were unverified, uncooperated, information paid for by Hillary. And guess what, they denied an American citizen his constitutional rights. And they got their back door right into the Trump campaign through Carter Page. And in December the 15th of 2016, we know that the Obama officials, oh, they just incidentally spied on Trump officials after Rice -- well, she reportedly unmasked the names of Steve Bannon, Jared Kushner, lieutenant general 33 year veteran Michael Flynn. Yes, there was fine -- as we have reported, more rightly so many, many times. Now, sadly, that is only one small part of this abuse of power and corruption. Now, throughout the night we will show you in full timeline. We have reported everything. But guess what, after months and months of waiting. The truth and justice and facts in spite of all of them are now becoming cascading down and will drown the proper people. Criminal referrals, the Horowitz report, the Huber report, the release of more closed-door testimony. Yes, we'll get those FISA applications, Gang of Eight materials, 302s. We are waiting on a Florida court to release information on Christopher Steele, that should be very revealing and enlightening. And an answer to this important question. Watch."

      "speaker": "Today, Congressman Doug Collins released yet a second day of closed-door testimony from the FBI's former top lawyer. Tonight, we are learning very revealing brand-new bombshells, according to Baker. The DOJ was having open discussions about appointing an independent counsel to investigate the Trump campaign long before Comey was fired. Quote",
      "utterance": "I don't even remember who said it quite honestly, but I am telling you that the topic did come up before the firing. Now, wait, we are told that the eight days in May after Comey was fired, that's what triggered the special counsel. Well, as it turns out, it was in the works all along. Why? Because Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, and all of these other deep state officials that thought that Hillary should win 100 million to zero, and that we are all smelly Walmart people that are going to vote for Trump, they were desperate to remove Trump from office, remember, they had an insurance policy. In fact, Baker alleging that McCabe, Page, Rod Rosenstein were discussing removing President Trump, undoing an election by using the 25th Amendment. Even allegedly breaking that they had two administration cabinet members on board with the scheme, this plot, this coup. No joking matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Baker testified, quote",
      "utterance": "I took it seriously, because my assessment was that they took it seriously. Baker also revealing that Rod Rosenstein offered to wear that wire and spy on the president of the United States without cause, and that no one alerted the president or anyone else about this illegal plot. And keep in mind, prior to Trump's inauguration, James Baker was fed Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier by liberal reporter David Corn, and a lawyer associated with the Clinton campaign. Now, the contents of the dossier were being passed around at the highest levels of the DOJ, FBI, intel community, around the same time that Clinton was cleared of all charges. Baker testified that he thought Hillary Clinton should have been indicted. He has the top lawyer under Comey. Quote, I had that belief initially after reviewing a large binder of her emails that had classified information in them. That is a violation, 18 USC 793, that's the Espionage Act. Baker said that he was persuaded out of it by his colleagues. Well, they want to the Clinton matter swept under the rug, even Page and Strzok said that the fix was in. They have no there there, but all of that decisions are made by Loretta Lynch and the Democrats at the Department of Justice. Now, look at our new timeline, how did we get to this point? Let's start July 10, 2015, FBI opened a criminal investigation, code name \"Midyear Exam\" into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information on that private server. September 2015, Obama's A.G. Loretta Lynch asked the FBI Director Comey to refer to Clinton's criminal investigation, not as an investigation it is, but as a matter. On March 4th, 2016, top FBI officials Strzok and Page are texting about their utter contempt for Donald Trump, one time calling him an idiot, saying that Clinton should win, oh, 100 million to zero, and that we are smelly Walmart voters of Trump. And in March 2nd, May 2nd rather of 2016, Comey, Strzok, others drafting a letter exonerating Hillary, changing the language from gross negligence to legal standard to extreme carelessness, which it is not before they ever investigated or interviewed Hillary. And then on June 27, 2016, that's when Lynch met Bill Clinton in a secret meeting at a private plane on a tarmac in Phoenix. July 22nd, 2016, two months after the beginning of the exoneration. Other key witnesses, Hillary Clinton finally interviewed by Peter Strzok who hates Trump, and other FBI agents. And on July 5th, Comey officially exonerates Clinton. In that very same month, then the FBI opens a counterintelligence investigation into Trump- Russia collusion. That one is called Crossfire Hurricane. In the very same month, the associate director Bruce Ohr meets with Christopher Steele on multiple occasions, but his wife Nellie works with Steele, and shares the dirty Russian dossier with McCabe, Strzok, Page, even Andrew Weissmann and others. Ohr warns them that the dossier is campaign op research tainted with bias. It's not verified, Hillary paid for it and Steele hates Trump. In July, one-time CIA operative Stefan Halper reportedly meets with Trump advisors, Page, George Papadopoulos secretly gathering information for the FBI. Then on August 15th, again, 2016, before the election, Strzok text Lisa Page about a scenario where President Trump gets elected, quote: we can't take that risk. And they speak of needing the insurance policy. September 2nd, 2016, Page and Strzok text that President Obama wants to know everything we are doing. October 22nd, 2016, that's when the FBI obtained the FISA warrant to surveilled Trump campaign associate Carter Page, the bulk of the application relying on Steele's dirty dossier, with Russian lies paid for by Hillary. Wow, a whole entry into the entire world of Donald Trump and his campaign. On November 1st, 2016, the FBI fires Christopher Steele for lying and leaking. December 15th, President Trump is president-elect, Obama intel officials accidentally, quote, spy on Trump officials. Obama national security adviser Susan Rice reportedly unmasking the names of Bannon, Kushner, and General Flynn. January 2017, Comey briefed the president that the dossier's contents were salacious and unverified, but in October, well, he signed the first FISA warrant. May 9th, 2017, the president fired FBI director Comey making Trump hater Andrew McCabe the acting FBI director. He is friends with page and Strzok. May 17th, 2017, Robert Rosenstein appoints Robert Mueller special counsel, Mueller immediately hires Strzok, Weissmann, Jeannie Ray. Weissmann, of course, was at the Clinton victory party, the attorney for the Clinton foundations, and all Democrats and builders to lead the investigation. The majority of the staff, big time Democratic donors, zero Republicans hired. June 8th, 2017, former FBI Director Comey admits having engineered a leak of his own, memo to \"The New York Times,\" to spur the appointment of the special counsel. Flash forward, march 2nd, this year. Nearly two years, $30 million later, no collusion, no obstruction, nothing. The evidence is clear. The president was set up by a powerful group of unelected individuals desperate to stop him into getting elected, and help his opponent, Hillary Clinton get elected and then try to destroy him after the election. Joining us now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. Mr. Jordan, Congresswoman, anything I said you know is wrong? I know a few more details can be filled in, but that's the synopsis."

      "utterance": "No, it was well done. And, look, remember what Chuck Schumer said two years ago about then President-elect Trump, he said if you mess with the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you. Bill Barr is going to find out if that statement was actually carried out. And that's what I so appreciate what the attorney general said. And I think that the American people appreciate it too. When you stop and think about, they want an attorney general whose focus on accountability in truth, and that's exactly what Bill Barr is going to get to, and he's going to find out if what Chuck Schumer said two years and three months ago if, in fact, that's what took place. And all the things you just went through, it sure looks like it did. It sure looks like it."

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely, I mean, he wants to get to the bottom of it. He says that the Trump campaign was spied on, he does not know what the predicate for that spying was. He wants to look into it. He wants to investigate it. He wants to understand it. And he is going to hold people accountable. All of the sources that I've spoken to, Sean, have said that Attorney General Barr is methodical, he is calm natured, he is not going to be pushed around by anybody -- not by Mueller, not by President Trump, not by anyone, not by the FBI, not by the people in the DOJ. He is going to do his job. He is going to follow the rule of law. And if people broke the law, which we can see, based on the evidence that we have uncovered over the last several years, and based on the evidence that Congress has uncovered that there is so much evidence of malfeasance within the FBI and the DOJ, that there needs to be a full-fledged investigation. And I think that this is why Attorney General Barr has now moved forward. He's openly stated that we have a team investigating this. And he is moving quickly. That's one thing that I think that people really need to understand. This is not going to drag out for years on end. Barr says the I.G. report is coming out in May or June. Barr has notified Congress that he is looking into these allegations. And Barr has already said that he will release Mueller's report, redacted report next week."

Maybe they care about beating up devices and removing SIM cards, that's obstruction. Well, maybe there is a line or two in the Mueller report, but we now have the Barr investigation. He will review the actions from the get-go here. That probably means that Hillary Clinton's investigation should be reopened. We will start there. But then we have the inspector general, and the FISA abuse. Then we have John Huber, whatever he is doing, nobody seems to know. Then we have 302s that will come out and the FISA applications come out."

They never told the court that it was unverified. And, by the way, we know unverifiable, because Steele does not stand by his own dossier. And so, they never verified it.

I believe that the counterintelligence investigation is questionable at best. And I still don't know why they would not tell Trump, hey, a couple of people on your campaign may be working with the Russians like they told Feinstein about somebody on her -- in her office working with the Chinese.

You want - Democrats care about obstruction. Look at Hillary's e-mail server subpoenaed e-mails. Here's the thing though. It can't be verified. As a matter of fact, most of it's been debunked in terms of the dossier. And the reason it can't be verified is because the author, he won't even stand by his own dossier when he was put under oath and an interrogator in Great Britain. So, we know that was false and call me in - sign the first warrant application in October 2016 went to Trump Tower in January 2017. Then President-elect Trump said, he said it's not verified, but salacious. So, did Comey lie to Trump then or did he lie on the FISA application, but he lied on one of those occasions."

So, if in fact the dossier is unverified to this day which I believe how could you use it to get a warrant against an American citizen four times. If he really told Trump here it is, we can't verify it. Why would you use the same document before a court to say we believe it's accurate enough to get a warrant. If you really believe that Trump's campaign was being infiltrated by Russians, why didn't you tell him so he could do something about it. And how could Clinton get away with all of this and not have anything. No charges at all. When the average person would probably be in jail now. I think it has a lot to do about a political bias."

So, while Bernie and Warren are reaping in big bucks while they're pushing the policies that will cripple the ability for poor working people to build the wealth for themselves in a country of freedom. They want sky high corporate tax rates 90 percent, 70 percent top marginal rates. History is clear. Large scale socialism, it enriches those at the very top. Massive taxes regulation only makes it harder to do things like start a business and build factories and manufacturing centers and jobs and opportunity.

The problem as I lay this out in a chalkboard. We've done about a year's worth of research on this. The problem is actually coming from Chicago. There is a group as family that has a United Methodist Church. There are preachers. They're the ones that started the sanctuary city. They are directly getting money from George Soros and others and they are the ones that are if I may, \"they are the ones that help charter the routes, arrange bus transportations and negotiate with Mexican officials to provide protection. That's from the AP. But when you find out who these people are, let me quote another. This I think is from UC San Diego. They said these latest members a zealous group of college student's community orders young professionals strove to lead and build national immigrant rights movement vis-a-vis CASA, informed by far-left politics, Marxist, Leninist thought, a communist ideology based on the theories of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin with an international world view.

It was a tactic used in China or by China against us in the Korean War where they just throw wave after wave after wave of people until you just can't fight it anymore. That's what's happening.

We found a document that was written by the Soviet historians, it was never made - it never meant to be made public. It saw the light of day in the 1960s, but it was how the Soviet Union got around all of the treaties that they had signed with Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt and how they flipped countries. How did they take Czechoslovakia which at the time was a very pro-free market kind of place and flip it communist without any tanks? They laid out a plan. It took them three years to do it. What I believe we are three to five years from seeing the end of this republic if we don't wake up, turn to God, turn back to God, beg him for forgiveness, ask him for help and then just name the enemy.
