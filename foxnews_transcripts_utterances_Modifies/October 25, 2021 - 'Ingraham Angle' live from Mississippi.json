      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is the INGRAHAM ANGLE. Welcome to Oxford, Mississippi. We are live from the campus of Ole Miss. This is wild here. OK. So tomorrow the number 12 rank rebels are going to take on the LSU Tigers in a legendary rivalry. And over the past few days, the campus has swelled with alums from both teams flooding into town. And another highlight of the weekend, former Ole Miss quarterback, the great Eli Manning and his family are in town and his number 10 jersey will be retired tomorrow. It's going to be extremely emotional. And it's going to hang next to the jersey of his father, Archie Manning, another former Ole Miss QB superstar, who played 13 seasons in the NFL. Now, the Manning family is beloved here in Oxford. So it's a special time to be here indeed. So I don't know about you guys, but the energy here is pretty electric. The crowd is nice. Now, I wanted to - I want - everybody knows already who watches this show, and they listen to me on radio for years that I'm a major SEC football fan. And the tradition of football is just a huge part of life. Not just here in the south, but it's also, of course, across the Midwest, the West Coast, New England, where I'm from. And once a week every fall, we gather together in our homes at bars and stadiums, at tailgates, to cheer for our favorite teams. And it's what they call the old normal. It's called America. All right. And we told you a year and a half ago that the tragedy of this pandemic wasn't just going to be measured in the number of lives lost, but in how much of our culture and our traditions we lose in the process. We warned you that a lot of powerful people will try to use the temporary COVID crisis to create a new normal. Come on. They still have people masked up in blue state America and under areas of federal control. And with few exemptions allowed, they'll exclude you, they'll fire you. They'll even shame you for not complying with vaccine mandates. Thousands of Americans have been forced out of their jobs in just the past week. Although Joe Biden last night said such concerns about vaccine mandates and people losing their jobs. They were just really overblown.",

Patriotic, hardworking Americans fought to preserve their pre-pandemic lives.

So fast forward to this year, when Fauci and others said football, especially college football, would be super spreader events. Well, all of us ignored them. We knew the science of outdoor transmission better than Dr. Fauci did, despite his prestigious degrees in all of his titles. The mass outbreaks that were predicted did not happen, thankfully. The south and the heartland fought harder than the rest of the country to keep our schools open, to keep our churches open, to keep our county fairs going, and yes, to keep college football going.",

And we also know that we manage those risks better than Washington D.C. ever could. Now, you think about college football. You have the school songs, the chance, the cheers and the parties before the game, that adds to all the atmosphere. But in the end, results matter. Stats are meticulously analyzed. TDs, interceptions, passing and rushing yards, and the end either win or lose. But in politics, other than on maybe Election Day, you can insulate yourself from scrutiny, despite repeated screw ups, faulty predictions, fumbles, you get the point. Oh, if you're a liberal, if you're woke, that usually means zero accountability. And that only seems to make them angrier by the way that they have no accountability, and they get more resentful along the way. Well, as for us, tonight and tomorrow across the United States, we're all going to be having fun with family and friends. And we're going to be getting ready to root for our teams. Knowing that, no, they're going to make mistakes. But we're going to remain loyal and hopeful about next season. It's part of their tradition that the left hates about America. They like tearing down our traditions. You know what I say? I say life's too short to be as unhappy and as miserable as they are. I've never seen anyone hate their own team as much as the left hates America. Feeling the excitement here tonight, it reminds me of a quote that I read by an Ole Miss alum in the New York Times many years ago. She said, \"We might not win every game, but we've never lost a party\". And in the end, we might even - might even invite Dr. Fauci. All right. Here with me now, and I'm so excited he's with us, is Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves. Governor, wonderful to see you tonight. I know you've been in the excitement for the last couple of days here. It's insane. I thought Tuscaloosa was crazy till I came to - came to Oxford. Mississippi has been vilified, ridiculed in the press, for not bowing down to some of the COVID tyrants. Yet your state now has a 5.5 percent unemployment. Places like New York City, over 10 percent. Governor, your thoughts tonight looking back on this period?",

So tomorrow the number 12 rank rebels are going to take on the LSU Tigers in a legendary rivalry. And over the past few days, the campus has swelled with alums from both teams flooding into town. And another highlight of the weekend, former Ole Miss quarterback, the great Eli Manning and his family are in town and his number 10 jersey will be retired tomorrow. It's going to be extremely emotional. And it's going to hang next to the jersey of his father, Archie Manning, another former Ole Miss QB superstar, who played 13 seasons in the NFL. Now, the Manning family is beloved here in Oxford. So it's a special time to be here indeed. So I don't know about you guys, but the energy here is pretty electric. The crowd is nice. Now, I wanted to - I want - everybody knows already who watches this show, and they listen to me on radio for years that I'm a major SEC football fan. And the tradition of football is just a huge part of life. Not just here in the south, but it's also, of course, across the Midwest, the West Coast, New England, where I'm from. And once a week every fall, we gather together in our homes at bars and stadiums, at tailgates, to cheer for our favorite teams. And it's what they call the old normal. It's called America. All right. And we told you a year and a half ago that the tragedy of this pandemic wasn't just going to be measured in the number of lives lost, but in how much of our culture and our traditions we lose in the process. We warned you that a lot of powerful people will try to use the temporary COVID crisis to create a new normal. Come on. They still have people masked up in blue state America and under areas of federal control. And with few exemptions allowed, they'll exclude you, they'll fire you. They'll even shame you for not complying with vaccine mandates. Thousands of Americans have been forced out of their jobs in just the past week. Although Joe Biden last night said such concerns about vaccine mandates and people losing their jobs. They were just really overblown."

Tell that to the 1900 state employees in Washington State now out of work, Mr. President; or the 34,000 health care workers in New York, who've been pushed out for refusing to get the jab. And the list by the way goes on and on. Now, most hardening since the early days of the pandemic is how red state America did not reflexively bow down. Patriotic, hardworking Americans fought to preserve their pre-pandemic lives. Now, this willingness to fight for our freedoms, to maintain our traditions, to defy the so-called experts who weren't elected by the way to anything, to make decisions for ourselves, all this the left detests. And Biden, he just doesn't understand."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

His own CDC, by the way, concedes that you can spread the virus whether you're vaccinated or not. Democrats love though calling everything an emergency. COVID is an emergency, climate's an emergency, racism is an emergency. You name it. Because when you call something an emergency, it gives Washington more power. So fast forward to this year, when Fauci and others said football, especially college football, would be super spreader events. Well, all of us ignored them. We knew the science of outdoor transmission better than Dr. Fauci did, despite his prestigious degrees in all of his titles. The mass outbreaks that were predicted did not happen, thankfully. The south and the heartland fought harder than the rest of the country to keep our schools open, to keep our churches open, to keep our county fairs going, and yes, to keep college football going."

      "utterance": "Now, we understand that Americans have an inherent right to self determination. That means we understand that life is filled with risks. And we also know that we manage those risks better than Washington D.C. ever could. Now, you think about college football. You have the school songs, the chance, the cheers and the parties before the game, that adds to all the atmosphere. But in the end, results matter. Stats are meticulously analyzed. TDs, interceptions, passing and rushing yards, and the end either win or lose. But in politics, other than on maybe Election Day, you can insulate yourself from scrutiny, despite repeated screw ups, faulty predictions, fumbles, you get the point. Oh, if you're a liberal, if you're woke, that usually means zero accountability. And that only seems to make them angrier by the way that they have no accountability, and they get more resentful along the way. Well, as for us, tonight and tomorrow across the United States, we're all going to be having fun with family and friends. And we're going to be getting ready to root for our teams. Knowing that, no, they're going to make mistakes. But we're going to remain loyal and hopeful about next season. It's part of their tradition that the left hates about America. They like tearing down our traditions. You know what I say? I say life's too short to be as unhappy and as miserable as they are. I've never seen anyone hate their own team as much as the left hates America. Feeling the excitement here tonight, it reminds me of a quote that I read by an Ole Miss alum in the New York Times many years ago. She said, \"We might not win every game, but we've never lost a party\". And in the end, we might even - might even invite Dr. Fauci. All right. Here with me now, and I'm so excited he's with us, is Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves. Governor, wonderful to see you tonight. I know you've been in the excitement for the last couple of days here. It's insane. I thought Tuscaloosa was crazy till I came to - came to Oxford. Mississippi has been vilified, ridiculed in the press, for not bowing down to some of the COVID tyrants. Yet your state now has a 5.5 percent unemployment. Places like New York City, over 10 percent. Governor, your thoughts tonight looking back on this period?"

And I got to tell you, Laura, it's great to have you here in Oxford, Mississippi, what we really think is as real America. And we'd love to have an SEC football fan like yourself right here with us. And you're going to see a great football game here, Laura."

When you watch what's happening across the country, we've been telling people now for over a year, governor, that the recovery could be led and would be led by the red states, including Mississippi. Here's proof. \"The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported real GDP for the state increased at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the first quarter 2021 and that Mississippi surpassed its pre-recession level of real GDP before the United States did.\" Until we started getting ready for the show tonight, I didn't know that fact.

In fact, last year in 2020 during COVID-19, we actually saw capital investment exceed $1.9 billion in our state, which was twice the average over the last eight years. We're seeing people around the country looking at Mississippi and other red states, by the way, because we've been open for business. We have a business friendly climate, we have a great place to come visit. I will tell you. You mentioned New York City earlier, it's a great American city. But you can't find better restaurants than you find right here in Oxford, Mississippi. Anywhere in New York City."

And we're having an incredible time, and I hope people are going to love the documentary behind the scenes of SEC football, the pomp, and the circumstance, the pageantry of it all. But we're actually doing a really cool thing for the college football pre- game show on Big Fox tomorrow. We're going to be at Luke Bryan's farm, Laura, raising money for the Brett Boyer Foundation. Luke's nephew died of a congenital heart condition and since then, they have made it their quest to raise as much money to fight pediatric heart conditions through the Brett Boyer Foundation. And so Luke Bryan is going to be on with me tomorrow morning talking college football. We're going to help raise some money. It's an awesome thing Fox is doing. And I can't wait to be a part of it.

And all those people in Oxford know what I'm talking about. I'm born and bred in the south. I know how important to the culture it is to be in big, full football stadiums on Saturday, celebrating your teams. And the only way, Laura, you know this, and all those people there with you know it too. The only way we get back to normalcy is by kicking the ass of fear. And that's what football oftentimes is all about. So when we all come together in communion on a Saturday rooting for our special teams and their favorite teams, and everybody is in those crowded stadiums. There's not a mask to be seen, your high five and everybody around you, that is how we reclaim American normalcy. That's how we kick Dr. Fauci's ass.

No show on that list has ever originated from outside a big city. Until now. Joining me now is Lee Habeeb, host of 'Our American Stories' that broadcast from right here in Oxford, Mississippi. Lee, you and I started the radio show all those years ago. I can't believe how long ago it was. Back in 2001, your show was a huge success. But you're kind of like my cousin Vinnie (inaudible). I mean, you came from New Jersey, and then you relocated here, raised your family here. What's so great about Mississippi that brought a city boy down here?

It's just people being together. And I wanted to do the show about college football, because it's actually not political. I mean I'm political. But the football isn't political.

My Lebanese grandparents and my Sicilian parents - grandparents did not come here because it's a white supremacist nation, nor do my Kenyan friends, Chinese friends, Mexican friends. It's a beautiful country. It's not a perfect country. Every night, two hours a night, we tell stories about America's past, present. We even told a beautiful story about Barbra Streisand, because in the end, what can - what kind of a life is that that she starts as a important Jewish girl in Brooklyn, goes to Erasmus High School, and because of intellectual property rights, meritocracy, she rises to be the greatest star in the world and is worth $600 million. What a story! And we celebrate her story. Henry Ford's fate stories. And the show is a runaway hit, I think in large measure, because it comes from a small town America. And most people live in small town America. And you know, and I know. I lived in LA for a year in New York. People from small towns go to those big cities, they stay for a little while, and then they come back home."

I have nothing against people expressing their opinions, but your just is not to indoctrinate. It's to tell people who Thomas Jefferson. And he didn't just own slaves. He wrote the Declaration of Independence, had a formidable part in the Northwest Ordinance in the northern territories, and the guy created a revolution which started the abolition of slavery. And it was white countries mostly, but for Haiti, that started this history of the ending of human bondage. And Christians played a fundamental part in the abolition movement. So tell the whole story. Yes, Thomas Jefferson owned slaves. Yes, he was a flawed man, we all are flawed. But judge him in the context of his times. We do that every night, all week long."

And what's interesting about that is I am pretty good at recognizing Chinese students or anybody who has Chinese in them because 26 years ago I adopted a little baby that was one quarter Chinese. And so I know someone from China when I see them, and nobody in class is from China. But that didn't seem to matter. I was still in violation of some policy."
