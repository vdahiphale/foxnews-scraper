Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. What a show we have for you tonight from politics to prayer. And of course, just as Sean did, we are remembering Reverend Billy Graham after his passing today. Marveling at this unbelievable legacy with some of the nation's top religious leaders. Pastor Rick Warren, Dr. Pat Robertson and Graham's grandson will all be here.  Plus, we are going to tell you why a lesbian couple is blaming Donald Trump for preventing them from fostering a refugee child.  And speaking of the president, he's practically pleading with the attorney general to investigate the Obama administration. So, Jeff Sessions job on the line?  But first, guns, God and the grace to listen. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. High school students, parents, brothers, sisters, raw emotion, suffering, sacrifice, bravery, heartache, evil, sorrow, anger, 17 dead.",

      "sentences": "Many of you remember the last time we had an assault weapons ban it was from 1994 to 2004. The study of the ban that was done by the National Institute of Justice concluded that the ban produced no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.  It went on to note that assault weapons were rarely used in gun crimes, even before the ban. Look, there are close to 15 million AR-15 style rifles in the United States today. It's one of the top-selling style of weapons in the country. And it may be hard to believe, especially after last week, these guns are actually rarely used to commit violent crimes. According to the FBI, rifles of all kinds, not just the AR, semi auto types, accounted for just 3 percent of firearms homicides in 2016 while handguns accounted for 65 percent.  Contrary to what you hear in the media, handguns are also still by far the weapon of choice for mass shooters depending on the definition, it's when three or four or more a people are killed.   Even left-wing media outlets, you see the graphic there from things like Mother Jones -- from 1982 through 2,012 found that 66 percent of the weapons were handguns while just 14 percent would qualify as assault weapons according to the definition used by gun-control advocates. Now writing in 'Reason' magazine, Jacob Solomon affirms that banning assault weapons will simply not stop mass killings, writing, 'Politicians, activists and journalists who have decided to blame mass shootings on assault weapons either do not acknowledge these facts or wave them away. It is clearly possible to carry out attacks similar to last week's without using assault weapons. Nine of the mass shootings with the 20 highest death tolls in both handguns or long guns that are not covered by the Feinstein bill.  That includes the third deadliest mass shooting, which killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, as well as two other attacks that killed 17 or more people.'  GQ magazine, not exactly a conservative outlet addressed the same issue a few years ago and it agreed noting that 'Even the Democratic staffers who wrote the now-expired 1994 federal assault weapon ban knew it was a largely symbolic policy.' Perhaps the most poignant words today came from a father, Andrew Pollock, who buried his daughter, Meadow, just a few days ago. Flanked by his sons, his rage, and his frustration was evident.",

And social media, as I mentioned, creates not a community, but a forced distance, a sense of longing, even envy.  So, maybe it's time to listen to what Steve Scalise last week when I spoke to him just hours after the shooting in Parkland. Prayer works, he said. Getting back to the basics, common sense, family, friendships and belief that God loves us all no matter what we are going through.  Think about that student Peter Wang and what he showed us. What he sacrificed himself. He was only 15 years old, but he helped save numerous fellow students and teachers by first ushering them to safety. His training already kicked in. Amidst all the cries for change and legislation, his example is the one I hope more of us emulate. The president did a really good thing today. But as we seek to learn from these horrific tragedies and fix what we can, emotion cannot and should not ever override our Constitution.  We must respect the rights that our Creator gave us, yes, the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms, and also our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those 17 students and teachers who are no longer with us, they don't have either of those rights, not the Second Amendment and not life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction is a student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Brandon Minoff. Brandon, thank you for joining us. I know this has been just beyond horrific. A week for students to recover from what they endured. Bury their friends, try to emphasize and try to learn something.   How are you doing a week after this? You've seen a lot of your fellow students react, a lot of them are very angry, and rightly so. Your thoughts?",

He was the friend of presidents, one after the other. He led people by the hundreds of thousands. He was a claimed man of the year time and time again, always humility. Always I've got to seek the cross of Jesus. He always pointed people to Jesus and the way for himself. That's the thing that struck to me. I was with him at the fall of the Berlin wall. He came to dedicate this building I'm in right now. He's a dear, dear friend for many years, but always humble. Never, ever did he take any heirs to himself that he was some kind of a hot shot. He was. He was the preeminent evangelical in the world. Fifty million evangelicals in the world, he was number one.

I remember asking him one time, Daddy Bill, that's what we called him, I said Daddy Bill, how in the world have you remain so humble in light of all of your accomplishments and in light of all of the adulation and praise that you receive any looked at me kind of puzzled. He didn't like the fact that he even said he was humble, because he did not think he was humble at all. But he said it's hard to be proud when you begin each day with God. When you begin each day with God, you realized that God is big, and I am small. God is God and I am not. So, I think it was, even for us family members, it was really his humility that left the deepest impression on all of us, but it was also his message. I think one of the things that separates him from so many different religious leaders, even Christian leaders, is the idea that he preached so passionately the idea that the essence, the foundation of Christianity is not what we do for God, it's what God in Christ has done for us. And I think that is a huge, huge thing to say, but it was all about Christ finished work on our behalf that we don't have to add what God has already done for us, that God has already granted us His approval in His acceptance and His love because of what Jesus has done for us.

What would Reverend Graham say to that, because he stayed away from politics. He was friends with everybody. But what would he say about the tone and the rancor today especially? PASTOR RICK WARREN, AUTHOR, \"THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE\": One of the hallmarks of Billy was not just the humility that Tullian and Pat mentioned, it was his integrity also. It was spotless after 60 years. And third would be he was a uniter. He was a builder, a bridge builder. People forget that in the '50s and the '60s, Billy Graham insisted that all of his campaigns and crusades in the south be integrated. And for many of those southern cities, they were the first publicly integrated events in those cities when Billy Graham came to town, and he said I'm not coming unless they are integrated. Not only were they integrated ethnically and skin color, but there were also integrated with all of the different traditions of Christianity. He said everybody's got to be at the table, and he put Catholics and Calvinists on the stage, and he put Protestants and Pentecostals, and he put charismatics and evangelicals and fundamentals and they were all there. And some people got mad at that, but he said I'm not coming unless there is unity. And of course in politics one of the things he taught me was that you've got to shepherd everybody. You've got friends who are Republicans, friends who are Democrats, you pastor of them all. You don't get co-opted by any particular partisan group because he has to be above the fray.

Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. What a show we have for you tonight from politics to prayer. And of course, just as Sean did, we are remembering Reverend Billy Graham after his passing today. Marveling at this unbelievable legacy with some of the nation's top religious leaders. Pastor Rick Warren, Dr. Pat Robertson and Graham's grandson will all be here. Plus, we are going to tell you why a lesbian couple is blaming Donald Trump for preventing them from fostering a refugee child. And speaking of the president, he's practically pleading with the attorney general to investigate the Obama administration. So, Jeff Sessions job on the line? But first, guns, God and the grace to listen. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. High school students, parents, brothers, sisters, raw emotion, suffering, sacrifice, bravery, heartache, evil, sorrow, anger, 17 dead."

How did the FBI not follow up on obvious red flags? How the shooter had access to a weapon despite his obvious mental health issues? It's all infuriating and beyond upsetting. And at the White House today, the president brought parents and students and teachers together who were grieving from Parkland and from other terrible tragedies right here also in D.C.

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Many of you remember the last time we had an assault weapons ban it was from 1994 to 2004. The study of the ban that was done by the National Institute of Justice concluded that the ban produced no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence. It went on to note that assault weapons were rarely used in gun crimes, even before the ban. Look, there are close to 15 million AR-15 style rifles in the United States today. It's one of the top-selling style of weapons in the country. And it may be hard to believe, especially after last week, these guns are actually rarely used to commit violent crimes. According to the FBI, rifles of all kinds, not just the AR, semi auto types, accounted for just 3 percent of firearms homicides in 2016 while handguns accounted for 65 percent. Contrary to what you hear in the media, handguns are also still by far the weapon of choice for mass shooters depending on the definition, it's when three or four or more a people are killed. Even left-wing media outlets, you see the graphic there from things like Mother Jones -- from 1982 through 2,012 found that 66 percent of the weapons were handguns while just 14 percent would qualify as assault weapons according to the definition used by gun-control advocates. Now writing in 'Reason' magazine, Jacob Solomon affirms that banning assault weapons will simply not stop mass killings, writing, 'Politicians, activists and journalists who have decided to blame mass shootings on assault weapons either do not acknowledge these facts or wave them away. It is clearly possible to carry out attacks similar to last week's without using assault weapons. Nine of the mass shootings with the 20 highest death tolls in both handguns or long guns that are not covered by the Feinstein bill. That includes the third deadliest mass shooting, which killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, as well as two other attacks that killed 17 or more people.' GQ magazine, not exactly a conservative outlet addressed the same issue a few years ago and it agreed noting that 'Even the Democratic staffers who wrote the now-expired 1994 federal assault weapon ban knew it was a largely symbolic policy.' Perhaps the most poignant words today came from a father, Andrew Pollock, who buried his daughter, Meadow, just a few days ago. Flanked by his sons, his rage, and his frustration was evident."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The focus should be on school security. The soft targets that are so vulnerable today. Arming staff who are well-trained, getting authorities on the state, local and federal level to see the obvious warning signs and act on them. And this obvious fact that America has become a society of strangers, distant through social media. All those anonymous insults and condemnations are often unduly harsh and disconnected."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Let's not discount this fact, that while schools obsess about diversity, sometimes that only breeds tribalism. And social media, as I mentioned, creates not a community, but a forced distance, a sense of longing, even envy. So, maybe it's time to listen to what Steve Scalise last week when I spoke to him just hours after the shooting in Parkland. Prayer works, he said. Getting back to the basics, common sense, family, friendships and belief that God loves us all no matter what we are going through. Think about that student Peter Wang and what he showed us. What he sacrificed himself. He was only 15 years old, but he helped save numerous fellow students and teachers by first ushering them to safety. His training already kicked in. Amidst all the cries for change and legislation, his example is the one I hope more of us emulate. The president did a really good thing today. But as we seek to learn from these horrific tragedies and fix what we can, emotion cannot and should not ever override our Constitution. We must respect the rights that our Creator gave us, yes, the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms, and also our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those 17 students and teachers who are no longer with us, they don't have either of those rights, not the Second Amendment and not life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining us now for reaction is a student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Brandon Minoff. Brandon, thank you for joining us. I know this has been just beyond horrific. A week for students to recover from what they endured. Bury their friends, try to emphasize and try to learn something. How are you doing a week after this? You've seen a lot of your fellow students react, a lot of them are very angry, and rightly so. Your thoughts?"

You could tell he was really annoyed, it seemed, with what he was hearing about let's go after the guns, whatever they say the gun of choice is. He found not to be an unhelpful part of the conversation and all day my producers and I were wondering, are there any students out there who maybe think focusing on that issue almost exclusively is the wrong approach and your answer to that would be?"

The AR-15 is not an automatic weapon, but if you are not familiar with guns or you don't know -- that's what kind of people think and believed, and I feel bad for a lot of these kids because -- I didn't know anything about this when I was 15 and 16-years-old.

Growing up in a Baptist home, Billy Graham was our pope and I read my first Billy Graham book, 'Peace with God, ' I think when I was in the sixth grade. At 17, I heard him for the first time and was thrilled at the Oakland crusade. And at 20, I met him person-to-person at the L.A. crusade and began a 20 year -- excuse me, a 40-year relationship where he mentored me over the last 40 years."

A lot of stuff that he taught me I've done with the next generation myself and one of them was he provided platforms for younger people. I remember when I was in high school -- nope, college, I wrote my first book on how to study the Bible methods. I wasn't a very confident writer at all, but Billy Graham believed in me and somehow, he got a copy of a book that I had self-published. He called me in the mid-'80s and said I'm bringing 13,000 evangelists to Amsterdam for ten days of training and I want you to come and train them and teach them how to study the bible.

He is a man who is so humble. That statement was so humble. I need God's forgiveness. He always talked about the cross. He never took it for himself. He was the friend of presidents, one after the other. He led people by the hundreds of thousands. He was a claimed man of the year time and time again, always humility. Always I've got to seek the cross of Jesus. He always pointed people to Jesus and the way for himself. That's the thing that struck to me. I was with him at the fall of the Berlin wall. He came to dedicate this building I'm in right now. He's a dear, dear friend for many years, but always humble. Never, ever did he take any heirs to himself that he was some kind of a hot shot. He was. He was the preeminent evangelical in the world. Fifty million evangelicals in the world, he was number one.

And I can tell you that the humility that the public saw we saw in private. He is genuinely the most humble person I have ever met in my life. I remember asking him one time, Daddy Bill, that's what we called him, I said Daddy Bill, how in the world have you remain so humble in light of all of your accomplishments and in light of all of the adulation and praise that you receive any looked at me kind of puzzled. He didn't like the fact that he even said he was humble, because he did not think he was humble at all. But he said it's hard to be proud when you begin each day with God. When you begin each day with God, you realized that God is big, and I am small. God is God and I am not. So, I think it was, even for us family members, it was really his humility that left the deepest impression on all of us, but it was also his message. I think one of the things that separates him from so many different religious leaders, even Christian leaders, is the idea that he preached so passionately the idea that the essence, the foundation of Christianity is not what we do for God, it's what God in Christ has done for us. And I think that is a huge, huge thing to say, but it was all about Christ finished work on our behalf that we don't have to add what God has already done for us, that God has already granted us His approval in His acceptance and His love because of what Jesus has done for us. The man of course speaks volumes, his humility, his faithfulness, his devotion. He was a family man. He was keenly devoted to his family, but then his message really, his message --"

It's hard to have civil conversations of people about politics. People take things out of context. People who are friends are not talking because of politics. What would Reverend Graham say to that, because he stayed away from politics. He was friends with everybody. But what would he say about the tone and the rancor today especially? PASTOR RICK WARREN, AUTHOR, \"THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE\": One of the hallmarks of Billy was not just the humility that Tullian and Pat mentioned, it was his integrity also. It was spotless after 60 years. And third would be he was a uniter. He was a builder, a bridge builder. People forget that in the '50s and the '60s, Billy Graham insisted that all of his campaigns and crusades in the south be integrated. And for many of those southern cities, they were the first publicly integrated events in those cities when Billy Graham came to town, and he said I'm not coming unless they are integrated. Not only were they integrated ethnically and skin color, but there were also integrated with all of the different traditions of Christianity. He said everybody's got to be at the table, and he put Catholics and Calvinists on the stage, and he put Protestants and Pentecostals, and he put charismatics and evangelicals and fundamentals and they were all there. And some people got mad at that, but he said I'm not coming unless there is unity. And of course in politics one of the things he taught me was that you've got to shepherd everybody. You've got friends who are Republicans, friends who are Democrats, you pastor of them all. You don't get co-opted by any particular partisan group because he has to be above the fray.

When the heat got turned on, Rod, he said we have to point a special counsel, running with his hair on fire. That's not the man you want in the job. You want a man who is tough, who is fair but tough, and also has the administration's back. You don't have to be a partisan, but you do have to be tough. Rosenstein was a mistake, that's my personal opinion. John, I want to hear from you. I love Jeff Sessions, he's been my friend for many years. I could've put them in a bunch of different positions but attorney general seemed like a really good choice for him. He's been fabulous on immigration, MS-13, a host of issues. He's been fantastic, but the president is just annoyed. And what about that point Cameron made? Do we need the confidence in the Justice Department undermined in the midst of this investigation?"

But history may well prove that in this moment where the rule of law is at stake and the Justice Department's ability to apply it evenhandedly is in question that he may in fact be a small man in a big moment of history, however good a man he may be. If ever there was a time given all of the Steele dossier facts that are coming out, at least at a minimum the appearance of wrongdoing in the DOJ, this is a situation which cries out for which the special counsel statute was designed for. It requires this. The OIG of the Justice Department, that's the swamp thing guarding the swamp things. That's too weak a broth for what's really --"

The problem with that, and both of you can speak to this, is that the inspector general, he doesn't have any authority beyond issuing a report, correct?

The women claimed they were unlawfully turned down for religious reasons because the Texas program takes federal money. Joining us now from New York to discuss the situation is from the Catholic League, of course, President Bill Donohue from the Catholic League. Bill, what's going on in this case because this couple says they were told basically they are not -- there coupledom is not mirroring that of the holy family, which is what the Catholic organization told them."

ACLU suing Catholic hospitals to make them perform abortions. You have gay couples trying to crash Catholic institutions, foster care, or whatever it is. They've lost every single time. In the case of this case in Texas, a law was passed last year protecting the right of faith-based initiatives to exercise their doctrinal prerogatives. And that would mean the Catholic agencies which do not believe in same-sex marriages do not have to allow a lesbian couple to have their care. And at the federal level we have faith-based institutions for decades. It's just as long as you don't involve yourself in inherently religious activities, such as forcing the kids to go to mass and prayer services, things that would make some people nervous, people have a phobia about religion, then you are OK. So they know they are going to lose. It's a matter of bullying and harassment if you want to know the truth."

      "utterance": "They are shopping them. The ACLU in particular is doing this. These are gay activists. They try to act as if they are not. They are gay activists. They are trying to shove their secular values down our throat. It's when the church gets too aggressive, we say what about church and state? It works the other way more often than not. When the state is encroaching on a religious institution, which is why we have these religious liberty protection laws all over the states. It's precisely because of secular militants trying to shove their way in and to basically neuter Catholic institutions. Once you take out the Catholicity of a Catholic institution, it's now secular. They can go to other religions which are OK with this, they can go to secular and public institutions."

This is not a settled issue, but if anything the law is on our side, particularly with the states that they have those protections there. But we've known about this for a long time. Why is it that Catholic hostile continue not to perform abortions? Why is it that adoption agencies continue to insist on Catholic doctrines without a problem? It's because there's no violation of federal or state law. What you have here is the intent is to intimidate, to bully, to get them to capitulate, and so if you get some weak-kneed Catholics like you do in Massachusetts, which is not exactly known for their strong Catholic opinions."

That's just not the way it looks. Oh, my goodness. I wish cutting the grass would reduce illegal immigration because I'm telling you this, I would even buy border enforcement some weed whackers myself, maybe a push mower or two, the old-fashioned types.

I don't know if Mexico is going to pay for it. But as is her custom, she misreads the will of the people. They want it done. So if you think a wall that is not necessary -- a well-clipped lawn will do the job, I have an idea. Replace your security, Nancy, with a lawn service, because what's good for the people should be good for their representatives. How's that? We'll be right back."
