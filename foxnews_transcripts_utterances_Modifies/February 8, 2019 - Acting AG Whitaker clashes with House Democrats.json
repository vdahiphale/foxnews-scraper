Brand new calls brand new information just coming in moments ago with regard to lieutenant governor of Virginia Justin Fairfax and calls from within his party to ask him to resign.  Fairfax is now accused by a second woman, a classmate at Duke University who says that she told friends back in 2000 that he raped her. Fairfax, essentially says she's lying. He has called that charge, \"demonstrably false.\"  This providing an ugly, but no doubt welcome distraction for Governor Northam who now seems to be riding out the storm over the yearbook photo as his succession plan looks a bit unviable at the moment. Here's Fairfax earlier today.",

Watson, says the two were friends but never dated or had any romantic relationship. So far, Watson has not detailed what her lawyer calls an aggressive and premeditated attack, but she claims her attack was similar to the first accuser, Vanessa Tyson, who says that she and Fairfax were at the DNC convention in Boston in 2004 when he asked her to go to his hotel room to get documents and they began kissing consensually. But then, she claims Fairfax put his hand behind her head and forced her to perform oral sex. Watson has called that encounter consensual.   And concerning the allegations by Meredith Watson, Fairfax, says, \"I demand a full investigation into this unsubstantiated and false allegation.\" He goes on to say he is telling the truth. Meredith Watson's attorney says she shared the details of her rape with a number of people who have now issued statements to corroborate her story. The attorney also said, \"Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages.\" Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, tweeted, \"The allegations against Justin Fairfax are serious and credible. It is clear to me that he can no longer effectively serve the people of Virginia as lieutenant governor, I call for his immediate resignation.\"  Virginia's five Democratic members of Congress have also called for Fairfax to step down as has New Jersey Democratic Senator and twenty 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker.   And now, Democratic Virginia state lawmaker, says on Monday, he will begin the process of impeaching Justin Fairfax if he doesn't step down. And we should note, Governor Ralph Northam is again reiterating as he did today that he will not step down. Martha.",

And when you look at that, you know, you think back to Christine Blasey Ford, saying that she had shared the story with friends much later on.   You know, and I know Ellison Barber reported earlier that they've asked the lawyer to turn over these documents that substantiate the fact that she did share this story with people. And you know, I guess one of the questions is when?

So, that's one person on the record offering that kind of corroboration. And at the same time, the contrast between the way the much less substantiated allegations were treated against Brett Kavanaugh. Where you didn't have any corroborating witnesses is really striking, because at that time you had all these liberal commentators, not to mention a lots of Democrats saying Kavanaugh cannot possibly be confirmed, and all women must be believed.  But, until now, we just hear about a rush of Democrats including former Governor Terry McAuliffe, saying Fairfax should step down. Many Democrats have been very cautious, liberal commentators are being the tepid or silent, not applying the same standard that they themselves brought to the Kavanaugh hearings.",

He has called that charge, \"demonstrably false.\" This providing an ugly, but no doubt welcome distraction for Governor Northam who now seems to be riding out the storm over the yearbook photo as his succession plan looks a bit unviable at the moment.

Watson, says the two were friends but never dated or had any romantic relationship. So far, Watson has not detailed what her lawyer calls an aggressive and premeditated attack, but she claims her attack was similar to the first accuser, Vanessa Tyson, who says that she and Fairfax were at the DNC convention in Boston in 2004 when he asked her to go to his hotel room to get documents and they began kissing consensually. But then, she claims Fairfax put his hand behind her head and forced her to perform oral sex. Watson has called that encounter consensual. And concerning the allegations by Meredith Watson, Fairfax, says, \"I demand a full investigation into this unsubstantiated and false allegation.\" He goes on to say he is telling the truth. Meredith Watson's attorney says she shared the details of her rape with a number of people who have now issued statements to corroborate her story. The attorney also said, \"Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages.\" Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, tweeted, \"The allegations against Justin Fairfax are serious and credible. It is clear to me that he can no longer effectively serve the people of Virginia as lieutenant governor, I call for his immediate resignation.\" Virginia's five Democratic members of Congress have also called for Fairfax to step down as has New Jersey Democratic Senator and twenty 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker. And now, Democratic Virginia state lawmaker, says on Monday, he will begin the process of impeaching Justin Fairfax if he doesn't step down. And we should note, Governor Ralph Northam is again reiterating as he did today that he will not step down. Martha."

Why would either of these women -- well, what do they have to gain by coming forward as Trace noted? They're not asking for money, they're not going on T.V. they're not seeking publicity.

You know, and I know Ellison Barber reported earlier that they've asked the lawyer to turn over these documents that substantiate the fact that she did share this story with people. And you know, I guess one of the questions is when? You know, what -- is it -- is it clearly documented at the time that she says this happened and if that's the case, and that's very significant, very credible, or was it later? So, it's a valid question."

So, that's one person on the record offering that kind of corroboration. And at the same time, the contrast between the way the much less substantiated allegations were treated against Brett Kavanaugh. Where you didn't have any corroborating witnesses is really striking, because at that time you had all these liberal commentators, not to mention a lots of Democrats saying Kavanaugh cannot possibly be confirmed, and all women must be believed. But, until now, we just hear about a rush of Democrats including former Governor Terry McAuliffe, saying Fairfax should step down. Many Democrats have been very cautious, liberal commentators are being the tepid or silent, not applying the same standard that they themselves brought to the Kavanaugh hearings."

When you point all that out to them, they just say, well, you don't care about the environment. Yes, we do care about the environment but we always care about jobs and living standards and our economy. And this proposal is just a complete joke when it comes to those things."

      "utterance": "Well, the premise is that greenhouse gas emissions that cause the globe to warm anything north of 1.5 degrees Celsius is about to plunge the country into a massive human and economic chaos that's in the coming years. So, that's what they are saying. So, they are saying we have to do all of these things because it's going to cost an enormous amount of money if the globe warms to this level that will cause all of this economic chaos. You don't agree with that?"

    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "No. None of that is true. There are studies that have shown that actually it's far cheaper to deal with the short-term consequences of climate change in terms of protecting against flooding and so on than it is to invest in these technologies which is so early. They are not ready yet. You know, one day it may be the case with innovation and scientific advance that solar power, for example, is much more viable than it is today. But we are a long away from that today. And we are nowhere near that, for example, when it comes to air travel which is one of the things that they want to see ended within the 10-year period of this proposal. So, it's just not realistic. It's not serious. But they don't care. Because they just want to send a message that, as you said, they are on the right side of this argument on the green agenda."

We never would have gotten to the moon, for example, if we hadn't sort of laid out this very sort of hopeful marker and then you have to make adjustments along the way to figure out the practicalities that this is sort of a big dream. It's a big goal and that is what they are getting behind. They would say that you, you know, are going to look back on this moment and say that you were wrong."

And in the end, the bottom line is, that you have to have a strong growing economy to create the wealth to invest in these technologies of the future. And if you are just handing out money and creating jobs from the government that won't happen. And so, it's counterproductive.

I mean, but the idea that, you know, that they're just -- it's like on the old match book. right? Dana Perino and her husband also met on a plane."
