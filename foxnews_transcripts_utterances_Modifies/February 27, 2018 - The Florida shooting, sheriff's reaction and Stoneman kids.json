      "sentences": "All right. Sean, Great show. Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. A major win in federal court today for President Trump and a big boost for his push to build the border wall. Univision anchor, Jorge Ramos, is here, that's going to be fun and to debate me on the wall and a new Supreme Court ruling that could completely altered the immigration issue.  I'll discuss the president's strategy as well for Mexico and China, huge news on that with the administration's point man on trade.  A huge number of teens -- maybe yours? Are now sending out sexually explicit of themselves and of others. Some experts are saying it's a positive development a debate not to be missed ahead.  But first, the Florida school shooting, this sheriff's reaction, and the Stoneman Douglas High School kids, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. We brought to you last night exclusive news about what was happening behind the scenes, new and shocking details about the activity of the Broward County Police under the leadership of Sheriff Scott Israel.  We shared with you a department email asking officers to defend the sheriff. It read, quote, 'At the moment we find our agency up against a flurry of media allegations and a personal attack against our sheriff, sheriff Israel stood with us. Now we must stand with him. It's important that they know we stand as one.' This should be not about saving anyone's backside but about transparency. Not protecting the sheriff or anyone else. Remember, Sheriff Israel has endorsed gun control and for that he won praise from student activists.  And this is happening as his department's actions before, during, and after the horrific school shooting are now being investigated by a separate state commission. When challenged, Israel -- don't forget, unelected Democratic sheriff -- brags about his amazing leadership.   But it may not have been so amazing. Last night, we reported exclusively that sources close to the Broward Sheriff's Office are telling us that deputies on the scene of the shooting were told not to enter the school unless their body cameras were turned on. Well, since they did not have body cameras, they didn't engage the shooter or enter the school. The Sheriff's Office by the way has not disputed our report. When asked about the deputies who failed to enter the school building, Broward Superintendent Robert Runcie, said, quote, 'There potentially could have been law enforcement that were sitting on the sidelines. Again, we'll see what comes out of the investigation. The Broward County Sheriff's Office and the FBI has all the video related to this. We have none of it in our possession. They made that clear. They came, they gave us a warrant and a subpoena, and they took it all.'   But remember, Sheriff Israel said that the videos may never be released, another bizarre comment. How do you say that? It's not clear if the feds have the video as well, it would even be his full decision at this point. Then there are the Parkland Florida school students, they've been through a lot. For anyone who has been conscious since Valentines Day, the media has featured these kids wall to wall, their passion, their words. I would argue their pain and loss is at times of being exploited by anti- gun activists, sometimes using them as proxies even. Remember this from the CNN town hall.",

      "utterance": "All right. Sean, Great show. Good evening from Washington. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. A major win in federal court today for President Trump and a big boost for his push to build the border wall. Univision anchor, Jorge Ramos, is here, that's going to be fun and to debate me on the wall and a new Supreme Court ruling that could completely altered the immigration issue. I'll discuss the president's strategy as well for Mexico and China, huge news on that with the administration's point man on trade. A huge number of teens -- maybe yours? Are now sending out sexually explicit of themselves and of others. Some experts are saying it's a positive development a debate not to be missed ahead. But first, the Florida school shooting, this sheriff's reaction, and the Stoneman Douglas High School kids, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. We brought to you last night exclusive news about what was happening behind the scenes, new and shocking details about the activity of the Broward County Police under the leadership of Sheriff Scott Israel. We shared with you a department email asking officers to defend the sheriff. It read, quote, 'At the moment we find our agency up against a flurry of media allegations and a personal attack against our sheriff, sheriff Israel stood with us. Now we must stand with him. It's important that they know we stand as one.' This should be not about saving anyone's backside but about transparency. Not protecting the sheriff or anyone else. Remember, Sheriff Israel has endorsed gun control and for that he won praise from student activists. And this is happening as his department's actions before, during, and after the horrific school shooting are now being investigated by a separate state commission. When challenged, Israel -- don't forget, unelected Democratic sheriff -- brags about his amazing leadership. But it may not have been so amazing. Last night, we reported exclusively that sources close to the Broward Sheriff's Office are telling us that deputies on the scene of the shooting were told not to enter the school unless their body cameras were turned on. Well, since they did not have body cameras, they didn't engage the shooter or enter the school. The Sheriff's Office by the way has not disputed our report. When asked about the deputies who failed to enter the school building, Broward Superintendent Robert Runcie, said, quote, 'There potentially could have been law enforcement that were sitting on the sidelines. Again, we'll see what comes out of the investigation. The Broward County Sheriff's Office and the FBI has all the video related to this. We have none of it in our possession. They made that clear. They came, they gave us a warrant and a subpoena, and they took it all.' But remember, Sheriff Israel said that the videos may never be released, another bizarre comment. How do you say that? It's not clear if the feds have the video as well, it would even be his full decision at this point. Then there are the Parkland Florida school students, they've been through a lot. For anyone who has been conscious since Valentines Day, the media has featured these kids wall to wall, their passion, their words. I would argue their pain and loss is at times of being exploited by anti- gun activists, sometimes using them as proxies even. Remember this from the CNN town hall."

And now there may be a major fight brewing with Mexico over trade, NAFTA, and the wall, who's going to pay for it? My next guest is at the center of it all. And the U.S. trade representative Bob Lighthizer might not be a household name, but you're not going to want to miss any of this. He joins us exclusively. Ambassador Lighthizer, great seeing you. Thanks for being back with us. So we read that now on this issue of NAFTA renegotiation, all these great new deals I keep hearing, all these great new deals are going to start, that there has been a snag in the negotiations, and it was reported in Reuters and Washington Post that there was a call between the president and the Mexican president Pena Nieto and it ended in some kind of testy manner. I guess the snag or the holdup was about over who is going to fund the wall. I just want to play something for you. My radio listeners today chimed in on this topic of whether it matters if Mexico pays or if it's an indirect payment. Let's listen."

It's trying to reverse a very bad trend that we have had for a long, long time in the trade area. The president ran on this, he feels strongly about it. When I talk to him, its workers, ranchers, farmers, that's it. It's wages and its jobs.

It's designed to get auto companies to move to Mexico and then shipped to the U.S. You say 77 percent, for some companies it's even higher. And a lot of these are companies with very little products that are made in America. So they're low U.S. content. And the kind of thing we are looking at is to have a better balance, have a higher regional content but also a U.S. content, and to reorganize the way we keep track of which is which. The president's objective is we have to get more jobs back to America, we have to reduce the deficit. And that will ultimately put pressure on wages and raise wages."

You can nail some of them to NAFTA, but most of it is because improving and productivity, technology changing, so we are steadily moving away from those types of manufacturing jobs.

And they spin off wealth to thousands, millions and millions of other people who serve the people who do the manufacturing. So to me it's complete nonsense to say that we don't need manufacturing."

Now you have to decide, the administration, by April about what you're going to do with Chinese aluminum imports. The concern of dumping under market priced goods, and they are now saying we could retaliate on your agriculture, the sour gum coming into the United States feeds livestock, so there's a trade war, Lighthizer and Trump are going to start a trade war, it's going to be a nightmare.

      "utterance": "I'll take Bibi's word for it. On the other hand, how exactly was the previous administration a friend to the Jewish people or the State of Israel? Obama disrespected the Israeli prime minister. He entered a ruinous nuclear deal with Iran. And then there were Obama's personal associations. This is an Illinois state senator Obama with the raging anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan and it was taken in 2005 but it was kept under wraps by the Congressional Black Caucus until just a month ago according to the photographer. And don't forget the LA Times has been sitting on a 2003 videotape of an event attended by what National Review's Andy McCarthy called a racist terror mongers. At that even Obama himself reportedly sang the praises of Rashid Khalidi. He's a supporter of Palestinian terrorist Yasser Arafat. But now the LA Times which admits it has the video of Obama rubbing elbows with an apologist for Palestinian terrorist is helping imply that Trump is enabling a wave of anti-Semitism? There is one word for that. Chutzpah. We'll be right back."

      "utterance": "Before we go, an update to a story we covered last night. Ice has arrested more 150 individuals in violation of federal U.S. immigration in northern California this week. That comes despite that warnings from the Oakland mayor of an impending raid. So well done, Mayor Schaaf. You did a good job. Didn't quite work, though, 150, and a lot of these people are criminals wreaking havoc on society in Northern California, so the people should be cheering this mess. Get them off the streets and out of the country. Shannon Bream and the Fox News @ Night team, it's not dancing yet because it's not Friday. We've got to have some activity like you have, Shannon. You have the dancing on Friday. You know what we do? We just go home. It's so boring."
