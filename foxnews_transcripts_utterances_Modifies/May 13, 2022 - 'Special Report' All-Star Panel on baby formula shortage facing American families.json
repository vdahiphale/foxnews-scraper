At least seven states have out-of-stock rates of about 40 percent or so, there on your screen, Texas, Connecticut, New Jersey, and more, 20 other states have out-of-stock between 30 percent and 40 percent. A huge issue for young families across this country. With that, let's bring in our panel, Juan Williams is a FOX News analyst, Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson, and Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner.\" Morgan, since you are a mom, let's start off with you. Obviously, a huge concern for young families. What does the government do in response?",

Abbott lab, the main manufacturer, shut down their main facility a few months ago, and it was over 40 percent of production of infant formula in this country. So you are seeing, I think, a double whammy when it comes to moms in this country from the Biden administration. They are already upset about schools being closed and radical education in our schools. Now you have moms angry because they can't feed their children in the way that they need to. The FDA should also open up and allow European baby formula to be sold in the United States. There is absolutely no reason why we have the red tape.

And why was the private sector so slow to respond? You can ask the government, you can ask our political leadership to get involved, but, ultimately, this is a failure of the private sector. In terms of government, under the new U.S. Mexico-Canadian trade pact, the Canadians cannot sell baby formula in the United States. And, again, that is something that we need to reverse.
