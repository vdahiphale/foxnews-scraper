Vladimir Putin fueling fears of invasion as the standoff between Russia and Ukraine gets even more tense. Things changing rapidly sometimes by the minute. And here's where we stand. Russian troops are within three miles of the border and are in reportedly in attack position. There was hope earlier today for a Biden/Putin summit to calm everything down but just hours ago Putin declaring two break away regions of eastern Ukraine to be independent and saying that the country should have never been separated from Russia during the Soviet Union. President Biden responding and is set to slap sanctions on those regions and the Kremlin just announcing Putin has ordered Russian forces to, quote, \"maintain peace\" in eastern Ukraine but it is unclear if troops will enter. All that while the Biden administration continuing to warn that Russian troops could cross into Ukraine at any moment.",

By his assaultive language, by his moving his troops now within three miles of the frontier. And they are mass armor. We have to understand this is not like anything we have seen since World War II. He must have 500 of those heavy tanks, aside from the aircraft and the missiles and everything else. He is prepared for invasion that won't stop until he gets to the Dnieper River which divides Ukraine east to west. That's where they kept Lviv, it sits on one bank of the river. I think that that's he wants. He wants half that country right now. And no telling. He could -- he could tell them to turn right and take those Baltic states, or at least threaten the NATO countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. I think that this is -- this is a crisis. Joe Biden has to stand up and speak without a damn N95 mask on that the vice president had. You couldn't hear her. You need like, you know, captions to hear what the vice president is saying. At this pivotal moment, I think it's politically correct at a worst possible time. But I think that the -- this is now war. It is, maybe it's not war that involves NATO yet, but, for example, our paratroopers cannot stand up against that armor, even the blessed 82nd -- and we got Joey here, God knows he knows better than I. And the 101st A. This is a -- this is a mechanized major army, 190,000 strong. And now they are given the green light to cross over. It is like Sudetenland in 1938. I hate comparisons to Hitler and the Nazis. But this is when Hitler insisted on the German speaking regions of Czechoslovakia. He got the German speaking regions then he moved his army and took the rest of Czechoslovakia. This is history repeating itself. Biden is called upon now to be strong, stronger than he is ever been and more clear than he is ever been and work in concert with our NATO allies who, thank God, have recognized the tiger is loose in the building.",

And she reported the fact that in July, when Putin had 21-page treaties essentially, he was reading his play book, he was talking about that in the past, going back to Russian leaders to Stalin. He said, why did they give up so much? He called it madness to give those republics their land and the rights that they gave up.

Vladimir Putin fueling fears of invasion as the standoff between Russia and Ukraine gets even more tense. Things changing rapidly sometimes by the minute. And here's where we stand. Russian troops are within three miles of the border and are in reportedly in attack position. There was hope earlier today for a Biden/Putin summit to calm everything down but just hours ago Putin declaring two break away regions of eastern Ukraine to be independent and saying that the country should have never been separated from Russia during the Soviet Union. President Biden responding and is set to slap sanctions on those regions and the Kremlin just announcing Putin has ordered Russian forces to, quote, \"maintain peace\" in eastern Ukraine but it is unclear if troops will enter. All that while the Biden administration continuing to warn that Russian troops could cross into Ukraine at any moment."

By his assaultive language, by his moving his troops now within three miles of the frontier. And they are mass armor. We have to understand this is not like anything we have seen since World War II. He must have 500 of those heavy tanks, aside from the aircraft and the missiles and everything else. He is prepared for invasion that won't stop until he gets to the Dnieper River which divides Ukraine east to west. That's where they kept Lviv, it sits on one bank of the river. I think that that's he wants. He wants half that country right now. And no telling. He could -- he could tell them to turn right and take those Baltic states, or at least threaten the NATO countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. I think that this is -- this is a crisis. Joe Biden has to stand up and speak without a damn N95 mask on that the vice president had. You couldn't hear her. You need like, you know, captions to hear what the vice president is saying. At this pivotal moment, I think it's politically correct at a worst possible time. But I think that the -- this is now war. It is, maybe it's not war that involves NATO yet, but, for example, our paratroopers cannot stand up against that armor, even the blessed 82nd -- and we got Joey here, God knows he knows better than I. And the 101st A. This is a -- this is a mechanized major army, 190,000 strong. And now they are given the green light to cross over. It is like Sudetenland in 1938. I hate comparisons to Hitler and the Nazis. But this is when Hitler insisted on the German speaking regions of Czechoslovakia. He got the German speaking regions then he moved his army and took the rest of Czechoslovakia. This is history repeating itself. Biden is called upon now to be strong, stronger than he is ever been and more clear than he is ever been and work in concert with our NATO allies who, thank God, have recognized the tiger is loose in the building."

Where did we get here? All right. Bill Clinton forced the Ukrainians in the early '90s to give their nukes back to Russia. If he had just let the Ukrainians keep the nukes, Russia wouldn't have gone in. You don't invade a nuclear power. He forced the nukes out there back to Russia and now they're sitting ducks for Putin.

And she reported the fact that in July, when Putin had 21-page treaties essentially, he was reading his play book, he was talking about that in the past, going back to Russian leaders to Stalin. He said, why did they give up so much? He called it madness to give those republics their land and the rights that they gave up. And he equated anti-Russian sentiment verbally withholding weapons of mass destruction against Russia. So, I think to your point, that this is absolutely predictable.
