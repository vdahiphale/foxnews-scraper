Plus, big news from Congress' investigation into the supposed Russian collusion with the Trump campaign. We will share our findings.  Also, the House chaplain has been dismissed. This is a huge controversy. A political firestorm on Capitol Hill. Raymond Arroyo has exclusive reporting about the chaplain's firing.  And what do Democratic candidates want from President Trump? Impeachment. How they might turn their blue wave into a blue ripple. I will explain.  Plus, we begin with President Trump on the verge of a truly historic diplomatic triumph is his tough talk appears to be paying off. The leaders of North and South Korea, this was wild, agreed in principle today to remove all nuclear weapons from their country. And to work toward formally ending the state of war that has existed since the 1953 truce. Trump was ecstatic over the news tweeting early in the day Korean War to end. They the president later acknowledged there was much work to be done, but he sure sounded optimistic.",

The idea of the North Korean dictator crossing the DMZ to meet the South Korean leader, obviously speaking the same language. Meeting together, embracing at one point after the handshake, after they had their meeting. Again, this is initial still in its initial phases, but Congressman, I have to say I think the only person who could have gotten as to this place, again, we will see where it goes, but Donald Trump because of his unconventional approach to negotiations and frankly his tough talk.

It's a committee of five who are chosen by the Norwegian parliament and they tend to be retired members of the Norwegian parliament, so they made some real mistakes over the years.   People whose Nobel Peace Prize was not earned. In the case of President Trump, this is a tremendous success. The only problem is the degree of pressure used he used to get it made turned the stomachs of some of the Norwegian members of parliament. Don't forget, he had nuclear aircraft flying toward North Korea. He had discussion with the South Korean defense minister that we might return our nuclear weapons to be deployed again in South Korea as many as 800 or more. Other kind of pressures obviously was massive in very focused sanctions even on the royal family in the North. This is not your ordinary idealistic make a speech kind of Nobel Peace Prize candidacy. This is someone who really got results.  The result came only through pressure. I think the Chinese also helped. Frankly, President Trump linking trade and the delegation going next week to helping with North Korea was a very bold gesture heavily criticized by the left-wing media.

We can't allow China to dominate high-tech. We can't allow China to dominate 3d printing, space weaponry, commercial aviation, but that is their subsidizing goal.

The president of China, Xi Jinping, has the North Korean leader come visit him almost out of the blue in the middle of the night a couple of months ago to preempt his visit or the North Korea's leaders visit with South Korea and the United States.

As \"the Angle\" reported this week, a recent poll conducted by the Jesuit Research Group found that only 11 percent of Hondurans emigrate to escape violence while 83 percent are looking for better economic opportunities. The U.S. based group, Human Rights First, announced yesterday that it will partner with law firms providing guidance to asylum seekers, but where is the line between providing guidance and helping people gain the system?

It's a committee of five who are chosen by the Norwegian parliament and they tend to be retired members of the Norwegian parliament, so they made some real mistakes over the years. People whose Nobel Peace Prize was not earned. In the case of President Trump, this is a tremendous success. The only problem is the degree of pressure used he used to get it made turned the stomachs of some of the Norwegian members of parliament. Don't forget, he had nuclear aircraft flying toward North Korea. He had discussion with the South Korean defense minister that we might return our nuclear weapons to be deployed again in South Korea as many as 800 or more. Other kind of pressures obviously was massive in very focused sanctions even on the royal family in the North. This is not your ordinary idealistic make a speech kind of Nobel Peace Prize candidacy. This is someone who really got results. The result came only through pressure. I think the Chinese also helped. Frankly, President Trump linking trade and the delegation going next week to helping with North Korea was a very bold gesture heavily criticized by the left-wing media.

We can't allow China to dominate high-tech. We can't allow China to dominate 3d printing, space weaponry, commercial aviation, but that is their subsidizing goal. They are doing that across every industry. And I'm worried that Donald Trump is so focused on the North Korea deal, that will let up the pressure on China that also is necessary.

The president of China, Xi Jinping, has the North Korean leader come visit him almost out of the blue in the middle of the night a couple of months ago to preempt his visit or the North Korea's leaders visit with South Korea and the United States.

You see the German leader, the Japanese leader, the French leader, what's happening now in North Korea. Listen, this president is showing that strength, when America is strong, America is way better off. I can tell you out here in Fort Wayne, Indiana, people get it.

First, they are getting some free legal advice from a number of American attorneys who are advising them holding some workshops on U.S. immigration law particularly on how to seek asylum if they have a credible claim. As \"the Angle\" reported this week, a recent poll conducted by the Jesuit Research Group found that only 11 percent of Hondurans emigrate to escape violence while 83 percent are looking for better economic opportunities. The U.S. based group, Human Rights First, announced yesterday that it will partner with law firms providing guidance to asylum seekers, but where is the line between providing guidance and helping people gain the system? Is there a line? Joining me to discuss that is the president and CEO of Human Rights First, Elisa Masimino. Elisa, it's great to have you on. This is a tough situation in Tijuana. We have at least 300 people, women and children included many of whom made a trek starting in March around Easter all the way up through Mexico ultimately getting here close to the United States. There are a lot of people who watched our show over the last few days and wonder, how is it that American lawyers go down to Mexico and advise people from another country about how to get into this country when most of their concerns are economic? They want a better life, may maybe they can get a job in Honduras, but that is not a valid claim for asylum, is it?"

Democrats will never absorb the truth that there was no Russia collusion. Take a step back down memory lane. Dianne Feinstein, the Democrat senator from California who is the head of the Democrats for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and both James Clapper who worked for Barack Obama for his National Intelligence Committee, both have said they've seen no evidence of collusion. What this is about is very simple. Democrats don't look for the truth. This is all about politics. If you don't have the Russia narrative and the Russia collusion story, you might have to talk about Korea and what happened today. You might have to talk about Donald Trump crushing ISIS. You might have to talk about GDP growth and job growth and wage growth and a secure border, and the fact that we are energy independent. Democrats can't talk about those things, and that's why they have to stick on this narrative of Russia collusion. Otherwise they can't run on anything this coming November elections, so this is about politics and truth."

This is political and it is partisan because when you look at this committee, it's not the bipartisan committee that has said OK, no collusion. It is the Republicans. There is still a Senate committee, and we still have been independent counsel by Robert Mueller. And I say Democrats and Republicans back off and let the guy do his job. If, in fact, there is no collusion, we need to find that out. This committee has not interviewed the people that Mueller has interviewed. This committee has not looked into all the documentation that the independent counsel has before him. So this does not give an exoneration to the president at all. This is some Republicans saying, hey, based on what we looked into, and they didn't look into everything, we don't feel there's an issue there. One more thing --"

Democrats can't handle that. When will you accept it? How much evidence you need? How much information do you need to show that Donald Trump had a hard time colluding with Republicans let alone trying to collude Russians. When do you accept it?"

But it just reinforces this idea that this was a political hit job from that the beginning. It was oppo research pushed through this Christopher Steele who later, got disassociated from the FBI for leaking information to the media. That was an interesting tidbit. Democrats brushed that off early on, but it was now confirmed."

And then it was after the election that he with his organization and money from private donors hired, or tried to hire Mr. Steele and Fusion GPS. I don't have a problem with that because of the timeline there. What was his motive? Clearly it was political. Do we see any corroboration, anything in writing from Mr. Steele? We don't. We have e-mails and conversations that Mr. Steele told me this, et cetera, but I don't have a problem due to the timeline."

I wish he got off it like 15. This is such an inside the beltway mentality, which is why none of these Democrats thought Queen Hillary was ever going to lose because they thought she's so smart, she's so dignified.
