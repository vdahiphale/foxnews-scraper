And if you look at his letter, which most people haven't read through the entire letter, it's really well-lawyered, because he makes the point that they did not send a notice of deposition that fails to meet the legal requirements to compel.  Most Congressional testimony, I worked on Capitol Hill for seven years, is voluntary, and they are trying to compel it. He makes the point that they want to depose these people, but they haven't given them time to get a lawyer or to get counsel and prepare for that. That puts them in legal jeopardy. They are denying them the right to have State Department counsel present at their depositions, which is illegal because the State Department also has rights. These people, for example, do not have the legal authority to hand over classified documents to Congress. That is a decision for the executive branch led by the president, and in this case, the State Department and the secretary of state.

They have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs and their industrial chain is breaking up, which is very painful for them.

Let me be clear -- I will not tolerate such tactics, and I will use all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated officials whom I am proud to lead and serve alongside at the Department of State.\" The pushback from Capitol Hill came basically, if you do that and prevent us from getting what we need, that could be an article of impeachment, as it was with President Nixon."

Look, they keep saying they have an impeachment inquiry. There's no impeachment inquiry. There hasn't been vote. There hasn't been vote. So they don't have -- one of the reasons -- the reason we don't have a vote is because she doesn't want to make the freshman Democrats from Trump's districts have to vote on this before all of this is played out and they see where the political winds are."

      "utterance": "But it also means that impeachment inquiry, if you voted on it, would give the impeachment committee certain authorities to compel witnesses and all the rest, which they haven't done, and that's one of the things Pompeo is pointing out. And if you look at his letter, which most people haven't read through the entire letter, it's really well-lawyered, because he makes the point that they did not send a notice of deposition that fails to meet the legal requirements to compel. Most Congressional testimony, I worked on Capitol Hill for seven years, is voluntary, and they are trying to compel it. He makes the point that they want to depose these people, but they haven't given them time to get a lawyer or to get counsel and prepare for that. That puts them in legal jeopardy. They are denying them the right to have State Department counsel present at their depositions, which is illegal because the State Department also has rights. These people, for example, do not have the legal authority to hand over classified documents to Congress. That is a decision for the executive branch led by the president, and in this case, the State Department and the secretary of state. So there's a whole bunch of legal reasons that he lays out why they should not be forced to cooperate with this."

And interestingly we have the inspector general of the State Department going to the Hill tomorrow to present some kind of documents to House investigators. We don't know exactly what that's about, but that is one more sign of the velocity, of the speed with which this whole thing has been unfolding. The story is only like a week old, 10 days old.

So the Durham track and of the Horowitz track may both come to culmination in the middle of the impeachment debate. And if that happens, then, too, the Democrats' momentum will slow down. This is a bank shot impeachment. The Democrats know with what they have now, they are not going to remove Donald Trump from office. So what they need to do is inflict maximum damage on him in order to basically bring out either a Republican challenger or a strong third-party movement in 2020."

One protester was shot in the chest, in critical condition tonight. More than 1,700 protesters arrested, 145 law enforcement officers injured, 1,000 flights in and out of Hong Kong disrupted or canceled due to the protests. This comes on a day when the president gave a tweet to China, essentially, saying \"Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\" We are back with the panel. Marc, I talked to some people today who said that Ronald Reagan may be turning over in his grave with that communist reference from a Republican president."

According to the Black Book of Communism, in the 20 century communist regimes killed 100 million people, 65 million of those were killed by the Chinese communist regime. So this is literally the most murderous regime in the history of mankind. And I agree with Liz Cheney and Mike Gallagher who tweeted out that the president should not have done that. But that said, the president has a pretty strong policy vis-a-vis China. He's got them in a painful position. Their economy has stop growing and it may even be contracting. They have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs and their industrial chain is breaking up, which is very painful for them. And on top of that, they have Hong Kong, which is -- if they could have easily crushed the protests in Hong Kong, they would've done it months ago. This is not Tiananmen Square. It's not easy to crush. And so they are losing their crown jewel right now."

Mitch McConnell, who has differed with the president on very little, his statement talked a lot about the abuses of the Chinese government against its own people.

The politics of impeachment make this even more complicated, though, because if the president is taking damage domestically, it may make him more likely to make concessions internationally."
