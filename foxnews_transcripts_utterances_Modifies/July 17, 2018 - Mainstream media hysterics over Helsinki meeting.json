A point the president clarified and batted down today as we just played in the previous segment. And let's not pretend that America, by the way, hasn't had a history of making convenient alliances with unsavory strongmen. We do so when necessary to achieve greater objectives for our country. I'm thinking for instance Mubarak and Saddam Hussein, just to mention a few. And remember Obama himself abruptly cut short a big meeting with our key democratic ally India to attend a memorial service for King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, a bit of a strongman don't you think? Maybe some strongmen are better than others, when Obama's involved with a strongman they're fine.  The former president also makes the mistake of assuming that Trump and the millions of people who turned out to vote for him just came if of the ether, just dropped from the sky. Well Trump was elected in part because many were fed up with the weak man leadership of Barack Obama, the president who drew red lines in disappearing ink. Voters in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and beyond had had it with globalism, had it with open borders and had it with trade deals that gutted our manufacturing and gave an upper hand to China.  Trump voters were also tired of endless wars and they still are. That's called common sense conservative populism. But of course many in the bipartisan establishment that Trump ran against will never admit the failures of globalization and instead like Obama, they choose to denigrate the sceptics.",

Well I could think of Japan for instance which has strong nationalistic streak, it prizes their culture and has a very strict immigration policy. Are they on the verge of civil war? I don't think so. Look Obama's star turn today was designed to seize on the opening that's the globalists feel that they have after Helsinki. But as usual they overreach and they have this really convenient case of amnesia regarding their own role in the rotten state of affairs with Russia. These are the facts though, Obama did not reset a relationship with Russia even though he bragged about it all the way through 2012. And Obama consistently underestimated the challenge posed by Putin's regime. And this is the assessment from the Brookings Institution, no fans of Trump. Writing 'at the end of Obama's two terms Putin had elevated Russia to a credible revisionist power on the international stage. Russia annexed Crimea and occupied much of Eastern Ukraine. By successfully propping up the degenerate Assad regime, the Kremlin gained veto on any possible political solution to Syria and got a meaningful foothold in the broader region. Fueling both anti-Americanism and illiberalism and most damning of all, it managed to meddle almost unopposed in U.S. politics, all on Obama's watch.'  I just read that in the makeup room earlier. The bottom lines is this, the two biggest nuclear powers in the world should have an open and frank line of communication. That's better for America's security and guess what? It's better for global peace. It's what Liberals used to be for, more talk less war. Trump has a realistic and a pragmatic view of the post-Cold War era, the most serious threat to America militarily and economically is not Russia, by the way, with an economy basically the size of Italy's. In fact the biggest threat to America is China. Trump is the first president to make this plain and act accordingly. With tough talk and tougher actions, including terrorists that the globalists are all against. And the globalists are obsessed with Russia of course, they say precious little about China's incursions, China's cheating and China's threats. Why? Because they make gobs of money on arising China. Remember back in 2014 when the Chinese military hacked into the federal government's office of personnel management? China has home addresses, social security numbers and family information on 22 million current and former government employees, including mine. This was Barack Obama with President Xi after the news broke, looked very friendly. Did Obama confront Xi on the world stage then about that hack, huge intrusion? No he did not. And did the media make a big deal of that? No they did not. Did pundits on MSNBC and CNN claim that Obama was in Xi's back pocket for not calling him out? No they did not.  But back to Russia. Trump said yesterday that both sides deserve blame for the state of the relationship. Now I might have not said that while standing next to Putin but in a 2016 BBC piece quoting Paul Pillar, a former CIA officer and foreign policy expert he said, 'The relationship went wrong when the west did treat Russia as a nation that had shaken of Soviet Communism. It should have been welcomed as such into a new community of nations. But instead it was regarded as the successor state to the USSR, inheriting its status as the principle focus of western distrust.' Now you can debate whether that was the right thing to do but we opted to expand NATO, he said, and failed in our attempts to turn Russia into an ally, albeit a cagey one. Now that got Russia's back up and it boosted Putin's popularity in his homeland. The truth is lots of people have said what Trump said yesterday, that we should have a better relationship with Russia where we can. Guess who said it? Clinton, George W. Bush and yes Barack Obama.",

DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER, \"DEATH OF A NATION\": I think on the face of it, it should not be surprising that the Russians tried to influence our elections. It is not surprising at all either that Trump would be skeptical of intelligence agencies that seem to of been institutionally mounted against him. So the left's apoplexy here I think has a deeper explanation, and the expedition is this. They are desperate for Trump to ratify the premise of the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation is given a boost if Trump himself, in a sense the very target of the investigation, were to basically say, yes, the Russians are the bad guys, because then Mueller can then push forward and simply try to close the loop by saying, and you are part of that group. So I think Trump's natural aversion to doing that is based upon the correct perception that the left's concern here is entirely domestic politics. They don't care about Russia, per se. These are people for whom election integrity have not exactly been a leading issue.

The problem with that theory is, number one, remember our old friend Sheriff Lombardo? He's come out and proclaimed a million times on TV that this was not a terroristic act. That is their first hurdle. They has to prove this was terrorism. They said it wasn't terrorism. The second hurdle they have that nobody's talking about is even if a judge somehow says this was terrorism and this safety act applies, they have to prove that the security system they had in place was effective and had social utility.

That's mission accomplished for the Russians if they're goal was to tie the hands of the president of the United States. Now I think this is going to back fire on Russia because in the long term because the United States is the leading world power and to get the status and the recognition that they need, they need to be able to cut deals with the United States.

Russia is very interested in seeing Assad regain control so if Russia just gets the part it wants, we don't get Iran out of southern Syria, we can't advance the security of the state if Israel in that region then we lose.

Don't you love how Obama attempts to write Trump off as some Putin-like dictator and for good measure, he tries to lend credence to the line that Trump, of course, is siding with the old KGB and Putin over all our intelligence agents and services. A point the president clarified and batted down today as we just played in the previous segment. And let's not pretend that America, by the way, hasn't had a history of making convenient alliances with unsavory strongmen. We do so when necessary to achieve greater objectives for our country. I'm thinking for instance Mubarak and Saddam Hussein, just to mention a few. And remember Obama himself abruptly cut short a big meeting with our key democratic ally India to attend a memorial service for King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, a bit of a strongman don't you think? Maybe some strongmen are better than others, when Obama's involved with a strongman they're fine. The former president also makes the mistake of assuming that Trump and the millions of people who turned out to vote for him just came if of the ether, just dropped from the sky. Well Trump was elected in part because many were fed up with the weak man leadership of Barack Obama, the president who drew red lines in disappearing ink. Voters in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and beyond had had it with globalism, had it with open borders and had it with trade deals that gutted our manufacturing and gave an upper hand to China. Trump voters were also tired of endless wars and they still are. That's called common sense conservative populism. But of course many in the bipartisan establishment that Trump ran against will never admit the failures of globalization and instead like Obama, they choose to denigrate the sceptics."

Whipping up racial divisions is a typical Democrat tactic and one we've already seen deployed by, for instance Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the new bright light of the Democrat Party, Corey Booker, Kamala Harris, Maxine Waters the list goes on and on. Obama there is Johannesburg just makes it sound slightly more erudite with all those poignant pauses.

Well I could think of Japan for instance which has strong nationalistic streak, it prizes their culture and has a very strict immigration policy. Are they on the verge of civil war? I don't think so. Look Obama's star turn today was designed to seize on the opening that's the globalists feel that they have after Helsinki. But as usual they overreach and they have this really convenient case of amnesia regarding their own role in the rotten state of affairs with Russia. These are the facts though, Obama did not reset a relationship with Russia even though he bragged about it all the way through 2012. And Obama consistently underestimated the challenge posed by Putin's regime. And this is the assessment from the Brookings Institution, no fans of Trump. Writing 'at the end of Obama's two terms Putin had elevated Russia to a credible revisionist power on the international stage. Russia annexed Crimea and occupied much of Eastern Ukraine. By successfully propping up the degenerate Assad regime, the Kremlin gained veto on any possible political solution to Syria and got a meaningful foothold in the broader region. Fueling both anti-Americanism and illiberalism and most damning of all, it managed to meddle almost unopposed in U.S. politics, all on Obama's watch.' I just read that in the makeup room earlier. The bottom lines is this, the two biggest nuclear powers in the world should have an open and frank line of communication. That's better for America's security and guess what? It's better for global peace. It's what Liberals used to be for, more talk less war. Trump has a realistic and a pragmatic view of the post-Cold War era, the most serious threat to America militarily and economically is not Russia, by the way, with an economy basically the size of Italy's. In fact the biggest threat to America is China. Trump is the first president to make this plain and act accordingly. With tough talk and tougher actions, including terrorists that the globalists are all against. And the globalists are obsessed with Russia of course, they say precious little about China's incursions, China's cheating and China's threats. Why? Because they make gobs of money on arising China. Remember back in 2014 when the Chinese military hacked into the federal government's office of personnel management? China has home addresses, social security numbers and family information on 22 million current and former government employees, including mine. This was Barack Obama with President Xi after the news broke, looked very friendly. Did Obama confront Xi on the world stage then about that hack, huge intrusion? No he did not. And did the media make a big deal of that? No they did not. Did pundits on MSNBC and CNN claim that Obama was in Xi's back pocket for not calling him out? No they did not. But back to Russia. Trump said yesterday that both sides deserve blame for the state of the relationship. Now I might have not said that while standing next to Putin but in a 2016 BBC piece quoting Paul Pillar, a former CIA officer and foreign policy expert he said, 'The relationship went wrong when the west did treat Russia as a nation that had shaken of Soviet Communism. It should have been welcomed as such into a new community of nations. But instead it was regarded as the successor state to the USSR, inheriting its status as the principle focus of western distrust.' Now you can debate whether that was the right thing to do but we opted to expand NATO, he said, and failed in our attempts to turn Russia into an ally, albeit a cagey one. Now that got Russia's back up and it boosted Putin's popularity in his homeland. The truth is lots of people have said what Trump said yesterday, that we should have a better relationship with Russia where we can. Guess who said it? Clinton, George W. Bush and yes Barack Obama."

We're not really at war with Russia which is the prerequisite for treason. And he actually said that Russia is our enemy which is something that the president that he served for right years vehemently rejected even after all the allegations of hacking. If you look at all the nuclear weapons on the planet that can extinguish the human species, 90 percent of them reside in the hands of two countries, the U.S. and Russia.

Something that our founding fathers never wanted. That was before Vietnam, before the Cold war really got underway in a hard core manner and obviously before the war on terror when it's grown and grown and grown ever still. So there's huge factions in Washington that are very vested in always having an enemy that Americans are scared of and right now what Democrats and Republicans, the leadership of each party as sort of a foreign policy lead are working in unison to do is to try and convince Americans to be sufficiently afraid of Vladimir Putin and Russia that they are willing to essentially acquiesce to everything. Interestingly, Obama resisted that bipartisan pressure for eight years. He was a believer that Russia was not a threat, that we ought to try to cooperate with them. It's the Democrats in the post-2016 era looking for an explanation of how Hillary Clinton lost who are trying to essentially find a foreign villain to escape accountability and blame for themselves.

He thinks maybe if they had a better personal relationships they could figure things out in Syria, or do better stuff for denuclearization. But the core of what he said there in 2009, I don't think there's much daylight between that core idea and what Trump is trying to do, and he is really, really frustrated that the Mueller investigation called all of his efforts into question.

There is something that is a political fact that makes people on both sides of the spectrum very uncomfortable to talk about, which is that there is a decent chunk of the populace who voted in 2008 for Obama, and then voted in 2016 for Donald Trump. And the reason is that both of them positioned themselves as outsiders to the Washington establishment. They ran against the orthodoxies of both parties on the grounds that endless war and globalization were destroying the future of the American worker, were destroying the American dream. They promised to radically overhaul what happens in Washington. And it is true that even though Trump and Obama are posited as these polar opposites on a lot of issues, trade being one, but Russia being another, they actually sound a lot more like then it they do different. And it is true that Obama repeatedly refused to do things that Trump did, like sent lethal arms to Ukraine, like bomb forces in Assad, because Obama didn't want to promote tensions with Putin because he thought it would be better for both countries to get along, which is very similar to what Donald Trump is saying."

DINESH D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER, \"DEATH OF A NATION\": I think on the face of it, it should not be surprising that the Russians tried to influence our elections. It is not surprising at all either that Trump would be skeptical of intelligence agencies that seem to of been institutionally mounted against him. So the left's apoplexy here I think has a deeper explanation, and the expedition is this. They are desperate for Trump to ratify the premise of the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation is given a boost if Trump himself, in a sense the very target of the investigation, were to basically say, yes, the Russians are the bad guys, because then Mueller can then push forward and simply try to close the loop by saying, and you are part of that group. So I think Trump's natural aversion to doing that is based upon the correct perception that the left's concern here is entirely domestic politics. They don't care about Russia, per se. These are people for whom election integrity have not exactly been a leading issue.

Here's the point. We know that Obama colluded with Russia when he basically told him, hey, when the American people are out of sight, I'm going to make a deal with Putin. We know Hillary colluded with Russia. She took money in exchange for the whole uranium ideal. The one person who has not colluded with Russia at least as far as we know is Trump. As so the fact that they intelligence agencies are mounting their investigation of Trump whereas they look the other way with the other two guys who we now who have proven to have had Russia ties, this is actually what makes the whole thing so comical."

Congressman Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. Congressman Lacy Clay calls her patty, it's a lack of maturity on her part. And liberal Congressman Alcee Hastings offered this warning, \"meteors fizz out.\" Joining me now for reaction is Chris Hahn, a former aide to Chuck Schumer, and Democratic pollster and strategist Mark Penn.

She's a rising star, her name is everywhere, people want to get to know her. And of course she's going to make a few people mad. She's an insurgent. That's what happens when there's an insurgency. And people still have a little bit of hard feelings after the primary. But you know what, incumbents need to work their districts or they are going to face the same fate. That's what happens in America. We have elections for a reason, and people have to pay attention to the issues that matter to their constituents.

It won't be the left. And, also, it's also not a question of stopping bills the way that it was. It's really quite a different power dynamic. So I think this is all overblown. She really doesn't command anything other than media attention, and in fact the right likes to hype her to say that she is the representative of the Democratic Party because she's a socialist.

Joining us to explain how this is even possible is Brian Claypool, survivor of the Las Vegas shooting and an attorney representing a number of the victims of the massacre. Brian, this is so wild on so many levels. We've already gone through, frankly, the lack of security, lack of responsiveness, officers standing out in the hallway, they should've gone in when Paddock was up to his evil act. But now they are being sued? What is the legal theory? I'd sanction the lawyers filing this suit, by the way. What is the legal theory?"

And how low do they want to kick victims like myself and other survivors? So what they are trying to do is use what's called the safety act, there was a law put in place by our federal government, 2002, that basically said if companies hire out a security company that's rubber-stamped by the Department of Homeland Security, that basically, what MGM is saying they are immune from any liability that results if there is a terroristic act. The problem with that theory is, number one, remember our old friend Sheriff Lombardo? He's come out and proclaimed a million times on TV that this was not a terroristic act. That is their first hurdle. They has to prove this was terrorism. They said it wasn't terrorism. The second hurdle they have that nobody's talking about is even if a judge somehow says this was terrorism and this safety act applies, they have to prove that the security system they had in place was effective and had social utility. Gee whiz, guess what, 58 people died and hundreds were injured, so it wasn't real effective."

That hallway video that came out a couple weeks ago, that just is wild to me. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but if I were, that would make me think, that's odd. Why didn't we see the check-in video earlier? Why didn't we see anyone coming and going into his room earlier? What took so long?"

They don't want the world to know how hapless their security was leading up to that shooting. So what did they do? Instead of spending money on shoring up their security and making sure this doesn't happen again, they spend millions of dollars hiring out thousand dollar an hour lawyers to file frivolous lawsuits to get out of the case on a legal basis so that the whole community and a set of jurors will never hear the evidence that we all want to hear to make positive change."
