      "sentences": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity\".  We begin this Friday night with a FOX News alert, and we are tracking several breaking stories at this hour.  Moments ago, massive crowds -- look at that -- waiting to greet President Trump in Maine where he met with officials, delivered remarks and toured a facility that is making coronavirus testing supplies which thankfully we're making a lot of progress on.  And meanwhile, New York City, Los Angeles, D.C., other major cities are now bracing for yet another night of unrest, this is more and more Democrats, so-called journalists, the media mob calls for the police to be abolished altogether. Well, any liberal governor, I'll address you later, that -- or any mayor that may want to experiment with that plan, go right ahead, give your cops in your city in your state, give them a month off, let's see how well that's going to work out for you. We'll have more on that in just a moment.  Also, tonight, shocking miraculous news that almost no one saw coming, including yours truly. I didn't think we'd see this until the July numbers came in in August -- 2.5 million new jobs were created in the month of May, the biggest gain in American history. Just like all the doctors were wrong in terms of what they were saying about coronavirus, all of the coronavirus modeling was wrong. Well, the economists -- they were wrong here as well, and as per usual, the media mob -- they were wrong. They seemed depressed today.  Now, professional \"Hannity\" FOX News stalker, there's a lot of them, Erik Pimple's paper over there at \"The Washington Post,\" they actually predicted that unemployment would hit 20 percent, actually put it -- tweeted it out. Well, pretty dumb over there.   Instead, the unemployment rate went down well over a point, 14.7 percent to 13.3 percent. Remember, this is May. This is -- we're barely opening in May. Now, this country's economic recovery, it appears to be well on its way to beginning that V-curve that we talked about. It's only the tip of the iceberg. Personally, I did not expect these numbers that we got -- again until the July numbers came out in August. Now, we have all the latest statistics coming. And later in the show, we'll show you what Joe Biden really thinks about his fellow Americans. A lot of us apparently he doesn't like at all. At least 10 to 15 percent of you out there, we're essentially worthless people, you know, smelly Trump-supporting Walmart shoppers, irredeemable, deplorables, clinging to God, our bibles, our religion, our Second Amendment, our Constitution.   So, how many more people is the ever-forgetful Joe going to insult and even say \"don't vote for me\" on Election Day? Now, first, we begin tonight on the ground in Brooklyn, New York. Bryan Llenas has been with us all week. He is standing by with the very latest there -- Bryan.",

      "sentences": "Sean, this is the first fourth night of the 8:00 p.m. curfew in New York City. The Brooklyn Bridge is behind me and they are making sure that only essential personnel are on the road.  It is a much quieter evening tonight than it has been all week. There are still been hundreds, thousands of marchers and protesters out there against systemic racism, inequality, and police brutality. But I've got to tell you, that 8:00 p.m. curfew here in New York City is really a contentious point. The protesters are pointing to that curfew and saying that it's stifling free speech. They have a right to be out there, and that it's putting them in a position to get to a bad situation with the NYPD.   But from the NYPD's perspective, all week, they have been saying there have been looters and violent people and criminals who have infiltrated these peaceful protests. They're very few, and that's why they are trying to enforce this curfew. They would rather you be off of the road after 8:00 p.m. They've been put in an impossible situation all week. We've seen them march peacefully with protesters, hand-in-hand really throughout the day, but even at night, given some leeway to allow these protesters to go in. But then, eventually, they have to go in until people knew got to get off the roads or get arrested, and it's caused a lot of animosity from some of the people here in New York City towards the NYPD.  Dermott Shea, the NYPD commissioner, says enough is enough. He says the antipolice rhetoric and the silence that is coming from the elected officials of this city is, quote, sickening. He thinks that this -- it needs to be notched down a lot. He believes that his officers have been targeted specifically because this antipolice rhetoric has been enfeebled by elected officials who have not done enough to promote dialogue between both groups. And so, this 8:00 p.m. curfew, they find themselves stuck in the middle, Sean. They are showing up. They're trying to enforce the law. They're in riot gear, and the protesters are there, and it's creating a situation over the last four nights that the NYPD finds itself in a no-win situation despite the fact that they're doing everything they can to enforce a law that the governor put in place and that the mayor is backing to protect the businesses in the streets here after what we saw for nights on end, well, at least two nights, I'm sorry, of mass looting and criminal behavior -- Sean.",

All week, we all witnessed the horrific scenes, the looting, the vandalism, the beat-downs, the shootings, the stabbings, the arson, you name it. One rioter was arrested for threatening to blow up a police station and turn it into Swiss cheese. America cities, they have now devolved into complete and utter anarchy. So far, Minneapolis has suffered over $55 million in building damage and looting alone. Now, authorities are warning sophisticated criminals organized crime, that they are using the riots to plot strategic heists.  But get this? The left's solution to the chaos is to defund and dismantle the police.   Now, have they lost touch with all reality? Are they really that dumb? Keith Ellison is now the attorney general of Minnesota. His son Jeremiah, he's a Minneapolis city council member. He just tweeted, quote: We are going to dismantle the Minneapolis police department, and when we are done, we're not simply going to glue it back together. The president of that city council agreeing. Quote: Yes, we're going to dismantle the Minneapolis police department.  Today, Congresswoman Omar also agreed, tweeting: It's time to disband the Minneapolis police department.  Now, sadly, this call to action is not just taking place in Minneapolis. Liberal cities all across America, Democrats now are taking big steps to defund or dismantle their police. In Los Angeles, their mayor out there, Garcetti, bowing to get $150 million from that department. He also referred to members of the LAPD as killers. Now, today, the LAPD union slammed the mayor, calling his remarks political pandering that smeared every single police officer in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, members of the LAPD, well, they had this to say to local councilman. Let's take a look.",

Hillary Clinton's former spokesperson also calling for police to be defunded. Socialist congresswoman, part of the squad, Congresswoman Tlaib, tweeting, quote: I just want us to dig deeper that the hashtag defund police movement isn't just brushed aside.   The mob, the media, some there -- they are pushing for the police to be abolished. A new story in \"The Atlantic\" reads, quote: Defund the police. American needs to rethink its priorities for the whole criminal justice system.  Maybe they forgot that Donald Trump did criminal justice reform to get rid of disparate sentencing. \"Rolling Stone\" publishing a, quote, practical guide to defunding the police. \"Cosmo\", they wrote, defunding the police will make us safer. Really?  And look at this. In a rare moment of common sense from the media mob, you have a writer over at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Vox.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=Ps9djChrFukE8HcJIQOimKveltVPkEulacfPyfe3ldI&s=rhXquB8bko7XUQH-Xmg-8a-L_zc8S7tKxgoaisB3pu0&e= tweeting, quote: I'm sorry, but this abolished the police seems like a poorly thought out idea that has gotten popular with shocking speed.  After widespread rage and condemnation from his far-left peers, guess what? He was pressured, groupthink, he was forced to apologize. So, clearly, in the new, radical, far left socialist Democratic Party, it is now officially woke to abolish the police.  Today, Byron York, he brought up a really good point in his tweet, writing, quote: Well, maybe it's time for some enterprising blue state municipality to go bold and eliminate its police force. Let's see what happens. Comrade de Blasio, how about we'll start with you. How about you give up the entire police department in New York, give two weeks paid leave, including, by the way, the armed police officers protecting you and your family every day, and after all, Black Lives Matter -- they have already promised they are going to fill the void. And they will patrol the streets, armed militias, if you want to call it, armed peace officers, really? The same Black Lives Matter group that frequently is called for violence against the police?

Are you comfortable with police being replaced by, let's say, militias, like Black Lives Matter and others? Well, according to Gallup, well, we have that answer. It's a resounding no. The vast majority of Americans trust the police. In fact, according to Gallup, only the police, the military, small businesses receive a net positive favorable rating.  And just for the record, the mob and the media, politicians, they had the highest net negative ratings. Still, some far left mayors, governors, they are ready, willing to dismantle the police, our first line of defense.  Even the Michigan governor, that's Governor Shutdown Whitmer said that she understands the sentiment behind the movement and the governor shutdown who used to use the police to enforce her over-the-top, absolutely obscene lockdown orders during the pandemic, well, guess what? Today, she violated her own social distancing orders. She took part in a protest. Remember, she outlawed lawn moving.  And for shutdown Whitmer, many other Democrats, the rules don't apply to them. They'll have you arrested for going to church, or if you are having a funeral even though you wear a mask in New York. But then they'll participate in protests with zero social distancing.  They'll disband the police force, all while they remain safe and sound. Of course, they have their armed guards. They have their high wall security. And guess what? They'll let businesses get looted, burned to the ground, all while continuing to take their paycheck.  By the way, that goes the same for Nancy Pelosi. She says we need proxy voting and mail-in ballots for people's health and safety in November. So much is on the line. Can't have congressmen and women voting in person. Must all do it by mail. Well, ultimately, it's going to come down to one very simple question. Do you want jobs, or you like this new mob rule? Not much of a question for me. Joining me with reaction tonight, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, FOX News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. We saw this now play out this week. Rod Rosenstein, knowing what you know now which you have signed the FISA warrants, no. Knowing what you know now, with Mueller had been appointed and done -- no. Is there any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion? No.  A couple of bad cops have abused power and were corrupt, dirty cops as Joe diGenova said, and then a bad cop here in Minneapolis and other cops who didn't do their jobs stopping it, look at what has happened. What -- now we are going to get rid of all cops? That sounds dangerous to me.",

First on the Russia hoax, one of the -- adding to the pain and anguish of the last week and a half is the fact that perhaps the biggest story in the decade has been so totally overlooked that the mainstream accused are president being a Russian spy. They tried their best to destroy his presidency. They tried to invoke the 25th Amendment and is being -- you know, because of everything that's going on, we're paying such scant attention to it. People want to abolish police, until they have to call 911. When they call 911 to get a recorded message, and the guy is coming through their window, they are going to rethink that whole thing about criminal justice.  There's a narrow line, a sweet spot between strength and compassion. I thought President Trump tried his best today, you know, elated with the economic news, invoking the name of George Floyd in the most loving way. He got mocked for it, I got exactly what he was trying to do.

You know, when you walk into a domestic violence situation, a volatile one, you know, when you see a little kid, you know, five years old crying in the corner because his father just beat the living out of a woman in the house who is now bleeding and you show up there, and the father doesn't want to go to jail and you get attacked by the father, which happened to me.

I'll never forget, in the corner, walk into her house while two guys you know are selling drugs out front and she wants to say something, but she can't because she has that look of fear in her eyes and she is afraid of what's going to happen, who do you think is going show up? Do you think Antifa is going to show up, who paid -- her entire life, she paid mortgage on that home and she's held hostage and imprison inside that house because to drug dealers set up camp out front? Who do you think stops that?  The police department stops that and when you see that little kid in the corner crying, I'll never forget it, burned into my cerebral cortex like there's no tomorrow. Until you see that, those are the cops that show up and do that. They're not perfect all the time, Sean. They make mistakes. We are all sinners.

This one is drug dealing, this one is shooting, this -- the crime -- so the reaction between the blue and the black and it doesn't matter whether the cop is white or black, is defined in many ways by the atmosphere of criminality, of human rights violations on a regular basis because people are stealing or whatever it is going on.

Unfortunately tonight, the lawless left continues to sow hate, division, more attacks on the military and law enforcement, as the National Guard in Utah confirmed they were kicked out of their D.C. hotel. Why? By the radical D.C. mayor earlier this week who, at the same time, was using city resources to paint a Black Lives Matter mural leading to the White House. Wasn't that the group -- maybe my memory is faulty. What do we want, dead cops, when do we want it, now? Hmm, pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon? I just don't quite remember. Now, President Trump earlier today tweeted, well, Mayor Bowser is grossly incompetent, no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C. Now, if the great men and women of the National Guard didn't step forward, they would've looked no better than her counterpart mayor in Minneapolis. Here with reaction, \"FOX & Friends\" weekend co-host, Pete Hegseth. He was serving with the National Guard during the D.C. unrest, along with Super Bowl champion Burgess Owens, who by himself, he is running for an open seat out in Utah, the district -- the fourth district there, and the host of \"The Rubin Report,\" David Rubin. Pete, I saw what you were doing, we had a conversation, told you to be safe. Can you give us some insight as to what you were dealing with and seeing in D.C. as you were called up?  PETE HEGSETH, HOST, \"FOX & FRIENDS\": Yes, I was there for three days, three nights on the streets of Washington, D.C. At one point, Sean, I was -- I was -- me and a handful of other guys standing at the Vietnam War Memorial to defend it from people who would want to deface it after the Lincoln Memorial. I remember saying a prayer there in thinking. This is what it's like to be a Vietnam veteran. What they went through, when they came home. If we had not been there, if the National Guard had not been there, everything a monument would've been defaced from everything will business would've been looted and they would've laid siege to the White House in an unending fashion. If not for the National Guard, and the mayor in Washington, D.C., would've had no way out of the mess that she and others have helped create. And, by the way, that hotel? That's the hotel I was staying at, and I can confirm that the guys that are still there have been kicked out of the hotel by the mayor. The men and women in uniform who had nowhere else to stay, that's where the army hotel had been set up, so that they could protect the very city that she supposedly runs. I was on those streets, the most vile things were being said to the cops and the National Guard soldiers. We were there to facilitate the First Amendment right to protest but to then stand as the thin blue and green line against the rioters, the looters, the violent folks who threw things at me, at us, at my guys, without that, you do not have any peaceful protest. And without -- without what the president did in calling in the National Guard and the other people, that Washington, D.C., would be a very different place tonight.",

The progressive mayors and governors, they want this chaos because it gives them an excuse to use more power, and then they feel that then proves that the whole system is broken. But a guy like Drew Brees, who I have nothing but respect for, he made a really terrible mistake by apologizing for what he believes and what was true, because once you bend the knee to these people, which we're watching so many people do right now, my Mayor Eric Garcetti was on his knees a day or two ago in front of protesters, once you bend the name you must live down there forever.

      "utterance": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity\". We begin this Friday night with a FOX News alert, and we are tracking several breaking stories at this hour. Moments ago, massive crowds -- look at that -- waiting to greet President Trump in Maine where he met with officials, delivered remarks and toured a facility that is making coronavirus testing supplies which thankfully we're making a lot of progress on. And meanwhile, New York City, Los Angeles, D.C., other major cities are now bracing for yet another night of unrest, this is more and more Democrats, so-called journalists, the media mob calls for the police to be abolished altogether. Well, any liberal governor, I'll address you later, that -- or any mayor that may want to experiment with that plan, go right ahead, give your cops in your city in your state, give them a month off, let's see how well that's going to work out for you. We'll have more on that in just a moment. Also, tonight, shocking miraculous news that almost no one saw coming, including yours truly. I didn't think we'd see this until the July numbers came in in August -- 2.5 million new jobs were created in the month of May, the biggest gain in American history. Just like all the doctors were wrong in terms of what they were saying about coronavirus, all of the coronavirus modeling was wrong. Well, the economists -- they were wrong here as well, and as per usual, the media mob -- they were wrong. They seemed depressed today. Now, professional \"Hannity\" FOX News stalker, there's a lot of them, Erik Pimple's paper over there at \"The Washington Post,\" they actually predicted that unemployment would hit 20 percent, actually put it -- tweeted it out. Well, pretty dumb over there. Instead, the unemployment rate went down well over a point, 14.7 percent to 13.3 percent. Remember, this is May. This is -- we're barely opening in May. Now, this country's economic recovery, it appears to be well on its way to beginning that V-curve that we talked about. It's only the tip of the iceberg. Personally, I did not expect these numbers that we got -- again until the July numbers came out in August. Now, we have all the latest statistics coming. And later in the show, we'll show you what Joe Biden really thinks about his fellow Americans. A lot of us apparently he doesn't like at all. At least 10 to 15 percent of you out there, we're essentially worthless people, you know, smelly Trump-supporting Walmart shoppers, irredeemable, deplorables, clinging to God, our bibles, our religion, our Second Amendment, our Constitution. So, how many more people is the ever-forgetful Joe going to insult and even say \"don't vote for me\" on Election Day? Now, first, we begin tonight on the ground in Brooklyn, New York. Bryan Llenas has been with us all week. He is standing by with the very latest there -- Bryan."

      "utterance": "Sean, this is the first fourth night of the 8:00 p.m. curfew in New York City. The Brooklyn Bridge is behind me and they are making sure that only essential personnel are on the road. It is a much quieter evening tonight than it has been all week. There are still been hundreds, thousands of marchers and protesters out there against systemic racism, inequality, and police brutality. But I've got to tell you, that 8:00 p.m. curfew here in New York City is really a contentious point. The protesters are pointing to that curfew and saying that it's stifling free speech. They have a right to be out there, and that it's putting them in a position to get to a bad situation with the NYPD. But from the NYPD's perspective, all week, they have been saying there have been looters and violent people and criminals who have infiltrated these peaceful protests. They're very few, and that's why they are trying to enforce this curfew. They would rather you be off of the road after 8:00 p.m. They've been put in an impossible situation all week. We've seen them march peacefully with protesters, hand-in-hand really throughout the day, but even at night, given some leeway to allow these protesters to go in. But then, eventually, they have to go in until people knew got to get off the roads or get arrested, and it's caused a lot of animosity from some of the people here in New York City towards the NYPD. Dermott Shea, the NYPD commissioner, says enough is enough. He says the antipolice rhetoric and the silence that is coming from the elected officials of this city is, quote, sickening. He thinks that this -- it needs to be notched down a lot. He believes that his officers have been targeted specifically because this antipolice rhetoric has been enfeebled by elected officials who have not done enough to promote dialogue between both groups. And so, this 8:00 p.m. curfew, they find themselves stuck in the middle, Sean. They are showing up. They're trying to enforce the law. They're in riot gear, and the protesters are there, and it's creating a situation over the last four nights that the NYPD finds itself in a no-win situation despite the fact that they're doing everything they can to enforce a law that the governor put in place and that the mayor is backing to protect the businesses in the streets here after what we saw for nights on end, well, at least two nights, I'm sorry, of mass looting and criminal behavior -- Sean."

All week, we all witnessed the horrific scenes, the looting, the vandalism, the beat-downs, the shootings, the stabbings, the arson, you name it. One rioter was arrested for threatening to blow up a police station and turn it into Swiss cheese. America cities, they have now devolved into complete and utter anarchy. So far, Minneapolis has suffered over $55 million in building damage and looting alone. Now, authorities are warning sophisticated criminals organized crime, that they are using the riots to plot strategic heists. But get this? The left's solution to the chaos is to defund and dismantle the police. Now, have they lost touch with all reality? Are they really that dumb?"

Are you comfortable with police being replaced by, let's say, militias, like Black Lives Matter and others? Well, according to Gallup, well, we have that answer. It's a resounding no. The vast majority of Americans trust the police. In fact, according to Gallup, only the police, the military, small businesses receive a net positive favorable rating. And just for the record, the mob and the media, politicians, they had the highest net negative ratings. Still, some far left mayors, governors, they are ready, willing to dismantle the police, our first line of defense. Even the Michigan governor, that's Governor Shutdown Whitmer said that she understands the sentiment behind the movement and the governor shutdown who used to use the police to enforce her over-the-top, absolutely obscene lockdown orders during the pandemic, well, guess what? Today, she violated her own social distancing orders. She took part in a protest. Remember, she outlawed lawn moving. And for shutdown Whitmer, many other Democrats, the rules don't apply to them. They'll have you arrested for going to church, or if you are having a funeral even though you wear a mask in New York. But then they'll participate in protests with zero social distancing. They'll disband the police force, all while they remain safe and sound. Of course, they have their armed guards. They have their high wall security. And guess what? They'll let businesses get looted, burned to the ground, all while continuing to take their paycheck. By the way, that goes the same for Nancy Pelosi. She says we need proxy voting and mail-in ballots for people's health and safety in November. So much is on the line. Can't have congressmen and women voting in person. Must all do it by mail. Well, ultimately, it's going to come down to one very simple question. Do you want jobs, or you like this new mob rule? Not much of a question for me. Joining me with reaction tonight, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, FOX News correspondent at large, Geraldo Rivera. We saw this now play out this week. Rod Rosenstein, knowing what you know now which you have signed the FISA warrants, no. Knowing what you know now, with Mueller had been appointed and done -- no. Is there any evidence of Trump-Russia collusion? No. A couple of bad cops have abused power and were corrupt, dirty cops as Joe diGenova said, and then a bad cop here in Minneapolis and other cops who didn't do their jobs stopping it, look at what has happened. What -- now we are going to get rid of all cops? That sounds dangerous to me."

First on the Russia hoax, one of the -- adding to the pain and anguish of the last week and a half is the fact that perhaps the biggest story in the decade has been so totally overlooked that the mainstream accused are president being a Russian spy. They tried their best to destroy his presidency. They tried to invoke the 25th Amendment and is being -- you know, because of everything that's going on, we're paying such scant attention to it. People want to abolish police, until they have to call 911. When they call 911 to get a recorded message, and the guy is coming through their window, they are going to rethink that whole thing about criminal justice. There's a narrow line, a sweet spot between strength and compassion. I thought President Trump tried his best today, you know, elated with the economic news, invoking the name of George Floyd in the most loving way. He got mocked for it, I got exactly what he was trying to do. But I'm telling you, this will move toward anarchy is going to end in a hurry as long as -- as soon as these people are victimized by crime, Sean."

They say Republicans don't believe in science. I actually do believe in science. I actually do believe that all of the great building blocks of the universe and within universe came from God, but I also believe in science, gravity, science, that's real science.

You know, Sean, I was a cop for a long time, between being a federal agent and police officer. You know, when you walk into a domestic violence situation, a volatile one, you know, when you see a little kid, you know, five years old crying in the corner because his father just beat the living out of a woman in the house who is now bleeding and you show up there, and the father doesn't want to go to jail and you get attacked by the father, which happened to me. I'm not telling you Rambo stories here, I'm just telling you for the purposes of this segment and he jumps on you and tries to then beat the crap out of you. Who do you think responds to save that woman and that kid from that situation they are in? Do you think the librarian is going to show up? Do think the Black Lives Matter crowd is going to show up, the social activists? You know, one of the looters are going to show up? What is your answer to that? Well, let me ask you again, you know, what about when I was walking foot post in the 75 precinct in East New York, a crime-ridden area, and you have to watch an 80-year-old woman. I'll never forget, in the corner, walk into her house while two guys you know are selling drugs out front and she wants to say something, but she can't because she has that look of fear in her eyes and she is afraid of what's going to happen, who do you think is going show up? Do you think Antifa is going to show up, who paid -- her entire life, she paid mortgage on that home and she's held hostage and imprison inside that house because to drug dealers set up camp out front? Who do you think stops that? The police department stops that and when you see that little kid in the corner crying, I'll never forget it, burned into my cerebral cortex like there's no tomorrow. Until you see that, those are the cops that show up and do that. They're not perfect all the time, Sean. They make mistakes. We are all sinners.

It's because black on black crime, urban crime, this malignant destructive force within the community is creating such a toxic atmosphere that the policeman comes usually from out of the neighborhood, he comes there and he sees the worst in everybody. This one is drug dealing, this one is shooting, this -- the crime -- so the reaction between the blue and the black and it doesn't matter whether the cop is white or black, is defined in many ways by the atmosphere of criminality, of human rights violations on a regular basis because people are stealing or whatever it is going on. So, the cop is now he is the social worker, he is a law enforcer, he is the marriage counselor, he's the childcare -- you know, they've got such a hard job. They -- you know, the fuse can burn down so far between it, it blows up. I think that one of these incidents, that cop that hit put his knee on George Floyd's neck, he hurt so many cops.

If you call 911 now, God forbid you did that, ask someone, can you put a police officer in front of my house because I'm worried, they will probably arrest you for calling 911 in making a false charge. They are not there for that. They are there to enforce the law and do it the best way they can. They're not your personal security force. Sadly, sadly, I'm not kidding, it's not hyperbolic. That has come home. People have gotten a taste of chaos. You know, a friend of mine said to me on my show earlier and he wasn't kidding. He said, you know, the difference about the United States in comparison to every other country in the world, I've traveled around the world in the Secret Service, this is true, is you wake up tomorrow with the expectations that things will be a little better. You don't worry about your house being taken by a horde of bandits coming by. You understand the rest of the world doesn't generally work like that? That's gone.

It's unclear what point David Dorn was shot but police say he was hit by gunfire inside the shop and was able to make it outside where he collapsed on the sidewalk.

Unfortunately tonight, the lawless left continues to sow hate, division, more attacks on the military and law enforcement, as the National Guard in Utah confirmed they were kicked out of their D.C. hotel. Why? By the radical D.C. mayor earlier this week who, at the same time, was using city resources to paint a Black Lives Matter mural leading to the White House. Wasn't that the group -- maybe my memory is faulty. What do we want, dead cops, when do we want it, now? Hmm, pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em like bacon? I just don't quite remember. Now, President Trump earlier today tweeted, well, Mayor Bowser is grossly incompetent, no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C. Now, if the great men and women of the National Guard didn't step forward, they would've looked no better than her counterpart mayor in Minneapolis. Here with reaction, \"FOX & Friends\" weekend co-host, Pete Hegseth. He was serving with the National Guard during the D.C. unrest, along with Super Bowl champion Burgess Owens, who by himself, he is running for an open seat out in Utah, the district -- the fourth district there, and the host of \"The Rubin Report,\" David Rubin. Pete, I saw what you were doing, we had a conversation, told you to be safe. Can you give us some insight as to what you were dealing with and seeing in D.C. as you were called up? PETE HEGSETH, HOST, \"FOX & FRIENDS\": Yes, I was there for three days, three nights on the streets of Washington, D.C. At one point, Sean, I was -- I was -- me and a handful of other guys standing at the Vietnam War Memorial to defend it from people who would want to deface it after the Lincoln Memorial. I remember saying a prayer there in thinking. This is what it's like to be a Vietnam veteran. What they went through, when they came home. If we had not been there, if the National Guard had not been there, everything a monument would've been defaced from everything will business would've been looted and they would've laid siege to the White House in an unending fashion. If not for the National Guard, and the mayor in Washington, D.C., would've had no way out of the mess that she and others have helped create. And, by the way, that hotel? That's the hotel I was staying at, and I can confirm that the guys that are still there have been kicked out of the hotel by the mayor. The men and women in uniform who had nowhere else to stay, that's where the army hotel had been set up, so that they could protect the very city that she supposedly runs. I was on those streets, the most vile things were being said to the cops and the National Guard soldiers. We were there to facilitate the First Amendment right to protest but to then stand as the thin blue and green line against the rioters, the looters, the violent folks who threw things at me, at us, at my guys, without that, you do not have any peaceful protest. And without -- without what the president did in calling in the National Guard and the other people, that Washington, D.C., would be a very different place tonight."

You have to understand that the left is -- and I just want to call what she is, she's a Marxist. They love -- they love chaos, they love pain and misery for those they are overseen. What they forget -- what they forgot is that the rest of the country isn't what they have been overseeing for the last few years. The rest of the country is hopeful, we believe in ourselves, we are very independent and that is why we're coming back as strong as we are. What we are seeing -- and by the way, I have a friend of mine, part of the National Guard here, left here to go to D.C. to help this lady, this mayor, to help people that she obviously doesn't really care about. And that's the message -- that's the conversation we are going to start having among Democrats who love our country, blacks, particularly business owners, find -- think about who is in your corner and who is not. And this is going to be the greatest conversation we've ever had, so -- because Marxism and the evil of it will finally be shown for what it is in our country will come back strong, we will get a president in place, a house that is going to give the Senate more backbone, and the next four years, Sean, is going to be the renaissance in our country. I really see it because we've talked about the realism of this evil of Marxism."

We saw -- nobody loves a city more than Drew Brees, for crying out loud, and he made his comments about kneeling, he's allowed to have his opinion. We saw what happened there. And now the NFL commissioner is weighing in. I just like free, open exchange of ideas and ideals, that includes people that beat the living hell out of me, which happens regularly. I accept it. That's part of the great tradition of this country. DAVE RUBIN, \"TEH RUBIN REPORT\" HOST: Absolutely, Sean, and, by the way, the chickens are coming home to roost. So it's nice to see a couple of \"New York Times\" or \"Vox\" or \"BuzzFeed\" people coming around and going, oh, maybe the police are decent or maybe law and order is a decent thing. Maybe the Constitution in America, they ain't that bad. But it's a little too late, right, because these are the people that have been trying to cancel you for years when you talk about black crime in Chicago, for example, were just this past weekend I think something like 19 people -- black people were killed. I mean, crazy statistics. But, of course, we should all be for free speech in the open exchange of ideas but with happening here, you know I'm in L.A. right now. The progressive mayors and governors, they want this chaos because it gives them an excuse to use more power, and then they feel that then proves that the whole system is broken. But a guy like Drew Brees, who I have nothing but respect for, he made a really terrible mistake by apologizing for what he believes and what was true, because once you bend the knee to these people, which we're watching so many people do right now, my Mayor Eric Garcetti was on his knees a day or two ago in front of protesters, once you bend the name you must live down there forever. They will keep their foot on your throat and I would much rather live as a free man and be hated than bow to the people who want to control me."

It's an absolutely blockbuster May jobs report totally crushed all expectations. U.S. economy gained a whopping, record 2.5 million jobs last month. And how was the mob and the media responding to all this good news? Over at fake news CNN, they're trying to ignore it, not even taking the president's remarks on it. Liberal, fake news, fraud Paul Krugman at the New York toilet paper \"Times,\" well, he's promoting baseless conspiracy theories that the Bureau of Labor Statistics altered the data. The Washington compost, well, they are putting out an outright false tweet about a 20 percent unemployment rate that they thought was coming that didn't happen. Great job at the psycho FOX News, \"Hannity\" stalker Erik Pimple paper. We go now and check in with Governor Mike Huckabee, Melissa Francis. Melissa, nobody saw this coming. They were expecting 7.5 million jobs lost. MELISSA FRANCIS, \"OUTNUMBERED\" CO-HOST: No, they were so close. I mean, those so-called experts, right? They were only off by 10 million jobs. So close. They thought it was going to be down 7.5 million, instead it was up 2.5 million, 75 percent of small business owners back out there, opening their doors, back to business, the lifeblood of the economy. And the mainstream media focused on one of the negatives within the report, which was that black unemployment is still stubbornly high. Yes, it is all the way back to what it was under the Obama administration and nobody wants to go back to the terrible jobs numbers for minorities under the Obama administration. The wage gap was huge, the gap between rich and poor, so we don't want to go back to that, and they point out, yes, it's just like under the Obama administration."

The car was revved up but it was at the stoplight. And yet, the accelerator was ready to go, but the people had their foot on the break. So when the break came off, this car is ready and raring to go, and I think we're all thrilled to see that the strong economy we had was revved up and ready, and it's getting back to speed.

Now, this is his only calling card, that he claims, that oh, he got nominated or appointed by Obama to be his running mate. That's not enough to vote for him. He threw blacks in jail by the -- with his crime reform -- his crime bill. It was President Trump with his First Step action that got out of jail.

So, if half the country voted for Trump, and she's talking about half of that, that's 25 percent. So Joe was not nearly as demeaning as Hillary was. Look, Joe's real problem with numbers as the numbers you talked about with Huckabee just now in that previous section, and Melissa, the economy could be coming back big time, and also, there's a Rasmussen report that came out today, it's an outlier, but it shows that 40 percent of blacks are now supporting Donald Trump.
