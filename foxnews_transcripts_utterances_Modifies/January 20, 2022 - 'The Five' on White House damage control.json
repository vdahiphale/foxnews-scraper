It's like, what did he mean when the elections will be illegitimate? Are you saying that what President Trump said about 2020 which you disavowed, because you say that the 2020 election was legitimate, good, OK, fine. Let's -- let's maybe I'll try to agree on that, or some agree on that. I agree with that. Well, then, are you saying that this next one is not going to be? Because what? What are the specifics, they've never laid that out. And so, then you have the press secretary have to come out and say, actually no, what he was saying is this and I can't even remember what her tweet said, but I can imagine that the White House communications team as soon as he said that thought, OK, that's -- there is one thing that we are going to have to deal right away. That issue is not going to go away. Because it wasn't just Kamala Harris that said what she said. Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina said it as well. So, go get ready, buckle up, everybody, we are going to have a big fight again about legitimacy of elections without specifics of concerns. They are -- the Democrats are expected to lose big time, a lot of seats in this midterm election. And not just in the midterm for Congress, but we are talking about state houses, state races, things like that. So, are they -- Democrats trying to set it up that if they lose those elections aren't legitimate? Where have we heard that before? And where did that really like, screw things up for everybody? I thought, so there was that. There's just one other thing. I think the mop up that was a pretty big deal, and that was the minor incursion are going to possibly be OK now by the Biden administration? Excuse me, last night they had to have a national security official, I think it was probably Jake Sullivan get on the phone and tell everybody, actually that's not what he meant. But that is exactly what our adversaries and our allies heard when you saw Zelensky put a notion -- note today that they are trying to walk it back. That was a big blunder.",

I'm going to use a booze analogy, you got to compare. Every -- we are in the state where we kind of -- we always have to compare Joe Biden to the guy before him. Right? And Trump is kind of like was an everyday presence, so we built up a tolerance, and he would come out and he would speak he was like a nightly martini we got used to it. But Biden he is like a guy he didn't drink for a year and then he comes out and he binges for two hours and now we all we all have a Biden hangover. I mean, I'm as confused as I am after that happened. I think the big mistake was they thought going -- going long, going long would address the questions of mental fitness, but instead it revealed the fogginess as Van Jones pointed out the confusion and also the crankiness that came later that you pointed out. It's like again, I mean, another analogy, it's like a classic car that's been sitting in the garage. You don't immediately drive it across the state. You know? You drive it down to the diner five miles down the road. That's Joe's speed. But I always -- I got to defend him. It's not his fault. I mean, he didn't make himself president, the Democratic Party did. It's 2022 and I still can't believe Joe Biden is president. He has been around my entire lifetime and he is president now after running I don't know, 13 times. The bottom line though, if there was very little time spent on American concern, it was spent on media concerns. And that was the bogus voting bill and Russia. Meanwhile, Americans just wanted to hear about law and order and getting food on their table, it's like they order steak and the Democrats keep delivering them tofu.",

He did make that awful blunder about the minor incursion in Ukraine which kind of made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, you know, and some of his other language was kind of meandering. I do agree with that. But I also think that he showed incredible stamina for an old guy. I admire the fact that he was on his feet for two hours answering some very hostile questions including some, one from our former colleague James Rosen that was so insulting. He asked the President of the United States, you know, are you -- are you mentally incapable of holding your office? I mean, can you imagine James Rosen or anyone else asking Ronald Reagan that? I thought it was very, very rude. He cleaned up the Ukraine, I think that the good thing about the Ukraine is that he made it clear that he wasn't drawing a red line, that we weren't committing ourselves to war in Europe if there was a further Ukrainian incursion by the Russians, thank God for that, because there are so many hawks in Washington, I could just see them all beating the drum, come on, let's send the 101st airborne, the 82nd airborne to Ukraine right now. I'm glad that he didn't go that far. What he did do was unfortunate and I think that it was a slip, because not because it was false, but because I believe it was true. I think that it is a U.S. policy that if there is a minor incursion, they are not going to go nuclear in terms of the sanctions. But you know, you should not think out loud especially in that context, Jesse.",

      "sentences": "First of all, the question about mental acuity was asked because half of the country including a number of independents in the latest A.P. poll had various serious concerns about Joe Biden's mental ability to hold the job. So, the question being asked was for a reflection of what people are saying to people calling him on the phone and asking about the president and the job that he is doing. But when it comes to the press conference yesterday, they rolled out everybody. They rolled out Nancy Pelosi, as we said the vice president and everybody had a problem and wasn't on the same page with exactly what they were saying and what the message was. In terms of what they said today, Jen Psaki said during the press briefing, that foreign leaders are happy that a person who respects democracy and alliances is back in the White House. Well, then you touch on the two issues that were the main problems yesterday in the press conference. Domestically, the president is now questioning the democracy and the legitimacy of elections. And in foreign policy, our alliances are all over the place. Europe and NATO don't know what they are going to do if Ukraine is invaded. The Ukrainians are very worried about what the United States is or isn't going to do. And the bottom line is there's been no deterrence. This didn't happen to President Trump because there was deterrence. And Putin sees an opening here to do something. And also, the last thing, is that because they waited so long to roll Joe Biden out to the public 78 days since the last press conference, he had no wins to talk about. They had him out there after he lost everything. There was nothing that he won on. They could've put them out a month ago before his bills are voted on and maybe get ahead of it, they didn't do that. They put him out there after he had nothing to go on and when he was a lame duck and that's why all of the questions yesterday had very tough answers.",

Like what do you want to emphasize, what do you care about most, and that can trickle down to the attorney general and others. Also, they will weigh in on lots of other things that have nothing to do with the federal government on local issues, why not this one? And then you have the real, the very real issue that Americans are showing concern about crime in the top five issues that they are worried about. And when you have over a third, just a third of the country saying that the White House understands problems that they are worried about, that becomes an untenable from a political standpoint. Because Republicans are going to be talking about crime, because that's what people cares about them because it needs to be talked about. So, it's untenable that the Democrats are just going to say, this is a local issue and walk away, because everybody can draw a straight line from Democratic donors to these progressive district attorneys and everyone is starting to get a real clear sense as to what the outcome is of that.

They are on the wrong -- they are on the side of the criminals as long as they support progressive policies, this is only going to get worse, but they can't switch sides, because then they are on our side and they don't want to be on our side.

Nobody at home last night cared about the voting bill or Russia, they wanted to hear about kill -- the deaths how you are going to fight this weird explosion in crime.

They don't want the president on the United States on their bad side, they will tighten things up. Everybody works the phone if you are the president. LBJ, Bush 41, Trump famously, would burn up the phones talking to party allies either just shooting the breeze, talking shop, you know, or talking politics. Barack Obama used a hop on the phone with Kamala Harris when she was the A.G. of California and talk all the time. He actually did say that she was the best-looking attorney general in the country, so maybe that did cross the line with Michelle, but he is not prejudicing or proceeding or giving one-sided tactical advantage in a case by calling the district attorney. That's like a fake ethical strawman they are just throwing up so they don't have to dive into this thing.

      "utterance": "Well, one thing that's pretty interesting is that Savannah Guthrie over at the Today show, that was her first question too, right? It's like, what did he mean when the elections will be illegitimate? Are you saying that what President Trump said about 2020 which you disavowed, because you say that the 2020 election was legitimate, good, OK, fine. Let's -- let's maybe I'll try to agree on that, or some agree on that. I agree with that. Well, then, are you saying that this next one is not going to be? Because what? What are the specifics, they've never laid that out. And so, then you have the press secretary have to come out and say, actually no, what he was saying is this and I can't even remember what her tweet said, but I can imagine that the White House communications team as soon as he said that thought, OK, that's -- there is one thing that we are going to have to deal right away. That issue is not going to go away. Because it wasn't just Kamala Harris that said what she said. Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina said it as well. So, go get ready, buckle up, everybody, we are going to have a big fight again about legitimacy of elections without specifics of concerns. They are -- the Democrats are expected to lose big time, a lot of seats in this midterm election. And not just in the midterm for Congress, but we are talking about state houses, state races, things like that. So, are they -- Democrats trying to set it up that if they lose those elections aren't legitimate? Where have we heard that before? And where did that really like, screw things up for everybody? I thought, so there was that. There's just one other thing. I think the mop up that was a pretty big deal, and that was the minor incursion are going to possibly be OK now by the Biden administration? Excuse me, last night they had to have a national security official, I think it was probably Jake Sullivan get on the phone and tell everybody, actually that's not what he meant. But that is exactly what our adversaries and our allies heard when you saw Zelensky put a notion -- note today that they are trying to walk it back. That was a big blunder."

      "utterance": "Well, first off, I have to say that I look great in the studio. Anyway, yes, you thought the Exxon Valdez needed to cleanup, Joe was like, hey, hold my Ensure. I'm going to use a booze analogy, you got to compare. Every -- we are in the state where we kind of -- we always have to compare Joe Biden to the guy before him. Right? And Trump is kind of like was an everyday presence, so we built up a tolerance, and he would come out and he would speak he was like a nightly martini we got used to it. But Biden he is like a guy he didn't drink for a year and then he comes out and he binges for two hours and now we all we all have a Biden hangover. I mean, I'm as confused as I am after that happened. I think the big mistake was they thought going -- going long, going long would address the questions of mental fitness, but instead it revealed the fogginess as Van Jones pointed out the confusion and also the crankiness that came later that you pointed out. It's like again, I mean, another analogy, it's like a classic car that's been sitting in the garage. You don't immediately drive it across the state. You know? You drive it down to the diner five miles down the road. That's Joe's speed. But I always -- I got to defend him. It's not his fault. I mean, he didn't make himself president, the Democratic Party did. It's 2022 and I still can't believe Joe Biden is president. He has been around my entire lifetime and he is president now after running I don't know, 13 times. The bottom line though, if there was very little time spent on American concern, it was spent on media concerns. And that was the bogus voting bill and Russia. Meanwhile, Americans just wanted to hear about law and order and getting food on their table, it's like they order steak and the Democrats keep delivering them tofu."

      "speaker": "GERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE",
      "utterance": "I think the criticism is a bit harsh of the president. I thought it wasn't that bad. He did make that awful blunder about the minor incursion in Ukraine which kind of made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, you know, and some of his other language was kind of meandering. I do agree with that. But I also think that he showed incredible stamina for an old guy. I admire the fact that he was on his feet for two hours answering some very hostile questions including some, one from our former colleague James Rosen that was so insulting. He asked the President of the United States, you know, are you -- are you mentally incapable of holding your office? I mean, can you imagine James Rosen or anyone else asking Ronald Reagan that? I thought it was very, very rude. He cleaned up the Ukraine, I think that the good thing about the Ukraine is that he made it clear that he wasn't drawing a red line, that we weren't committing ourselves to war in Europe if there was a further Ukrainian incursion by the Russians, thank God for that, because there are so many hawks in Washington, I could just see them all beating the drum, come on, let's send the 101st airborne, the 82nd airborne to Ukraine right now. I'm glad that he didn't go that far. What he did do was unfortunate and I think that it was a slip, because not because it was false, but because I believe it was true. I think that it is a U.S. policy that if there is a minor incursion, they are not going to go nuclear in terms of the sanctions. But you know, you should not think out loud especially in that context, Jesse."

    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "First of all, the question about mental acuity was asked because half of the country including a number of independents in the latest A.P. poll had various serious concerns about Joe Biden's mental ability to hold the job. So, the question being asked was for a reflection of what people are saying to people calling him on the phone and asking about the president and the job that he is doing. But when it comes to the press conference yesterday, they rolled out everybody. They rolled out Nancy Pelosi, as we said the vice president and everybody had a problem and wasn't on the same page with exactly what they were saying and what the message was. In terms of what they said today, Jen Psaki said during the press briefing, that foreign leaders are happy that a person who respects democracy and alliances is back in the White House. Well, then you touch on the two issues that were the main problems yesterday in the press conference. Domestically, the president is now questioning the democracy and the legitimacy of elections. And in foreign policy, our alliances are all over the place. Europe and NATO don't know what they are going to do if Ukraine is invaded. The Ukrainians are very worried about what the United States is or isn't going to do. And the bottom line is there's been no deterrence. This didn't happen to President Trump because there was deterrence. And Putin sees an opening here to do something. And also, the last thing, is that because they waited so long to roll Joe Biden out to the public 78 days since the last press conference, he had no wins to talk about. They had him out there after he lost everything. There was nothing that he won on. They could've put them out a month ago before his bills are voted on and maybe get ahead of it, they didn't do that. They put him out there after he had nothing to go on and when he was a lame duck and that's why all of the questions yesterday had very tough answers."

You can support the police, but if the system doesn't work together with the prosecutors to have charges and keep these guys in jail, they get out and murder young women while they are at work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So, from her perspective, right, this is apparently at the president's position, this is what he has told her, and that's going to be his position. I think it's untenable for two reasons, both political and policy. First on the policy side of things, the White House absolutely does set a tone and an agenda for what is prosecutorial emphasis. Like what do you want to emphasize, what do you care about most, and that can trickle down to the attorney general and others. Also, they will weigh in on lots of other things that have nothing to do with the federal government on local issues, why not this one? And then you have the real, the very real issue that Americans are showing concern about crime in the top five issues that they are worried about. And when you have over a third, just a third of the country saying that the White House understands problems that they are worried about, that becomes an untenable from a political standpoint. Because Republicans are going to be talking about crime, because that's what people cares about them because it needs to be talked about. So, it's untenable that the Democrats are just going to say, this is a local issue and walk away, because everybody can draw a straight line from Democratic donors to these progressive district attorneys and everyone is starting to get a real clear sense as to what the outcome is of that. You had today, guess what, right before we came on the air, the new attorney here in New York, attorney Bragg, he said disavowing the memo that he wrote the other day, didn't want people to misunderstand what he meant trying -- withdrawing it."

They don't want to talk about violent crime because it's on them. When you are talking about the radicals, that's their side. So, to paraphrase Joe Biden, they are on the wrong side. They are on the wrong -- they are on the side of the criminals as long as they support progressive policies, this is only going to get worse, but they can't switch sides, because then they are on our side and they don't want to be on our side. Geraldo was right, you know we've learned that politics, most politicians they can't do two things, right? So, when they are like, they are obsessed with impeachment, you know, COVID just takes off. It was the same month, and now what they are doing is they obsess over this sham of a voting bill, again, Geraldo is right on that when in fact you have crime exploding. Nobody at home last night cared about the voting bill or Russia, they wanted to hear about kill -- the deaths how you are going to fight this weird explosion in crime. They can't do woke politics and fight crime, because woke politics is antithetical to crime. It is -- it is -- to fight in crime. It believes that the criminal is in fact the victim to a larger society, and that we are in fact the oppressors. So, it will never change until the Democratic Party learns to deal with the toxin in their own group."

They could have a nice private conversation, Joe Biden and Krasner and Garson and Bragg and say, guys, not only are people getting killed, you are killing my popularity. This crime wave is killing me politically, so tighten it up and we'll get this thing under control. These D.A.s have political aspirations. They don't want the president on the United States on their bad side, they will tighten things up. Everybody works the phone if you are the president. LBJ, Bush 41, Trump famously, would burn up the phones talking to party allies either just shooting the breeze, talking shop, you know, or talking politics. Barack Obama used a hop on the phone with Kamala Harris when she was the A.G. of California and talk all the time. He actually did say that she was the best-looking attorney general in the country, so maybe that did cross the line with Michelle, but he is not prejudicing or proceeding or giving one-sided tactical advantage in a case by calling the district attorney. That's like a fake ethical strawman they are just throwing up so they don't have to dive into this thing. I went out on the streets to shoot a package for Primetime that you can see on the little bottom right of your screen for Monday. Everyone I talk to and I said, what do you want me to cover on Primetime? They said crime. Every race, creed, or colors said they want you to talk about crime. And the problem with Joe Biden he is not tapped into the emotional current of this country. Imagine Trump as president and they have like these high- profile homicides, people being pushed to death in a subway in New York or in L.A. getting slashed, the two biggest cities in the country back-to-back crime like that, Trump would be out there holding a press conference. He'd be calling their parents on the phone and Biden is just out of touch."

So, Joe is right when he says he outperforms his expectations because they were so damn low. Geraldo was grateful 20 minutes ago that the guy was standing. So, all everybody expected from Joe was like no tweeting like the old boss. Please don't bomb Texas after you drink too much Nyquil. No one, no one has ever been elected with such low expectations. Yet at the same time, he failed the low expectations because the science of human relations shows that the more you know someone, the worse they are. So, when he was in the basement chained to a rusty solo flex, we didn't think he was so bad. But then as he started climbing up the stairs and walking around, the more you saw them, the less you thought of them. So, he's really the first candidate that they were right?

So, you know, these teachers have no agenda to actually educate children for the future. They're not, you know, focus on math and science and getting everybody a better future by making sure that they know how to do those things. Instead, they're focused on pitting people against each other to satisfy their own leftist ideology, which is anti-American.

And because the neighbors -- they now have to remove it. They also have to pay the couple $565.00 for every year the device was installed. Do you think that's right?"

Today is my favorite film director's birthday, David Lynch. There he is. He turned 76. He was -- he was nominated for an Oscar for my favorite movie of all time, Blue Velvet. And he's done a bunch of other great movies. But he's also known for amazing hair, probably the greatest hair of any director. So, I thought I would try, inspired by David Lynch, do it with my hair, and I don't think I even come close."

We used to say we're brothers from another mother. Tony told me about the very inspirational documentary done by the terrific illusionist Criss Angel. And it's about his seven year old son Johnny's successful fight against pediatric cancer. Criss and his wife Shaunyl hope to raise awareness and money for other kids with pediatric cancer. If you'd like to learn more about this story, I tweeted out more information and a link to the documentary @GeraldoRivera. Check it out on Twitter."
