We are doing things that nobody ever thought was possible, and we've just started. It's just the beginning, believe me.   You know, in the boy scouts, you learn right from wrong, correct? You learn to contribute to your communities, to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. You pledge to help other people at all times.  In the scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your best and to do your duty to God and your country.  And by the way, under the Trump administration, you'll be saying: \"Merry Christmas,\" again when you go shopping, believe me. Merry Christmas!   They've been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. You'll be saying Merry Christmas again, folks. But the words: duty, country, and God are beautiful words. In other words, basically what you are doing is you are pledging to be a great American patriot.   For more than a century, that is exactly what our boy scouts have been. Last year, you gave more than 15 million hours of service to helping people in your communities. Incredible! That's an incredible stat. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service by the end of this jamboree, 100,000. When natural disaster strikes, when people face hardship, when the beauty and glory of our outdoor spaces must be restored and taken care of, America turns to the boy scouts because we know that the boy scouts never, ever, ever let us down.",

The President started the day with this tweet earlier, asking why the beleaguered A.G., as you see in the text of this, is not digging into Hillary Clinton and her ties to Russia. Then on Air Force One later this evening, Anthony Scaramucci said that Trump and Sessions need to \"speak and determine what the future of the relationship is.\" So, you're going to hear in a moment from Laura Trump who is head of the Trump reelection effort on Mr. Sessions' fate in a moment as well so stick around for that, but what about the question of Robert Mueller? The President also continues to put periodic doubt into whether or not he believes that the Special Counsel has conflicts of interest that may make a case to remove him. So is the President putting the old band back together at the White House?  Rudy Giuliani was spotted on a flight today to D.C. He has shut down some of those discussions, but there are also reports that Newt Gingrich may take a bigger role. So, he's here in a moment live on THE STORY tonight. But first, Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry, who has been watching the Boy Scouts' Jamboree with me live in New York tonight. It's never boring in the Trump White House.",

      "sentences": "No, not at all. Good to see you, Martha. What's interesting is that in the last 24 hours, the President has pulled no punches aimed at friend and foe alike. Today, as you mentioned tweeting against the former opponent he still calls \"crooked Hillary\" and offered a new nickname for one of the many Democrats investigating Russia, \"sleazy Adam Schiff,\" he said. But the Commander-in-Chief, who today, also rallied support for the efforts to repeal and replace by declaring Republicans have not done their job and may end up feeling the wrath of voters. Now, seems to be also getting restless with some key members of his own staff and cabinet. Important to note: talk of the demise of top aide like Steve Bannon, and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has been predicted by the mainstream media, practically, since hour one of the administration, and they are still standing. But various officials, suggesting us, these two one-time rivals now becoming friends by default, trying to figure out how to survive. Remember, by bringing in Anthony Scaramucci, the President overruled both Bannon and Priebus. Political reporting, that while Bannon used to be in the oval office most the day, he now spends hour after hour, camped out at Priebus' conference table. Axios' reporting that previous, \"Reince has very few true allies inside the building; at this point, they don't stretch much further than his personal assistant and then Republican National Committee holdovers on the press team.\"  In fact, a source close to the President told me: the key here is in recent days, President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has increasing become a sharp critic of Priebus in private. So, watch that. Meanwhile, two officials at the State Department insisting to Fox tonight, there is no truth to a CNN report that Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, is thinking about leaving by the end of the year. Though one of these sources admits, Tillerson has been very frustrated in the Post.  Meanwhile, the speculation all over the map, as you said about Jeff Sessions. After that beleaguered tweet, one rumor claiming Rudy Giuliani was replacing him. The former mayor insisting no, he's not interested in the job, and in fact, he agrees with Session on the decision to recuse himself from the Russian investigation. Then social media going nuts with another rumor, that Sessions was spotted at the White House -- maybe he resigned at lunch. Our Justice Department Producer, Jake Gibson, reporting actually Sessions met with the White House Counsel, Don McGhan, and the House Secretary, Tom Price, on health care issues. So, the bottom line here, Martha, yes, there are still a lot of speculation about who's in and who's out, but we've been hearing this month after month and the President has still remained firmly in control, and very few of these rumors and all the rest have really panned out.",

One of the people that actually have raised the issue of the conflicts with Mueller, I think his appointment was a mistake by Rod Rosenstein because of his history with Comey. But more importantly, he interviewed for Comey's job, and that probably should've taken him off the list. But these conflicts in terms of appointing people that made contributions are not going to be successful at the Department of Justice. They're not the grounds for that type of radical change. They're allowed to make those political contributions. I'm astonished that he picked people that made large political contributions. You can throw a stick on any corner in D.C. and hit 20 lawyers. It seems to me that Mueller could've picked people that were not so politically involved. But having said that, you're not going to see a change, I think, through the Department of Justice. Now, when you're talking about firing Mueller, he could probably do that. It would put them in the biggest jam since Taft got stuck in the White House bathtub. I mean, it is a really bad idea.   Because think about how this would work, Martha. He couldn't talk to Sessions because he recused himself. He would go to Rosenstein who appointed Mueller and says fire him. Rosenstein presumably would say no, and he would either be fired himself or resign. Then, the President would have to find a sort of Bob Fork, who's willing to do what Rosenstein wouldn't do. You could go through that leadership having resignation after resignation. In the meantime, people would cite that as a basis for impeachment. They would move to try to pass the Independent Counsel Act. It wouldn't end this. It would prolong it.",

I can't believe that he was interviewed for Comey's job and the President didn't talk about his firing of Comey or what he wanted in Comey's replacement. That means that he's holding material information to his own investigation. That's a very odd person to select as special counsel. So, the President could very well be right about that.

You know, he has told the committee everything he knows. He's handed over all the documents he has. And you saw the same thing happen with my brother-in-law Don Jr. You know, he put out on Twitter the entire e-mail back and forth, because transparency is very important to us.

Donald Trump did run on putting people back to work. Especially in some of these, what we call flyover states. States that have been economic despair and lost a lot of jobs, but since he came to office he's done basically nothing about it. So Chuck Schumer was very smart in putting together this plan.

Though one of these sources admits, Tillerson has been very frustrated in the Post. Meanwhile, the speculation all over the map, as you said about Jeff Sessions. After that beleaguered tweet, one rumor claiming Rudy Giuliani was replacing him. The former mayor insisting no, he's not interested in the job, and in fact, he agrees with Session on the decision to recuse himself from the Russian investigation. Then social media going nuts with another rumor, that Sessions was spotted at the White House -- maybe he resigned at lunch. Our Justice Department Producer, Jake Gibson, reporting actually Sessions met with the White House Counsel, Don McGhan, and the House Secretary, Tom Price, on health care issues. So, the bottom line here, Martha, yes, there are still a lot of speculation about who's in and who's out, but we've been hearing this month after month and the President has still remained firmly in control, and very few of these rumors and all the rest have really panned out."

      "utterance": "It's very difficult. One of the people that actually have raised the issue of the conflicts with Mueller, I think his appointment was a mistake by Rod Rosenstein because of his history with Comey. But more importantly, he interviewed for Comey's job, and that probably should've taken him off the list. But these conflicts in terms of appointing people that made contributions are not going to be successful at the Department of Justice. They're not the grounds for that type of radical change. They're allowed to make those political contributions. I'm astonished that he picked people that made large political contributions. You can throw a stick on any corner in D.C. and hit 20 lawyers. It seems to me that Mueller could've picked people that were not so politically involved. But having said that, you're not going to see a change, I think, through the Department of Justice. Now, when you're talking about firing Mueller, he could probably do that. It would put them in the biggest jam since Taft got stuck in the White House bathtub. I mean, it is a really bad idea. Because think about how this would work, Martha. He couldn't talk to Sessions because he recused himself. He would go to Rosenstein who appointed Mueller and says fire him. Rosenstein presumably would say no, and he would either be fired himself or resign. Then, the President would have to find a sort of Bob Fork, who's willing to do what Rosenstein wouldn't do. You could go through that leadership having resignation after resignation. In the meantime, people would cite that as a basis for impeachment. They would move to try to pass the Independent Counsel Act. It wouldn't end this. It would prolong it."

      "utterance": "So, I just want to put up on the screen a quote from President Trump, and this was in the New York Times interview that he did a Friday ago. He said, \"We were interviewing replacements at the FBI. Did you know, Mueller, was one of the people that were being interviewed? The next day he's appointed Special Counsel. Talk about conflicts?\" The President said. \"There were many other conflicts that I haven't said, but I will at some point.\" That's a loaded statement."

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, frankly, Mr. President, you should just tell us. But I happen to agree with him that Mueller's selection was highly problematic. Mueller, on some level, is a witness. I can't believe that he was interviewed for Comey's job and the President didn't talk about his firing of Comey or what he wanted in Comey's replacement. That means that he's holding material information to his own investigation. That's a very odd person to select as special counsel. So, the President could very well be right about that. But in terms of firing Mueller, they would bring a great deal of hurt down that mountain and it would not be to the advantage of his administration."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He's also made it very clear that he doesn't want this investigation to start going into areas where he feels are not the purview of the Russian investigation. And that's something I know his lawyers are watching very closely as well. Jonathan Turley, thank you very much. Always good to see you, Jonathan. So, President Trump's son-in-law and Senior Adviser, Jared Kushner, met Senate Aides today, in a closed-door hearing. Tomorrow, he will do the same with members on the House side.

You examine a witness, you cross-examine the witness, you look for corroboration or contradiction. You don't use anonymous sources and selective leaks and prejudge the outcome. So, what's happening tomorrow, us interviewing a witness, is exactly what we should be doing. His statement is helpful, it provides a road map. I have additional questions both based on what he said and things that were not said in his 11-page statement. But for those who are not used to seeing the way investigations are supposed to be run, this is how they're supposed to be done."

      "speaker": "GOWDY",

What he said was, I didn't know what the meeting was about, and soon as I got into it I realized I'm in the wrong place. So, he said two separate e-mails saying can you please call me, so I can have an excuse to get out of this meeting. So, that's what I mean by corroboration. The fact that he didn't remember the name of the Russian Ambassador until November the ninth, that is corroboration. That's what you are looking for in an investigation, a statement that is either corroborated or contradicted. In this case, it's corroborated."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. The moment that you just talked about is he called the Russian embassy and said what is the name of the Russian ambassador because he was trying to put together his notes and all these forms. He also pointed out that he had a couple of, you know, sort of, he describes them as sort of chance meetings along the way. But he said I was invited to have lunch at this Ambassador and not just talking about his interactions with Russians, he's talking about all the foreign people who reached out to him when his father-in-law was elected. You know, does that whole argument hold water? He says I didn't put any of those in the forms that got pulled too early, so I went back and corrected them all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, we're going to ask him about that tomorrow. He said, it was inadvertently sent and he corrected it the next day. If you look at the other -- we have his call list, if you look calls he was going to make, it was to representatives of lots of different countries. So, that's why you need the documents. That's why you have to have the back and forth with the witness. That's why you don't let California Congressmen prejudge the outcome of investigations. That's why we're talking to him tomorrow. So, if there is a benign explanation, or if the Democrats want to assert a less than benign explanation, tomorrow is the day to do it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Because Members of Congress cannot behave themselves in public settings. And every serious investigation, you can't think of one that's not done behind closed doors. You don't have a clue who Bob Mueller is talking to. I don't know who he's talking to. You're not supposed to know. You don't know who that sheriff in your home county is talking to about the latest arm robbery. Serious investigations are done without time limits, and frequently without the political posturing that you see in this town. I mean, stop and think, Martha. We have anonymous sources. We have selective leaks. And then, we have Members of Congress prejudging the outcome of the investigation. That's why this is not serious. So, praise the Lord that we're actually doing one thing tomorrow that very vaguely resembles a serious investigation. No time limits behind closed doors."

    {
      "speaker": "L.TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that was up to Jared. Listen, you're right, Jared has never sought out of the limelight. He's a very humble individual, but he played a big role in the campaign. He obviously, played a huge role in the administration. And I think for the entire family, this whole notion that there was any collusion with Russia is so ridiculous. Jared, wanted to clarify and be as transparent as possible, which is exactly what you saw happen today. And I think he did a great job of that. You know, he has told the committee everything he knows. He's handed over all the documents he has. And you saw the same thing happen with my brother-in-law Don Jr. You know, he put out on Twitter the entire e-mail back and forth, because transparency is very important to us. And so, I really commend both of them for the fact that nobody used bleached it. Nobody deleted emails. Nobody destroyed, you know, cell phones with hammers. We are being very upfront with this because we want the world to know that there was no collusion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, I would disagree with that. I think we're very cohesive as a family unit. And I think, you know, listen, it does feel like the world is against us right now, but we're all standing strong. And sure, people may have different lawyers, but we are all the same family. We worked incredibly hard, Martha, on this campaign, and you actually heard it right there from Jared. You know, the idea that there was anything other than the President's message than the fact that he ran a better campaign, that he was a better candidate, that won this election for him is quite frankly insulting to the American voters. Because what they saw in him is what we see today in him as President that he's leading this country, and you know, we are finally going the right direction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this because we're seeing some shuffle. We saw Sean Spicer leave last week. You've got a new Director of Communications in Anthony Scaramucci. Is there feeling among the family that the people who were loyalists during the campaign deserve a more front row seat to the President? That they deserve to be on the team and that some of these more establishment folks, for lack of a better description, may be or not serving him that well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",

And Sean Spicer is an incredible guy, and he did a great job, but he felt like maybe someone else could carry that message better. And so, you know, whether it's a person who is incredibly loyal to the campaign or just a different individual, Donald Trump wants what works for him for this country."

I think he could've done things differently himself, but I think, you know, that remains to be seen what happens with him. But what I will tell you is -- my father-in-law is a very loyal individual, and he is very loyal to people who are loyal to him. And when he feels like somebody isn't doing a good job or is not being loyal, he's going to correct that. And I think that's what we've seen in the White House so far."

So, let's start there. Do you think that his days are numbered?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "No, I'd be very surprised. Look, Sessions was the first Senator to endorse Trump. I remember the very first meeting that I went to, which he had Don McGahn hosted but Jeff Sessions chaired it when almost no one was for Trump in Washington. Sessions stayed with Trump when he was ten points behind during the whole taping of the conversation, you know, about sex and all that stuff. Jeff Sessions has been loyal all the way through. Probably, you can make a good case he, shouldn't have recused himself, the President suddenly feels that way. But when you look at Jeff's overall contribution and you look at the work they're doing cooperating with Homeland Security on rolling up MS-13 gangs all over America, you look at what Jeff is doing taking on sanctuary cities and the liberal mayors who refused to protect their citizens from criminals. There's a lot of good in Jeff Sessions. And I think it would be a big mistake for the President to, in any way, do anything except move forward with him."

      "utterance": "Right. I think he thinks Jeff Sessions made a huge mistake. And I think he believes as a result of that, he's in this enormous fight with Mueller that would not probably have existed. So, he's got a strong case here. On the other hand, I would point out that loyalty is a two-way street. There's a point here where people have to say, the guy was with you from the very beginning, and he makes one big mistake, do you really dump them? And if you do, what signal do you send to everybody else on the team?"

There are discussions about maybe Rudy Giuliani, although he shut those down a bit today. And perhaps, you, coming into a more -- sort of outside role/inside role, are you going to take a bigger role in this administration in any way? I think Trump has felt -- the President has felt, very beleaguered. He talked about the beleaguered secretary -- I mean, attorney general. I think the President's felt beleaguered because frankly this thing is so totally screwed up, it is so one-sided, and it is such a witch hunt. That I'm also -- I'm totally sympathetic to the Trump position. I think it's absurd that the Republicans in Congress have not investigated the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton 33,000 e-mails, all of those things. You want to talk about Russian involvement, then, let's start with the Clinton Foundation. I think it's absurd that they haven't -- frankly, gone right at the deputy attorney general and said tell us what it is Mueller is investigating? He's supposed to have a law. There's supposed to be a crime that Mueller's investigating. Tell us what it is. I think that this thing is a witch hunt. I think the people that Mueller's hired are bad people.

The president said he's for it, Vice President Pence says he's for it, Senator Schatz and other senators says they're for it, so let's hope that that happens.

So the conventional wisdom is, oh, they wouldn't have the votes for it, even though they all voted for it just last congress. So, I say call it up, called the question, and sometimes in the light of day in front of God and everybody, people actually vote different than what they say before the actual vote happens.

So this message, which is very pragmatic, I won't say exactly moderate, but it is not a radical, Bernie Sanders, leftarian, these are useful talking points for Democratic house candidates that are running in the kinds of districts where they will need to win if they expect to have a reasonable shot at winning back the house next year."

You're going to raise the minimum wage, Adrian, as one of the tenants of this, increase health care in a number of ways as well, programs for jobs, that kind of thing. I don't think any of it is really revolutionary in terms of the idea that Democrats adhere to, but they lost so many of their, sort of, union, blue-collar workers in the last round. They need to try to get them back."

      "utterance": "Right. Look, I agree with Chris on this. This is a great message for Democrats, the advocating for -- part of what we have talked about in the resistance, this forms since Donald Trump has become president, is that we've actually have a forward thinking, positive message. Donald Trump did run on putting people back to work. Especially in some of these, what we call flyover states. States that have been economic despair and lost a lot of jobs, but since he came to office he's done basically nothing about it. So Chuck Schumer was very smart in putting together this plan. Again, I think anytime Democrats are talking about the economy and putting people back to work, that's a good thing."

      "utterance": "Sure. Well, you know, obviously, the big problem for Democrats is, is not that they quit giving that message, is that they've lost all credibility whatsoever in giving that message. And it's kind of humorous to sit here today and listen to Nancy Pelosi who's been trying to deliver this message for however long she's been in power now, and she's just trying to kind of reboot her own political career with new talking points. And people aren't buying it, and they haven't been buying it for the past eight years, since President Obama won his first election. And I don't think they're going to start buying it now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, we know Nancy Pelosi has not been a great selling point for some of the candidates in the course of the special elections that we saw campaigning against having her continue what was kind of a strong point for some of the Republicans who won those seats. This Washington Post story rolling across just a few moments ago, basically adds to what we talked about at the top of the show, which is that it doesn't look good for Jeff Sessions if you read -- not even so much between the lines of the tweets. They're pretty much right out there. The beleaguered A.G. was just one of them. And they you're talking about loyalty to the boy scouts, Chris, it looks increasingly like they're going to find a way to try to nudge him out or get him to resign, do you agree?"
    },

      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "What a humiliating, astonishing way to lay low Jeff Sessions, who -- whatever people think about him and congress, whether they agree with him or disagree with him in the senate, an honorable man, a loyal man, a man -- his love to the constitution for the country. He stood by Donald Trump. He put that hat on when everybody told him it was career suicide. You can't do this. He's no good. And that was when Trump was a long shot, couldn't win. To see the depredations of Jefferson, but regards Sessions, through this and his services as attorney general is a really sad thing. And it makes you understand why so few people really want to get in government and really want to get in public light because you might end up abused and used like Jeff Sessions has been."

He set himself, apparently, to a reporter today that he thought that Sessions made the right decision when he recused himself from the Russian investigation. That he's not in the running. Ted Cruz is the other name that surfaces in this article as a possibility to follow up in his position."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "And, of course, you know, the reasons that Jeff Sessions recused himself has nothing to do with his alleged ties to Russia, but the fact that he was a clear surrogate of the campaign itself. But I agree with Chris about -- Jeff Sessions is not and never has been a problem in Washington. The direction that President Trump has gotten from voters to come and clean up Washington, it's not about Jeff Sessions. Jeff Sessions is an ally, and it's unfortunate that he is kind of taking a wire brush to Jeff Sessions."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "Well, look, first of all, Attorney General Sessions, regardless of what you think about him, did the right thing by recusing himself in this investigation. And what is so deeply troubling to me, and many other Democrats, and many Americans in general, is the fact that Donald Trump simply has no regard for the way our justice system is set up. If he doesn't like the way somebody handle something, even if it's looking at an investigation independently, which, of course, what Bob Mueller is doing. And we're starting to look at him being attacked by Trump and his surrogates as being somebody who, in their view, is not credible to conduct an investigation that should be independent, he fires them. And that in itself is incredibly disturbing. Regardless of your party affiliation, everybody should be concerned that Donald Trump does seem to have a complete lack of disregard for our justice system."

We're now learning that up to 100 people may have been packed inside that sweltering truck. But the driver, James Bradley, Jr., claims that he did not know that anybody was being snuck into the country in his truck. So joining us now, criminal defense attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, on whether that excuse can hold up. I mean, Mark, this is just a tragically sad story. It was over 100 degrees in that truck, and apparently they were taking turns letting each other breathe through a hole that was in the side of the wall. I mean, it's just an excruciating story. But legally, what does it mean?"

So the question is what's your defense, I didn't know. OK. So then the burden, I think, falls on the government to prove that he did know. So what are the facts? Are any of the surviving immigrants saying that they have any contact with him at all? That he would have known. The physical truck versus the rig, is there any way that he knew or should have known that they were back there prior to him getting out at the Walmart and going to urinate, and then hearing all the screaming and then he opens it up? Is there a single witness that can say that he knew? I told him to traffic these people over here and I'd pay him for it. These are the questions that have to be answered. If you don't have that, then this is a reasonable hypothesis of innocence."

They got to put forth sufficient evidence to show that he knew, because right away he told investigators, I didn't know. So how does he know? You're convinced he should know because he should know what's back there. I'm not that convinced, Martha."

Clearly, they weren't remembering some of these, right? Hoping for a real race in the water like these great men versus wild sports matchups, like the time in 2013, when NFL player Devin Hester, actually, raced a real cheetah and won. And in ‘07, football player Chad Johnson took on a race horse and won. That's what we're talking about here. So Phelps wants a rematch. Can we build an impenetrable lane that maybe can make this happen? Send me your ideas on twitter. How can we see this happen in the water? We will see you back here at 7:00 tomorrow night.
