Whether it's Walter Lippman in the 50s or Bill Sapphire in the 90s or Walter Cronkite in the 70s. And I think Charles Krauthammer, achieved that status. You could agree or disagree with him, but you had to know what he said and you had to consider what he said. And I think, to a certain degree he was -- you know, it's interesting because he loved baseball so much. He was the national umpire, he called balls and strikes.  And in a world where there's so many people who -- you know, you're in one tribe or the other, you're on one side or the other, he had the courage of this intellect, the courage of his convictions, and you know, if he thought that Democrats were doing something wrong, he'd call it and when he thought people on his side of the aisle, conservatives were betraying what he thought were the right principles, he would call them out as well. It is a -- I think an incalculable national loss. And you know, we can talk about him personally, but I really do think it's a loss for the nation and there's nobody --",

But I mean, that's really the ability that anyone of us who writes or who watches what's going on in this world that's what you strive for, and Charles had it, and he had it because he was so brilliant and so incredibly smart. And sometimes the things that he would say would seem fairly simple. And you think to yourself -- you know, why did -- why didn't I say it that way? Because it just made so much sense. But the reason that he arrived at it in such a clear concise way was because he was Charles, and he was able to do that.

But one of the things that struck me when I would substitute for Bret and anchor, and he'd be on the panel is most of us are lucky if we think in phrases a few of us are good enough to think in sentences, Charles thought in paragraphs or even in pages. And I think part of it was because he had to form the thoughts in his mind. It wasn't easy for him to be on a computer or keyboard and noodle with a thought and that had a phrase here and take a phrase out here. So, that you would just -- he would -- you'd ask him a question and a mini- column would spill out perfectly phrase -- you know, logically, it's been tactically, and you would just almost have your breath taken away by the status of his intellect if he was quite astonishing. Now, you know we can talk about other things how funny he was, how irreverent he was, how had good company he was, but boy, I think do you have to -- when you start with Charles, and you assess the laws that has to be this extraordinary voice, this extraordinary intellect, which now we can read and we can remember but is lost to us in the future.",

I remember reading him every Friday, no matter what. And I was -- the first thing I went to, I didn't even bother with the front page even when I was Press Secretary, I didn't care what was on the front page of the paper. I wanted to see what Charles had written. I remember exactly where I read it. I would be -- it was about 5:45 in the morning and I would be reading it there before Peter took me down to the White House and we would go back and forth with it. Did you see how Charles smoked him today? You know, whoever it was that Charles was going after. And it was one of those moments at the kitchen island and I read this column. It was 2006 I believe and it was about the passing of his brother Marcel. And it's it still sticks with me. Years later I had the opportunity not just to work with him when I was at the White House but certainly when -- afterwards at Fox News. But in addition, I worked as a consultant to the publisher that he eventually did his book with and I had the idea for the book and I said you should do a collection.  Now, the publisher says, that'll never sell because it's Chris Wallace said usually these clips and paste jobs don't do that well. And I said no, trust me. He's different. He's a person that everyone shushes their children over when he's about to talk. And everyone wants it. And some -- I have to say Martha's, somewhat selfishly I wanted the book for my own collection. I wanted to have it. That book became a huge bestseller. And you know what, I didn't know until recently, I've forgotten, he actually read the book as well. He read the audiobook. And so, for people here listening tonight who might be younger, who might not have known the Charles Krauthammer over the decades as we did and learn from him, buy that book. Listen to it. I think that aside from George W. Bush, I learned more from Charles Krauthammer than anyone else in my life. And I tried to conduct myself in the way that as you too would describe it, I hear it in your voices as well, with integrity, honor, and also with joy. He loved his life and he would zoom into the White House in his van like Dale Earnhardt Jr. And when we have -- when we had him for lunch, he loved the hotdogs at the White House.

I would think he would think some of this was just too maudlin and he would want to be ironic about it. I've known Charles for a long, long time. I'll say a couple stories. I went to take my five-year-old son and our older son to a movie. I looked for a movie that would work you know, and it was Tom and Jerry, a cartoon. I went in there looked like a pretty empty theater. When the movie was over, lights went up my son and I were there and Charles was there with his son. That was it. In this movie Martha, Tom and Jerry cartoon, they had some shall we say adult situation and I was kind of shocked, Charles was too, and I remember he said we're the only paying customers and still they have to mistreat us. I mean, just classic, classic Charles. You're showing some pictures on some of these meetings. Charles's lunch has started as I remember with George Will and Meg Greenfield and the editor of the Washington Post up at the Chevy Chase Lounge on Connecticut Avenue and then that evolved and some other lunches. I was part of that lunch. We called ourselves the pariah lunch group. And it was Charles Murray, Charles Krauthammer, Pete Wehner, and myself. We were the pariah lunch group, because for one reason or another, each of us had a rough day at the office from time to time from the media. So we got together once every six weeks or so and talked, and talked, and talked about things high and low, things politically incorrect, whatever was on our minds. It was more fun and more laughter.  Again, that's the point that I want to make. If Charles was listening, he would say, come on you guys, you know, we had a lot of laughs, we had a lot of fun. You have shown a picture too of the chess game. He was a great chess player. He used to go to tournament to New York and watch the masters. He was just a student. He loved life.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you know, what it does as it stirs up feelings, emotions and memories and it gets kind of difficult but cutting through that is -- you know, I sat opposite Charles, so Charles would be the strong, conservative voice, and I would supposed to be his opposite on the liberal side on special report and we did this for more than 10 years. And sometimes we go out and then watch the nationals. We're both big baseball guys. But what strikes me as we were talking is, he was Jewish, and he had this strong sense of God. And not necessarily in the practice. So when we talk about God, imagine his intellect, then, applied to faith.  And so at this moment of his death, I think about the fact that he would say the one indisputable fact is there is a God. And you can go back and forth about Agnostic, Atheist, Catholic, Jewish, whatever, Muslim, but Charles was like, but no matter where you are in this conversation was much like a chess match because that's the way his mind works. It was a calculation. You got to acknowledge the presence of God. I remember once doing Sukkot with him, you know if you're young where you go out in a tent with the Jewish community, and there was Charles. And you know, he would had questions about the practice and all that. And he was telling me the history. Of course to get to that tent, we had to drive in his car. He pick me from home. And even to go to ball games. I would say to him, Charles, this is scaring the daylights out of me. You know, he is driving a car and he is fast.",

You think about, you know, Meg Greenfield and others who were his mentors. But you think, wait a minute, there is a tradition here in terms of leading conservative voices. William F. Buckley if you think back to the 1950s and standing up to things like, you know, so many of the negatives, but also developing conservatives thought at the time, you could come forward to Bill Safire or maybe Robert Novak in a different era. But I think for our era, there is no doubt that he was the leading conservative thinker. And for me, what an honor to be able to engage with him. Because he was not one to belittle, bully, or put down people. He wanted to argue with you, to play the chess game with you.  And so for me, it was quite a learning opportunity. And one filled with love, love not only for him but for his wife for Robyn, and let me tell you, you know, we just had father's days, his love for Daniel, overflowing. I mean, good guy.

I really enjoy the pictures in the videos of Bret Baier and him there. And he went with so many of his friends from \"Special Report\" to spend there throughout the entire season.

We were already good friends and we had all of those deep conversations that the general just described and Brit and all of your guests tonight and the ones that you have with him. And by the way, you've done an amazing job tonight, I don't know how you're getting through it. But I've really enjoyed all of these incredible recollections. And I was surprised. I was waiting to hear on something on high. Because Charles was a psychologist, a psychologist, a philosopher, a historian, a giant of an intellect as everyone said. But it was just this really interesting moment when he said that and he saw that I was kind of taken it back, and he said you just, you have to go along with the right. And so, it always stayed with me, and I was, I guess I expecting though there would be a righteous, peaceful end for him. And so I just really wasn't ready to accept that he could have an end with cancer because he had battled the great battle, and he had overcome, and he had taught everyone. And I read on the Internet tonight coming down here a letter that he had written someone's father who had spinal cord injury. And just like the general said, he shared his struggle with so many people going through similar struggles, he took the time. He gave them perspective and in this beautiful letter that I just read half an hour ago, he said, that it's possible to have a good life. And that you don't know it now, but I'm looking back, you are looking forward. And I want, you know, this is scant comfort, but I want you to know that there is a possibility for a good life and that you can reach for it. And he was so encouraging and so warm. And so it was interesting that he was stoic too. But that comes from the strength he built through the recovery from that -- from that experience. And then, around the other side of that, he just became this, you know, incredibly warm person once he realized how many lives I think he touched. He was such a people person as you know. I think when people first came across him, they, you know, saw this sort of professorial cool energy, but once you started talking to him you knew what a people person he was. He just delighted in different personalities and what was going on. Once in a while, he was definitely up for some gossip. He made us laugh, as everyone knows, sometimes just breaking us up on the set of Bret show in unexpected moments that really just sent me reeling. I just -- he was so droll and so hilarious. But you know, I struggled with that piece because I wanted to talk about all of the things that I want people to not only read about in the book, like you mentioned, but in Brit's special which is easily found on YouTube, it is an hour that will absolutely change your life. Staggering stories that will take your breath away and inspire you. And I want to include so many of those in the column but I got to 2,000 words or more and I started to have to hack it down. You know, his addiction to online chess, all of these incredible things about him. So, I just stuck with the stories that took place between the two of us. And how much you talk about parenting and how much he talked about dogs, and all, anyway, all of the things that he shared of just, Charles, the man.",

And I love that he says that his father has a treat because he loved the beach so much. And he wants his boys to have treat home on to summer. He would take them out of school early in Canada to bring them down to Long Island to be at their summer cottage and to set them free to go from baseball park to baseball park and all of the games that they made up together tan, salty, and just in the sun. And it really -- it's just, it will just take your breath away. It's really an amazing -- his memories of childhood in that's what he brought to fatherhood. I mean, his beloved Daniel who is his literally his physical mirror image looks exactly like him. When he spoke about Daniel, and just the honor of being a dad, I mean, it was almost with a somber reverence. It was so beautiful.

But I would argue that it's a national loss, and hear me out here for a second on this. I think, there are some people in the media who whether you agree with them or not, whether they're liberal or conservative, become such a central voice to the national conversation. Whether it's Walter Lippman in the 50s or Bill Sapphire in the 90s or Walter Cronkite in the 70s. And I think Charles Krauthammer, achieved that status. You could agree or disagree with him, but you had to know what he said and you had to consider what he said. And I think, to a certain degree he was -- you know, it's interesting because he loved baseball so much. He was the national umpire, he called balls and strikes. And in a world where there's so many people who -- you know, you're in one tribe or the other, you're on one side or the other, he had the courage of this intellect, the courage of his convictions, and you know, if he thought that Democrats were doing something wrong, he'd call it and when he thought people on his side of the aisle, conservatives were betraying what he thought were the right principles, he would call them out as well. It is a -- I think an incalculable national loss. And you know, we can talk about him personally, but I really do think it's a loss for the nation and there's nobody --"

But I mean, that's really the ability that anyone of us who writes or who watches what's going on in this world that's what you strive for, and Charles had it, and he had it because he was so brilliant and so incredibly smart. And sometimes the things that he would say would seem fairly simple. And you think to yourself -- you know, why did -- why didn't I say it that way? Because it just made so much sense. But the reason that he arrived at it in such a clear concise way was because he was Charles, and he was able to do that. And you know, one of the quotes in the piece that we just ran, Chris, with -- that Bret put together from Charles. \"You're betraying your whole life if you don't say what you think.\""

I would argue that his disability and most there were a surprising number of people who didn't even realize it, I think it actually aided that clarity of thought. I mean, that was inherent to him. But one of the things that struck me when I would substitute for Bret and anchor, and he'd be on the panel is most of us are lucky if we think in phrases a few of us are good enough to think in sentences, Charles thought in paragraphs or even in pages. And I think part of it was because he had to form the thoughts in his mind. It wasn't easy for him to be on a computer or keyboard and noodle with a thought and that had a phrase here and take a phrase out here. So, that you would just -- he would -- you'd ask him a question and a mini- column would spill out perfectly phrase -- you know, logically, it's been tactically, and you would just almost have your breath taken away by the status of his intellect if he was quite astonishing. Now, you know we can talk about other things how funny he was, how irreverent he was, how had good company he was, but boy, I think do you have to -- when you start with Charles, and you assess the laws that has to be this extraordinary voice, this extraordinary intellect, which now we can read and we can remember but is lost to us in the future."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And Charles put together both of those things -- you know, he became someone who was known for being on T.V. and you know, doing that, that dance that you just described. That great intellectual dance of being able to pull his thoughts together and so many people across the country -- you know, we're able to see him and watch him as he -- as he sort of put it all together out there. And I think, you know that, that made him a star, as Brit Hume said in -- as somewhat unlikely way. But it really was, I mean, all of us, anyone of us -- you know, he was always on \"SPECIAL REPORT\", but whenever I had him on my show, whenever he was going to be on the panel when we were travelling for political conventions and he would be part of the show, it was -- it was a treat, you know it's special. And people who, who watched just looked forward to seeing him so much. And I also think that he you know, was able to put together the human side of life and have an appreciation for you know, family and sports and all of those things that he talked about and things that matter which I think is just such a wonderful title to his book because isn't that really in life all of us have ever hoped to figure out the answer to right? And he wants to focus on those things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you're exactly right. And things that matter is such a perfect example because what are this was basically wasn't new essays, it was a collection of his old columns. And I remember when I first saw it, I said, this is just a clip job. It's a bunch of old columns. And then you read it and even if they were 20 or 30 years old, there was such clarity, there was such kind of timeless wisdom to them that you found yourself -- you couldn't wait to read the next column and unlikely as it was that he was a T.V. star, it was somewhat unlikely but that book became a huge bestseller and he reveled in the fact that it was at the top of the New York Times bestseller list week after week after week. And again there was this kind of timeless quality to what he said. It wasn't -- you know he wasn't just saying well, here's what happened today in Washington. There was a wisdom to it that that transcended the ups the downs, the new cycle, all the kinds of things that we talked about in Washington. It -- this was timeless. This was permanent.

And it was just his little dig at me like you know, I'm surprised that you're working on a Thursday or a Friday, Chris, and I think some shot back about you know, a little joke from a little man but we both -- we did enjoyed it. And the other thing is that we both shared a love for movies. And we would share movies and I'd say have you seen this, have you seen that? And one time I told him about a movie I'd gone to see called Borat a funny yes quite filthy movie and he went to see it and he then came back. I said, what -- did you like it? And he said yes I did. And then the next thing is he had a column about what a disgusting movie it was and how terrible it was. I said, Charles, I thought you liked it. He said, yes, but it was a good column too. So you know, he just was a delightful person to be around. And that was the wonderful combination. Yes he was this towering intellect, yes I think he was this really vital voice in the national conversation, he was also one hell of a good friend and just wonderful company.

Charles set the gold standard for us to live up to as journalists, to be that decent, right? To be -- and most of all and I think this is really the cornerstone of what made Charles and people said he -- I've heard people say this evening that he was the most influential center-right thinker in America. I will go farther. I will say that he was probably the most influential public intellectual of his generation. I don't think anybody before the very fact that he was conversant in both things, that he what he understood the language of the left, he understood the language of the right. And you know what, he never ever did ever made a straw man. He never put words in anybody else's mouth. He never assumed the worst about his adversary. He was fair-minded and that made him ultimately more convincing than anything else. What made Charles ultimately convincing was the fact that he was not giving you short shrift. He had heard you out, he had been appreciative of it and you were still wrong. And when he nailed you that way (INAUDIBLE)."

And you know we had -- we had a good sort of like scuffle back and forth and you know ended being good-natured and you know he liked that. He wanted to challenge everybody that he was talking to.

So -- and I always thought you know, when you listen to Charles and you hear him out and you listen to what you say, you just sort of think, at the end, yes, Charles is right.

I remember reading him every Friday, no matter what. And I was -- the first thing I went to, I didn't even bother with the front page even when I was Press Secretary, I didn't care what was on the front page of the paper. I wanted to see what Charles had written. I remember exactly where I read it. I would be -- it was about 5:45 in the morning and I would be reading it there before Peter took me down to the White House and we would go back and forth with it. Did you see how Charles smoked him today? You know, whoever it was that Charles was going after. And it was one of those moments at the kitchen island and I read this column. It was 2006 I believe and it was about the passing of his brother Marcel. And it's it still sticks with me. Years later I had the opportunity not just to work with him when I was at the White House but certainly when -- afterwards at Fox News. But in addition, I worked as a consultant to the publisher that he eventually did his book with and I had the idea for the book and I said you should do a collection. Now, the publisher says, that'll never sell because it's Chris Wallace said usually these clips and paste jobs don't do that well. And I said no, trust me. He's different. He's a person that everyone shushes their children over when he's about to talk. And everyone wants it. And some -- I have to say Martha's, somewhat selfishly I wanted the book for my own collection. I wanted to have it. That book became a huge bestseller. And you know what, I didn't know until recently, I've forgotten, he actually read the book as well. He read the audiobook. And so, for people here listening tonight who might be younger, who might not have known the Charles Krauthammer over the decades as we did and learn from him, buy that book. Listen to it. I think that aside from George W. Bush, I learned more from Charles Krauthammer than anyone else in my life. And I tried to conduct myself in the way that as you too would describe it, I hear it in your voices as well, with integrity, honor, and also with joy. He loved his life and he would zoom into the White House in his van like Dale Earnhardt Jr. And when we have -- when we had him for lunch, he loved the hotdogs at the White House. He loved to have hot dogs and it was just a real honor to know him."

Charles always filled the space with just the right number of words and the most acute words too. Our copy editors knew to check any change with Charles because he cared about every word. There was never much to change."

Chris Wallace talks about the Reagan Doctrine column which certainly holds up I think the Bush Doctrine one certainly does as well. If I could mention one other dimension of his life. Chris mentioned support and encouragement and I would say that as a mentor he was quite incredible and he didn't wait for you to come to him to ask for advice. In April of '09 after I left the White House, still trying to think of what I was going to do, he invited me to his office. And I went there and I thought I had sort of it all figured out. Now, he said he was a relapser in remission psychiatrist but boy could he asked penetrating questions about what you wanted to do in your life and he would help -- and he helped me so much. And I remember Shannon Bream, she was on duty as on the anchor desk on a Saturday and there was a terrorist attack. There was hardly anybody around. Charles Krauthammer came to the studio and was in the studio with her for six hours as she anchored that day helping her through it. He would always be so generous and I hope that we can remember that about Charles as well, to try to live his -- live our lives as he did."

Chris Stirewalt is still with us. Chris, I'm just looking at some of the -- there was an editorial recently written by Fay Vincent the former Commissioner of baseball. He said, \"Charles Krauthammer is one of my heroes. For years, my wife and I watch Fox News \"Special Report\" with Bret Baier where Charles softly delivered his insights on politics with impressive and often sardonic wit and intelligence. We grew to rely on his electronic companionship and political navigational skills. He knew where true north was pointed and although he could bite he seldom barked.

I have been thinking a lot lately about an evening I spent with him. We were in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention in 2016 and because of how things worked out, Charles was ready to get back to the hotel and it was time. He was -- he was worn out and we had to get back there. And he didn't want to wait for security to get back from where we were. And so we started to make our way through the arena and then out through this very long circuitous pathway that the Secret Service had set up that probably ended up traversing about a quarter -- a quarter to a half a mile. I want to tell you that no rock star in the history of rockstardom could have been more mobbed, more celebrated, more worshipped, more fond over than these Republicans.

      "utterance": "You bet it is. And everything that's been said is true. I'll just dissent a little bit in this and say that if Charles were listening and I expect he is, he would he would be a little uneasy. He'd say come on, guys you know, you're laying it on really epic. He had a great sense of himself and a fabulous sense of humor and sense of irony. I would think he would think some of this was just too maudlin and he would want to be ironic about it. I've known Charles for a long, long time. I'll say a couple stories. I went to take my five-year-old son and our older son to a movie. I looked for a movie that would work you know, and it was Tom and Jerry, a cartoon. I went in there looked like a pretty empty theater. When the movie was over, lights went up my son and I were there and Charles was there with his son. That was it. In this movie Martha, Tom and Jerry cartoon, they had some shall we say adult situation and I was kind of shocked, Charles was too, and I remember he said we're the only paying customers and still they have to mistreat us. I mean, just classic, classic Charles. You're showing some pictures on some of these meetings. Charles's lunch has started as I remember with George Will and Meg Greenfield and the editor of the Washington Post up at the Chevy Chase Lounge on Connecticut Avenue and then that evolved and some other lunches. I was part of that lunch. We called ourselves the pariah lunch group. And it was Charles Murray, Charles Krauthammer, Pete Wehner, and myself. We were the pariah lunch group, because for one reason or another, each of us had a rough day at the office from time to time from the media. So we got together once every six weeks or so and talked, and talked, and talked about things high and low, things politically incorrect, whatever was on our minds. It was more fun and more laughter. Again, that's the point that I want to make. If Charles was listening, he would say, come on you guys, you know, we had a lot of laughs, we had a lot of fun. You have shown a picture too of the chess game. He was a great chess player. He used to go to tournament to New York and watch the masters. He was just a student. He loved life. He loved to talk about so many aspects of life. We will miss him. But you know, we have his words, we have his words. And, his words mean so much. You have so much good videotape too."

I want to hear your elegant words earlier tonight talking about Charles and your friendship with him. Your thoughts as you listen to all of these folks weighing in. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you know, what it does as it stirs up feelings, emotions and memories and it gets kind of difficult but cutting through that is -- you know, I sat opposite Charles, so Charles would be the strong, conservative voice, and I would supposed to be his opposite on the liberal side on special report and we did this for more than 10 years. And sometimes we go out and then watch the nationals. We're both big baseball guys. But what strikes me as we were talking is, he was Jewish, and he had this strong sense of God. And not necessarily in the practice. So when we talk about God, imagine his intellect, then, applied to faith. And so at this moment of his death, I think about the fact that he would say the one indisputable fact is there is a God. And you can go back and forth about Agnostic, Atheist, Catholic, Jewish, whatever, Muslim, but Charles was like, but no matter where you are in this conversation was much like a chess match because that's the way his mind works. It was a calculation. You got to acknowledge the presence of God. I remember once doing Sukkot with him, you know if you're young where you go out in a tent with the Jewish community, and there was Charles. And you know, he would had questions about the practice and all that. And he was telling me the history. Of course to get to that tent, we had to drive in his car. He pick me from home. And even to go to ball games. I would say to him, Charles, this is scaring the daylights out of me. You know, he is driving a car and he is fast."

It was especially equipped for van and he would, he just had a new one made, in fact. But the big point, I think, from journalism, going back to people that we heard about. You think about, you know, Meg Greenfield and others who were his mentors. But you think, wait a minute, there is a tradition here in terms of leading conservative voices. William F. Buckley if you think back to the 1950s and standing up to things like, you know, so many of the negatives, but also developing conservatives thought at the time, you could come forward to Bill Safire or maybe Robert Novak in a different era. But I think for our era, there is no doubt that he was the leading conservative thinker. And for me, what an honor to be able to engage with him. Because he was not one to belittle, bully, or put down people. He wanted to argue with you, to play the chess game with you. And so for me, it was quite a learning opportunity. And one filled with love, love not only for him but for his wife for Robyn, and let me tell you, you know, we just had father's days, his love for Daniel, overflowing. I mean, good guy. There is a picture we just showed, Martha, where he's got Daniel on his chest."

There were people I've heard from tonight that I didn't know him that well. It turns out that he was an important factor in their life. He was a giant, Martha. This man was a giant. And of course it was his intellect, it was his courage. It was his unbelievable sweetness, which I think is, you know, he was overlooked, because he was so piercing and sharp in his writings and his analysis on television that you might, if you didn't know him, you might miss that. But people who did know him didn't miss it. And it was a powerful thing. It was touching.

He talked about how his older brother would always insist to the other guys that he hangs out with, that he wasn't going with them unless he could bring Charles. And Charles talked about how much that meant to him as a younger brother and how much he learned from hanging around with the older kids and that kindness, that obviously, you know, was so important to Charles as he dealt with other people in his life."

One thing that always struck me about him is, you know, dealing with this tragic illness that he had. I had soldiers reach out to me, three of them, over the last six years who had serious injuries like his. And the first time I approached Charles about it, because they wanted to talk to him. He said, of course. I would be more than happy. Here is a way that they can reach me. I said, Charles, I know you probably do a lot of this. He said, general, this goes on every month of my life. And he just dealt with that issue. And he said, I'm going to tell him something that they may not want to hear. And he said, -- he doesn't talk about this publicly, of course. And he says, I am going to tell them, the thing that enabled me to go on with my life and have a meaningful life, despite this tragic illness was a hundred percent acceptance of what happened to me. Without that acceptance and knowing that I will never walk again, I'm never going to be, I'm never going to be the previous Charles Krauthammer. I won't have any of that physically. But I'm not going to throw the rest of my life away mentally and emotionally, and spiritually because of it. He said, so that's what I'm going to tell them.

We were already good friends and we had all of those deep conversations that the general just described and Brit and all of your guests tonight and the ones that you have with him. And by the way, you've done an amazing job tonight, I don't know how you're getting through it. But I've really enjoyed all of these incredible recollections. And I was surprised. I was waiting to hear on something on high. Because Charles was a psychologist, a psychologist, a philosopher, a historian, a giant of an intellect as everyone said. But it was just this really interesting moment when he said that and he saw that I was kind of taken it back, and he said you just, you have to go along with the right. And so, it always stayed with me, and I was, I guess I expecting though there would be a righteous, peaceful end for him. And so I just really wasn't ready to accept that he could have an end with cancer because he had battled the great battle, and he had overcome, and he had taught everyone. And I read on the Internet tonight coming down here a letter that he had written someone's father who had spinal cord injury. And just like the general said, he shared his struggle with so many people going through similar struggles, he took the time. He gave them perspective and in this beautiful letter that I just read half an hour ago, he said, that it's possible to have a good life. And that you don't know it now, but I'm looking back, you are looking forward. And I want, you know, this is scant comfort, but I want you to know that there is a possibility for a good life and that you can reach for it. And he was so encouraging and so warm. And so it was interesting that he was stoic too. But that comes from the strength he built through the recovery from that -- from that experience. And then, around the other side of that, he just became this, you know, incredibly warm person once he realized how many lives I think he touched. He was such a people person as you know. I think when people first came across him, they, you know, saw this sort of professorial cool energy, but once you started talking to him you knew what a people person he was. He just delighted in different personalities and what was going on. Once in a while, he was definitely up for some gossip. He made us laugh, as everyone knows, sometimes just breaking us up on the set of Bret show in unexpected moments that really just sent me reeling. I just -- he was so droll and so hilarious. But you know, I struggled with that piece because I wanted to talk about all of the things that I want people to not only read about in the book, like you mentioned, but in Brit's special which is easily found on YouTube, it is an hour that will absolutely change your life. Staggering stories that will take your breath away and inspire you. And I want to include so many of those in the column but I got to 2,000 words or more and I started to have to hack it down. You know, his addiction to online chess, all of these incredible things about him. So, I just stuck with the stories that took place between the two of us. And how much you talk about parenting and how much he talked about dogs, and all, anyway, all of the things that he shared of just, Charles, the man."

And I love that he says that his father has a treat because he loved the beach so much. And he wants his boys to have treat home on to summer. He would take them out of school early in Canada to bring them down to Long Island to be at their summer cottage and to set them free to go from baseball park to baseball park and all of the games that they made up together tan, salty, and just in the sun. And it really -- it's just, it will just take your breath away. It's really an amazing -- his memories of childhood in that's what he brought to fatherhood. I mean, his beloved Daniel who is his literally his physical mirror image looks exactly like him. When he spoke about Daniel, and just the honor of being a dad, I mean, it was almost with a somber reverence. It was so beautiful. He always wanted to hear about my kids as if he was sort of their grandfather. I mean, he didn't know them. But he was just so interested in the journey of parenthood.

It was when he was in med school and trying to become a psychiatrist. And that he was required in his residency to attend group therapy and he hated it, so he skipped the sessions. And he got in trouble for it. And when he was wheeled in and when we was, you know, brought in to face the repercussions of this and take in order that he had to attend group. He said, I became -- I came into psychiatry to do with psychotics. I like the people who came into my office and tell me that they are John the Baptist. But this is the amazing thing about Charles, he loved psychotics. He loved people, he loved anyone who came up to him in a baseball park. I just sent an e-mail from someone who went up to tell him what a fan she was. One night at the Nats game, several years ago, and because his friend had canceled he had a free ticket and said just come sit in my extra seat. I mean, he just love people. It was an amazing gift that I think he knew that we reviewed him and almost, as you can hear from you guest tonight, and you know, Martha, really, he was the only person I know that really people worship him. And Charles Knew that. He knew that people really wanted to hang as a reward. But he wasn't doing it to make them feel good. He was doing it because enjoyed them as well."

      "utterance": "Yes. And as he said, if you don't really say what's on your mind in life and you don't say what you think, you are betraying who you are supposed to be. And you know, I think, in this moment, A.B., there is so much divisiveness that we talk about. And there is so much fighting that becomes ugly and judgmental and Charles was not like that. And I think if there's one thing that we need to remember perhaps in terms of bringing with him, to our lives, especially in this moment, is that."

      "utterance": "Yes. It's an incredible kindness and always placing himself and other people those who are suffering or struggling. And certainly, always in the political debate that everyone across the table or across the divide who might disagree with him was always a worthy debate partner. And he was never personal. Always respectful. And it's really an example for all of us. Now, and forever."

Full and complete with the great loves and great endeavors that make it worth living. I am sad to leave. But I leave with the knowledge that I have lived the life that I intended.\" A.B., thank you very much."

So \"Charles Krauthammer: His Words.\" That will be tomorrow night at 9 p.m. As you want to make sure to take that in tomorrow evening.

So that will be tomorrow night at 9 p.m. I would encourage all of you to read a little bit of Charles tonight and keeping with you and your hearts and in your prayers, and in his families as well.
