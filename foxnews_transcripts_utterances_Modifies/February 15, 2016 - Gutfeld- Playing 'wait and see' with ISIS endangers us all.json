Then by all means, call us.\" That's the logic and it's brought to you by the hyper-tolerant folks behind Islamophobia-phobia. This is not wait and see. It's wait and die. And it's not a moral stance, nor one that protects America. It's a stance that leads to the death of your loved ones. And it's not going to be small. It won't be San Bernardino and it won't be a machete attack. Thanks to the modern threesome of technology, bio-agents and suicidal ideology, the next attack could make 9/11 look like \"9 1/2 Weeks.\"  The sad part about this is, we need to wait for it, because it's the polite thing to do. What a White House. They want to criminalize war, even when ISIS won't play along.",
