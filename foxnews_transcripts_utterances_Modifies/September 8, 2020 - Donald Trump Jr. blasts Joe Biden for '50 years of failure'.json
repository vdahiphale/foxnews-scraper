      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Thank you. And welcome to \"Hannity\".  We begin tonight with the FOX News alert. The president just capped off a very busy day on the campaign trail, a huge, massive rally and crowd in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  Look at this crowd, look at Winston-Salem tonight. Take a long look and ask yourself -- by the way, that's not at all the video I wanted to show. How many p -- how many people feel this way -- you can run the other video -- about the week and the frail Joe Biden?  Because earlier, the president also delivered a speech in Jupiter, Florida, where he was also met by massive crowds. Meanwhile, Joe Biden spent today in his basement bunker doing nothing as per usual. We'll have that in a minute. Apparently, he needed to rest after a very rough weekend on the campaign trail -- more weird gaffes, more strange statements, more constant confusion. He looked like a masked deer in the headlights.  We're going to show you the very worst moments from this weekend of Joe Biden, coming up. Plus, we're going to bring you a critical warning that the rest of the media mob won't tell you about, and that is mail-in voter fraud. It is real. This coming from a Democratic operative who organized and coordinated mail-in ballot voter fraud in many previous elections.  And later, we have brand new disturbing video from this weekend's far left riots.   But, first, we start with a very important observation about the 2020 race, 56 days from now. As we speak, there is nothing that I could otherwise describe as what is a sickening, sick, ugly alignment among so many of the powerful elitist groups in this country. You got the Democratic Party there, 99.9 percent. You got weak Republicans, you know, the ones that always demanded, if you're a conservative, you got to suck it up and support their RINO candidates, the ones they preferred. You have all the deep state bureaucrats that desperately want Trump out, so they can return to their nefarious deeds. And then the 99.9 percent of the mob and the media, 99.9 percent. You got \"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Prost (ph),\" all the print media for the most part, nearly every single, solitary so-called cable news network, they're all fake news. Every broadcast channel, ABC, NBC, CBS.   And then you can add Hollywood snobs and elitists, and then you can add now many pro-athletes. They all speak in one voice. They're all working on the one goal. They all want one outcome on November the 3rd. They want to beat Donald Trump. Now, it's time for a HANNITY history lesson and what we call perspective because remember, I know for years have gone by fast, but the same exact thing was happening four years ago.  In 2016, same groups all lined up against Donald Trump. They laughed at Donald Trump's campaign. They mocked him from running. They all made the prediction, ha-ha, he can't win. Almost all of them said no chance of winning.   They orchestrated then the biggest smear campaign in history. You might remember some of this.",

This is the single most consequential election of our lifetime and the media, the mob, the Democrats, Hollywood elites and all of their allies, they're not telling you the truth.

In fact, as we speak, they are turning a blind eye to the obvious and serious concerns about -- let's be honest here -- the whole country is talking about it, they talk about it behind closed doors, Democrats even tell me. Media mob people even tell me.  Joe Biden's strength, his stamina, his alertness, and mental acuity, yeah, they're all worried about it. Just like the riots, oh, yeah. It's a myth, it's not happening. They are ignoring a walking disaster in Biden and they know it. They are so desperate to beat Donald Trump that they are willing to put this country literally in the position of supporting somebody that would be elected president that is weak, that is frail, that is obviously a candidate that is not up to the job, the hardest job in the entire world, president of the United States, leader of the free world.   For example, during one virtual event on Monday, Biden struggled mightily to answer a question without a teleprompter. Well, actually, with a teleprompter. Take a look.",

They act like reality is not happening. They have zero moral compass, intellectual honesty or curiosity. It is such a disservice to you, we, the American people. It is a dereliction of duty. Now, let's go back to the video I promised you earlier in the show. This is the president -- this is the crowd in North Carolina.  I want you to take a deep long, hard look at this video. We are going to keep running in total. Looked at this crowd and ask yourself, by the way, could Joe Biden ever get a crowd like this, this massive, this much energy on the ground?  Because if you listen to the mob and the media and you listen to Hollywood, and you read print and you watch fake news cable news and fake news broadcast news, they're corrupt to the core. They've been lying to the American people for four-plus years.  Biden's campaign staff even preselected reporters during last week's brief so-called press conference. Now, we all know why, the reason is obvious. When Biden goes off script, well, disaster ensues. He needs a teleprompter to answer questions. He doesn't know at times what office he's running for, what day of the week he is, he doesn't know what positions family members have had. Biden's daily struggles have become so bad that his former White House stenographer, well, he's now speaking out warning us telling us the truth. \"Washington Free Beacon\" pointing out that he is not the same Joe Biden that his mental acuity having deteriorated. He is not the only person by the way hiding from the press.  On Monday, his radical extreme to the left of even Bolshevik Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, could not be bothered to take a single question. Instead, keep looking at that crowd, she avoided reporters with one of her famous and awkward laughing fits. Let's look at this crowd. Look at that crowd. Ask yourself, can Joe Biden get that crowd in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, like the president did tonight? Looks pretty big to me. Anyway, watch Kamala.",

That would be called an enthusiasm gap.  In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a large gathering of Biden supporters like this anywhere. The contrast between the two campaigns is massive.

Now, I'm looking at tonight's crowds and today's crowd and I'm saying, Donald Trump Jr., I would say there's a lot of enthusiasm for your dad. DONALD TRUMP JR, AUTHOR, \"LIBERAL PRIVILEGE\": Well, it feels pretty good and it's sort of ironic that those are the same people that out of 150 million American Democrats, Joe Biden, who can't remember where he is 50 percent of the time, is the best they've got, Sean. It's -- honestly, it would be sad if it wasn't so scary for our country. What's going on in that campaign, the inability to articulate a thought, the inability to do events two days in a row without having to go back into his basement borough and hide -- and I don't mean to make light of cognitive decline as his stenographer has pointed out, and has so many other people have pointed out. All you have to do is go back and look at a tape of him in the Senate 20 years ago and realize it's not the same guy. I don't mean to make light of that. That's something that everyone, you know, has -- knows someone who is dealing with an issue like that. We're just not necessarily trusting that person with the nuclear codes. We're not trusting the person with our children's and our grandchildren's futures. I mean, that's what they are doing, doing it because Joe Biden is the perfect camouflage for the mainstream media to push their radical leftist agenda into Middle America. They can go to Ohio and Pennsylvania and say, Joe's moderate, look, it's moderate Joe. But you're not a moderate with his platform. You're not a moderate with the people he's chosen to surround himself with. So, it's a big lie.  But as to the enthusiasm gap, you're right, Sean, it was incredible. I was at the boat parade yesterday in Florida. It went for 20 miles. Every dock, every restaurant on the water had people, hundreds of them. Just look at my Instagram page, I mean, just cheering and screaming. You know, it's amazing. The Democrats are going to have to play a lot of games to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people with this one but they will. It's what they're doing. They're not bothering to staff up a ground game. They're not bothering with any of those things. What they're doing is they are staffing up lawyers so they can try to win this thing after Election Day, not on it.",

But since I'm not going to go riot or loot, I stayed at home. I didn't go to work. And I was able to look at Joe Biden's 50 years of failure. I was able to document all of these things that if Donald Trump did, they would be career ending. It would be over, whether it's the brain surgeries, whether it's the disastrous trade policies supporting NAFTA, TPP, China's permanent status in the World Trade Organization. Joe Biden, as a politician, he's probably done more damage to the American middle class and to American manufacturing than any other person alive. And yet, the media will allow him to run Middle America like he's going to be the savior. If he's going to be the savior of anything, Sean, why did he wait 50 years? Why didn't he do this already? That's the reality. When you have the mainstream media that refuses to actually be journalists and just wants to be activists, it creates a problem because all of the things that are Biden's major flaws, they don't have any interest in.

Some completely deny that fraud even exists. And, by the way, they are once again lying to you the American people, just like on Russia, just like on obstruction and quid pro quo Joe. Look at the Heritage Foundation, there have been 1,285 proven cases of voter fraud in America. Look at the state of New Jersey, one city councilman, three others, recently charged with a mail-in voter fraud scheme. Also, mail-in ballot fraud in North Carolina, that resulted in a new election. 2018, four cases of illegal mail-in voting schemes in Texas that caused two elections to be overturned. In Georgia's June primary, a thousand people illegally voted twice and the \"New York Post\" just conducted a shocking interview with the top Democratic operative who spent a career committing voter fraud, mail-in voter fraud as a matter of fact. Look at \"The Post\", quote, he not only changed ballots himself over the years, but led teams of fraudsters and mentored at least 20 operatives in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This is how you want the election decided because make no mistake this is exactly what the Democrats are now pushing for.

There's no accountability. There's no tracing or tracking on these ballots once they're collected. That's a real problem.

Another video appears to show one of the same agitators with the bullhorn harassing workers inside a McDonald's. Now, authorities in Pittsburgh, they're investigating all this. Remember, this is the behavior Biden, Harris, they wouldn't criticize. Democrats even ignored what's happening, denied it for months. This is the behavior of the anarchists, the mob, the media told you that didn't exist. Up in Rochester, New York, it gets even worse. Protesters there turned chaotic last Friday in response to troubling body cam footage being released in the Daniel Prude case. Again, look at your screen. Rioters descending onto a restaurant to harass innocent diners before later marching directly into neighborhoods, and according to reports, allegedly trying to enter an apartment building. It was a scene of complete lawlessness and total anarchy, you know, that's been going on over a hundred days now. And just breaking tonight, the city's entire police command staff, including the police chief, they are leaving. They're retiring. Can any of you blame these heroes?

Al Sharpton is sounding the alarm and having his election year conversion, 56 days out of an election.

AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST, \"POLITICS NATION\": You know, I got a lot of attention when I did the eulogy for George Floyd's funeral, but I also a month later preached a one-year-old kid's funeral in Brooklyn who was killed by a stray bullet.

There isn't a single Republican who holds statewide office here in California. The Democrats don't have just majorities in the Senate and the assembly, Sean. They've got super majorities. So Republicans don't even need to show up to go to work. And they've not invested in the power grid. Forget about building power plants and the idea of nuclear completely off the chart, and as a result, we have these brown outs, fuel prices are higher than they otherwise would be and guess who hurt -- gets hurt? The very low income people that these environmentalists claim that they care about. It's outrageous. And regarding 78 degrees, Sean, I live in Hollywood Hills.

The president just capped off a very busy day on the campaign trail, a huge, massive rally and crowd in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Look at this crowd, look at Winston-Salem tonight. Take a long look and ask yourself -- by the way, that's not at all the video I wanted to show. How many p -- how many people feel this way -- you can run the other video -- about the week and the frail Joe Biden? Because earlier, the president also delivered a speech in Jupiter, Florida, where he was also met by massive crowds. Meanwhile, Joe Biden spent today in his basement bunker doing nothing as per usual. We'll have that in a minute. Apparently, he needed to rest after a very rough weekend on the campaign trail -- more weird gaffes, more strange statements, more constant confusion. He looked like a masked deer in the headlights. We're going to show you the very worst moments from this weekend of Joe Biden, coming up. Plus, we're going to bring you a critical warning that the rest of the media mob won't tell you about, and that is mail-in voter fraud. It is real. This coming from a Democratic operative who organized and coordinated mail-in ballot voter fraud in many previous elections. And later, we have brand new disturbing video from this weekend's far left riots. But, first, we start with a very important observation about the 2020 race, 56 days from now. As we speak, there is nothing that I could otherwise describe as what is a sickening, sick, ugly alignment among so many of the powerful elitist groups in this country. You got the Democratic Party there, 99.9 percent. You got weak Republicans, you know, the ones that always demanded, if you're a conservative, you got to suck it up and support their RINO candidates, the ones they preferred. You have all the deep state bureaucrats that desperately want Trump out, so they can return to their nefarious deeds. And then the 99.9 percent of the mob and the media, 99.9 percent. You got \"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Prost (ph),\" all the print media for the most part, nearly every single, solitary so-called cable news network, they're all fake news. Every broadcast channel, ABC, NBC, CBS. And then you can add Hollywood snobs and elitists, and then you can add now many pro-athletes. They all speak in one voice. They're all working on the one goal. They all want one outcome on November the 3rd. They want to beat Donald Trump. Now, it's time for a HANNITY history lesson and what we call perspective because remember, I know for years have gone by fast, but the same exact thing was happening four years ago. In 2016, same groups all lined up against Donald Trump. They laughed at Donald Trump's campaign. They mocked him from running. They all made the prediction, ha-ha, he can't win. Almost all of them said no chance of winning. They orchestrated then the biggest smear campaign in history. You might remember some of this."

In fact, as we speak, they are turning a blind eye to the obvious and serious concerns about -- let's be honest here -- the whole country is talking about it, they talk about it behind closed doors, Democrats even tell me. Media mob people even tell me. Joe Biden's strength, his stamina, his alertness, and mental acuity, yeah, they're all worried about it. Just like the riots, oh, yeah. It's a myth, it's not happening. They are ignoring a walking disaster in Biden and they know it. They are so desperate to beat Donald Trump that they are willing to put this country literally in the position of supporting somebody that would be elected president that is weak, that is frail, that is obviously a candidate that is not up to the job, the hardest job in the entire world, president of the United States, leader of the free world.

Now, let's go back to the video I promised you earlier in the show. This is the president -- this is the crowd in North Carolina. I want you to take a deep long, hard look at this video. We are going to keep running in total. Looked at this crowd and ask yourself, by the way, could Joe Biden ever get a crowd like this, this massive, this much energy on the ground? Because if you listen to the mob and the media and you listen to Hollywood, and you read print and you watch fake news cable news and fake news broadcast news, they're corrupt to the core. They've been lying to the American people for four-plus years. Biden's campaign staff even preselected reporters during last week's brief so-called press conference. Now, we all know why, the reason is obvious. When Biden goes off script, well, disaster ensues. He needs a teleprompter to answer questions. He doesn't know at times what office he's running for, what day of the week he is, he doesn't know what positions family members have had. Biden's daily struggles have become so bad that his former White House stenographer, well, he's now speaking out warning us telling us the truth. \"Washington Free Beacon\" pointing out that he is not the same Joe Biden that his mental acuity having deteriorated. He is not the only person by the way hiding from the press. On Monday, his radical extreme to the left of even Bolshevik Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, could not be bothered to take a single question. Instead, keep looking at that crowd, she avoided reporters with one of her famous and awkward laughing fits. Let's look at this crowd. Look at that crowd. Ask yourself, can Joe Biden get that crowd in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, like the president did tonight? Looks pretty big to me. Anyway, watch Kamala."

Yesterday, Trump supporters turned out in force, one of the largest boat parades we have ever seen, and there's been a lot of big ones. Notably, no Biden parades that I've noticed around the country. That would be called an enthusiasm gap. In fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find a large gathering of Biden supporters like this anywhere. The contrast between the two campaigns is massive.

DONALD TRUMP JR, AUTHOR, \"LIBERAL PRIVILEGE\": Well, it feels pretty good and it's sort of ironic that those are the same people that out of 150 million American Democrats, Joe Biden, who can't remember where he is 50 percent of the time, is the best they've got, Sean. It's -- honestly, it would be sad if it wasn't so scary for our country. What's going on in that campaign, the inability to articulate a thought, the inability to do events two days in a row without having to go back into his basement borough and hide -- and I don't mean to make light of cognitive decline as his stenographer has pointed out, and has so many other people have pointed out. All you have to do is go back and look at a tape of him in the Senate 20 years ago and realize it's not the same guy. I don't mean to make light of that. That's something that everyone, you know, has -- knows someone who is dealing with an issue like that. We're just not necessarily trusting that person with the nuclear codes. We're not trusting the person with our children's and our grandchildren's futures. I mean, that's what they are doing, doing it because Joe Biden is the perfect camouflage for the mainstream media to push their radical leftist agenda into Middle America. They can go to Ohio and Pennsylvania and say, Joe's moderate, look, it's moderate Joe. But you're not a moderate with his platform. You're not a moderate with the people he's chosen to surround himself with. So, it's a big lie. But as to the enthusiasm gap, you're right, Sean, it was incredible. I was at the boat parade yesterday in Florida. It went for 20 miles. Every dock, every restaurant on the water had people, hundreds of them. Just look at my Instagram page, I mean, just cheering and screaming. You know, it's amazing. The Democrats are going to have to play a lot of games to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people with this one but they will. It's what they're doing. They're not bothering to staff up a ground game. They're not bothering with any of those things. What they're doing is they are staffing up lawyers so they can try to win this thing after Election Day, not on it."

But since I'm not going to go riot or loot, I stayed at home. I didn't go to work. And I was able to look at Joe Biden's 50 years of failure. I was able to document all of these things that if Donald Trump did, they would be career ending. It would be over, whether it's the brain surgeries, whether it's the disastrous trade policies supporting NAFTA, TPP, China's permanent status in the World Trade Organization. Joe Biden, as a politician, he's probably done more damage to the American middle class and to American manufacturing than any other person alive. And yet, the media will allow him to run Middle America like he's going to be the savior. If he's going to be the savior of anything, Sean, why did he wait 50 years? Why didn't he do this already? That's the reality. When you have the mainstream media that refuses to actually be journalists and just wants to be activists, it creates a problem because all of the things that are Biden's major flaws, they don't have any interest in. It took someone like me to sit there and look at this 50-year track record of failure, whether it's through his positions in government, whether it's through his family, whether it's the graft, the Hunter Biden --"

Tonight, Democrats, they continue to advocate for widespread mail-in ballots, oh, 56 days before an election. They don't really seem to care about the risks of fraud and those possibilities. Some completely deny that fraud even exists. And, by the way, they are once again lying to you the American people, just like on Russia, just like on obstruction and quid pro quo Joe. Look at the Heritage Foundation, there have been 1,285 proven cases of voter fraud in America. Look at the state of New Jersey, one city councilman, three others, recently charged with a mail-in voter fraud scheme. Also, mail-in ballot fraud in North Carolina, that resulted in a new election. 2018, four cases of illegal mail-in voting schemes in Texas that caused two elections to be overturned. In Georgia's June primary, a thousand people illegally voted twice and the \"New York Post\" just conducted a shocking interview with the top Democratic operative who spent a career committing voter fraud, mail-in voter fraud as a matter of fact. Look at \"The Post\", quote, he not only changed ballots himself over the years, but led teams of fraudsters and mentored at least 20 operatives in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This is how you want the election decided because make no mistake this is exactly what the Democrats are now pushing for. Here with more, former White House press secretary and FOX News contributor Ari Fleischer, along with former Arkansas governor, FOX News contributor Mike Huckabee.

Ballot harvesting is really the biggest problem out there, because what it means is it's licensing people from the parties and it's particularly the Democrat Party that does this to go out and subject voters to possible intimidation, to collect votes and if they collect votes from a Republican area not turn them in from a Democrat area, round them up and turn them in. There's no accountability. There's no tracing or tracking on these ballots once they're collected. That's a real problem. The other, just to be quick is states that have deadlines way too close to Election Day to apply for your absentee ballot. You won't get it in time, and then all the lawyers are going to be empowered to demand to count every vote even the ones that came in after Election Day."

Now, it's not a matter of the people who are dead, it's a matter of how many people are going to vote more than once because they're going to get a ballot in a lot of places. They'll be voting people from nursing homes and very senior centers, all sorts of ways, and that's what I think we need to be worried about. Donald Trump has to have an army of people to go vote and ideally go vote in person and if the river is flooding, swim the river at flood stage but do not sit this one out."

But take a look at what happened in the 2008 race between Al Franken and Minnesota and Norm Coleman. Norm Coleman won on election day and then through Democrat lawyers, they started to engineer every kind of trick in the book, chains that you could find, 25 precincts in Minneapolis had more ballots cast than there were voters registered. And when it was brought to the attention of the judge looking at the recount, he said there's nothing we can do about it. It's too late we can't un-count those votes. Donald Trump and the Republicans better have that army of lawyers ready to go to toe with the Democrat lawyers who are going to try to ex-post facto change every rule in the book to give themselves the advantage."

Another video appears to show one of the same agitators with the bullhorn harassing workers inside a McDonald's. Now, authorities in Pittsburgh, they're investigating all this. Remember, this is the behavior Biden, Harris, they wouldn't criticize. Democrats even ignored what's happening, denied it for months. This is the behavior of the anarchists, the mob, the media told you that didn't exist. Up in Rochester, New York, it gets even worse. Protesters there turned chaotic last Friday in response to troubling body cam footage being released in the Daniel Prude case. Again, look at your screen. Rioters descending onto a restaurant to harass innocent diners before later marching directly into neighborhoods, and according to reports, allegedly trying to enter an apartment building. It was a scene of complete lawlessness and total anarchy, you know, that's been going on over a hundred days now. And just breaking tonight, the city's entire police command staff, including the police chief, they are leaving. They're retiring. Can any of you blame these heroes? They are prevented from doing their jobs and they are unfairly demonized and subject to vicious assaults, and this is happening in every big liberal city and state all across the country. We'll continue following all these stories. But get this -- the new extreme left is so unhinged, so out of touch, so dangerous even. Al Sharpton is sounding the alarm and having his election year conversion, 56 days out of an election. Obviously, Al Sharpton is looking at the same polling data and the same focus groups as groups that scared the crap out of CNN's fake news Don Lemon, seriously. Not doing it because they believe it, they're doing it because, uh-oh, we may lose because of it. Take a look. REV. AL SHARPTON, MSNBC HOST, \"POLITICS NATION\": You know, I got a lot of attention when I did the eulogy for George Floyd's funeral, but I also a month later preached a one-year-old kid's funeral in Brooklyn who was killed by a stray bullet. To take all policing off is something that I think a latte liberal may go for as they sit around the Hamptons discussing this as some academic problem, but people living on the ground need proper one policing."

Forget about building power plants and the idea of nuclear completely off the chart, and as a result, we have these brown outs, fuel prices are higher than they otherwise would be and guess who hurt -- gets hurt? The very low income people that these environmentalists claim that they care about. It's outrageous. And regarding 78 degrees, Sean, I live in Hollywood Hills. My temperature would not get anything under 80 degrees, even though I had the air conditioning on because of the inefficiencies here. So it really didn't matter."

That's not to say we should all be wasting resources endlessly, but we should all be able to go about our lives in the way that we've always gone -- gone about it. And Larry's totally right because since we have a one-party system in effect here in California, when you ask the average Californian, you know, something's wrong here, and they go, you know, it sure is, and then you remind them that the governors and the state assemblymen and the mayors are all Democratic, you have to get that light, no pun intended, to go off in their head and then they might go, oh, maybe we got to change something here."

I don't know how you did your job as press secretary. I don't know how Spicer did it. I don't know how Kayleigh McEnany does it. Couldn't pay me all the money in the world to do that job.

That's for sure, and they didn't like it very much when I reminded them as they were talking about the problems and all these major cities, who was the one that was leading those major cities. It was very interesting that the second I started naming off all of the accomplishments and all of the things that the president has done to empower the black community and help the black community they quickly cut me off and decided it was time to move on. Let's not forget that one of the hosts of that show actually called the president a terrorist, despite the fact that --"

They are the definition of hypocrisy and they've decided that they hate this president more than they love this country. And it has never been more evident than the fact that they can't be happy about the positive things that this president has done to help all Americans particularly black Americans across this country. You know, I look at the enthusiasm in North Carolina tonight, and I don't see that for Joe Biden. I look at the accomplishments -- they can't acknowledge a single thing Donald Trump has done well, because Biden and Obama, they didn't set record low unemployment. They didn't do opportunity zones, Joe's record on race. They left after eight years with 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the ‘70s, and then the Iranian mullah deal, $150 billion. I don't think that's a good record to run on, Sarah."

She actually pointed out how bad Joe Biden's record was when it came to race relations during his almost five decades in public service. He has done nothing in almost 50 years to help black Americans. Why should we expect him to do that now? The contrast is clear, and Donald Trump needs to be reelected in November."
