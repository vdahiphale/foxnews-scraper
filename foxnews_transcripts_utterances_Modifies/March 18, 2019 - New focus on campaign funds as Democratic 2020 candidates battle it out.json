Money, it's what all the candidates want, but precious really ever have or ever get, money, the kind of money that can give you an edge, sometimes instantly, and if you are one Beto O'Rourke, the kind of money that can set you apart instantly. It gives your critics pause, because say what you will of his spotty resume, Beto is anything but spotty coming out the gate. More than six million bucks raised in first 24 hours as a presidential candidate. Better than Bernie. Better than Kamala. So far better than anybody.  Historically, even better than Barack, as in Barack Obama, when he started his trip to the White House.  That was then. What is happening now?  Welcome, everybody. I'll Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  Now, if Beto has got the dough, does he also have the mo', as in momentum?  Will Joe Biden see a run for his money, should he decide to enter this presidential race? And is money going to ultimately whittle down a crowd that right now is running potentially into the dozens? That may be getting ahead of ourselves. But here is something that is not. They are pouring money fast and loose in campaigns that need it fast and furious, and they are getting it, particularly in the O'Rourke camp.  FBN's Deirdre Bolton has been following all of this -- Deirdre.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Neil, this was a first today record number. You called it. That's $6.1 million online in the first 24 hours of Beto O'Rourke's official campaign announcement.  And according to his spokesperson, someone on his team, he says the money came in without a dime from political action committees or corporations or special interests.   Now, as a comparison point, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders raised slightly less in his first 24 hours, $5.9 million, so pretty close. And most agree that Sanders is really going to be the one who sets the pace for 2020 grassroots donations. So, Bernie Sanders took in more than $10 million in his first week. And we should note, most of that is coming from small donors. You mentioned some of the other candidates, Neil. Their respective launches all within a range. So you have California senator Kamala Harris, also Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, they were around a million, a million and a half for their first 24 hours. The two governors who are in the race, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, three days, he had a million dollars. So it took them a little longer to make that watermark. And then the former Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper, he raised about a million dollars. It took him 48 hours.   Senator Elizabeth Warren, the slowest start out of the gate. But this is not completely a fair comparison, because when she announced she was considering running. She raised about $300,000. We don't have accurate numbers as to the first official 24 hours. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, as well, officially entered the race via an announcement on video this Sunday. We're still waiting to tally those up.  But you mentioned the former V.P., Joe Biden. He was at an event on Saturday in Delaware, saying, I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- anybody who would run -- I didn't mean -- and then he chuckled, and he made a sign of the cross on his chest. So it's not official that Biden is in the race yet, but President Trump, as we know, did weigh in with this tweet: \"Joe Biden got tongue-tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for president. Get used to it. Another low-I.Q. individual.\"  So that is the point of view from President Trump on former Vice President Joe Biden. Neil, we're still early days, but this is going to be interesting -- back to you.",

And all the money in the world couldn't convince the American people to like her or to trust her. But the small-dollar donations, that's what shows where the energy is within the Democratic Party. And that's with Bernie and that's with Beto.  But Bernie, he is who he is. There's an authenticity about him that people like, even if that's him authentically liking the Soviet Union.   But Beto, I'm not so sure he knows who he is. I mean, just two weeks ago, he was off on the road trying to find himself writing in his journal. We don't know whether to call him Rob O'Rourke, when he was captain of the crew team or Psychedelic Warlord when he was this computer hacker.  But now he's settled on Beto. And so we have already seen him coming out with this campaign it isn't the smoothest launch. He's already having to apologize, change positions on health care, apologize for his white privilege. It's not the smoothest rollout. So he -- there's a lot of energy behind him, but he's -- there's also going to be a lot of targets on his back because of that energy.

What's significant about Sanders and O'Rourke and some of the other Democrats is, they're getting this money in small gifts, $25, $50, $100.   Why does that matter? Because you can hit them again and again and again and again. They're committed. They have skin in the game. And they could give $50 a month from now until the end of the election, or maybe they double it as you get close to the Election Day. The excitement carries them to a higher number.

And focus on the Ethiopian Airlines crash has now turned at least in part to Washington, because The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that federal prosecutors and the Department of Transportation's inspector general are both probing the development of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and whether there were improprieties with the certification of the plane at the FAA. The Journal reports that, on March 11, the day after the crash, a grand jury issued a wide-ranging subpoena for documentation and e-mail correspondence. It is highly unusual, The Journal, says for prosecutors to delve into regulatory approval of a commercial airliner. Separately, the black boxes are revealing some initial findings that point to similarities between the Ethiopian crash and the Lion Air crash five months before. The data shows the MCAS automated system designed to lower the plane's pitch in the event of a stall was turned on. The tail flaps trimmed down to force the nose down, just as in the Lion Air crash. But in the Lion Air crash, we also know that the MCAS was acting on bad data from a malfunctioning sensor that indicates the planes's pitch and angle of attack.  In a statement yesterday, Boeing's CEO said -- quote -- \"Boeing is finalizing its development of a previously announced software update in response to erroneous sensor inputs.\" Pilot training may also prove to be a contributory cause. The MCAS system is easily turned off with two switches on the center console by the pilot's thigh. Turning it off would have set the flaps and the trim tabs to a normal position. The first officer on the Ethiopian Airlines flight had only 200 hours in the MAX 8 cockpit.",

I don't know which judge in which court, but some federal judge will make the first move on this. And eventually it'll be probably make its way to the Supreme Court.  But every time, every time the Supreme Court has been asked to decide whether the Congress can give away some of its power to either the judiciary or the president, it has said no, it can't.

But there are real fears here in the United States that imposing tariffs could really hurt the auto industry. And there's a lot of opposition about a mile down Pennsylvania Avenue to what the president might do in terms of tariffs. There was a report from the Center for Automotive Research last July that found that as many as two million cars may not be produced, and as many as 700,000 jobs could be lost because of these tariffs. There was a real wide range in there, though, so nobody really knows what could happen. But the president is getting a lot of pressure to not go ahead with these tariffs.

He's identified as a resident of the Netherlands, but a native of Turkey.  After firing what is called a big gun, he fled. Now, Dutch officials, including the prime minister, has still not ruled out terror in this attack. But there are other indications it could be something else, Neil, indications perhaps it might have been a family dispute, that he was going after one woman on the train, and then people got caught in the crossfire. He is also known to police, a long criminal record, including attempted manslaughter. But, Neil, in these times, with what's going on in New Zealand and elsewhere, there were certainly tense moments, tense hours in the town of Utrecht, and still death and injury on the streets there -- back to you.",

Money, it's what all the candidates want, but precious really ever have or ever get, money, the kind of money that can give you an edge, sometimes instantly, and if you are one Beto O'Rourke, the kind of money that can set you apart instantly. It gives your critics pause, because say what you will of his spotty resume, Beto is anything but spotty coming out the gate. More than six million bucks raised in first 24 hours as a presidential candidate. Better than Bernie. Better than Kamala. So far better than anybody.  Historically, even better than Barack, as in Barack Obama, when he started his trip to the White House. That was then. What is happening now? Welcome, everybody. I'll Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" Now, if Beto has got the dough, does he also have the mo', as in momentum?  Will Joe Biden see a run for his money, should he decide to enter this presidential race? And is money going to ultimately whittle down a crowd that right now is running potentially into the dozens? That may be getting ahead of ourselves. But here is something that is not. They are pouring money fast and loose in campaigns that need it fast and furious, and they are getting it, particularly in the O'Rourke camp. FBN's Deirdre Bolton has been following all of this -- Deirdre."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, this was a first today record number. You called it. That's $6.1 million online in the first 24 hours of Beto O'Rourke's official campaign announcement. And according to his spokesperson, someone on his team, he says the money came in without a dime from political action committees or corporations or special interests. Now, as a comparison point, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders raised slightly less in his first 24 hours, $5.9 million, so pretty close. And most agree that Sanders is really going to be the one who sets the pace for 2020 grassroots donations. So, Bernie Sanders took in more than $10 million in his first week. And we should note, most of that is coming from small donors. You mentioned some of the other candidates, Neil. Their respective launches all within a range. So you have California senator Kamala Harris, also Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, they were around a million, a million and a half for their first 24 hours. The two governors who are in the race, Washington Governor Jay Inslee, three days, he had a million dollars. So it took them a little longer to make that watermark. And then the former Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper, he raised about a million dollars. It took him 48 hours. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the slowest start out of the gate. But this is not completely a fair comparison, because when she announced she was considering running. She raised about $300,000. We don't have accurate numbers as to the first official 24 hours. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, as well, officially entered the race via an announcement on video this Sunday. We're still waiting to tally those up.  But you mentioned the former V.P., Joe Biden. He was at an event on Saturday in Delaware, saying, I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- anybody who would run -- I didn't mean -- and then he chuckled, and he made a sign of the cross on his chest."

      "utterance": "So, does money matter? Well, to a lot of historians, at least in the early going, it does. And, again, if you are raising it in small sums, that begets the attention to those who hand out bigger sums to you. Barack Obama found out back in 2007-2008, and the rest, as you know, is history. Speaking of which, to history professor extraordinaire, bestselling author Larry Sabato at the UVA Center for Politics, and The Washington Free Beacon's Liz Harrington. Professor, let me begin with you. Do you pay attention to this as an early barometer of support? How do you look at it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Anybody who doesn't pay attention would be crazy. And any campaign that tells you today they wouldn't want to have Beto O'Rourke number, or for that matter, Bernie Sanders' number, fund-raising number, they're lying, because you do want that extra money. But it is not the alpha and the omega of politics. You can end up winning with less money if you have the right message and if you hit the rate wave right in the election year. But, yes, you would rather have more money, and it's something we all look at."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's interesting too, Liz, because, obviously, if you're looking to raise money and even bigger sums of money, I guess you have to prove to a lot of the big money guys in each party, in this case, the Democratic Party, you can get and generate that kind of interest. Beto O'Rourke has. And I'm wondering if that gives him sort of a boost that other campaigns, with the exception of Sanders that already routinely enjoys this, don't have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIZ HARRINGTON, THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON",
      "utterance": "Well, it does. But I would agree with Larry. Money, it isn't the be-all/end-all, because we saw, in 2016, Hillary outspent Trump 2-1. And all the money in the world couldn't convince the American people to like her or to trust her. But the small-dollar donations, that's what shows where the energy is within the Democratic Party. And that's with Bernie and that's with Beto.  But Bernie, he is who he is. There's an authenticity about him that people like, even if that's him authentically liking the Soviet Union. But Beto, I'm not so sure he knows who he is. I mean, just two weeks ago, he was off on the road trying to find himself writing in his journal. We don't know whether to call him Rob O'Rourke, when he was captain of the crew team or Psychedelic Warlord when he was this computer hacker. But now he's settled on Beto. And so we have already seen him coming out with this campaign it isn't the smoothest launch. He's already having to apologize, change positions on health care, apologize for his white privilege. It's not the smoothest rollout. So he -- there's a lot of energy behind him, but he's -- there's also going to be a lot of targets on his back because of that energy. And he's not handling it too well so far."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, success can do that, right? Early success, the appearance of success, and very different on a national stage than obviously a state one. But, Larry, another thing I'm reminded, I remember the presidential race of Phil Gramm, and he famously said money is the mother's milk of politics.  And he had a lot of it, I believe at the time more than any of the other candidates. Didn't do him a lot of good. John Connally, similarly, running with a big money lead, and, of course, I think he got all of one delegate for that. So we should be careful, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And you cited two superb examples. And also Gramm and Connally relied on big money, big contributions. What's significant about Sanders and O'Rourke and some of the other Democrats is, they're getting this money in small gifts, $25, $50, $100. Why does that matter? Because you can hit them again and again and again and again. They're committed. They have skin in the game. And they could give $50 a month from now until the end of the election, or maybe they double it as you get close to the Election Day. The excitement carries them to a higher number. So that's why small givers are preferred to big givers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Gotcha. You know, we're looking live now at Beto O'Rourke. He's at a political event in Cleveland, Ohio. And, Liz, I'm reminded of the fact that the president is already focused on the candidate's hand gestures. And maybe that's the sign the president's worried or maybe that's his way of saying welcome to the race. He's done this to low-energy Jeb Bush and little Marco and lying Ted. I mean, when they enter the field, it's pretty soon that he starts fielding the characterizations. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARRINGTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, I'm sure he will come with more, but that is his initial reaction. And it's interesting, because Trump's comments on the hand gestures was actually the biggest jump in Google searches about Beto, period. So Trump still can drive the conversation."

And now we're getting data from the black boxes, we're told, that says that what happened in that particular flight seemed a mimic one that happened on Lion Air, when that went down some six months earlier, last fall in Indonesia. Doug McKelway has been connecting the dots in Washington -- Doug."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good afternoon, Neil. And focus on the Ethiopian Airlines crash has now turned at least in part to Washington, because The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that federal prosecutors and the Department of Transportation's inspector general are both probing the development of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and whether there were improprieties with the certification of the plane at the FAA. The Journal reports that, on March 11, the day after the crash, a grand jury issued a wide-ranging subpoena for documentation and e-mail correspondence. It is highly unusual, The Journal, says for prosecutors to delve into regulatory approval of a commercial airliner. Separately, the black boxes are revealing some initial findings that point to similarities between the Ethiopian crash and the Lion Air crash five months before. The data shows the MCAS automated system designed to lower the plane's pitch in the event of a stall was turned on. The tail flaps trimmed down to force the nose down, just as in the Lion Air crash. But in the Lion Air crash, we also know that the MCAS was acting on bad data from a malfunctioning sensor that indicates the planes's pitch and angle of attack. In a statement yesterday, Boeing's CEO said -- quote -- \"Boeing is finalizing its development of a previously announced software update in response to erroneous sensor inputs.\" Pilot training may also prove to be a contributory cause. The MCAS system is easily turned off with two switches on the center console by the pilot's thigh. Turning it off would have set the flaps and the trim tabs to a normal position. The first officer on the Ethiopian Airlines flight had only 200 hours in the MAX 8 cockpit."

And then there's a separate issue of investigations here back at home regarding Boeing itself, not the jet in question, but Boeing itself, that it might have had too much sway in the vetting process for these jets with approving officials. A former NTSB board member, John Goglia, joins us right now. John, good to have you back."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOGLIA",
      "utterance": "Well, we -- there have been allegations of that kind of influence in the past. But the FAA has not been found -- just the opposite. The FAA has not been found to be too cozy on those issues. So, we will have to wait and see what comes out of this investigation. It's pretty broad-based. So it's going to touch a lot of different areas. And, although I personally don't think that Boeing would have that kind of influence, one never knows."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm going to ask you a couple of more cynical questions. And it's only cynical because I know from where this data and research we're getting is coming from. First, on the study the black boxes, the French are doing it. That's fine.  But the French, of course, are big investors in Airbus industry, a maker of competitive products. Again, I don't want to be jaded about it. But would it be out of the realm of possibility that they would be particularly harsh or draw conclusions that were too early to draw on this data?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOGLIA",
      "utterance": "Well, that's always been the concern. We know that -- we're pretty clear that, in the past, they have gone lightly on some of Airbus accidents. But if they just read the boxes out and gave the raw data to Ethiopia, then one would expect that the data would be accurate. And, fortunately, the investigators that are usually pretty focused, and they don't pay attention to all the noise that is generated either by the politicians or by the press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, especially the press. There's the nasty ones, John. So let me ask you about this pressure that happens when you try to get a vehicle to be cleared for takeoff, no pun intended, and you have an impeccable safety record prior. How much do authorities weigh that when approving a new or revamped version of, let's say, the same 737, a different model?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOGLIA",

And to that end, we're impeaching the delegation process that the FAA uses. But I have been told over and over again by companies that the delegates that the FAA blesses to do the review are usually tougher on the company than the FAA inspectors are, because they know more. And that's one of the reasons why they FAA has chosen to give them the power of delegation. The FAA still has to pass and review. But these people are among the most knowledgeable on whatever the system is. So I don't think we can we can do away with that system, unless we're prepared to drastically increase the funding for the FAA."

She's not happy with the 12 Republican senators who voted against the president's national emergency and worries about the prospect of any of them even thinking of overriding the president's veto.

In fact, I don't even think there's going to be a vote in the Senate, because if the House fails to override, that's the end of it. The issue is then teed up before a federal charges. I don't know which judge in which court, but some federal judge will make the first move on this. And eventually it'll be probably make its way to the Supreme Court. But every time, every time the Supreme Court has been asked to decide whether the Congress can give away some of its power to either the judiciary or the president, it has said no, it can't.

If undercover agents testified under their real names or under pseudonyms, that testimony is kept secret. So I don't think all of it will come out.  I think a great deal of it well, but not all.

Car companies are all coming back to the U.S. So is everyone else. We now have the best economy in the world. The envy of all. Get that big, beautiful plant in Ohio open now.

The president has got 90 days to decide what to do. He's trying, of course, to use the threat of tariffs as leverage on new trade deals. But there are real fears here in the United States that imposing tariffs could really hurt the auto industry. And there's a lot of opposition about a mile down Pennsylvania Avenue to what the president might do in terms of tariffs. There was a report from the Center for Automotive Research last July that found that as many as two million cars may not be produced, and as many as 700,000 jobs could be lost because of these tariffs. There was a real wide range in there, though, so nobody really knows what could happen. But the president is getting a lot of pressure to not go ahead with these tariffs. He's headed, by the way, to Ohio in a couple of days, Neil.

And I think that's so important that we do that, especially in this particular day and age. Now, the thing is, President Trump has accomplished a lot of great things. Certainly, we talk about the unemployment rate across spectrums, African-American, Hispanic, those are all good things. You talk about the fact that he said that he was going to bring jobs back to the U.S. and car companies, and people said that that wouldn't be possible, it wouldn't happen. But yet we are seeing that it's happening.  So those are some very positive things that he's done. But as I mentioned on this show, as you mentioned earlier, certainly, when he gets to talking about something like someone's face, or making kind of really petty remarks, that drives away from his message, and certainly drives the news coverage in another way.

He's identified as a resident of the Netherlands, but a native of Turkey.  After firing what is called a big gun, he fled.

It's an $8.5 billion business right now, $13 billion in lost productivity, though, because everyone at work is filling out bracket sheets and all the rest, not, me mind you, because I'm here to report on it. We have got FOX News contributor Kat Timpf. We got have Turning Point USA's Rob Smith, and, last but not least, radio host sensation Mike Gunzelman. Gunz, you don't do this and gamble like that."

      "utterance": "Yes, how's it going to pay for itself? If you're requiring someone to do work, then that will pay for itself. But just giving people money to do nothing, I don't understand how this is a thing. Finland tried it and then they said oops."
