Now, President Trump and New York Governor Mario Cuomo -- sorry -- Andrew Cuomo -- I keep going to the father -- who is a Democrat, very much on the same page with this idea that you cannot keep the economy shuttered for a long time.

What they would do is, they would ask if the bill should be passed, and so long as not a single member objects, they pass the bill. But it's unclear when they can get this through the Senate and then get it through the House.  One thing I should note that's important, Neil, is that the temperature on Capitol Hill today is much lower than it was yesterday. That's usually a good sign that people are working together, they're working this out. There was a lot of fighting on the Senate floor yesterday, which was rather extraordinary. That's not happening today, which means that they're getting this in form. What's next? Well, Roy Blunt, the Republican senator from Missouri, indicated they're already starting to talk about phase four. Consider the size of this bill. It's ginormous.

Whether it's a Category 5 or a Category 1, maybe we can make a bit of a difference by some social distancing and by some sheltering in place, that it doesn't have to be extreme.  But a lot of it can be just common sense. When you think about getting groups of people together or things that really have a high risk of close contact, those are the things that we want to try to prevent.

So, right now, the whole thing of find every case and do contact tracing and stamping out, we're too far along for that in most places now.

And, as you mentioned, we heard from Senator Chuck Schumer that says we are on the two-yard line in passing this $2 trillion stimulus package. Couple that with $4 trillion in Federal Reserve firepower yesterday, and the markets were off and running today. Also, you can't discount the words coming from President Trump. He is now targeting Easter for the reopening of the economy. Might be optimistic, but the fact that he wants to reopen the U.S. economy sooner, rather than later, that helped lift sentiment today. So, sectors that did well, along with the U.S. economic growth, did well in the sessions, so we're talking about the energy sector, the materials and financials, also big tech. I should remind our viewers, analysts think that big tech might emerge out of the coronavirus pandemic even stronger than before. For instance, Amazon can't keep up with its deliveries and orders. Also, Zoom Video has doubled so far on the year. Netflix saw record streaming traffic just this past weekend. And Apple says they will reopen stores in the first half of April. Now, we also just got the latest economists' forecast for jobless claims, which are due out on Thursday. Economists think that one million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week, which would be nearly two times the record we saw back in 1982, when 695,000 Americans applied for jobless benefits. But that's actually smaller than what Goldman Sachs is predicting, Neil. They're looking for 2.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits. Bank of America says three million.

We wanted to make sure as well we do more for hospitals.

Now, President Trump and New York Governor Mario Cuomo -- sorry -- Andrew Cuomo -- I keep going to the father -- who is a Democrat, very much on the same page with this idea that you cannot keep the economy shuttered for a long time.

There's a lot of concern among the current 430 members of the House about bringing everybody back to vote. What they would do is, they would ask if the bill should be passed, and so long as not a single member objects, they pass the bill. But it's unclear when they can get this through the Senate and then get it through the House. One thing I should note that's important, Neil, is that the temperature on Capitol Hill today is much lower than it was yesterday. That's usually a good sign that people are working together, they're working this out. There was a lot of fighting on the Senate floor yesterday, which was rather extraordinary. That's not happening today, which means that they're getting this in form. What's next? Well, Roy Blunt, the Republican senator from Missouri, indicated they're already starting to talk about phase four. Consider the size of this bill. It's ginormous. But there's a lot of things that they can't put into this piece of legislation. That's the phase three. They have to get to phase four sometime down the road, Neil."

But in order to do so, I think we're all going to have to pull some weight. I tell people in North Carolina, it's a little bit of like a hurricane coming ashore. They understand that. Whether it's a Category 5 or a Category 1, maybe we can make a bit of a difference by some social distancing and by some sheltering in place, that it doesn't have to be extreme. But a lot of it can be just common sense. When you think about getting groups of people together or things that really have a high risk of close contact, those are the things that we want to try to prevent. And maybe we could relax some other areas where the risk isn't so high. But I think we're all in it together for the protection..."

But one of the things we're hearing right now, with some three new states added to the mix, more than half the American people are under some sort of stay-at-home requirement, order, law, and that could rise. And just today, we learned that India's prime minister is issuing a lockdown, not for some of his 1.3 billion people, all of them. I'm just wondering what you make of the effectiveness of these lockdown, stay-at-homes, whatever you want to call them?"

But we're looking at information from some areas in Asia and some other areas now in some parts of Europe, where it maybe has been effective. So, right now, the whole thing of find every case and do contact tracing and stamping out, we're too far along for that in most places now. So, I think we have to do what best science and what best epidemiology tells us might work. And that's the social distancing or a modified shelter in place."

      "utterance": "Yes, well, it's going to cost a lot of money, but biggest points rally in the Dow's history. So that lifted all three benchmarks off these three- year lows. And, as you mentioned, we heard from Senator Chuck Schumer that says we are on the two-yard line in passing this $2 trillion stimulus package. Couple that with $4 trillion in Federal Reserve firepower yesterday, and the markets were off and running today. Also, you can't discount the words coming from President Trump. He is now targeting Easter for the reopening of the economy. Might be optimistic, but the fact that he wants to reopen the U.S. economy sooner, rather than later, that helped lift sentiment today. So, sectors that did well, along with the U.S. economic growth, did well in the sessions, so we're talking about the energy sector, the materials and financials, also big tech. I should remind our viewers, analysts think that big tech might emerge out of the coronavirus pandemic even stronger than before. For instance, Amazon can't keep up with its deliveries and orders. Also, Zoom Video has doubled so far on the year. Netflix saw record streaming traffic just this past weekend. And Apple says they will reopen stores in the first half of April. Now, we also just got the latest economists' forecast for jobless claims, which are due out on Thursday. Economists think that one million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week, which would be nearly two times the record we saw back in 1982, when 695,000 Americans applied for jobless benefits. But that's actually smaller than what Goldman Sachs is predicting, Neil. They're looking for 2.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits. Bank of America says three million. These are pretty dire numbers."

And we're monitoring the entire situation where people are staying at home. More than half the people in this country are doing just that, but not everybody, and sometimes for state constitutional reasons. This seems to be the case in South Dakota.

What I love about South Dakota is that they all get personal responsibility. They know that they're personally responsible for their own health, for their family and their communities.

If they see a bad actor out there, someone who's not following the recommendations of the CDC that we know are fact -- factual to control this virus, then they need to go have face-to-face conversations with these business owners, and tell them that they need to be changing practices to protect people. That's been working in so many communities. And we have done a good job now of slowing down the infection rate in our state. I know it'll increase. I know it will be something that will continue to be -- get more and more difficult as days go on. But we're giving ourselves time to prepare our hospital systems and our providers to handle the influx of individuals that won't feel well, and make sure that we're better prepared to take care of them."

And there is -- there is teeth to the executive order. If they violate the executive order, they face a second-degree misdemeanor. So this is very serious. As you know, Governor DeSantis has been bold and trying to protect Floridians, while, at the same time, recognizing that he needs to be cautious in these orders, because people are not only afraid of protecting their health and the health of their families, but they're fearful of jobs, job loss and loss of income. And, so, Governor DeSantis, I commend him. He has taken very bold action, but he's done so after examining the facts, examining how he can be very particular in these orders to make sure they're limited, but protecting Floridians at the same time."

The executive order says, where there are areas where you're seeing significant community spread, but it's specific to name those three states, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. And so we know, when those planes are coming in. And, as you know, we get over 100 planes every day still coming in from those -- from New York. They will be met there, and they will be told that there's this quarantine in place, and we have procedures in place. In fact, Governor DeSantis has asked for the help of state attorneys and law enforcement to make sure he has the personnel in place to help enforce this executive order."

And I fly into your fine state. Is someone going to direct me, all right, Mr. Cavuto, you're here for a while, you're going to have to stay where? Where do I go? When I self-quarantine -- a lot of people self-quarantine in a home or a hotel. Where do you self-quarantine?"
    },

      "speaker": "MOODY",

And the executive order is clear that the costs will be on those individuals that are either returning home or coming into Florida to stay. And then it'll be up to them to self-quarantine, and make sure they're staying away from the public during that duration. Again, we know that this is -- this will provide some hardship to those coming into Florida."

Our governor is doing what he feels he has to do to protect Floridians. I commend him for that. We all are. As leaders, we're in the fight every day to make sure that those are - - those people that need essential cleaning supplies or face masks or anything to protect their health have the ability to do that and people aren't jacking up prices."

And we talked about it, and it seemed to make a lot of sense. The seniors, who are most vulnerable during this virus crisis, they needed to come in and get their items that they needed, and shop in a safe, clean, friendly environment, and then go home, and hopefully get enough items, and be the first ones who get them, that they wouldn't have to get out over the next few days."

It's probably the best moment in our history. And we do it every morning from 7:00 to 8:00. We get all kinds of compliments from not just the seniors, but other employees -- I'm sorry -- other shoppers, the general public. And our employees, it's a great way to start their day off.

I think it's going to be a strong, strong economic message. I think it's, frankly, a much better package than what was available Saturday and early Sunday morning. I know there was a lot of rancor on the floor of the Senate yesterday. I was -- I wasn't involved in that. I was actually in a room closeted with Steve Mnuchin, the secretary of Treasury, trying to work out some of these details. And I thought he was a very reasonable negotiator. And I think no matter where you fall on the political spectrum, both in terms of broader-based transparency and protections to make sure there's not the kind of abuse that took place post-TARP, as well as making sure -- the package that we originally had did a lot for the airlines and a lot for small business, but left virtually every other business, 500 and above, out. I think there's a much more targeted program that I have been part of, a tax retention for employees in there as well, a couple of other very good provisions as they -- as they get laid forward.

And when you do something this big, and it only has one team's seal of approval, you're going to get stuff that may be outside the boundaries of what we should be doing. I think the administration -- and I have not been a fan of the administration on a lot of items -- you know that -- but, in this case, I think they have come with a serious negotiator, with a willingness to realize, whether it's about transparency, whether it's willing to make sure that we don't give dollars away to businesses that need it, and then have those dollars spent on share buybacks or on excessive executive compensation, I think most all Americans, I think most legitimate businesses want that as well. We wanted to make sure as well we do more for hospitals. We want to make sure as well that we have got the ability, so that if people are unemployed, for example, gig workers or others, they don't fall through the cracks.

The sad reality is that, for a lot who are getting ready for the Tokyo Olympics this summer, well, they just found out it's going to be next summer, and no guarantee that they're going to be there. We have got Dick Pound with us right now, the International Olympic Committee member. Dick, I guess this wasn't as much of a shock, given the ongoing virus concerns. But what happens to a lot of those athletes? How easy or not will it be to still qualify to make the now I guess 2021 Olympics?"

So, some of the folks that may have qualified this year, when you get to next year, they may be yesterday's news. And the new generation will say, well, I don't care what you did last year. This is this year, and I'm faster than you or stronger than you, and I should be on the team."

But I'm wondering, this, on top of canceled basketball, canceled baseball, or delayed baseball, that, for a lot of folks, there -- there will be a reluctance to be in large gatherings, in large crowds, at stadiums, football arenas, even vast soccer arenas, and dare I say maybe the Olympics itself. Is that a worry? Is that a genuine worry now?"

And what we hope is that, by next year, not only will the virus have been brought under reasonable control, but that we will -- we may be on the verge of having a vaccine. And I think an effective vaccine would ease a lot of the concerns. And don't forget that a lot of the folks at the highest risk are the old folks. And they may not make up..."

Is that something that has to be sort of put in people's back picture here?"

But we -- we -- life as we knew it was going to end because of the Zika virus back in 2016. And when Canada had the Olympics, Winter Games, in 2010, we had the H1N1 virus.
