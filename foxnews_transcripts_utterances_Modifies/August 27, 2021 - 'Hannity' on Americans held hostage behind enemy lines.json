      "sentences": "Americans held hostage now behind enemy lines and the timetable is coming fast. That's right.  As we are now fast approaching America's last weekend in Afghanistan, 13 of our brave soldiers are dead. They will never return home to their families.  More than a dozen others seriously wounded. A total death toll is now more than 170, over 200 people injured.  This as now thousands of our own citizens, our friends, our American family and yes, American allies remain trapped all across the country, all of them behind enemy lines, all of them hostage to the whim of the terror group known as the Taliban and others. And now, it's harder than ever to even get inside Hamad Karzai International Airport with reports that the Taliban could be in full control of that airport now in a matter of days, some are predicting as early as this weekend. Maybe the worst part is the death and destruction and carnage and chaos all easily preventable, so easily preventable.  Joe Biden is defiantly locked into his disastrous decision that has -- that has rendered us a failure here. Why he has tripled down on this failure is anyone's guess. Why he's abiding by the Taliban's deadline also a mystery tonight. Why he's not sending in additional troops to rescue every single solitary American behind enemy lines is unforgivable. Why he's so accepting of the idea that Americans will be left behind is beyond anything that any good American that I know of can comprehend. And sadly, tonight, that outcome seems inevitable. This was not an intelligence community failure Joe Biden ignored what are dozens and dozens of warnings on the ground and they've been given to him now for months, our sources confirming he ignored his own military advisors that too has been ongoing for months. He ignored the intel community, he ignored the Taliban's clear you can see the map with the time frame, their rapid advance from April to June to July to August and everywhere in between.  And yesterday, well, what do we see you know incoherent mumbling, bumbling, rambling press conference showing the entire world America's friends and allies and, yeah, hostile regimes and our foes our enemies alike that the United States of America has a cognitively weak, frail and completely out of touch president that is clinging to failed policies.   This is beyond a national embarrassment. Innocent people will likely die as a result of all of this, more will die. So congratulations Joe. This is your mission accomplished. Now at least American families will never be the same. Many more brave servicemen will struggle with serious injuries for the rest of their lives. And more than a hundred other innocent civilians have perished.   But when you think things couldn't get worse well you think again because today in a statement at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, earlier today, Jen Psaki warning that another terror attack in Kabul is likely. There will be another terror attack and there's nothing that we apparently can do? This is a nightmare, a failure of epic proportions. The worst foreign policy disasters, one of in our nation's history, with deadly, real-life consequences, and risks that remain higher than ever. Remember, just last week, Biden said any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at Karzai International Airport will be met with swift and forceful response. Well, now, that swift and forceful response is nowhere to be found. Just like so many other Biden promises, those words appear to be totally completely hollow, seemingly like what's in his head at most hours of the day.",

How will they ever get out? What are we doing to protect them? What will happen to Karzai International Airport in Kabul when we do pull out? What will Joe do if more Americans are murdered, like yesterday?  What will he do if the Taliban murders an Afghan with one of our special immigrant visa, the ones we made a pledge to if it ever came to this, we would get you the hell out of there? But we didn't keep our word to them. Many will die.   And Joe gave him a list of names so they now have a database biometrics and Joe's list. They're being hunted down as we speak. They will be executed one after another. How many Americans -- we still don't get an answer -- are still in Afghanistan? How many Americans have been evacuated? They don't know. How will he prevent the rise of ISIS or al Qaeda with no embassy, no intel presence on the ground? You know, they were at war with us, we weren't at war with them, that 9/11 commission report -- yeah, all the plotting and planning and scheming that took place inside of Afghanistan and the lead up to 9/11/2001, 20 years ago.  What will happen to the $83 billion that Joe Biden, the weapons that he left behind, the most powerful weaponry of any military force on the face of the Earth, now we gave it to terrorists? And is there any plan to secure  -- it's a little too late because now we have images of Taliban flying our Black Hawk attack helicopters, or riding around in our armored vehicles. Two hundred and eight helicopters and aircraft he left behind, how does Biden plan to vet what is now tens of thousands of Afghan refugees? Because as we speak, there are so many refugees flying into Washington, D.C. apparently, they're doing the vetting after people are in the air flying to this country. It's causing a massive bottleneck at Dulles International Airport.   We need to know how these individuals are being vetted. Reports that already over a hundred people that have come to America from Afghanistan are also on our terrorist watch list. Clearly, there are a lot of important questions that need to be answered and Joe Biden, his incoherent, mumbling and bumbling and unwillingness and inability to answer them is chilling.  Yesterday during a bizarre -- you know, one of his bizarre moments at that press conference, Joe Biden was completely dazed and confused with an image that went viral. Take a look.",

We don't leave our fellow citizens, our fellow Americans behind. We rescue our fellow Americans trapped behind enemy lines. We respond to terror attacks with overwhelming force. We have the greatest military on the face of the earth. We strike fear into the hearts of all of our enemies and instill confidence in all of our allies.   But under Biden none of that has happened and clearly will happen, made that clear yesterday. The one thing that was clear. No more military presence, we're getting out, we're sticking to the timetable and yeah, there'll be Americans left behind in all likelihood. Now, we're suffering the consequences of his real weaknesses in real time.  Mark my words: with so many trapped, this could all get so much worse before it gets better. And I pray that I am wrong. Our first guest tonight -- it comes from the -- you -- to the U.S. from northern Afghanistan. His boss, the so-called president of Afghanistan, reportedly fled the country many weeks ago with four cars and a helicopter full of millions and millions of dollars of cash.  But my next guest is the vice president of Afghanistan, still in the country, leading the resistance against the Taliban. And tonight, he is pledging to help any Americans that will be left behind. Amrullah Saleh is with us right now.  You're in the northern part of Afghanistan. I understand you have a very strong resistance that is growing by the day. I have reports on the ground that I've confirmed that you are leading the country. You're the de facto resistance leader of the country and you're rightful place considering that your president left.  And my question is, what would you need to ensure the safety of our Afghan allies, innocent Afghan citizens and Americans that will be left behind?  Because I want my fellow Americans brought home safely. AMRULLAH SALEH, AFGHAN OPPOSITION LEADER (via telephone): Well, we need two  -- three things to be done and these are doable things, and it will save the lives of Americans and it will most likely save the lives of millions of Afghans. Number one, Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda are celebrating the defeat of the United States. It is a must for Joe Biden's administration to take Pakistani state accountable. All the Taliban leaders who are in Kabul, including Haqqanis, they came from Pakistan. That is number one. Number two, they should make it very clear to the Taliban now who are in control of Kabul, that if one more attack is carried out, it will be Taliban responsible for it because few days back, we warned the Americans that the only way for Taliban to gain control of the Kabul airport is to stage suicide attacks or attacks and then blame it on ISIS. Otherwise, this fiasco is not going to end soon. So, for Taliban to say it is not us, Taliban are the creator of the suicide bombing thing in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, they cannot become innocent overnight.  Number three, United States must use its power of convening and power of bringing nations together to create an alliance for peace as it has created an alliance for war against terrorism. And they should not abandon Afghanistan. There's a lot the United States can do.  Today, the Afghans who are fools (ph), new (ph) arrival, and everybody watching, the super power seeming so weak. That should be averted. These are doable things. We are not asking you to re-escalate, come back militarily. We are asking United States to project confidence, hope, power. Not weakness, not desperation, not being seen as a super power on the run and unable to do anything. The United States --",

I can tell you that the vast, overwhelming, massive majority of Americans find that repulsive, sir. But with that said, I don't control the president, I don't control Congress.

So, Panjshir Valley today is not only a valley. It is the center, it is the safe haven and it is the capital for all of those who fear their lives, who are fearing Taliban terrorists, and who are trying to get to somewhere to feel safe. So with that said, what is our strength? The biggest strength we have is our political will, which unfortunately isn't there in Washington. The United States is capable of doing everything.  But the decision which was taken to withdraw troops from Afghanistan so abruptly was a political decision. It has hurt the feelings of so many American service members, the intelligence community, the strategic community. Look, I understand Washington was fatigued by paying few billion dollars and retaining 2,000 troops in Afghanistan. What you are seeing now, America is paying with its dignity, with its reputation and with its credibility. America must show will and power and it should project hope and confidence.",

But here's why this is so important going forward, we have to help them survive because what's going to happen and Biden's own intelligence community is saying this, the Taliban equals al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is going to come roaring back, they are going to attack the West again. That is absolutely going to happen, and we need to have somebody to work with when our future American soldiers have to go back again. The same crew that is around Biden was around Obama that led -- that yanked out of Iraq too fast and too soon, led to the ISIS caliphate, that launched attacks around the world.

We should take Bagram Air Force Base and connect it to the Panjshir Valley, and let it be an evacuation route for those left behind.

Some of it is part of deception operations, you know? I mean, if you're designated like al Qaeda is, as a terrorist organization, what do you do? You move your people into say the Taliban because they're not designated and you operate like that. But when General John Campbell's forces uncovered the largest al-Qaeda base in ever found anywhere in the world in October 2016, where was it? In southern Afghanistan, who was there 30 square miles where the Taliban and al-Qaeda were training together, were working together. I mean, they're marrying to each other's families for goodness sake. And you know, you just had the acting president of Afghanistan, the former vice president, Amrullah Saleh, who under the Afghan constitution is now president, now their leader. And he told me in an interview not so long ago that when they pick up these prisoners or when they pick them up from the battlefield and interrogate them, they find that today, they're ISIS, two weeks ago, they were Taliban.

It's right at 50/50, half want him gone, half want him to stay. But the part that wants him gone has been increased by about five points of the last few weeks, and the intensity is on all the recall side. People are angry at the cost of living, they're angry at the way this man shut down the state, Sean, while ignoring science while having his own kids enjoy in- person education at a private school, while he was sitting up there in the French laundry with the very people that drafted the mandates, who were not wearing masks, they were not engaged in social distancing and kids lost a whole year of in-person education. And they were already behind. Our test scores for math and reading are near the bottom of the country before the pandemic. And then you're talking about rising homelessness and for the very first time in this state's 170-year history, Sean, people are leaving. And that's why so many people, 1.7 million people signed that petition, to get rid of this guy. And about a third of them were independents and Democrats, so you can't call this some sort of Republican takeover and the majority of Hispanics now want him gone. In fact, we have we have a category called non-party preference. Normal states call them independents, and the majority of independents want him gone. So -- and, by the way, Sean, the voting has already begun. You're right the election is on September the 14th, but that's the final day. The voting has already begun. The ballots have already been sent to homes and people are already sending them in, and I understand around 10 percent of people have already voted. That's why I need the money now.

And regarding the rise in homelessness, Sean, when Gavin Newsom ran for mayor in San Francisco, I think it was 2004, he promised to clean up homelessness in 10 years. That would have been 2015. It's even worse now and when he became lieutenant governor he pounded the table for eight years claiming he had nothing to do. How about fulfilling your campaign promise about doing something about the homelessness. For all those reasons that's why in my opinion he's likely to be recalled and I'm way ahead by Republican rivals I'm not really worried about that part. I'm worried about the first part of the ballot. Again, 50-50, 50 percent plus one vote must vote to remove him.

      "utterance": "Americans held hostage now behind enemy lines and the timetable is coming fast. That's right. As we are now fast approaching America's last weekend in Afghanistan, 13 of our brave soldiers are dead. They will never return home to their families. More than a dozen others seriously wounded. A total death toll is now more than 170, over 200 people injured. This as now thousands of our own citizens, our friends, our American family and yes, American allies remain trapped all across the country, all of them behind enemy lines, all of them hostage to the whim of the terror group known as the Taliban and others. And now, it's harder than ever to even get inside Hamad Karzai International Airport with reports that the Taliban could be in full control of that airport now in a matter of days, some are predicting as early as this weekend. Maybe the worst part is the death and destruction and carnage and chaos all easily preventable, so easily preventable. Joe Biden is defiantly locked into his disastrous decision that has -- that has rendered us a failure here. Why he has tripled down on this failure is anyone's guess. Why he's abiding by the Taliban's deadline also a mystery tonight. Why he's not sending in additional troops to rescue every single solitary American behind enemy lines is unforgivable. Why he's so accepting of the idea that Americans will be left behind is beyond anything that any good American that I know of can comprehend. And sadly, tonight, that outcome seems inevitable. This was not an intelligence community failure Joe Biden ignored what are dozens and dozens of warnings on the ground and they've been given to him now for months, our sources confirming he ignored his own military advisors that too has been ongoing for months. He ignored the intel community, he ignored the Taliban's clear you can see the map with the time frame, their rapid advance from April to June to July to August and everywhere in between. And yesterday, well, what do we see you know incoherent mumbling, bumbling, rambling press conference showing the entire world America's friends and allies and, yeah, hostile regimes and our foes our enemies alike that the United States of America has a cognitively weak, frail and completely out of touch president that is clinging to failed policies. This is beyond a national embarrassment. Innocent people will likely die as a result of all of this, more will die. So congratulations Joe. This is your mission accomplished. Now at least American families will never be the same. Many more brave servicemen will struggle with serious injuries for the rest of their lives. And more than a hundred other innocent civilians have perished. But when you think things couldn't get worse well you think again because today in a statement at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, earlier today, Jen Psaki warning that another terror attack in Kabul is likely. There will be another terror attack and there's nothing that we apparently can do? This is a nightmare, a failure of epic proportions. The worst foreign policy disasters, one of in our nation's history, with deadly, real-life consequences, and risks that remain higher than ever. Remember, just last week, Biden said any attack on our forces or disruption of our operations at Karzai International Airport will be met with swift and forceful response. Well, now, that swift and forceful response is nowhere to be found. Just like so many other Biden promises, those words appear to be totally completely hollow, seemingly like what's in his head at most hours of the day."

What will Joe do if more Americans are murdered, like yesterday? What will he do if the Taliban murders an Afghan with one of our special immigrant visa, the ones we made a pledge to if it ever came to this, we would get you the hell out of there? But we didn't keep our word to them. Many will die. And Joe gave him a list of names so they now have a database biometrics and Joe's list. They're being hunted down as we speak. They will be executed one after another. How many Americans -- we still don't get an answer -- are still in Afghanistan? How many Americans have been evacuated? They don't know. How will he prevent the rise of ISIS or al Qaeda with no embassy, no intel presence on the ground? You know, they were at war with us, we weren't at war with them, that 9/11 commission report -- yeah, all the plotting and planning and scheming that took place inside of Afghanistan and the lead up to 9/11/2001, 20 years ago. What will happen to the $83 billion that Joe Biden, the weapons that he left behind, the most powerful weaponry of any military force on the face of the Earth, now we gave it to terrorists? And is there any plan to secure -- it's a little too late because now we have images of Taliban flying our Black Hawk attack helicopters, or riding around in our armored vehicles. Two hundred and eight helicopters and aircraft he left behind, how does Biden plan to vet what is now tens of thousands of Afghan refugees? Because as we speak, there are so many refugees flying into Washington, D.C. apparently, they're doing the vetting after people are in the air flying to this country. It's causing a massive bottleneck at Dulles International Airport. We need to know how these individuals are being vetted. Reports that already over a hundred people that have come to America from Afghanistan are also on our terrorist watch list. Clearly, there are a lot of important questions that need to be answered and Joe Biden, his incoherent, mumbling and bumbling and unwillingness and inability to answer them is chilling.

Number one, Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda are celebrating the defeat of the United States. It is a must for Joe Biden's administration to take Pakistani state accountable. All the Taliban leaders who are in Kabul, including Haqqanis, they came from Pakistan. That is number one. Number two, they should make it very clear to the Taliban now who are in control of Kabul, that if one more attack is carried out, it will be Taliban responsible for it because few days back, we warned the Americans that the only way for Taliban to gain control of the Kabul airport is to stage suicide attacks or attacks and then blame it on ISIS. Otherwise, this fiasco is not going to end soon. So, for Taliban to say it is not us, Taliban are the creator of the suicide bombing thing in Afghanistan over the past 20 years, they cannot become innocent overnight. Number three, United States must use its power of convening and power of bringing nations together to create an alliance for peace as it has created an alliance for war against terrorism. And they should not abandon Afghanistan. There's a lot the United States can do. Today, the Afghans who are fools (ph), new (ph) arrival, and everybody watching, the super power seeming so weak. That should be averted. These are doable things. We are not asking you to re-escalate, come back militarily. We are asking United States to project confidence, hope, power.

We're going to bring in a senator and a congressman in a minute. My question to you is, specifically, can you tell us how many -- how many fighters you have? What kind of equipment you have?

So, Panjshir Valley today is not only a valley. It is the center, it is the safe haven and it is the capital for all of those who fear their lives, who are fearing Taliban terrorists, and who are trying to get to somewhere to feel safe. So with that said, what is our strength? The biggest strength we have is our political will, which unfortunately isn't there in Washington. The United States is capable of doing everything. But the decision which was taken to withdraw troops from Afghanistan so abruptly was a political decision. It has hurt the feelings of so many American service members, the intelligence community, the strategic community. Look, I understand Washington was fatigued by paying few billion dollars and retaining 2,000 troops in Afghanistan.

We're going to have to smuggle them along the ground those that are left, into the Panjshir or across borders. And you have private organizations, Congress, and basically everybody but the White House taking this leadership role. But here's why this is so important going forward, we have to help them survive because what's going to happen and Biden's own intelligence community is saying this, the Taliban equals al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is going to come roaring back, they are going to attack the West again. That is absolutely going to happen, and we need to have somebody to work with when our future American soldiers have to go back again. The same crew that is around Biden was around Obama that led -- that yanked out of Iraq too fast and too soon, led to the ISIS caliphate, that launched attacks around the world. But we had the Kurds to go back to. We had bases in the region. In Afghanistan, we have nothing. Biden gave all of our bases away. Our local allies are being hunted down. All we have left is Vice President Saleh, a gentleman Ahmed Massoud, the son of the famous resistance fighter, and the Panjshir Valley.

It's just extraordinary. They know perfectly well that the Taliban and al-Qaeda and ISIS, the distinctions between these groups are just power struggles, internal power struggles. Some of it is part of deception operations, you know? I mean, if you're designated like al Qaeda is, as a terrorist organization, what do you do? You move your people into say the Taliban because they're not designated and you operate like that. But when General John Campbell's forces uncovered the largest al-Qaeda base in ever found anywhere in the world in October 2016, where was it? In southern Afghanistan, who was there 30 square miles where the Taliban and al-Qaeda were training together, were working together. I mean, they're marrying to each other's families for goodness sake. And you know, you just had the acting president of Afghanistan, the former vice president, Amrullah Saleh, who under the Afghan constitution is now president, now their leader. And he told me in an interview not so long ago that when they pick up these prisoners or when they pick them up from the battlefield and interrogate them, they find that today, they're ISIS, two weeks ago, they were Taliban. Two years ago, they were al-Qaeda, you know, and it's sort of an ongoing circle.

I was listening to the TV yesterday when the Taliban spokesman said there's no proof that Osama bin Laden perpetrated 9/11, you know, that kind of brazen talk tells you how they're feeling.

And so, they didn't have the urgency to get out. They closed an air force base that is under United States control, and they close it, and they scuttle it in favor of a Kabul airport that I have been to that is not very safe and secure.

When we come back, Vice President Kamala Harris supposed to stump for Gavin Newsom who is in real trouble tonight in this recall, and she canceled after the deadly suicide bombing in Kabul. Larry Elder who's leading the pack will join us next, straight ahead."

      "utterance": "All right. Now, failed California Governor Gavin Newsom appears to be on the verge of a total collapse ahead of the recall. That race is on September the 14th, coming quickly. And now, it looks like Vice President Kamala Harris will not be able to come and rescue Gavin. Harris was set to be the headliner at a rally to oppose Newsom's recall in San Francisco tonight, but she canceled her plans shortly after yesterday's deadly attacks in Kabul. This comes as Newsom continues to fall way behind in the polls. Here with reaction, he's leading by 11 points on question two, who would you pick to be the next governor? And that is gubernatorial candidate, long time friend of the show I might add, Larry Elder. I watched the attacks. We talked about that the last time. I want to go over these polls with you because I always thought question one was the hardest, Larry, and that was to remove Newsom. In terms of now CBS, latest poll they have, do -- we now have a very tight race. The Real Clear Politics average is \"to remove\" is leading \"do not remove\". He would need 50 percent. He's only 47 percent at do not remove. That is not good for Gavin Newsom. Anyway, the most recent survey had you know you up by 11 points. The closest Democrat is way behind you. Is this -- is there a potential now, real potential of a political earthquake in the state of California?"

      "utterance": "Well, as always, Sean. Thank you for having me on. Let me just first give my condolences to the service members who lost their lives and those who are injured and the Americans who are still trapped in in Afghanistan. But, yes, there is a excellent chance that this man is going to be removed. You're right about the first question. It's right in the margin of error. It's right at 50/50, half want him gone, half want him to stay. But the part that wants him gone has been increased by about five points of the last few weeks, and the intensity is on all the recall side. People are angry at the cost of living, they're angry at the way this man shut down the state, Sean, while ignoring science while having his own kids enjoy in- person education at a private school, while he was sitting up there in the French laundry with the very people that drafted the mandates, who were not wearing masks, they were not engaged in social distancing and kids lost a whole year of in-person education. And they were already behind. Our test scores for math and reading are near the bottom of the country before the pandemic. And then you're talking about rising homelessness and for the very first time in this state's 170-year history, Sean, people are leaving. And that's why so many people, 1.7 million people signed that petition, to get rid of this guy. And about a third of them were independents and Democrats, so you can't call this some sort of Republican takeover and the majority of Hispanics now want him gone. In fact, we have we have a category called non-party preference. Normal states call them independents, and the majority of independents want him gone. So -- and, by the way, Sean, the voting has already begun. You're right the election is on September the 14th, but that's the final day. The voting has already begun. The ballots have already been sent to homes and people are already sending them in, and I understand around 10 percent of people have already voted. That's why I need the money now. So I'm asking people to go to ElectElder.com  and throw something in the tip jar because he's going to outspend my side by about nine to one, maybe even ten to one."

      "utterance": "The COVID hypocrisy I think has gotten the attention of everyone in the state. So what is your main message? I've known you for years. I wouldn't -- you're a libertarian/conservative. You have been most of the years I've known you. You haven't changed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "No, my main message, Sean, is the number one responsibility of government is to protect people in property and we're having a rise in crime. Rising shootings, rise in homicides, in all the major cities in California and because of this defunding police movement, because of this false narrative that the police are engaging in systemic racism against cops, cops are pulling back and the very people who are hurt the most are black and brown people. And regarding the rise in homelessness, Sean, when Gavin Newsom ran for mayor in San Francisco, I think it was 2004, he promised to clean up homelessness in 10 years. That would have been 2015. It's even worse now and when he became lieutenant governor he pounded the table for eight years claiming he had nothing to do. How about fulfilling your campaign promise about doing something about the homelessness. For all those reasons that's why in my opinion he's likely to be recalled and I'm way ahead by Republican rivals I'm not really worried about that part. I'm worried about the first part of the ballot. Again, 50-50, 50 percent plus one vote must vote to remove him. So I'm urging people to recall Gavin Newsom and then of course to put my name in as a person to replace him."
