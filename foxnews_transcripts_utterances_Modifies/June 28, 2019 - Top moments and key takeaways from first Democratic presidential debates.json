But it was that one exchange that really, really struck a chord. And Kamala Harris, the senator from California, was prepared for it. It was planned. Her team tweeted out a picture of her. \"There was a little girl in California who was bussed to school. That little girl was me. #DemDebate.\" That was from last night.  If you look at the bullet points as far as searching, the searches for buses spiked 3,100 percent. Harris' name, 500 percent the second half of the debate. And then she became the top trending search topic in all of Google and the U.S. Twitter kind of matched those numbers as well. Let's bring in our panel, Marc Thiessen, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" OK, Marc, game changer last night?",

It was his inability to parry the attack from Kamala Harris which he should've known was coming. It was completely predictable. Biden is out of touch with his party, but the reason why he's leading the pack is because he's perceived as the most electable candidate. But last night he didn't looked very electable. He looked old, he looked tired, he looked unprepared.   Can he recover from that? Yes. There's 11 more debates and its six months to the Iowa caucuses. And if you think back to 1984 there was the famous first debate with Reagan and Walter Mondale where Reagan looked very confused and not on top of the facts, and he was already president. And in the next debate he came through with his famous line, I'm not going to take advantage of my opponent's youth and inexperience, and turned the whole thing around. So Biden didn't have a line like that. He needs a line like that.",

If you look at the bullet points as far as searching, the searches for buses spiked 3,100 percent. Harris' name, 500 percent the second half of the debate. And then she became the top trending search topic in all of Google and the U.S. Twitter kind of matched those numbers as well. Let's bring in our panel, Marc Thiessen, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" OK, Marc, game changer last night?"

He looked old, he looked tired, he looked unprepared. Can he recover from that? Yes. There's 11 more debates and its six months to the Iowa caucuses. And if you think back to 1984 there was the famous first debate with Reagan and Walter Mondale where Reagan looked very confused and not on top of the facts, and he was already president. And in the next debate he came through with his famous line, I'm not going to take advantage of my opponent's youth and inexperience, and turned the whole thing around.

And then you add to that, the proposal which everybody raised their hand and says I support decriminalization of illegal immigrants, everybody except Senator Bennet.

And it's because of the asylum laws. It all started in 2014. And now here's what you hear Democrats saying, its' the children, the children, the children. We need to deal with unaccompanied minors and children coming with families who are then separated. That has driven this debate to the left."

But keep in mind also that this is a force multiplier for all the spending that the Democrats have proposed, because if Medicare for all costs $32 trillion, that's for Americans. If you turn the country into a magnet for illegal immigrants to come in for all the free stuff, they are going to want free college, they're going to want free child care, they're going to want all the free stuff as well.

I would say that the president today, the outrageous thing that he did was to indulge in this lighthearted banter about getting rid of journalists with the president of a country where journalists are murdered for reporting, and one recently was just arrested by the police for reporting honestly, not just on what Putin does, but local government corruption and that sort of thing. That was a bad moment."

Donald Trump is in a very strong position to negotiate here. The U.S. economy is booming, 3.1 percent growth. Our biggest problem is that we have 1.6 million more unfilled jobs and we have people to fill them. China's economy is contracting, the tariffs are hurting them. So Trump sees our economic strength against their relative economic weakness as a force multiplier for them."

It's been one of the things he strongly wanted to have accomplished and pull that off this week. My loser this week, I'm going to pick Bernie Sanders. In a weird way, Bernie is a victim of his own success. The party has adopted so much of his agenda over the last few years that he no longer stands out the way he did one on one with Hillary, and I think he looked a little lost in that second debate."

My loser, sadly, is Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. Women's national team who refuses to put her hand over her heart during the national anthem. She's a great athlete. I respect her political views and her right to hold them, and I even support the push for gender equality. But she's playing for team USA. You cannot insult the stars and stripes while wearing the stars and stripes."

While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the border, the DMZ, just to shake his hand and say hello.\" Right now, there is no plan to have any meeting at the DMZ. This is a tweet, and the president suggesting that ahead of his meeting with the Chinese president, so we will follow this development to see if it all comes together.
