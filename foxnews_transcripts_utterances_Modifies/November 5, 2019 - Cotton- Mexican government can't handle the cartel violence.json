He was very aggressive with the media, very aggressive with his opponents, even before he was a governor, going back to his challenge of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. And so he tried out a lot of these populist techniques that President Trump later employed to greater success. But what's interesting is that it didn't exactly work for him at the local level. He has the ignominious reputation as the least popular governor in the country because of a lot of the ways that he's handled himself there in Kentucky.   And like we reported over at RealClearPolitics a month ago, what he has been trying to do to save his seat is wed his reelection to the impeachment inquiry of President Trump.

And it can come back and bite them in the fanny. I think that's exactly what's happening here. You got a president that, every time there's a new high, says, you're welcome and enjoy spending your money. And I just think that, at some juncture, comes back to bite you. I also think that the this is an economy that has underwhelmed, necessarily, and certainly in 2019, we're kind of back to trend. And the trend is OK. The trend is good enough for all-time highs in the market, and it's good enough for a good third-quarter earnings reporting season, but it's not a bragging point.

So, this president deserves more credit. I disagree with Art. We have the highest median income in the history of our country. Incomes have gone up over $5,000, real dollars. When you add in the tax reform, it's another $1,500, over $6,000. Obama, they went up over $1,000 over an eight-year period, seven-and-a- half, you take out the recession.

I mean, obviously, people want to hear about jobs. And in the battleground states, they want to make sure that those -- that is, Republicans want to make sure that those unemployment rates stay low. They're lower than where they were when the president first got elected. But they're higher from the levels that they were a little more than a year ago. How does this play out?",

We have this amazing phenomenon in the country, which is new in the Trump era, of more than a million more open positions, open jobs waiting to be filled than we have unemployed Americans. This has never happened in a few decades of the government keeping these statistics. So I think that does resonate. That's why in polls typically the president doesn't get a great approval rating, except on the economy. For that to continue, though, I think he really does need to resolve this China trade dispute.

We have consistently seen, the more constructive we get on the tone on U.S.-China trade, the better the market does. And the opposite is certainly true. We saw that in the month of May. We certainly saw that for the entire month of August. So I agree with you 100 percent.

I'm going to start with a phone call, part of the transcript, not the call between the president of Ukraine and the president of the United States, but a call between Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and the president of the United States. And this is in the deposition that was released today.  Sondland said to President Trump -- quote -- \"I asked him one open-ended question. What do you want from Ukraine? And as I recall, he was in a very bad mood. It was a very quick conversation. He said: 'I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing'\" and says President Trump hung up on him. Now, I'm going to direct you to another element of the transcript which we got today. And one element, one word we might start to focus in on here is the word presumed. And this is also from Gordon Sondland and the transcript released this afternoon -- quote -- \"I presumed the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\" And Republicans are seizing on that word presumed, that Gordon Sondland wasn't really saying there was a potential quid pro quo there, but this was just his presumption, his interpretation of events. And that's why, when you parse these statements and go through the transcripts, it's very much subject to interpretation. Democrats are going to say one thing.

It's pretty apparent from that resolution that the House passed last week that the Intelligence Committee for sure will have hearings. But Jim Jordan isn't on that committee. I'm going to use a sports analogy here. In ice hockey, you want to have the best matchup, and this is where, if you're playing hockey, the visiting team has to put their players on the ice first, and then the home team, they put their players on the ice second. They look at who the visitors put out there. And then they try to get the best matchup. So what the Republicans are trying to do is get the best matchup. But with the Select Committee on Intelligence -- Select Committee, that's a very key, important term here -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she is the one that has last change. She could potentially veto putting Jim Jordan on the Select Committee. And this sort of change, a change of player personnel, is so rare on Capitol Hill, nobody knows if that's the case. But you could see why Republicans would want to have Jim Jordan out there fighting for President Trump.  He's obviously been one of the president's most ardent defenders.",

First of all, in the revised testimony that the ambassador to the E.U., Gordon Sondland, gave on Monday, he says that he does now recall telling a couple of people, Bill Taylor, who was the highest-ranking diplomat in Ukraine, as well as Tim Morrison, who is the former Russia expert here at the NSC, that it looked like there was a quid pro quo between Ukraine aid, U.S. aid to Ukraine, and the Ukraine launching an investigation into corruption, including Burisma. But Sondland also says in this revised statement, I -- quote -- \"presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\" Doesn't say, I know. He says, I presumed. And in his testimony, Kurt Volker told investigators he saw no quid pro quo. Volker said: \"Well, you asked what conversations did I have about that quid pro quo, et cetera. None, because I didn't there was a quid pro quo.\" So the White House has taken these two specific things and put out a statement about them, saying: \"Both transcripts released today show that there is even less evidence for this illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought. Ambassador Sondland squarely states that he didn't know and still doesn't know when, why, or by whom the aid was suspended. He also said he presumed there was a link to the aid, but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption. \"By contrast, Volker's testimony confirms there could not have been a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians didn't know about the military aid hold at the time.\" So the White House, despite the fact that Sondland went back and revised his testimony to a degree that a lot of people are now saying, well, there it is, there's the smoking gun, the White House is still saying that these two witnesses are beneficial to them. Also, the White House is going to come out in a little while with a statement about the invitation for Mick Mulvaney to come up on Friday and talk to the three committees that are investigating potential impeachment articles against the president. The White House was thinking of just putting out a statement saying he's not going to show, but something a little more colorful than that may be coming down the line, Neil, because I think the White House wants to stand its ground here and really show the flag in terms of this idea of executive privilege before Congress -- Neil.",

I think Sondland thought, well, maybe they're laying a trap for me here. So he went back and said, after talking to a couple people, I do recall now telling Ambassador William Taylor and Tim Morrison and the Ukrainians that I think that aid was conditioned on this idea of corruption investigations.

He was very aggressive with the media, very aggressive with his opponents, even before he was a governor, going back to his challenge of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. And so he tried out a lot of these populist techniques that President Trump later employed to greater success. But what's interesting is that it didn't exactly work for him at the local level. He has the ignominious reputation as the least popular governor in the country because of a lot of the ways that he's handled himself there in Kentucky. And like we reported over at RealClearPolitics a month ago, what he has been trying to do to save his seat is wed his reelection to the impeachment inquiry of President Trump. He's trying to make this a us vs. them election. And he's hoping that with Trump's visit to the state that that can take him to the finish line."

And it can come back and bite them in the fanny. I think that's exactly what's happening here. You got a president that, every time there's a new high, says, you're welcome and enjoy spending your money. And I just think that, at some juncture, comes back to bite you. I also think that the this is an economy that has underwhelmed, necessarily, and certainly in 2019, we're kind of back to trend. And the trend is OK. The trend is good enough for all-time highs in the market, and it's good enough for a good third-quarter earnings reporting season, but it's not a bragging point.

So, this president deserves more credit. I disagree with Art. We have the highest median income in the history of our country. Incomes have gone up over $5,000, real dollars. When you add in the tax reform, it's another $1,500, over $6,000. Obama, they went up over $1,000 over an eight-year period, seven-and-a- half, you take out the recession.

I mean, obviously, people want to hear about jobs. And in the battleground states, they want to make sure that those -- that is, Republicans want to make sure that those unemployment rates stay low. They're lower than where they were when the president first got elected. But they're higher from the levels that they were a little more than a year ago. How does this play out?"

That's why in polls typically the president doesn't get a great approval rating, except on the economy. For that to continue, though, I think he really does need to resolve this China trade dispute. And you see that signal from investors every day. When it looks like we're getting some kind of deal, the market goes up. And when we get bad news on that front, it goes down."

The more optimistic investors are about a China deal, the more they buy, the less optimistic or concerned they are, the less so. There was growing indications today that both sides are going to remove tariffs, many of which were -- in this country were going to kick in next month, and that had the buyers out. What do you think?"

And I would say that if we were able to put the U.S.-China trade war at least in a compartment and say, we're not going to escalate from here, we have completed phase one, there's not a great deal of uncertainty because you know it's not getting worse, yes, but the tougher hurdles like I.P. theft and forced technology transfer will be difficult in 2020's business, I think the market was celebrate that. We have consistently seen, the more constructive we get on the tone on U.S.-China trade, the better the market does. And the opposite is certainly true. We saw that in the month of May. We certainly saw that for the entire month of August. So I agree with you 100 percent. If we can put this in the rear-view mirror, I certainly think that helps this administration and the polls in 2020. And I think they're going to try to choreograph that news around that. It makes a great deal of sense."

And I think that doesn't help the China situation, right, because if they think that this president's going to be someone they don't have deal with, then they're going to try to outwait him. But China needs this deal more than we do. They are at 6 percent growth, the worst growth they have in almost three decades. They have got more of an issue. Their supply chains are leaving en masse. They have got to deal with this and they have got to deal with this president. And so I would appreciate the impeachment dying down, so that we can actually get this trade deal. I agree with both James and Art. We have got to get this trade deal ironed up and sealed tight."

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER",
      "utterance": "Hey. I'm going to start with a phone call, part of the transcript, not the call between the president of Ukraine and the president of the United States, but a call between Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and the president of the United States. And this is in the deposition that was released today. Sondland said to President Trump -- quote -- \"I asked him one open-ended question. What do you want from Ukraine? And as I recall, he was in a very bad mood. It was a very quick conversation. He said: 'I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing'\" and says President Trump hung up on him. Now, I'm going to direct you to another element of the transcript which we got today. And one element, one word we might start to focus in on here is the word presumed. And this is also from Gordon Sondland and the transcript released this afternoon -- quote -- \"I presumed the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\" And Republicans are seizing on that word presumed, that Gordon Sondland wasn't really saying there was a potential quid pro quo there, but this was just his presumption, his interpretation of events. And that's why, when you parse these statements and go through the transcripts, it's very much subject to interpretation. Democrats are going to say one thing. Republicans are going to say something else. The reason, Neil, is because most people won't read the transcripts, they will listen to the news and listen to interpretations."

      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "Right. And that's why probably, in about a week's time, we will start to get some polling on this. And this is why who the people are fighting on Capitol Hill are so important. There's been a lot of chatter the past couple of days here about possibly moving Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, to the Intelligence Committee. It's pretty apparent from that resolution that the House passed last week that the Intelligence Committee for sure will have hearings. But Jim Jordan isn't on that committee. I'm going to use a sports analogy here. In ice hockey, you want to have the best matchup, and this is where, if you're playing hockey, the visiting team has to put their players on the ice first, and then the home team, they put their players on the ice second. They look at who the visitors put out there. And then they try to get the best matchup. So what the Republicans are trying to do is get the best matchup. But with the Select Committee on Intelligence -- Select Committee, that's a very key, important term here -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she is the one that has last change. She could potentially veto putting Jim Jordan on the Select Committee. And this sort of change, a change of player personnel, is so rare on Capitol Hill, nobody knows if that's the case. But you could see why Republicans would want to have Jim Jordan out there fighting for President Trump. He's obviously been one of the president's most ardent defenders."

The Ukraine government recognizes that they have corruption problems, and we expect the president to step up and point to a commitment to ending corruption and graft in his administration or across the whole of the Ukraine. That doesn't rise to the level that they're trying to make it, an impeachable offense, nor did they original transcript or the whistle-blower complaint.

Now, they voted last week. You had two Democrats join Republicans saying they shouldn't move forward. They look like -- as they have for the past three years, they're just looking for a way to negate the election of 2016. They will have a chance to have the voters decide the next president in 2020.

We get the Japanese trade agreement passed, we get the first phase of several phases of trade agreements with China passed, I think we will see an economic bump.

But Sondland also says in this revised statement, I -- quote -- \"presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\" Doesn't say, I know. He says, I presumed."

Ambassador Sondland squarely states that he didn't know and still doesn't know when, why, or by whom the aid was suspended. He also said he presumed there was a link to the aid, but cannot identify any solid source for that assumption. \"By contrast, Volker's testimony confirms there could not have been a quid pro quo because the Ukrainians didn't know about the military aid hold at the time.\" So the White House, despite the fact that Sondland went back and revised his testimony to a degree that a lot of people are now saying, well, there it is, there's the smoking gun, the White House is still saying that these two witnesses are beneficial to them. Also, the White House is going to come out in a little while with a statement about the invitation for Mick Mulvaney to come up on Friday and talk to the three committees that are investigating potential impeachment articles against the president. The White House was thinking of just putting out a statement saying he's not going to show, but something a little more colorful than that may be coming down the line, Neil, because I think the White House wants to stand its ground here and really show the flag in terms of this idea of executive privilege before Congress -- Neil."

I think Sondland thought, well, maybe they're laying a trap for me here. So he went back and said, after talking to a couple people, I do recall now telling Ambassador William Taylor and Tim Morrison and the Ukrainians that I think that aid was conditioned on this idea of corruption investigations. So now he has squared himself with Congress.

But I will say again, if the Mexican government can't protect Americans inside of Mexico, then America may have to take matters into our own hands. We showed that we can do it last week in Syria. We showed eight years ago that we can do it in Pakistan during the Usama bin Laden raid. This is only 50 miles away from our southern border.

They are not allowed to be enriching uranium under the Iran deal that the Obama administration negotiated at the Fordow site. But the Obama administration's deal never converted or required a conversion of that nuclear site into a purely civil site. It was a military site. And so everything that was there before the deal is still there. And so now the Iranians are threatening to begin work again at that site.

I mean, well, technically not violating what they had told the president, even though others argue they're certainly tempting fate, they get more and more provocative, in the hope that will bring the U.S. to the table. I would imagine just the opposite. The same with Iran. But it's a weird strategy."

    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "Well, this is particularly strange -- well, not strange behavior, but bad for the Iranians, because they're humiliating the Trump administration in a way. The Trump administration just once again authorized civil nuclear waivers, to allow some civil non-military nuclear work to continue with the Iranians, in the hopes of having some leverage with the Iranians to try to actually negotiate a better deal, to have -- to keep an eye on some of what goes on at those sites. But days after those waivers were issued, the Iranians make this announcement that they're going to continue -- that they're going to now escalate its provocative behavior at those sites. So it is -- it's embarrassing for the Trump administration's approach, which is supposed to be a maximum pressure campaign towards the Iranians to try to compel them to change their behavior."

      "utterance": "All of this, of course, as we just look back at the 40th anniversary of the seizing of those American hostages in Tehran during the Carter administration. And now I'm seeing the same video or film then, video now, of \"Death to America,\" burn the American flag. It's like that great '70s show all over."

    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "It is. I will say there too, Neil, sometimes, Americans get impatient for fix the problem, get this regime under control. And, sometimes, it's just a long slog. Under the Trump administration, at least now that the deal has mostly been done away with, we're not in -- we're no longer enabling the Iranians with all of these funds and sanctions relief to funds their proxies, their -- the terrorist groups that they have been funding across the region. And so we have seen a lot of those funds dry up. And now the Iranian military has continued to having to cut a lot of their resources because of the pressure that the United States government has placed upon them. So, sometimes, it just takes a long time to compel and squeeze a regime like Iran. We have moved a lot of military assets back into the region during the Trump administration to try to deter them, especially after that attack against those Saudi oil fields. So you got to kind of buckle in and take a while sometimes to pressure a change in behavior."

      "utterance": "We shall see. Rebeccah, I always learn a lot. Thank you very, very much, Rebeccah Heinrichs, following this from the Hudson Institute. Meanwhile, who needs a $15 minimum wage, an hourly wage, when along comes a major bank to say, we're going to up that, make it $20? After this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, I will take your $15 and -- well, anyway, forget the battle for 15 bucks an hour. Bank of America just upping its minimum wage to $20 an hour. So, are the free markets taking care of what some on the left have been saying the United States government should? Not so fast, according to Democratic strategist Shavar Jeffries, who says that the fight is still needed, hike everyone's pay. But Independent Women's Forum president Carrie Lukas says, let private companies like Bank of America do just that. So, Shavar, you're looking at this and saying, not enough, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAVAR JEFFRIES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. I mean, as is the best of American capitalism, it's a mix between the public and the private. It's a beautiful thing that Bank of America wants to pay its wage -- its workers a better wage, wants to share greater earnings and returns with its workers in the form of higher income, hopefully benefits as well. That's a beautiful thing. We need more employers to step up and do that as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But not every employee can be a Bank of America, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Well, that's why -- well, we have many employers, though, frankly, where there's -- that are reporting historic earnings, historic returns in terms of earnings, and we need more employers to share those returns with their workers. But at the same time, we are going to need the government to push people to say that, in the United States of America, if you work hard for 40 hours a week, you should be able to take care of your family, and too many families are unable to do so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, that's a good point. But I do distinguish, Carrie, between very wealthy, bigger than colossus bank like Bank of America offering this, and let's say a small, medium- sized business owner. Not everyone is a Fortune 500 company."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARRIE LUKAS, PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. This is something Bank of America can afford to do to, to keep and retain good workers. But other companies are going to have to have different strategies. And let's remember that not all workers want -- just want higher wages. Some are going to perform other kinds of compensation, whether it's more benefits, more leave time, greater flexibility. So we should let workers and businesses find the best match between them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, Carrie, are you surprised that -- and many more businesses of all sides have been pushing and getting closer to that $15-an-hour-level. And it hasn't caused this economic nightmare that some had feared?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUKAS",
      "utterance": "Well, this is because we have a strong economy. You have historic low unemployment rates. So banks -- and Bank of America and other employers are having to compete. And that's because they have resources. If profits go down, they wouldn't be able to continue paying these wages. So we need to be careful and not throw this into jeopardy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Shavar, the flip of that is, if you -- if we do enter a slowdown, it's not as if we repealed recessions. It's just been a long time since we had one. But there will be a slowdown. There will be a recession. I think that's - - that's clear. We don't know when. And then, if you lock a lot of businesses into a $20 hourly wage or thereabouts, they're not going to be able to deal with it down the road, when things dramatically slow down. A lot of people could lose their jobs. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Democrats generally propose minimum wage rules that actually have carve-outs for very small businesses; $20 an hour, let's be clear, that's $800 for a full workweek. Very few families in this country can afford to take care of their family with that, pay for health care, pay for college."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, what do you think a minimum wage should be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think we have to have a living wage, and that's going to be a different wage in different parts of the country. I mean, obviously, it costs more to live in certain parts of the country. And we need to have wage policies that reflect..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, not even $20 is good enough?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "What I'm saying is that what employers ought to do is, they should want to employ people in such a way that they can actually take care of their families. That's what employers want to do, before we even talk about the government. I would hope any employer would say they want to pay their workers to be able to live."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Carrie, what do you think of that? It's the company's obligation to do it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUKAS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Not everyone is trying to take care of a family. We need to make sure that you also have opportunities for teenagers to -- people who've had long-term unemployment, people coming out of prison. They're not going to be -- these companies are not going to take a chance on someone like that at $20 an hour."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Of course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUKAS",
      "utterance": "We have to make sure that there are jobs for people and opportunities to get in the door. This idea of $20 or more for everyone, that's just going to lock a lot of people out of the work force entirely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "The idea that it's unheard of to pay a worker so that they can actually take care of their family, at a time when 40 percent of Americans report that they couldn't handle an unexpected $400 bill, we should push more..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUKAS",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, well, we will watch it. The debate ensues right now. Bank of America wants to make this the policy here, but it will respond to market forces as necessary. So, we will see what the fallout of that will be. Again, just to remind you, we have two more records to tell you about today, the Dow and the Nasdaq. So that's the wind at this economy's back.
