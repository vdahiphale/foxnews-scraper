So after getting hammered for appropriating Native Americanism, Liz now wants to be AOC, as the other Democrats realize that blaming Trump for everything in good times is essentially crediting him for the good times. So, now, it's back to climate doom. But if they believe we will destroy earth if we don't act drastically, shouldn't they be disabling planes, trains, and automobiles instead of using them? What hypocrites.  And what broken records, apocalyptic thinking has been around forever. The World War was supposed to end on a million yesterdays. Yet, the left keeps resurrecting that one thought. We are all going to die. But it raises a huge question. If the left can't come up with a way to solve terror, crime, or homelessness, why should we listen to them about a problem that's the size of the earth? There were 144,000 arrests on the southern border last month. You don't want to solve that little problem? Then shut up about the earth. You are in over your head. But issues are always hampered by hysteria, especially when it is delivered like a champ from a doomsday cult. Climate change may be an existential threat, but only to the sanity of Democrats.

And law enforcement agencies across the country and particularly in these big schools are very, very vigilant about administering that training. So for him say that everything went so fast he wasn't scared, that's not really what happened. Anyone who's been through one of these incredibly traumatic events, especially in law enforcement, knows that time slows down, but also your training allows you to account for that. And I'm pretty sure his training didn't tell him to go hide by a stairwell and then lie about it.

And I'm I said, well, I didn't know she was nasty. I wasn't referring to her. I said she was nasty about me. And essentially, I didn't know she was nasty about me.

U.K. outlets opting for more positive headlines touting Trump's praise of eternal friendship, common values, and the treasured friendship between the U.S. and the U.K. But the U.S. media, they just can't seem to help themselves.

He said there is more of a groundswell of support for President Trump in Britain that a lot of times people who wanted to leave the European Union get ignored in the media. It's a very similar story. And that they wish that Theresa May had been a little bit more like President Trump when she was fighting with the E.U. about leaving, because she kept trying to like accommodate and they don't want to accommodate Europe anymore. So I don't know where it goes from here, but I do think that the U.K. had a very successful visit. And the President has a lot to be proud of. And there is still more to come."

After each quote, his head was exploding. You could hear him pulling at his hair going oh, my God, he's like the neighbor from Bewitched, right. He's going absolutely nuts. So, this is -- when you focus on the words, you create your very own mental health problem that nobody else can see. If you focus on the deeds, however, what's going on with trade, jobs, GDP, North Korea, China, what we are doing with opioids, our military strength, this is a golden age. If you keep focusing on the words, you end up having these delusions like you do on CNN and like this young woman on that other show. Also, I would like to say that I have said before that Trump is a news potato. You can make him into any meal, French fries, you can also make him into Shepherd's Pie because he served it up. He served it up. He had a hearty blend of news and entertainment."

People go what, he wants to bring American private enterprise into our much beloved you know public-sector healthcare system. So I think people were upset about that. And with the Meghan Markle stuff, he says he was talking about her comment. I just say is this a kind of difference without distinction? Because I think he has a history of calling people like Hillary Clinton a nasty woman, right. He said this about Senator Elizabeth Warren. He said this about Kamala Harris. He says Omarosa is a dog. He says Rosie O'Donnell is a dog. I know how this guy talks and speaks about people who are critical or have strong differences with him. So to me, you know..."

And I really enjoyed watching her. Because I don't think she was trolling him, I think she had a great time.

She would put the whole thing on hold until they fix the emissions in the Sherman tanks. So climate change is worse than Hitler? Could be since just the thought makes me fume. So after getting hammered for appropriating Native Americanism, Liz now wants to be AOC, as the other Democrats realize that blaming Trump for everything in good times is essentially crediting him for the good times. So, now, it's back to climate doom. But if they believe we will destroy earth if we don't act drastically, shouldn't they be disabling planes, trains, and automobiles instead of using them? What hypocrites. And what broken records, apocalyptic thinking has been around forever. The World War was supposed to end on a million yesterdays. Yet, the left keeps resurrecting that one thought. We are all going to die. But it raises a huge question. If the left can't come up with a way to solve terror, crime, or homelessness, why should we listen to them about a problem that's the size of the earth? There were 144,000 arrests on the southern border last month. You don't want to solve that little problem? Then shut up about the earth. You are in over your head. But issues are always hampered by hysteria, especially when it is delivered like a champ from a doomsday cult. Climate change may be an existential threat, but only to the sanity of Democrats. You know, Kennedy, the Democrats could've solved immigration in a lunch hour, but couldn't. But I guess climate changes easier."

And as you know since Columbine, every single one of these officers across country and especially in Florida where you have these very densely populated high schools where these kids are sitting ducks, they get an incredible amount of training. And law enforcement agencies across the country and particularly in these big schools are very, very vigilant about administering that training. So for him say that everything went so fast he wasn't scared, that's not really what happened. Anyone who's been through one of these incredibly traumatic events, especially in law enforcement, knows that time slows down, but also your training allows you to account for that. And I'm pretty sure his training didn't tell him to go hide by a stairwell and then lie about it. And if I were one of the parents of the injured or one of the 17 kids who died because of his inaction, this is -- this is only moderately satisfying."

And if he had said when the first responders came in, the shooting is from the inside, he would've had to have gone in. But he was too scared. So he acted confused and that's why everybody set-up a perimeter, and that's the exact opposite of what his training told him to do. Now, Florida has passed a new law that says that people, if they volunteer in these schools, they can get training to arm themselves, and that the President's commission to study this. And they're getting rid of Obama's diversionary program where students can get like four or five misdemeanors per year and not get reported to police and get to stay in the school.

Since then, we know that there have been other attempts at mass shootings, including at schools, where other students unarmed, but also training to be Junior ROTC officers or some sort of military junior officer, they are the ones who stopped the shooter out of bravery.

And instead of CNN or any of these other companies talking about that, they want to dox and shame and humiliate some black conservative who lives in the Bronx. The media does this all the time, Juan. Look at Conan O'Brien. He puts Trump's face up, the lips move and they do a little mouth over whatever.  \"The Daily Show\" or \"The Colbert Report\" made millions of dollars on deceptively edited satirical videos that went viral and everybody got a big kick out of it. Hard news media does it, too. CNN deceptively edited the video of President Trump feeding the fish in Japan to make him look undiplomatic.  How about when \"Time\" magazine darkened O.J.'s mug shot on their cover?"

And you know, speaking of deception, Robert Muller actually edited out some exculpatory information from a phone call from Trump's lawyers to make him look bad. So it happens all the time on that side, but the press doesn't like it when an average American does it."

They're going to target you and what constitutes a target is the expanding bullseye of demonization is anything thing not in the resistance, so that's why you can go after a kid in a red hat. Right? Covington -- the Covington kid was an easy target. A forklift operator, itinerant forklift, now he by posting a video parody is now a target. You can target anybody.
