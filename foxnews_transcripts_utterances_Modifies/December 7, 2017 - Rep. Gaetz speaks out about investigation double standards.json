      "sentences": "I have some incredible news to share with the Fox viewers tonight. Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Senator Al Franken is offering a not so funny farewell. The man who was accused of multiple groping and other stuff will resign, but no apologies, no admission of guilt, just accusations. Lashing out, of course, against President Trump and Senate candidate, Roy Moore.  As predicted, Franken was a victim of the P.C. lynch mob. Now there's a backlash against \"The Ingraham Angle\" for identifying the real cause of his ousting. It was all a cynical political ploy.  And a huge development at the Justice Department, a top official demoted after reportedly, as we thought, coordinating with the law firm pedaling that infamous anti-Trump Russian dossier.  We begin with the fall of the liberal icon comedian, Al Franken, and the \"me too\" pandemic. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Look, Franken really had no choice after most of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate called on him to quit. Listen closely to his statement today.",

As we explained in the ANGLE last night, the Dems did not suddenly become beacons of morality wagging their fingers at everyone else because they're on the moral high ground. This was a crass political ploy. Democrats dumping Franken overboard because now that they can claim the moral high ground for 2018 and pursue allegations against Donald Trump and Roy Moore.",

The Washington Post wrote, \"Al Franken finds unlikely defenders on Fox News.\" The Huffington Post, almost identical, \"Meet Al Franken's Republican Defenders.\" Mediaite, \"Laura Ingrahm, Newt Gingrich Defend Franken From Dem Lynch Mob.\" News flash, we weren't defending Franken. We were defending the notion that one should be considered innocent until proven guilty.  You see, the real story here, what we were warning you about, is this -- it's kind of a P.C. Polgram underway with a nasty political edge to it. They're dropping like flies now. Former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr. was fired today by Morgan Stanley for allegedly several years ago grabbing a woman. He was trying to take her out to drinks. She didn't like that. Now he's vowing to sue the woman and Morgan Stanley, that it never happened. Congressman Trent Franks, he announced today that he's going to step down rather than endure an investigation for having what he called a discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates. This takes the cake.  Now, look, we need to be careful here, you, myself, everyone, that we don't get so caught up in the white heat of the \"me too\" movement that lives and careers are destroyed without much evidence and in a flash.  Look, there are credible allegations out there. There's creeps that need to be shown the door. No doubt about it. We also have to be weary of what I call the \"me too\" flu. The gender opportunists that come out of the wood work with allegations many, many years later because it serves a political or personal end. Are any of you getting tired of the sudden explosion of moral piety spewing from those who ended up enabling the real abusers by looking the other way because it was politically expedient to do so for years? Me too. That's THE ANGLE.  Joining us now with reaction, attorney and GOP official, Harmeet Dhillon along with Democrat Capri Cafaro, former minority leader in the Ohio State Senate.   Harmeet, let's start with you. I mean, I'm not a fan of Al Franken, he and have clashed a lot politically over the years, and I found him actually personally quite nasty, but I'm getting a little bit worried about where this is all going. Because the Democrats clearly would not have acted against Al Franken if they had the White House and they had had a decent majority in the Senate. This was so they could tar Trump and go after Roy Moore. I have no doubt in my mind.",

You know, look at the leader of the pack, Kristin Gillibrand, who last year was campaigning happily with Bill Clinton, sent him thank you tweets and thinks it's all hanky-dory.  When it's expedient to throw the Clintons overboard, which they have done, now they've done that as well. So, I think this whole \"me too\" movement has been enabled by the fact that the Democrats are no longer held back by the Clinton dynasty.  Because for all these years, everybody knew it was wrong what was happening, yet they couldn't say anything because the leaders of their party were the ones doing the offending and the demeaning and the shaming and the blaming and all of those bad things. And so, now it's a new day, but I think they're going a little bit overboard here. I'm not sure Al Franken based on his comments today is truly with the program.",

The good news is the winds have not come back as once feared. Bad news, you still see a number of flanks of this fire, the Thomas fire, burning. You can see threatening home in this area outside of Ventura between Ventura and Ohi, which is basically about an hour or so north and west of Los Angeles. This fire has chewed up more than 115,000 acres since Monday night and several hundred homes. While this fire burns here in a number of locations and pretty spread out, there's a new fire that started today in San Diego called the Lilac fire. That burned more than 3,000 acres and several homes in San Diego. But 18,000 people have been evacuated down there because of the conditions. As you can tell, these conditions are still rough and steep and difficult terrain in many cases, and a lot of the cities haven't burned -- the areas around them haven't burned in a long time, including here in Ventura and Santa Barbara County. So, right now, this is the firefight that firefighters are facing. Obviously, not a lot of air support this time of night. In fact, we haven't seen many helicopters at all. The good news, there's no winds in this area right now at least in this area, and they are hoping it stays that way. But again, the red flag warnings remain here in California until midday on Saturday -- Laura.",

And while that hearing was unfolding, Fox News reported another potential conflict involving an Obama holdover. They're coming out of the wood work. This time at the Justice Department. Bruce Orr was demoted and stripped of his title, associate deputy attorney general, yesterday morning after the House Intel Committee learned that he met during the 2016 campaign with Christopher Steele, the former British spy that authored the infamous Russian dossier.  Joining us now to discuss is Republican congressman from Florida, Matt Gaetz and Democratic strategist, Joel Payne, who was deputy national press secretary and former senate majority leader, Harry Reid's guy. Great to see you both. Joel, let's start with you. There are a lot of people working for this investigation that are political adversaries of the president. If the shoe were on the other foot and this was an investigation of Hillary Clinton and the investigation was stacked with anti-Hillary prosecutors, you guys would be going crazy. We have Peter Strozk in this case who has been sending anti-Trump texts during the debate. He was at every big interview.

The man who was accused of multiple groping and other stuff will resign, but no apologies, no admission of guilt, just accusations. Lashing out, of course, against President Trump and Senate candidate, Roy Moore. As predicted, Franken was a victim of the P.C. lynch mob. Now there's a backlash against \"The Ingraham Angle\" for identifying the real cause of his ousting. It was all a cynical political ploy. And a huge development at the Justice Department, a top official demoted after reportedly, as we thought, coordinating with the law firm pedaling that infamous anti-Trump Russian dossier. We begin with the fall of the liberal icon comedian, Al Franken, and the \"me too\" pandemic. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Look, Franken really had no choice after most of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate called on him to quit. Listen closely to his statement today."

As we explained in the ANGLE last night, the Dems did not suddenly become beacons of morality wagging their fingers at everyone else because they're on the moral high ground. This was a crass political ploy. Democrats dumping Franken overboard because now that they can claim the moral high ground for 2018 and pursue allegations against Donald Trump and Roy Moore."

The Washington Post wrote, \"Al Franken finds unlikely defenders on Fox News.\" The Huffington Post, almost identical, \"Meet Al Franken's Republican Defenders.\" Mediaite, \"Laura Ingrahm, Newt Gingrich Defend Franken From Dem Lynch Mob.\" News flash, we weren't defending Franken. We were defending the notion that one should be considered innocent until proven guilty. You see, the real story here, what we were warning you about, is this -- it's kind of a P.C. Polgram underway with a nasty political edge to it. They're dropping like flies now. Former Democratic Congressman Harold Ford Jr. was fired today by Morgan Stanley for allegedly several years ago grabbing a woman. He was trying to take her out to drinks. She didn't like that. Now he's vowing to sue the woman and Morgan Stanley, that it never happened. Congressman Trent Franks, he announced today that he's going to step down rather than endure an investigation for having what he called a discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates. This takes the cake. Now, look, we need to be careful here, you, myself, everyone, that we don't get so caught up in the white heat of the \"me too\" movement that lives and careers are destroyed without much evidence and in a flash. Look, there are credible allegations out there. There's creeps that need to be shown the door. No doubt about it. We also have to be weary of what I call the \"me too\" flu. The gender opportunists that come out of the wood work with allegations many, many years later because it serves a political or personal end. Are any of you getting tired of the sudden explosion of moral piety spewing from those who ended up enabling the real abusers by looking the other way because it was politically expedient to do so for years? Me too. That's THE ANGLE. Joining us now with reaction, attorney and GOP official, Harmeet Dhillon along with Democrat Capri Cafaro, former minority leader in the Ohio State Senate. Harmeet, let's start with you. I mean, I'm not a fan of Al Franken, he and have clashed a lot politically over the years, and I found him actually personally quite nasty, but I'm getting a little bit worried about where this is all going. Because the Democrats clearly would not have acted against Al Franken if they had the White House and they had had a decent majority in the Senate. This was so they could tar Trump and go after Roy Moore. I have no doubt in my mind."

      "utterance": "Absolutely, Laura. I agree with your comments yesterday and Newt Gingrich's. I think that Al Franken is a human sacrifice on the altar of 2018 for the Democrats. You know, look at the leader of the pack, Kristin Gillibrand, who last year was campaigning happily with Bill Clinton, sent him thank you tweets and thinks it's all hanky-dory. When it's expedient to throw the Clintons overboard, which they have done, now they've done that as well. So, I think this whole \"me too\" movement has been enabled by the fact that the Democrats are no longer held back by the Clinton dynasty. Because for all these years, everybody knew it was wrong what was happening, yet they couldn't say anything because the leaders of their party were the ones doing the offending and the demeaning and the shaming and the blaming and all of those bad things. And so, now it's a new day, but I think they're going a little bit overboard here. I'm not sure Al Franken based on his comments today is truly with the program."

The good news is the winds have not come back as once feared. Bad news, you still see a number of flanks of this fire, the Thomas fire, burning. You can see threatening home in this area outside of Ventura between Ventura and Ohi, which is basically about an hour or so north and west of Los Angeles. This fire has chewed up more than 115,000 acres since Monday night and several hundred homes. While this fire burns here in a number of locations and pretty spread out, there's a new fire that started today in San Diego called the Lilac fire. That burned more than 3,000 acres and several homes in San Diego. But 18,000 people have been evacuated down there because of the conditions. As you can tell, these conditions are still rough and steep and difficult terrain in many cases, and a lot of the cities haven't burned -- the areas around them haven't burned in a long time, including here in Ventura and Santa Barbara County. So, right now, this is the firefight that firefighters are facing. Obviously, not a lot of air support this time of night. In fact, we haven't seen many helicopters at all. The good news, there's no winds in this area right now at least in this area, and they are hoping it stays that way.

And while that hearing was unfolding, Fox News reported another potential conflict involving an Obama holdover. They're coming out of the wood work. This time at the Justice Department. Bruce Orr was demoted and stripped of his title, associate deputy attorney general, yesterday morning after the House Intel Committee learned that he met during the 2016 campaign with Christopher Steele, the former British spy that authored the infamous Russian dossier. Joining us now to discuss is Republican congressman from Florida, Matt Gaetz and Democratic strategist, Joel Payne, who was deputy national press secretary and former senate majority leader, Harry Reid's guy. Great to see you both. Joel, let's start with you. There are a lot of people working for this investigation that are political adversaries of the president. If the shoe were on the other foot and this was an investigation of Hillary Clinton and the investigation was stacked with anti-Hillary prosecutors, you guys would be going crazy.

It's like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire literally and figuratively. Stay safe, everyone. Dark times.\" You know, he should be Chelsea Handler her lightly because something a little off base I think. To worry about politics when your house is about to go up in flames, we've had friends who have lost their homes in Bel Air and in Ventura. Why would you be focused on political disagreement when a tragedy like this is closing in on people? The woman is obsessed. Something is wrong, and you see why Netflix cancelled her show."

To test us, to try us, whether it's the saints, Jesus, whoever. So -- but he thinks that construction is wrong. He pointed to the French. The French changed it a little bit. They say, hold on, I'll get this right, do not let us fall into temptation. So the onus and the emphasis is on you rather than God leading you."

The left will do anything to prop up Michelle Obama. She looks at a store window and they say the economy is like growing because Michelle looked at a store window. Meanwhile Melania is the most incredible, awesome person. She's funny, she's humble, she's really smart, and all they do is try to take it away from her. I don't like that."

Boy, this is great. We needed you here. We needed you here after this segment. We were just criticizing the Pope. No. Let's start with you, Sister Joseph Andrew. People are I know watching saying why are Sister Joseph. Why is it a man's name? You pick saint names and you go with that?"

      "speaker": "BOGDANOWICZ",
      "utterance": "We have a lot of musical talent. And we used it a great deal in the community. It's part of our prayer life. And so it flows out. So everything that we sing really is a prayer. And so the sisters just break into harmonies and we just have fun."

      "speaker": "BOGDANOWICZ",
      "utterance": "It's true. It's so freeing an it's so uplifting and so peaceful. It's like how do we find peace in the world today? Music is a beautiful outlet. Pope John Paul II would say that, the good, the true the beautiful are like a magnet in our hearts. We all have to respond. You just can't not. You have to."

      "speaker": "THOMAS",
      "utterance": "There's so many intentions in our world today. But I think first, we have to be saints. We're each called to respond to God's love. So the first thing I pray for is God help me become who you want me to be. But there's so many intentions in the world, so many needs, and every one of the people in the world who has those needs has a place in our prayers as a community."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, the nuns are here. They are praying for you, and you should be grateful for that. They are amazing people. Reminder, if you can, I'll pray for it, pick up a copy of my book \"Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump.\" It makes a great Christmas gift, and I say Christmas.
