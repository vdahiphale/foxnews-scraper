It is a lot easier, it seems, for them to say, sure, go ahead and impeach President Trump, than it is for House Democrats to get to that conclusion and the logistical hurdles ahead.  As you look at the polls new out today, Monmouth poll, has Joe Biden is in the lead and you see Bernie Sanders in second. Pete Buttigieg, they mayor, look at that, less that one percent to eight percent just in a short time. And then if you look at Iowa, obviously the first stop the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden also leading there, the margin a little bit smaller, and Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor in third.   With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Leslie Marshall, Democrat strategist, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\" Jonah, we've had this kind of launch, non-launch for Joe Biden. He was going to go Wednesday, now it's Thursday. We don't have a lot of details on what it looks like, but he's clearly still leading in some of these big pools. JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": He is. And I think he is well-positioned. I don't usually give a lot advice to Democrats, but if I were him, I would come out, I would announce and immediately take dead aim at Bernie Sanders and say this is a two-person race. I'm the grown up. I'm a liberal, but I'm not a socialist. The party will go down in flames if we pursue Bernie's path. It will make everybody else look small. He is basically the only guy in a position who can do that. And I think that one of the things we see is that a lot of the Democratic primary people, they think that basically Democratic Twitter is the actual Democratic electorate, and it's not. And he is one of the only people who is positioned to actually reach out to the traditional Democratic voter.",

There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track.

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years. He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time. And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything. And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington. And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much. And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them. The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess.",

Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65. Now it's two-to-one per retiree. We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people. It is not sustainable.

A lot of people thought at first that might be a good place for the former vice president to announce, but then there was some kickback, people felt it was disrespectful, they decided not to do it, and that delayed them some. There is a \"Time\" magazine piece where they have people that are already leaking within the campaign, saying it is very disorganized for a launch, that is a problem that he will have to get on track. But I and other Democrats are not worried yet. He is still leading in almost every poll, and he hasnŸ_Tt yet announced."

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and of course the problem for Joe Biden both in the Democratic Party and as a general election candidate is the fact that he has been around Washington for 45 years. He has been part of a problem for a for a very, very long time. And so he has -- he is going to struggle to come up with whatever new message it is that he has go that now it is going to change everything. And of course when I look at the field I can't think of a single person who has actually run for president as many times as he has over the past -- since he has been in Washington. And all of that while, as you point out, the name recognition is very, very good, and it helps them very much. And I think Jonah is right, he is in a position to face off against somebody like Bernie Sanders and show the difference between the two of them. The problem still remains that he has been around here for a very long time, and it's a mess."

Look, when you go to this thing called prison, you have lots of rights that are curtailed. The freedom of assembly, freedom of speech all sorts of things. One of the others ones happens to be freedom to vote. It is another thing entirely when you pay back your debt to society about whether or not you should have your voting rights restored. But the idea that Bernie Sanders is getting out like free candy these Willie Horton type issues where he wants the worst terrorists in America to be able to vote, it's bizarre to me."

Now, when they get out of prison, if they get those rights restored that's a whole other conversation. We've seen that. There are people left and right that can agree to that. And this is a can of worms that a Democrat doesn't need to open because we have so many other areas.

On Social Security, total costs projected to exceed its total income including interests for the first time since 1982.

President Trump obviously ran in 2016 vowing not to touch these programs. Obviously, that was a smart move back then, but the fact remains that they are going consultants and something has to be done about it. The one good thing I think that has happened is that it's going to be a lot easier to fix these programs with a very good economy like the one we have right now than if we were facing this catastrophe and had a bad economy."

How on earth are they going to make up any kind of a gap with Medicare if they can't afford any secondary insurance beyond what they are already paying? This is something where the left and right, Democrats and Republicans, not only can work together but they have to, and they have to do it before it's on the brink of insolvency."

      "utterance": "And they are right. The thing is the Trump administration has basically ignored the problem with entitlements while the Democrats are proposing things to make them much, much worse. The simple fact is that we live in an economy where Social Security was created when we had something like over a dozen workers for every retiree. Most people died at 61, they didn't get benefits until they were 65. Now it's two-to-one per retiree. We're having a massive wealth transfer from young people to old people. It is not sustainable. It has got to be ripped up from the ground and figured out. You have to grandfather in the people who are recipients now but then fix it for the coming generation. That is nowhere on the horizon for what the Democrats are proposing, and the Republicans are just ignoring it."
