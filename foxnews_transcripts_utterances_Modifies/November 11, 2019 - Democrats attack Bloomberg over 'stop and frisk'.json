      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One thing we know for sure about Elizabeth Warren above all else, is that on economic questions, she is a sincere populist. Warren is deeply distressed by income inequality. She profoundly distrusts Wall Street and big tech. She hates monopolies and massive multi-generational concentrations of wealth. So if you're a private equity chieftain for example, or a weed smoking trustafarian living off family money in Jackson Hole, you've got to be terrified of Elizabeth Warren. How could you not be terrified? Listen to her talk.",

Actually, that's not too far from what Donald Trump ran on in 2016, back before Paul Ryan and the Ayn Rand people got ahold of this economic program.   But this time around, Elizabeth Warren plans to steal that message -- the Trump message really. Warren claims that she is the radical populist here. She is the disruptor, but is she? Let's see. Emily Tisch Sussman is a woke liberal who often appears in cable television who talk about Democratic politics. Nice person, but she is the daughter of two billionaires. So you'd think that Emily Tisch Sussman would hate Elizabeth Warren, but she doesn't.   Instead, she demands that you support Elizabeth Warren or else you're sexist. Watch.",

But keep in mind, you just saw one of the richest people on Planet Earth demanding that you support Elizabeth Warren for President. Surprising, right? Well, actually, it turns out that some of Warren's most fervent supporters are the very people she claims she wants to fight. Well, that's weird.  So for example, in the third quarter of this year, Elizabeth Warren raised more money from Silicon Valley, from those monopolists she claims to hate than anybody else running for President. Spotify's CEO is an Elizabeth Warren fan, so is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire, Chris Sacca? He has already maxed out to her campaign. Really? The billionaires supporting her.  Then last month, Charlie Gasparino over on Fox Business reported that Elizabeth Warren's campaign is making overtures to finance moguls on Wall Street seeking contributions, and some of them are responding.  But wait a second. Why would Elizabeth Warren's enemies -- and these have got to be her enemies, she attacks them all the time on the campaign trail -- why would your enemies fund her campaign? We will give you five seconds to think about it, and the answer, of course is they're not really her enemies. They understand that Warren doesn't really mean what she says. They know that Warren's populism is a facade and underneath it all, she is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment. That's what it seems like she really is, is she?  Well, John MacArthur suspects she might be here. He is the publisher of \"Harper's Magazine.\" He has been the publisher there for more than 35 years, so he has watched a few Democratic candidates in his time. He's got a new piece out for \"The Spectator,\" in which he describes Elizabeth Warren this way. As quote, \" ... a left wing populist for people who don't want left wing populism.\"   Warren, he writes, maybe quote, \" ... more like Hillary than anyone dares to say out loud. When the two women talk on the phone, as they do, maybe it's more about power than about good government.\" Mr. MacArthur joins us tonight live. Thanks so much for coming on tonight.",

She signed a pledge that was put out by the Association of State Democratic Committee saying, I won't argue with you. I will be a regular party liberal. I will respect the party protocols, and I won't poach on your turf.   I think she is being, to some extent promoted by the establishment party to kill off Sanders. Her job one is to kill off Sanders. So she's playing a double game. On the one hand, she mimics Sanders, she's copying him to a tee. But on the other hand, she goes around loudly announcing that she is not going to rock the boat with the Democratic Party.

You notice the flap with Tulsi Gabbard recently where Hillary Clinton makes this wild accusation that she is a Russian agent or a Russian asset and that she is preparing for a third party run. That's a way to punish Sanders to hurt Sanders. Sanders comes out and defends her. Warren keeps her mouth shut. She says nothing. I think they have a non-aggression pact. And that once you're in with the Clintons, once you're compromising yourself to that extent, it's very hard to stick to principle.  I'm worried that if she gets the nomination and right now she looks like the consensus choice. Biden is faltering badly. They're hoping that she can knock out Sanders. If she gets the nomination, they can get her to water down her program and become a consensus Democrat who makes sure that the patronage and the fundraising continues operating the way it always has.",

Meanwhile, during the same period, the Federal government has approved hundreds of new H-1B visas for Uber. And that means they can replace those workers with foreign scabs, who will work for less. It's like outsourcing but even easier because Uber doesn't even have to build a new building. There's nothing unusual about what Uber is doing. There's bipartisan consensus in Washington that we desperately need smart people from overseas to do the jobs that Americans are too badly educated to do. No reason to fix our schools or make sure higher education is serious and non-frivolous. We can just import people from countries that take education seriously. And that's what we do. That's why the U.S. government passes out foreign worker visas to allow corporations to replace people like you with people who live 6,000 miles away. Now, you probably haven't even heard of the F1 Optional Practical Training Program. But just four years from 2009 to 2013 that program replaced nearly half a million American jobs. That program allows foreign students who study at American universities to stay in the country after they graduate. In other words, we're just going to staple a green card to their diploma, you probably heard that phrase recently. And since employers you use F-1B visas are not required to pay payroll taxes, they get in effect a tax subsidy for hiring foreigners over U.S. citizens. How is that for America last? Maybe the program would make sense if Americans really couldn't fill all those jobs. But it turns out there are plenty who could. Just ask the thousands who were recently laid off by Uber. According to the Economic Policy Institute, fully half of all American STEM majors -- that is people who study technology -- don't end up working in STEM jobs. Isn't that weird? The only people who actually benefit from these visa programs are tech billionaires in Silicon Valley. They're getting richer no matter what. And the foreign nationals who want to live in San Francisco and our U.S. government makes it easy for them to do that. Who gets hurt? Well, among others, the college graduates who took on huge amounts of student loan debt only to be dumped into a system where their foreign replacements get preference over them. This is happening on a grand scale, and both parties are for it including many Republicans in Washington. It tells you a lot about where their priorities are. Well, a philosophy lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley went on Twitter the other day and revealed his true feelings about everyone who lives outside the city. The instructor was a graduate student called Jackson Kernion and described rural Americans and we're quoting now, \" ... as bad people who have made bad life decisions.\" He encouraged his followers on Twitter to quote, \"shame people\" who weren't pro-city and argued that healthcare, gasoline and internet access ought to be much more expensive for rural Americans. No that most people at Berkeley share his contempt. Bestselling author Mark Steyn isn't originally from this country, but he moved here to rural America where he has lived for many years and he joins us tonight. So what do you think of this, Mark, as a rural American? Do you feel less good than your compatriots in Williamsburg, Brooklyn?",

Rural America has a lot of problems. The fellow across the street in my broken down loser New Hampshire town, they paid $125,000.00 for their home. When they sold it a decade later, they had to take 80 grand for it. The two other houses that were up for sale, nobody wanted to buy them. And in the end, they gave them to the town and the town demolished them. So when you -- but when you sell a $125,000.00 house for 80 grand, you can't move to a city. You can't afford to live in a city. I would say three things about the problems with cities. The first thing is that some of them are murderous like Chicago. The second is that in California particularly where this guy is from, they are absolutely filthy. NBC in Los Angeles is reporting tonight, showing video of a man on the streets of Los Angeles dumping a bucket of diarrhea over a woman as she is getting into her car. You heard from your previous guests that had all these people who want to save the planet. Instead of being a narcissistic buffoon and trying to save the planet, why not do something achievable? Like try to save your city -- a city that can't even stop human waste in the street and putting human waste in the oceans and on its beaches? And the third thing this guy doesn't appreciate because he is something like a hipster philosophy groover is that city -- the best cities in the world are bifurcating. The middle class is eliminated. They can't afford to live there. You have the mega rich and the immigrant servants who service their lifestyles whether it is domestic servants or the barista at Starbucks.

Warren is deeply distressed by income inequality. She profoundly distrusts Wall Street and big tech. She hates monopolies and massive multi-generational concentrations of wealth. So if you're a private equity chieftain for example, or a weed smoking trustafarian living off family money in Jackson Hole, you've got to be terrified of Elizabeth Warren. How could you not be terrified? Listen to her talk."

It's time to fight back."

Actually, that's not too far from what Donald Trump ran on in 2016, back before Paul Ryan and the Ayn Rand people got ahold of this economic program. But this time around, Elizabeth Warren plans to steal that message -- the Trump message really. Warren claims that she is the radical populist here. She is the disruptor, but is she? Let's see. Emily Tisch Sussman is a woke liberal who often appears in cable television who talk about Democratic politics. Nice person, but she is the daughter of two billionaires. So you'd think that Emily Tisch Sussman would hate Elizabeth Warren, but she doesn't. Instead, she demands that you support Elizabeth Warren or else you're sexist. Watch."

I thought it was an interesting point. And I think there may be something to it."

      "utterance": "Yes, there might be something to it. If you don't support Warren, you're a sexist. But keep in mind, you just saw one of the richest people on Planet Earth demanding that you support Elizabeth Warren for President. Surprising, right? Well, actually, it turns out that some of Warren's most fervent supporters are the very people she claims she wants to fight. Well, that's weird. So for example, in the third quarter of this year, Elizabeth Warren raised more money from Silicon Valley, from those monopolists she claims to hate than anybody else running for President. Spotify's CEO is an Elizabeth Warren fan, so is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and billionaire, Chris Sacca? He has already maxed out to her campaign. Really? The billionaires supporting her. Then last month, Charlie Gasparino over on Fox Business reported that Elizabeth Warren's campaign is making overtures to finance moguls on Wall Street seeking contributions, and some of them are responding. But wait a second. Why would Elizabeth Warren's enemies -- and these have got to be her enemies, she attacks them all the time on the campaign trail -- why would your enemies fund her campaign? We will give you five seconds to think about it, and the answer, of course is they're not really her enemies. They understand that Warren doesn't really mean what she says. They know that Warren's populism is a facade and underneath it all, she is really just this season's Hillary Clinton -- faithful party robot, stalwart defender of the prerogatives of the establishment. That's what it seems like she really is, is she? Well, John MacArthur suspects she might be here. He is the publisher of \"Harper's Magazine.\" He has been the publisher there for more than 35 years, so he has watched a few Democratic candidates in his time. He's got a new piece out for \"The Spectator,\" in which he describes Elizabeth Warren this way. As quote, \" ... a left wing populist for people who don't want left wing populism.\" Warren, he writes, maybe quote, \" ... more like Hillary than anyone dares to say out loud. When the two women talk on the phone, as they do, maybe it's more about power than about good government.\" Mr. MacArthur joins us tonight live. Thanks so much for coming on tonight."

The people who really run it day-to-day, the Clinton-Obama faction that lives off Wall Street that she will not poach on their turf in terms of patronage and fundraising. She signed a pledge that was put out by the Association of State Democratic Committee saying, I won't argue with you. I will be a regular party liberal. I will respect the party protocols, and I won't poach on your turf. I think she is being, to some extent promoted by the establishment party to kill off Sanders. Her job one is to kill off Sanders. So she's playing a double game. On the one hand, she mimics Sanders, she's copying him to a tee. But on the other hand, she goes around loudly announcing that she is not going to rock the boat with the Democratic Party.

    {
      "speaker": "MACARTHUR",

If she remains faithful to the Democratic Party, and that's what it appears to be the case right now, look, I'll give you a good example. You notice the flap with Tulsi Gabbard recently where Hillary Clinton makes this wild accusation that she is a Russian agent or a Russian asset and that she is preparing for a third party run. That's a way to punish Sanders to hurt Sanders. Sanders comes out and defends her. Warren keeps her mouth shut. She says nothing. I think they have a non-aggression pact. And that once you're in with the Clintons, once you're compromising yourself to that extent, it's very hard to stick to principle. I'm worried that if she gets the nomination and right now she looks like the consensus choice. Biden is faltering badly. They're hoping that she can knock out Sanders. If she gets the nomination, they can get her to water down her program and become a consensus Democrat who makes sure that the patronage and the fundraising continues operating the way it always has."

But it's also something that the mainstream Democratic Party is not addressing. The minimum wage is still at $7.25 an hour and there are still a lot of illegal labor in the country working for $3.00 to $4.00 an hour. Meanwhile, you've got NAFTA and the permanent normal trade relations with China still driving hundreds of thousands of jobs out of the country. Factories closing, still moving to Mexico, still moving to China and nothing is being done. You don't hear the Democrats talking about it at all. Sanders is talking about it because I think he is -- he is quite sincere. But you don't hear them talking about trade anymore."

So you'd think that stop and frisk will be popular with the left. Democrats have been more aggressive than ever in their gun control efforts and are promising to take your guns and enact mandatory buybacks for weapons of war. Well, again, stop and frisk is really the only measure that's ever been proven to get so-called weapons of war off the street before they killed people, so Democrats would support it, right? No. They hate it. Why? Because it's racist, of course."

He was right. Mass migration reduces wages for low skilled workers. But now Sanders has changed his mind. His campaign has released an immigration proposal that reads like something the Koch brothers would write. It would halt deportation. It would abolish enforcement of our borders, abolish I.C.E. and create a new category for something called climate migrants. Justin Haskins is a Research Fellow at the Heartland Institute.

You know, I don't believe that anybody is actually suffering from man- caused climate change. But Bernie Sanders' proposal would have 50,000 people -- 50,000, at minimum -- come to the United States from around the world who are suffering from climate change, supposedly, in just the first year and over the course of his presidency, hundreds of thousands of people, because supposedly this is good for climate justice or something along those lines. But the most bizarre part of all of this is that I thought, according to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and everybody else in the socialist left that human beings are causing climate change, that human CO2 emissions, that that's what's causing climate change, and it's going to be catastrophic. Well, if that's true, then why are we bringing people from all over the world where they produce CO2 emissions less per person in places like Mexico and Guatemala and places like that?

      "utterance": "The rideshare company Uber has fired more than a thousand workers since July, mostly Americans. That's about two percent of its workforce. Meanwhile, during the same period, the Federal government has approved hundreds of new H-1B visas for Uber. And that means they can replace those workers with foreign scabs, who will work for less. It's like outsourcing but even easier because Uber doesn't even have to build a new building. There's nothing unusual about what Uber is doing. There's bipartisan consensus in Washington that we desperately need smart people from overseas to do the jobs that Americans are too badly educated to do. No reason to fix our schools or make sure higher education is serious and non-frivolous. We can just import people from countries that take education seriously. And that's what we do. That's why the U.S. government passes out foreign worker visas to allow corporations to replace people like you with people who live 6,000 miles away. Now, you probably haven't even heard of the F1 Optional Practical Training Program. But just four years from 2009 to 2013 that program replaced nearly half a million American jobs. That program allows foreign students who study at American universities to stay in the country after they graduate. In other words, we're just going to staple a green card to their diploma, you probably heard that phrase recently. And since employers you use F-1B visas are not required to pay payroll taxes, they get in effect a tax subsidy for hiring foreigners over U.S. citizens. How is that for America last? Maybe the program would make sense if Americans really couldn't fill all those jobs. But it turns out there are plenty who could. Just ask the thousands who were recently laid off by Uber. According to the Economic Policy Institute, fully half of all American STEM majors -- that is people who study technology -- don't end up working in STEM jobs. Isn't that weird? The only people who actually benefit from these visa programs are tech billionaires in Silicon Valley. They're getting richer no matter what. And the foreign nationals who want to live in San Francisco and our U.S. government makes it easy for them to do that. Who gets hurt? Well, among others, the college graduates who took on huge amounts of student loan debt only to be dumped into a system where their foreign replacements get preference over them. This is happening on a grand scale, and both parties are for it including many Republicans in Washington. It tells you a lot about where their priorities are. Well, a philosophy lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley went on Twitter the other day and revealed his true feelings about everyone who lives outside the city. The instructor was a graduate student called Jackson Kernion and described rural Americans and we're quoting now, \" ... as bad people who have made bad life decisions.\" He encouraged his followers on Twitter to quote, \"shame people\" who weren't pro-city and argued that healthcare, gasoline and internet access ought to be much more expensive for rural Americans. No that most people at Berkeley share his contempt. Bestselling author Mark Steyn isn't originally from this country, but he moved here to rural America where he has lived for many years and he joins us tonight. So what do you think of this, Mark, as a rural American? Do you feel less good than your compatriots in Williamsburg, Brooklyn?"

Rural America has a lot of problems. The fellow across the street in my broken down loser New Hampshire town, they paid $125,000.00 for their home. When they sold it a decade later, they had to take 80 grand for it. The two other houses that were up for sale, nobody wanted to buy them. And in the end, they gave them to the town and the town demolished them. So when you -- but when you sell a $125,000.00 house for 80 grand, you can't move to a city. You can't afford to live in a city. I would say three things about the problems with cities. The first thing is that some of them are murderous like Chicago. The second is that in California particularly where this guy is from, they are absolutely filthy. NBC in Los Angeles is reporting tonight, showing video of a man on the streets of Los Angeles dumping a bucket of diarrhea over a woman as she is getting into her car. You heard from your previous guests that had all these people who want to save the planet. Instead of being a narcissistic buffoon and trying to save the planet, why not do something achievable? Like try to save your city -- a city that can't even stop human waste in the street and putting human waste in the oceans and on its beaches? And the third thing this guy doesn't appreciate because he is something like a hipster philosophy groover is that city -- the best cities in the world are bifurcating. The middle class is eliminated. They can't afford to live there. You have the mega rich and the immigrant servants who service their lifestyles whether it is domestic servants or the barista at Starbucks.

Tonight Comrade Putin stares out with flat Slavic eyes over Union Square below, just as in Soviet times. The portrait was painted so stealthily with such careful subversion that even now local leaders admittedly, not geniuses, appear to believe it depicts a climate protester from Sweden. Of course the joke is on them. In the Kremlin tonight, they're clinking chilled glasses of vodka and laughing. They hack our elections. Now they've hacked our murals. Corporate America is officially woke and getting woker by the day. The banks won't lend to gun makers. Gillette wants to end masculinity.

I don't think that analogy works so much anymore. I think it's little too cutesy. This isn't the Oregon Trail. This is Juarez and Jeff Zucker is El Chapo. I mean the level of corruption here is insane, and these are supposed to be competitors, we would assume that the news business would want to be, you know, maybe be delighting in one of their competitors having a tough time."

Because it does tell you what -- like, so CNN is liberal, obviously, they've identified their audience as liberal and people stuck in airports as you noted. I get all of that. That's totally fine. But the Epstein story isn't political necessarily, so it really reveals the deeper agenda, which is basically covering up for the people in charge, however repulsive, corrupt and criminal they are. And that's really what it is, right?"

      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. The fact that they said that this story was squashed because they wanted an interview with Will and Kate, for what? The 10,000 housewives that care about the Royal family? I mean, and it said it's just powerful people, powerful and well-connected people and you're right to point out it wasn't necessarily political. And that is what makes it so disgusting and so corrupt."

      "utterance": "Of course not. You know I always thought the journalists are supposed to expose power and expose corruption and speak up like I did several years ago and was blacklisted by liberal media when I saw things -- very, very bad behavior. And now what we're seeing is with Amy Robach being so obsessed with not the corruption, not the injustice, not that many people were probably continued to get victimized after this story -- after the story was spiked, but she's obsessed with the fact that she didn't get credit for breaking the story, this career defining story that she wanted her name on."

The women on the stage, I'm focusing here on my fellow women, senators, Senator Harris, Senator Warren and myself. Do I think that we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don't. Maybe we're held to a different standard."

He is 37. He went to Harvard. He was a Rhodes Scholar in the military. I mean, it's a pretty impressive background for someone. So let's say a woman has that background, I would expect her come out and you know, if she thinks she's going to run for President, you know, go ahead and do it and then fight for it, and that's what he's done. I don't like him. I don't like any of the Democratic candidates, but you have to hand it to them. They're out there ruining their lives and saying dumb things, and she comes after him. Now, either she is a sexist or even worse that she believes -- and remember, this is the voters -- that the voters would be treating a woman differently. This is the Democratic primary season. These are Democratic voters that she is accusing of being sexist. I mean, this is such a habit that they have. She is not even considering what it is she is saying here."

But when I was on the left, we realized and we did studies that in fact, for women to move forward, they should highlight being women and that would mean using their first name. So she is doing well in the debates as is Mayor Pete, and so she is using that aspect, believing it to help her with the same electorate that she is accusing of sexism. Now, maybe if Mayor Pete had ever eaten a salad with his comb maybe that would even out the playing field. I don't know. But it's an interesting argument and it is shameful because as women, we know that, look, we say we're equal, and that we're going to play by the same rules, expect the same dynamic and it's getting very old to say that your trouble is based on other people or it is other people's fault."
