I think the president would do what he did in his Oval Office address on immigration, which is that he belittles the Democrats, demonizes immigrants. He goes on and on, tells lies. And then, he expects that somehow no one is going to call them on it. And if they do call him on it, they are bad folks for saying it.  To my mind, the big issue here is, you know, the president and the White House today, they said we're going to bring back 46,000 IRS employees and not pay them. And what do you see happening at the airports, in Atlanta yesterday? Huge lines. I think at some point, and the poll showed this, the American people are saying you know what, President Trump, you are having a tantrum, which is by the way, Pelosi used. You're having a tantrum.

She's going to control legislation moves in the House. The problem solvers are in the United States' House, not the Senate. And Republicans also need 60 votes in the Senate. They only have 53 of the Senate, which is what makes things difficult for Republicans to try to move things forward, because what Nancy Pelosi has done with the House is passing legislation. So she can say look, we are doing things. We are passing legislation. It's on you now and Republicans can't reciprocate, because they don't have the votes in the Senate to get it done. But the reason why Nancy Pelosi doesn't want President Trump to speak is she doesn't want him to have an unfiltered way to speak to the American people to make his case for the wall, and also increase border security.  And the bigger problem with all of it is the fact that we are not -- this is not a policy fight, right. If you look at the issues, they agree on it. Democrats have supported fencing in the past. Republicans want physical barriers. So the difference isn't policy. This is political. And when the difference is political, it's much harder to come to an agreement, because with the objective is to deny something or deny him of something, it's a lot more difficult to try to find common ground there.",

My more concern is while this is going on -- and I've talked to a few coast guards, and a good friend, let's call him Uncle Louie, so he stays anonymous. The U.S. Customs Border Protection, which is a little bit different than patrol people get too confused. While this is going on, our borders, our eastern seaboard is wide open because we don't have the manpower anymore to keep people from coming in and out. And that's the real issue.  I don't care whose fault it is, who said what. We are more in danger now, not just at the southern border, the entire eastern seaboard doesn't have enough coast guards to keep our waters safe from the drug smugglers. As a matter of fact, he was telling me that they were in pursuit and they didn't have enough manpower to catch the guy. And he literally just sailed right in. They knew they were there, but they didn't have the bodies to go out and intercept them. That's the real issue.  So I don't care if he just has to do -- do whatever he has to do, you have to do the executive thing. If you have to do the nuclear option and just get the wall funding from the Pentagon, do it, because right now, we are in a more dangerous spot. Forget all these arguing and who said what, I don't care about it. Our country is vulnerable right now because we look and we're acting so terrible with our government. We are wide open.",

What it is, is that you have the Congress, the Supreme Court, the cabinet, everybody's there. So you want to make sure they are all safe. But I think the bigger issue is this. I think the president would do what he did in his Oval Office address on immigration, which is that he belittles the Democrats, demonizes immigrants. He goes on and on, tells lies. And then, he expects that somehow no one is going to call them on it. And if they do call him on it, they are bad folks for saying it. To my mind, the big issue here is, you know, the president and the White House today, they said we're going to bring back 46,000 IRS employees and not pay them. And what do you see happening at the airports, in Atlanta yesterday? Huge lines. I think at some point, and the poll showed this, the American people are saying you know what, President Trump, you are having a tantrum, which is by the way, Pelosi used. You're having a tantrum. And you're somehow now paralyzing the government, as if everything has to be just about you. Stop it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the problem with the problem solvers is just the mere fact that, look, Nancy Pelosi is the one that's going to control the schedule in the House. She's going to control legislation moves in the House. The problem solvers are in the United States' House, not the Senate. And Republicans also need 60 votes in the Senate. They only have 53 of the Senate, which is what makes things difficult for Republicans to try to move things forward, because what Nancy Pelosi has done with the House is passing legislation. So she can say look, we are doing things. We are passing legislation. It's on you now and Republicans can't reciprocate, because they don't have the votes in the Senate to get it done. But the reason why Nancy Pelosi doesn't want President Trump to speak is she doesn't want him to have an unfiltered way to speak to the American people to make his case for the wall, and also increase border security. And the bigger problem with all of it is the fact that we are not -- this is not a policy fight, right. If you look at the issues, they agree on it. Democrats have supported fencing in the past. Republicans want physical barriers. So the difference isn't policy. This is political. And when the difference is political, it's much harder to come to an agreement, because with the objective is to deny something or deny him of something, it's a lot more difficult to try to find common ground there."

My more concern is while this is going on -- and I've talked to a few coast guards, and a good friend, let's call him Uncle Louie, so he stays anonymous. The U.S. Customs Border Protection, which is a little bit different than patrol people get too confused. While this is going on, our borders, our eastern seaboard is wide open because we don't have the manpower anymore to keep people from coming in and out. And that's the real issue. I don't care whose fault it is, who said what. We are more in danger now, not just at the southern border, the entire eastern seaboard doesn't have enough coast guards to keep our waters safe from the drug smugglers. As a matter of fact, he was telling me that they were in pursuit and they didn't have enough manpower to catch the guy. And he literally just sailed right in. They knew they were there, but they didn't have the bodies to go out and intercept them. That's the real issue. So I don't care if he just has to do -- do whatever he has to do, you have to do the executive thing. If you have to do the nuclear option and just get the wall funding from the Pentagon, do it, because right now, we are in a more dangerous spot. Forget all these arguing and who said what, I don't care about it. Our country is vulnerable right now because we look and we're acting so terrible with our government. We are wide open."

There is no sidewalk and big trucks come whipping around those corners. We're mainly seeing young men, groups of 5, 10, 20, making this march. They've got about 300 miles to go to Mexico. There was a little slow down today for the caravan in Guatemala, the riot police were out in force. A few hundred of them with shields, helmets, wooden batons. There was no violence, but certainly, a strong presence there at the border. It doesn't take much to get from Honduras into Guatemala. All you have to do is show your I.D. card. You don't need a visa or a passport. So people were let through, but it did slow them down. So next, we will see what kind of reception they get in Mexico. Brian."

And strangely enough, a lot of young men that I've talked to had absolutely no money in their pockets, for what could be a month-long trip. One man told me today I will rely on people on the road to feed me. We haven't seen any handouts, we haven't seen any financing. We have seen church kitchen soup kitchen lunches, people providing for the migrants. But largely, they've been on their own. It's mainly young men, but we've seen some women, husbands, mothers, and small children, too, which is a really tough road. But about the Mexican reaction, they might've worn out their welcome, especially around Tijuana. They've just shut down a major shelter there in Tijuana, just as another caravan is coming. And these caravans are getting bigger and faster. We don't know how big this one's going to get. It's about 2,000, but it could go to 7,000, 10,000, or 15,000. There are two more scheduled. So now, the waves are getting closer and closer together, because I think these caravans, at least here in Guatemala and in Honduras, are seen as a success. People have not been deported back home. They've not been thrown in jail. They have made it. So more people are joining."

If we can find work in Mexico for a while, great, but we are going. There is nothing here for us.

These are young, vigorous men looking for work most of them. And they are willing to make a tremendous effort to undergo 3,000 miles, a lot of them on foot, a lot with nothing. These are people who are taking this incredibly difficult trip just because things are so bad. I think the fact that they are leaving tells you about how bad things are in Honduras.

I think with the older people, there is a lot more fear because they have their children to defend and take care of, along with a very difficult route.

I think the larger issue here for us and I think this is something Dana has drilled into my mind is, can we do something back in their home countries to help stanch this?

The problem is, the system is being gamed and that's an issue because you have -- we've seen dramatic increases in families making this dangerous trip. We know at least one of three women are going to be sexually assaulted on the trip. There is violence. There is danger. Steve talked to about someone who was arrested, who was a rapist. So this is a very dangerous trip. And so the problem is the system is being gamed. But 89 percent of people are going to pass that initial credible fear interview, but only 9 percent who actually show up in immigration courts are going to be granted asylum, yet they've made this journey to the United States.

He says that process has become harder for people in this case, who are instead of claiming asylum, because they want to get here to get a job can literally -- there will be new places for them to go, and say I want to work.

So I think that is a big problem. And the left has a Louis Farrakhan problem. And they also have a problem with some anti-Semites among the group. You even have Maxine Waters, who was -- you know, there's a video recently of her hugging Louis Farrakhan. She is the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee.

If, for example, he does things in the black amenity, but I am pro -- I am not for his anti-Semitic behavior, his antiwhite talk. I am pro -- just get the -- get the lines down. At the very least, she had -- was not prepared to disassociate herself. And now a program that, a march that had 550 sponsors is down to half that and might not even take place on Sunday.

You have somebody like Liz Cheney, who is the conference chairman for the Republicans, saying you've got to get -- you should find another line of work. Right? They're drawing a line in the sand. And I feel like maybe the Democrats smell blood in the water. Like, they want the Republicans to hurt because of Steve King; but then the Republicans could turn on them and say, \"Well, what about Louis Farrakhan?\" And then, like, where does it end? And I do also agree there is personal choice, right? Like I don't have to own everything that anybody that has ever been a Republican has ever had. I don't have to own any of that.

He stayed in the lane that we're trying not to be any more. So you cannot support Farrakhan and then condemn somebody for supporting King. You just can't do it. If -- if a guy wants to be pro-white, and he wants to say bad things about African-Americans and Jewish people; but he's really good at balancing the budget, you will -- they will see them make that argument. And you're like, \"You can't do that, because he's white.\" It's the same thing. We've come a long way. It's the same playing field now. a lot more than it was 30 years ago when that rhetoric and his -- his fight and his vigor was important to the black community. He needed to evolve. He should have been changing the way he's speaking now, because it's a different world now; and you can't ask for change if you're not willing to change."
