So, they focused on things like purging the military of extremists and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.  Now, for many conservatives, this situation seemed hopeless. Well, now we see the table's turning, because as they damage our economy and our foreign policy, the Democrats are also slowly but surely destroying their own prospects for 2022 and 2024.   Now, let's go through it all point-by-point. Number one, GOP unity. Now, contrary to the fake news claiming a post-Trump Republican civil war will be in the offing. Republicans are extremely united, for example, on the issue of the ever tedious Liz Cheney, the new CBS YouGov poll showing that 80 percent of the party supported her removal, mostly for the obvious reason that she doesn't advance the thing called the Republican agenda. Similarly, the GOP voters broadly support Trump's economic and immigration agenda. So, does any of that sound like a party at war with itself? Of course not. Number two, mystery masks theater. Well, Democrats just screwed this one up royally.  A few weeks ago, it was clear that Democrats are going to start caving on the pandemic controls that they've clung to so passionately for now what 14 months and on masks, when the CDC announced that vaccinated people could drop them. the Far Left Church of COVID went into total revolt mode. AOC proclaimed her dismay by saying she would keep wearing masks regardless of the fact that she was already vaccinated. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who defied her own lockdown orders to get her hair done in early days of pandemic said the same.  Basically, the Democrats have bumbled the mask issue look like total goofballs from day one. Now for the 100th time stated on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. There is no evidence that cloth face coverings are effective in stopping the spread of a respiratory virus.  The CDC's own website has the study posted on the ineffectiveness of masks against the Influenza virus. We talked about that a year ago. Even The Washington Post had to admit that masks did not work to slow the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic either. But as usual, the red States had to lead us out of this mess. And ultimately, they shame the CDC to give in dropping mask mandates months ago. But at the time, the experts and the Biden folks were predicting the worst.",

And we know there was never any surge of COVID linked to ditching masks mandates across the United States. Mandating the masking of children though, that is going to go down as a very dark chapter for the Democrats and the public health experts who advocated it. It's both anti-science and abusive to force children to wear mask at playgrounds, summer camps, on planes at any time. Yet, that is still what the CDC is recommending if you can believe it, it's totally illogical. Democrats and their union buddies are hoping though that masks rules for kids will force parents to relent and get their kids vaccinated even if they're uncomfortable with that.   But here's some advice for the Left. injecting children with an experimental vaccine for a disease they rarely get sick from and don't efficiently spread is a non-starter for most parents. It's going to cost you votes and possibly help lose you control of Congress and the presidency. Frankly, it's disgusting. Number three, loser lockdowns. Well, look, Democrats won't only feel the electoral pain from their vaccine insanity, but also, of course, their destructive lockdowns. Don't think Republicans won't remind voters which party decided that schools were non-essential. But marijuana dispensaries and big box stores were. The fact is the teachers' unions own Biden, we all know that now. And that ended up doing enormous damage to our kids learning.  And by the way, in New York, it's still unclear if schools will fully be open next fall, because teachers, many of them simply don't wish to return to the classroom. And unions are making impossible demands. I'm telling you more than anything else, I think this issue is galvanizing mothers and fathers nationwide and blue states and in blue cities that have slow rolled these reopenings It's a minefield for Democrats.  Number four, race obsession. Now, whether they're in class or not, kids across America are being forced fed the critical race theory, poison we've exposed on this show night-after-night. And our own president who served with twice elected Barack Obama, he's declared America himself to be systemically racist. And his own party, of course, it's totally on board with the Marxists who are trying to engineer, reengineer I should say schooling in America toward a social justice style radicalism.

Most Americans don't want to pay taxes for schools that teach them to hate their own nation. That's repulsive. And some red states, by the way, like Idaho and Oklahoma, they've banned it. And the good news, the parent led movement against the racial industrial complex is building and THE ANGLE will help them as much as possible by exposing the true agenda of the race baiters, power and money. That's what they're after.  Border madness. Let's go on to that. That's number five. We learned today that 531,533 migrants have been apprehended at our southern border between January and April. Those are just the people we've caught. And this is totally a crisis of Biden's own making. Think about this, if this pace keeps up, by the end of this year, Biden's first year in office, 2 million illegals will have been given full access to our country, free health care, free education, food stamps, even housing. And more than any other issue, this one represents the worst dereliction of duty of any president in modern times. And by the way, putting Kamala Harris in-charge, that was a telltale sign that Biden didn't care about, or didn't even want the influx of humanity to continue unabated.  Now, she hasn't been by the way to the border, of course, and it's so afraid to answer questions. Kamala Harris hasn't even held a press conference for 54 days. So much for that problem solver presidency we were hearing so much about. Biden and his DHS Secretary should be impeached for the crime of conspiring to keep the southern border open during a national health emergency. Number six, inflation surges. The Democrats dream of a wild massive fake spenderama is slowly fading away as their own party's economic gurus are reading them out. Now. Former Clinton treasury secretary Larry Summers has been warning about the dark clouds forming over the Biden economy for months, data are pointing more towards higher inflation than I expected and sooner with more inflation signs sooner than I would have expected.   With a consumer price index growing fastest pace since 2008, Biden's got himself in a box. And under these circumstances, there is no way that the Democrats will be able to do this multi trillion dollar cramdown of spending and massive tax hikes, and also at the same time think they're going to keep the economy growing. It's not possible.  But of course, his party's Left-wing, they're going to be furious if they lose this opportunity to soak the rich, and what they really want to do redistribute wealth to their pet projects.",

Now, I think the Democrats really did believe that the Capitol riots on January 6th, would doom Republicans for a generation. That's how they were playing it, that somehow the images of the fur boy and face pain would make Americans forget that the Democrats themselves are incapable of sound governance.   But it turns out that Americans are a lot smarter than the Democrats think. Much more important to them is the fact that crime, for instance, is exploding under Biden's watch. As you know, Democrats continue to misread Biden's mandate from day one.  After four years of Trump and the pandemic, they thought they had convinced the electorate to support a much more expanded role for the federal government, didn't they? But they failed. It turns out according to a new Pew poll, Americans views haven't changed that much. In August 2020, about six and 10, 59 percent Americans said the government should do more to solve problems. Today, 55 percent hold that view. So, it's actually gone down some Oh, and by the way, trust in government with the Democrats and total control of all branches of government is still at a pathetic 24 percent. If Biden wants to turn things around for America, let's just assume he does. What he'd do is simply brush off the Far Left and implement the sound policies that we already know work. schools open no matter what, low taxes, a strong energy sector, and a tight labor market helped by a tight border that keeps wages up. But I'm not holding my breath, he is going to do any of that. And that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me now Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast. Democrats are not setting themselves up to look too good in 2022 and 2024, Victor, but it's amazing how despondent conservatives were, of course, maybe understandably after the election. But they miss read the electorate big time, and how far they thought the country had moved to the Left. Victor, your reaction.",

But you knew that anyway, because nobody in the primary who embraced them did anything other than fail. Joe Biden didn't get near them.  And remember that Joe Biden during the campaign and the transition, didn't get near them. He ran on Donald Trump's tweets, he was uniter that he was going to the COVID pandemic, the lockdown the recession, George Floyd's debt, the rise anything but those issues. And then guess what everything that he touched that he inherited, that was golden, turned to dross once he had no more excuses. He had 115 days, there was no - COVID was dying, the lockdown was ending.  Donald Trump was not there anymore. So, he didn't have any other excuse, but to embrace that agenda that he didn't want to embrace, because he knew it was toxic. But we've had 115 days of it now. And it's not working. It's a disaster. And what are we left with? We're left basically with executive order, executive order, executive order, or let's try to lead in Puerto Rico or change the process with the court packing or the filibuster, or the national voter law or maybe scare everybody by saying when you go to bed tonight, there's Donald Trump are racist under it.

I think it's fair to say that every disease, particularly diseases that target people, for example, and that have a disparate impact on people who are obese people who have pre- existing conditions, for example, people live in poor neighborhoods where sanitation is not as good. There are all kinds of factors that contribute to why some group is more vulnerable to a disease than another.  It's a completely different thing to say that there's some kind of systemic bias in the hospital system, or in the health care system that is causing these inequities. And so, I think what Fauci is doing is he's playing into this idea that American institutions that for whatever reason, produce disparate outcomes. I mean, think about it, the NBA and the NFL produced racially disparate outcomes, far more disparate than the health system. And yet nobody calls those racist why, because they're not.",

So, they focused on things like purging the military of extremists and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. Now, for many conservatives, this situation seemed hopeless. Well, now we see the table's turning, because as they damage our economy and our foreign policy, the Democrats are also slowly but surely destroying their own prospects for 2022 and 2024. Now, let's go through it all point-by-point. Number one, GOP unity. Now, contrary to the fake news claiming a post-Trump Republican civil war will be in the offing. Republicans are extremely united, for example, on the issue of the ever tedious Liz Cheney, the new CBS YouGov poll showing that 80 percent of the party supported her removal, mostly for the obvious reason that she doesn't advance the thing called the Republican agenda. Similarly, the GOP voters broadly support Trump's economic and immigration agenda. So, does any of that sound like a party at war with itself? Of course not. Number two, mystery masks theater. Well, Democrats just screwed this one up royally. A few weeks ago, it was clear that Democrats are going to start caving on the pandemic controls that they've clung to so passionately for now what 14 months and on masks, when the CDC announced that vaccinated people could drop them. the Far Left Church of COVID went into total revolt mode. AOC proclaimed her dismay by saying she would keep wearing masks regardless of the fact that she was already vaccinated. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who defied her own lockdown orders to get her hair done in early days of pandemic said the same. Basically, the Democrats have bumbled the mask issue look like total goofballs from day one. Now for the 100th time stated on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. There is no evidence that cloth face coverings are effective in stopping the spread of a respiratory virus. The CDC's own website has the study posted on the ineffectiveness of masks against the Influenza virus. We talked about that a year ago. Even The Washington Post had to admit that masks did not work to slow the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic either. But as usual, the red States had to lead us out of this mess. And ultimately, they shame the CDC to give in dropping mask mandates months ago. But at the time, the experts and the Biden folks were predicting the worst."

      "utterance": "I was reacting to Texas when it first dropped its masks mandate two months ago. Well, yesterday announced - Texas announced its first day with zero COVID deaths in 14 months. And we know there was never any surge of COVID linked to ditching masks mandates across the United States. Mandating the masking of children though, that is going to go down as a very dark chapter for the Democrats and the public health experts who advocated it. It's both anti-science and abusive to force children to wear mask at playgrounds, summer camps, on planes at any time. Yet, that is still what the CDC is recommending if you can believe it, it's totally illogical. Democrats and their union buddies are hoping though that masks rules for kids will force parents to relent and get their kids vaccinated even if they're uncomfortable with that. But here's some advice for the Left. injecting children with an experimental vaccine for a disease they rarely get sick from and don't efficiently spread is a non-starter for most parents. It's going to cost you votes and possibly help lose you control of Congress and the presidency. Frankly, it's disgusting. Number three, loser lockdowns. Well, look, Democrats won't only feel the electoral pain from their vaccine insanity, but also, of course, their destructive lockdowns. Don't think Republicans won't remind voters which party decided that schools were non-essential. But marijuana dispensaries and big box stores were. The fact is the teachers' unions own Biden, we all know that now. And that ended up doing enormous damage to our kids learning. And by the way, in New York, it's still unclear if schools will fully be open next fall, because teachers, many of them simply don't wish to return to the classroom. And unions are making impossible demands. I'm telling you more than anything else, I think this issue is galvanizing mothers and fathers nationwide and blue states and in blue cities that have slow rolled these reopenings It's a minefield for Democrats. Number four, race obsession. Now, whether they're in class or not, kids across America are being forced fed the critical race theory, poison we've exposed on this show night-after-night. And our own president who served with twice elected Barack Obama, he's declared America himself to be systemically racist. And his own party, of course, it's totally on board with the Marxists who are trying to engineer, reengineer I should say schooling in America toward a social justice style radicalism.

Most Americans don't want to pay taxes for schools that teach them to hate their own nation. That's repulsive. And some red states, by the way, like Idaho and Oklahoma, they've banned it. And the good news, the parent led movement against the racial industrial complex is building and THE ANGLE will help them as much as possible by exposing the true agenda of the race baiters, power and money. That's what they're after. Border madness. Let's go on to that. That's number five. We learned today that 531,533 migrants have been apprehended at our southern border between January and April. Those are just the people we've caught. And this is totally a crisis of Biden's own making. Think about this, if this pace keeps up, by the end of this year, Biden's first year in office, 2 million illegals will have been given full access to our country, free health care, free education, food stamps, even housing. And more than any other issue, this one represents the worst dereliction of duty of any president in modern times. And by the way, putting Kamala Harris in-charge, that was a telltale sign that Biden didn't care about, or didn't even want the influx of humanity to continue unabated. Now, she hasn't been by the way to the border, of course, and it's so afraid to answer questions. Kamala Harris hasn't even held a press conference for 54 days. So much for that problem solver presidency we were hearing so much about. Biden and his DHS Secretary should be impeached for the crime of conspiring to keep the southern border open during a national health emergency. Number six, inflation surges. The Democrats dream of a wild massive fake spenderama is slowly fading away as their own party's economic gurus are reading them out. Now. Former Clinton treasury secretary Larry Summers has been warning about the dark clouds forming over the Biden economy for months, data are pointing more towards higher inflation than I expected and sooner with more inflation signs sooner than I would have expected. With a consumer price index growing fastest pace since 2008, Biden's got himself in a box. And under these circumstances, there is no way that the Democrats will be able to do this multi trillion dollar cramdown of spending and massive tax hikes, and also at the same time think they're going to keep the economy growing. It's not possible. But of course, his party's Left-wing, they're going to be furious if they lose this opportunity to soak the rich, and what they really want to do redistribute wealth to their pet projects."

      "utterance": "Now Republicans can honestly say, you can't say we didn't try to warn you about what was coming. Number seven, the insurrection flop. This is one of my favorites. Now, I think the Democrats really did believe that the Capitol riots on January 6th, would doom Republicans for a generation. That's how they were playing it, that somehow the images of the fur boy and face pain would make Americans forget that the Democrats themselves are incapable of sound governance. But it turns out that Americans are a lot smarter than the Democrats think. Much more important to them is the fact that crime, for instance, is exploding under Biden's watch. As you know, Democrats continue to misread Biden's mandate from day one. After four years of Trump and the pandemic, they thought they had convinced the electorate to support a much more expanded role for the federal government, didn't they? But they failed. It turns out according to a new Pew poll, Americans views haven't changed that much. In August 2020, about six and 10, 59 percent Americans said the government should do more to solve problems. Today, 55 percent hold that view. So, it's actually gone down some Oh, and by the way, trust in government with the Democrats and total control of all branches of government is still at a pathetic 24 percent. If Biden wants to turn things around for America, let's just assume he does. What he'd do is simply brush off the Far Left and implement the sound policies that we already know work. schools open no matter what, low taxes, a strong energy sector, and a tight labor market helped by a tight border that keeps wages up. But I'm not holding my breath, he is going to do any of that. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker host of the Dinesh D'Souza Podcast. Democrats are not setting themselves up to look too good in 2022 and 2024, Victor, but it's amazing how despondent conservatives were, of course, maybe understandably after the election. But they miss read the electorate big time, and how far they thought the country had moved to the Left. Victor, your reaction."

But you knew that anyway, because nobody in the primary who embraced them did anything other than fail. Joe Biden didn't get near them. And remember that Joe Biden during the campaign and the transition, didn't get near them. He ran on Donald Trump's tweets, he was uniter that he was going to the COVID pandemic, the lockdown the recession, George Floyd's debt, the rise anything but those issues. And then guess what everything that he touched that he inherited, that was golden, turned to dross once he had no more excuses. He had 115 days, there was no - COVID was dying, the lockdown was ending. Donald Trump was not there anymore. So, he didn't have any other excuse, but to embrace that agenda that he didn't want to embrace, because he knew it was toxic. But we've had 115 days of it now. And it's not working. It's a disaster. And what are we left with? We're left basically with executive order, executive order, executive order, or let's try to lead in Puerto Rico or change the process with the court packing or the filibuster, or the national voter law or maybe scare everybody by saying when you go to bed tonight, there's Donald Trump are racist under it.

I think it's fair to say that every disease, particularly diseases that target people, for example, and that have a disparate impact on people who are obese people who have pre- existing conditions, for example, people live in poor neighborhoods where sanitation is not as good. There are all kinds of factors that contribute to why some group is more vulnerable to a disease than another. It's a completely different thing to say that there's some kind of systemic bias in the hospital system, or in the health care system that is causing these inequities. And so, I think what Fauci is doing is he's playing into this idea that American institutions that for whatever reason, produce disparate outcomes. I mean, think about it, the NBA and the NFL produced racially disparate outcomes, far more disparate than the health system. And yet nobody calls those racist why, because they're not."

But he'd never said that to the American people in total when he was in front of them most cameras. I think he's getting really desperate, Laura, because I think he knows that most of his advice was wrong. Scott Atlas was much more correct than he was, their historical record starting to show that and we're getting a lot of disturbing information out of these reinvestigations of how this virus started and the role the United States played in funding some of this enhanced function research, which was an absolute disaster and should never happen.

At the end of April, more than 9200 Americans contracted COVID after being fully vaccinated, but that's only a small fraction, of course of the 95 million who were vaccinated at the time, but each case offers a clue as to why the vaccine doesn't always work. So, it was a little shocking to see the CDC announced that it would not be reviewing all cases where vaccinated people do end up becoming infected. Instead, the agency is only going to monitor so-called vaccine breakthroughs that result in hospitalizations or death. Joining me now is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Kulldorff, why is the CDC doing this? And is this information not useful?"

But of course, for any breakthrough cases, it's important to investigate it as long as there are symptoms. If you're asymptomatic, it doesn't matter. But if there are symptoms, hospitalization or death, it's important to investigate them. And it's also important to compare to comparative studies of the efficacy of the different vaccines to see which vaccines work best, and maybe some work better in some groups and others."

The really key thing is that older people who have not had the disease that they need to get vaccinated. And I think that's especially important that we ensure that less affluent people get the vaccines because they sometimes have more hurdles to get the health services. And we already saw with the lockdowns that the loved ones protected the laptop class or the professionals, people like journalists, like U.S. scientists, like me, lawyers and so on, while the workers were not protected. So that's why we have a much higher burden of this disease among the workers compared to more affluent people, and especially inner city workers, because infectious diseases are often more serious in an urban crowded setting."

That's a neat trick. I'd like to ask him exactly what is bonkers, as he calls it? Our right to free speech? Religious expression? Assembly? This is why we broke from England, to protect those God-given rights. But if you would like to know what is really bonkers, how about this one, Laura. Listen."

Laura, last week we reported on a truly bonkers story. The Audubon Zoo here in New Orleans canceled an event to show solidarity with the police over concerns that it might offend members inside and outside of the community. I imagine the folks at the zoo heard what I heard when I asked people in person about that decision."

But the president has been vaxxed twice, yet here he is coming out of mass this Sunday in a mask. And the other day at George Washington University, Dr. Fauci took some selfies with students outdoors. He also wore a mask. You see, I think this example undermines whatever they are saying. It actually erodes public confidence in the ability of the CDC to say go out, you are vaccinated, indoor or outdoor, no masks. And then you've got the two leading figures of the government on the issue wearing masks outside. I don't know how you follow this."

Of course, we only know about the donation because of a malicious media campaign to try to ruin the lives of all of Rittenhouse's donors. But Lieutenant Kelly isn't about to roll over. He is fighting back, and he joins me now exclusively along with his attorney, Ray Hogge. Lieutenant Kelly, tell us about how you felt, what happened that day you were fired."

If a police officer is speaking as a private citizen, which he was, on a matter of public concern, which he was, then the police department and the city have to have a pretty substantial reason to punish him for that speech, which they don't. Also, they completely deprived him of due process. They gave him -- they handed him his notice of his opportunity to respond and his chargers and simultaneously terminated him, which is completely unheard of."

And in it you allege that city of Norfolk, and particularly the police chief, terminated your employment because of your donation, and your message was perceived by them and some as opposing or impeding the Black Lives Matter political movement. Lieutenant, was race and politics at all a part of your basis for your termination?"

They want to protect the right to self-defense and free expression. And I don't think those rights are in conflict with each other. I think that's important to protect them for all citizens, not just private citizens, but also public employees, teachers, police officers, firefighters."

Your grievance that has already been filed includes the shocking photo of the Norfolk police chief, his name is Larry Boone, I want to repeat his name, Larry Boone, wearing his official uniform while holding a Black Lives Matter sign. Apparently, that's OK. So how is his public activism at a police protest acceptable, but a $25 anonymous donation to Kyle Rittenhouse's legal defense fund is grounds for termination? I will leave that to the lawyer to respond to, Mr. Hogge."

You can't have a double standard. And this is even worse than a double standard because the lieutenant did not walk around in a parade with any message. He donated a tiny amount of money anonymously."
