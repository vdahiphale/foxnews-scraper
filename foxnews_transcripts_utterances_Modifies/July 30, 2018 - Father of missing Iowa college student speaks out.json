I'm Sandra Smith, in for Martha McCallum, and this is our top story tonight. We've just learned that the Iowa Department of Public Safety will hold a news conference tomorrow afternoon to provide an update on the case of Mollie Tibbetts, the 20-year-old college student was last seen July 18th.  Investigators initially said, she went for a jog and never returned to her boyfriend's house where she was dog sitting. But there is new evidence tonight that suggests University of Iowa student was on her computer late that night and may have actually returned to that house after the jog. Now, friends and family members are making a desperate plea for anyone with information to come forward.",

Well, since Mollie Tibbetts went missing on July 18th, there have been intense searches for her in barns, in sheds, in cornfields, investigating the possibility that she went missing while out on that jog. But now, a family member says, it's possible Mollie Tibbetts made it back to her boyfriend's house the day that she went missing. Over the weekend, a relative of Tibbetts told a local news station that investigators say, Tibbetts' laptop might show she was doing homework at her boyfriend's house into the night possibly after her jog. And Tibbetts' boyfriend claims she sent him a snap chat picture the day she vanished that appeared to be inside. As of tonight, police have not publicly named any suspects and are being very tight lip about many details saying releasing too much information will compromise their investigation.  Police won't comment on whether there were any signs of forced entry at Mollie's boyfriend's home where she was staying, or if investigators have obtained any information from Mollie's Fitbit which could reveal her exact GPS location and heart rates the day she went missing.   Mollie's boyfriend was 100 miles away working at a construction job in. He claims, he was one of the first to throw up red flags that Mollie was missing. When she did not respond to one of his text messages and did not show up to work.",

And he's really the catalyst for getting them to turn out. Obviously, in Florida, he's had a very strong following from the beginning.

Yes, cost of course is the number one issue we have to deal with and not a lot of people are doing that when they are talking about Medicare for all and free college tuition, but the real question about Medicare for all especially is whether it will make the lives of people better. And when it comes to socialized medicine we've seen in states across the country, where single payer has been implemented, it has failed. In Great Britain people wait 100 days for essential surgeries and 750 people per month die waiting for services and as a result of that care.

I'm Sandra Smith, in for Martha McCallum, and this is our top story tonight. We've just learned that the Iowa Department of Public Safety will hold a news conference tomorrow afternoon to provide an update on the case of Mollie Tibbetts, the 20-year-old college student was last seen July 18th. Investigators initially said, she went for a jog and never returned to her boyfriend's house where she was dog sitting. But there is new evidence tonight that suggests University of Iowa student was on her computer late that night and may have actually returned to that house after the jog. Now, friends and family members are making a desperate plea for anyone with information to come forward."

      "utterance": "Sandra, good evening. Well, since Mollie Tibbetts went missing on July 18th, there have been intense searches for her in barns, in sheds, in cornfields, investigating the possibility that she went missing while out on that jog. But now, a family member says, it's possible Mollie Tibbetts made it back to her boyfriend's house the day that she went missing. Over the weekend, a relative of Tibbetts told a local news station that investigators say, Tibbetts' laptop might show she was doing homework at her boyfriend's house into the night possibly after her jog. And Tibbetts' boyfriend claims she sent him a snap chat picture the day she vanished that appeared to be inside. As of tonight, police have not publicly named any suspects and are being very tight lip about many details saying releasing too much information will compromise their investigation. Police won't comment on whether there were any signs of forced entry at Mollie's boyfriend's home where she was staying, or if investigators have obtained any information from Mollie's Fitbit which could reveal her exact GPS location and heart rates the day she went missing. Mollie's boyfriend was 100 miles away working at a construction job in. He claims, he was one of the first to throw up red flags that Mollie was missing. When she did not respond to one of his text messages and did not show up to work."

      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",

      "utterance": "I talked to Mollie, Sunday for about three hours. We talked regularly on the phone. I live in California, she was out earlier this year for my wedding. And so, we just talked about she's going to the Dominican Republic for a wedding. Her boyfriend's brother, she's getting back to school, a book she's reading, just the usual stuff."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "I don't know, the authorities as you said are circumspect with all of the information. And so, they're not sharing that sort of information with us, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "A lot of questions about what state the house she was staying in her boyfriend's house while he was off on this construction job and she was their dog sitting as much as we've been told. Something that has not been mentioned much was with the -- with the dogs there? Have the dogs' been found? Were they at home when authorities arrived at the house?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "Yes, the dogs are at the house. I was just there yesterday, and they're in perfect condition."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Interesting. And so, now they're waiting for new evidence that they may have new evidence in their possession, but are they sharing that with you, Rob?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "No, they're not. And for obvious reasons, the last thing the authorities want to do is share information that would give an advantage to anybody who would need to use that right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "The last we heard before the latest developments was that the last she was seen or heard of was on that run. And now, the new developments today is that the last she would have been seen was this photo she took snap chat to her boyfriend and it looked like she was indoors. Would it be like Mollie to be working on her computer and doing homework late into the evening like they believed she was now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "It wouldn't be unusual when she was staying with us in California. She was on the computer quite a bit. She was taking online courses, so that wouldn't be unusual. But, none of the timelines has been confirmed by the authorities. At least, not to our knowledge. And so, a lot of this is now conjecture and speculation that we just can't confirm."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I know they are not ruling anything out at this point, Rob. What is the search on the ground look like at this point, how vast does it become?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "Well, the search as far as we know, and again, and they're very discreet and they're very professional. Although I know they're very aggressive, we don't know that much about. What we learn, we learn really through the media. And then, we talk every day with the authorities and they give us a briefing but it's a very general briefing that they're making progress, that sort of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "While you're on, I wanted to make sure everyone knows that the tip line is (641) 623-5679. Because Rob, you have said that's what we need in sometime in case -- sometimes in cases like this, all it takes is one tip or one thing someone saw that was unusual that day that could lead to finding Mollie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, that is the one thing that we can do. And so, there's sort of three parts of this effort. And one is our partners in law enforcement. The other part is the local community, and there's a group that is creating all of the information, the yard signs, the posters, the banners, the pins, the people, the magnetic things that people are putting on trucks and cars. You can't go anywhere in Iowa without seeing a picture of Mollie. But the point is, is that we need to drive that information, someone saw something and they may not even know that it's significant. And so, don't hesitate, have the courage to call that number, it's totally anonymous. The authorities have plenty of resources to sort through what's real, and what isn't. And so, I talked to them again this morning, the authorities. And they said the only reason we're doing these interviews and partnering with the media. And we're really grateful to the media to help us get this story out. And I can't tell you how grateful we are. But the point of all of this is that someone knows something and they need to call the authorities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Rob, finally, how are you -- how are you doing tonight? How are you -- how's your family?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIBBETTS",
      "utterance": "You know, we have a tough family, and we're fighting, and we're just -- we wake up, and we go back at it. And so, you know we feel about the way you'd expect a family to feel that has someone that we love as much as Mollie. But, that's really not important, what's important is Mollie. So, we've set that all aside and we just keep going at it."
    },

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "We are just 100 days and counting now, until the midterm elections. And despite, dire predictions from critics, candidates running on President Trump's platform are reaping the benefits. Just look at the GOP primary race for governor in Florida. About six weeks ago, before the Fox debate, Florida's Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam had a 15-point lead to Congressman Ron DeSantis. Since then, President Trump endorsed DeSantis, and Putnam now finds himself with an 11-point deficit. But the president set to rally with the DeSantis in Tampa tomorrow night. Joining me now is Congressman Ron DeSantis, Republican candidate for Florida governor. Congressman, good evening to you. So, how is it going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RONALD DESANTIS, R-FLA., CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "Now, we're doing really well, Sandra. I think that, you know, that week, where we did get the Trump tweet, then we had our Fox News debate and, of course, I started finally advertising, was really, I think, the inflection point in the race. We've done really well since that point and, obviously, with the President coming down tomorrow, he's going to fill out an arena that has, I don't know how many thousands of people. That's going to be a big, big deal and I think that will further our momentum and lead us to victory."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "So, what do you -- what is -- what does all of this say about the way President Trump and the influence he is going to have as we mentioned, less than 100 days out now until midterms, what impact is he having on your Party and these races?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a big impact because he has brought new people to the Republican Party, and so you have some of the old guard who have, kind of, been around the block. He then energized new folks. And so I think those are the people we need to come out to support Republican candidates up and down the ballot. And he's really the catalyst for getting them to turn out. Obviously, in Florida, he's had a very strong following from the beginning. He had a record-setting performance in his primary down here, obviously, won Florida for the Electoral College and he has had good ratings in Florida, you know, for most of his presidency, including now. So I think he really brings a lot to the table in terms of driving those core Trump supporters out to the polls."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "I fought hard to elect President Trump and I'm supporting Adam Putnam for governor. Adam will stand with President Trump to get tough on illegal immigration, ban sanctuary cities and deport criminal illegal aliens. That's why Florida law enforcement is standing with him."

      "utterance": "Why is she not going to bat for you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think, she has been a friend of mine. She's done a good job. But, I mean, obviously, Donald Trump has made his choice. And so if I had the choice between those two endorsements, I would choose the President any day of the week and twice on Sunday. I also just disagree with the substance of the admin. The fact of the matter is, Putnam has supported things like the Gang of Eight amnesty that Schumer and Obama pushed. He voted against allowing troops on the southern border, was the only Republican in Florida to do that. And he's against e-verify, which we need in Florida, so you can stop elimination. So there's actually a big divide between the two of us on that. And I think the President took the measure of both candidates and thought I was the leader that Florida needs."
    },

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Finally, I want to get your reaction to Nancy Pelosi, addressing Democrats saying our commitment to the economic well-being of working families has helped differentiate us from the damaging choices the Republican Congress has made to reward the wealthiest Americans and large corporations at the expense of weakening Americans' access to affordable health care, your response to her?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, the economy is doing very well, much better than when she was speaker of the house. I think we need to keep that momentum going. If she has her way, though, Americans will be paying higher federal taxes. Obviously, she would increase bureaucracy and red tape, which would slow down the economy. So I think we should build off the success we've had rather than turn over the reins to Pelosi. She had her chance and the American people rejected her program. It won't going to be better the second time around."

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "You know, I don't totally know. I think the congressman is right that in the Republican primary, it seems like nothing is better than getting the endorsement of Donald Trump. If he gives you his endorsement, you're going to get the nomination. But, you are seeing now, as we head into the general, a lot of these battleground districts the Republican incumbent does not want Donald Trump to come down there. They are not appearing at his rallies when he's coming to the state. And I think that gives you a sense that maybe for independent voters and undecided voters, the President is a very controversial figure."

You know, our chairwoman who is in-charge of overseeing all these races, Ronna McDaniel, says we want President Trump at every district. And to put it on top of that, our sister committee, the NRCC, has said we want President Trump in every district. In fact, they said, even the really competitive ones, and they cited to me the example of Georgia's sixth, where Karen Handel beat John Ossoff, despite the millions that poured in from Hollywood and elsewhere. She didn't just beat him using President Trump's name, she over performed 2016 by four points. So, we are using President Trump at any race across the country."

Now, the President wants the American taxpayers to pay for the wall. Republicans control the House, the Senate, the White House and the Supreme Court, so if they can't agree on a budget and they have to shut down the government, I think it's pretty clear --"

They thought it was such a fantastic idea to shut down the federal government for DACA recipients. It failed. It was the first shutdown that Democrats got blamed for, at least, in the last few decades. So, Democrats are quivering when they hear the word, shutdown. They lost the last one. And the American people want a border wall. Harvard-Harris Poll says 60 percent want a barrier on the southern border. The President is on the right side of the American people on this issue. No doubt."

      "utterance": "Yes. I think that the history -- it's true that the Democrats didn't come out that well from the last fight over that, but all the previous ones, and I kind of think the precedent is, if you call for a shutdown, and you threaten a shutdown, and then there's a shutdown, people say, that's the person who wanted the shutdown. So, I just -- we have never had a shutdown when the President was of the same Party, controlled both Houses of Congress. It doesn't make sense."

      "utterance": "Sandra, apparently, the Special Counsel's office is leaving the President's lawyers, hanging, because Rudy Giuliani said today that the Trump team reached out to Mueller's guys, 10 days ago, about possibly participating in an interview where there could be questions about alleged collusion, but not about alleged obstruction of justice. And Mayor Giuliani says, nobody from Mueller's team of investigators ever got back to him. So, he has now cooled on the idea of subjecting the commander-in-chief to a legally perilous sit-down."

The Robert Mueller rigged witch-hunt, headed now by 17, increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer, angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent dossier, paid for by crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the witch-hunt is an illegal scam! So, even though the President said earlier this month, he would love to do an interview with the Special Counsel's office, in his investigation, and he could still change his mind at some point in the future. Our colleague, John Roberts, reports that soon there might be an official announcement that the President will not do an interview with Mueller's team to talk about alleged collusion. Even though Giuliani reiterated today, in one of a series of interviews, that he does not believe collusion is a crime, back to you."

But, you know, the President is not going to be indicted. Justice Department procedures and guidance that's been in existence since the Watergate era, does not allow for a sitting President to be indicted. So, the peril for President Trump here, to the extent there is any, has always been impeachment, which is a political process, not a legal one. And what they are trying to do is take their case to the Court of Public Opinion. He's not as worried as the normal defense lawyer would be worried about saying things that could be used against his client in court. And I think they're pretty confident that there is no criminal case."

      "speaker": "ANDREW MCCARTHY, FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "From Rudy's standpoint that's actually correct. Now there's been a number of times in the investigation were Rudy sees on the legal aspect of the defense of the president gives these sweeping denials, but what Rudy is saying is correct, there is collusion, it's just concerted activity. You and I are colluding by having this conversation. The only thing prosecutors care about is conspiracy, which is an agreement by two or more people to commit a federal crime and the conspiracy that was the rationale for this investigation, he's precisely right about that, if the hacking conspiracy and there hasn't been any evidence at least that we know of that ties either the president or anyone in the trauma campaign to that. So the reason this is relevant is a prosecutor should not get to interview the president. This would be an easy one for people to see if they were trying to interview a journalist, right. He would say there needs to be a serious crime and there needs to be some showing that the journalist is the only repositories, the only source of the information that the prosecutor has available. Can't get it from anywhere else. You don't just get to interview the president because you think it would be interesting. You have to show--"

You know, as a prosecutor you want to feel like you can have conversations with the defense lawyers and have a sort of exchange of information that isn't going to be played out in the media day by day. And that if I tell you something in a private conversation, I'm not going to watch on television."

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "To me, it's not. Now they've said from the beginning that there's a lot of stuff that we don't know, which is true enough. But it really is up to the Justice Department. Mueller answers to Rod Rosenstein, who is the deputy attorney general. The Justice Department should be exercising control here to make sure that if Mueller wants to have this interview, and it's perfectly understandable why he should want it. His job is to find out what happened and to get all the relevant information. It's the supervision at the Justice Department who has to come in to say, look, you don't just get to interview the president, you have to show there is a serious crime and you have to show that he's the only one who can give you the information that you need to make the case. And I just don't -- that's why Rudy keeps saying there is no crime, because if there's no crime, what's the point of having the conversation?"

But when it comes to this young woman and what she wants to offer her district and the country, we have to look at the map here and she's talking about free Medicare for all, free health care, free tuition for anybody who wants to go to a trade school or public university. That all sounds really great but if you go to an economics class in college you will learn that there's no such thing as a free lunch. Sandra, I know that you know that with your economic background. And the fact is that even if we pass a Medicare for all plan it would cost $3.2 trillion per year if everything went running smoothly and the federal government right now takes in about 3.4 or $3.7 trillion per year and it would completely eat up every single taxpayer dollar we have in this country, including if you are going to confiscate even more of the wealth that is earned through success in this country."

What my problem is, you know, anybody can say, you know, I'm just like such and such candidate. It's just like Cortez or I'm just like Sanders. That's just like me saying I'm just like LeBron James and I can play the game as well as him. You know, saying it and actually being that someone is something totally different. And I tell candidates all the time, where they are going to lose is trying to copy and paste political platforms. Find your own voice. You know, Cortez ran in the Bronx. She ran completely, you know, with what she believes with her constituents even though clearly she can't articulate it as well as I guess she should, but when you look at candidates who are running in Washington State, there's two different candidates, two different agendas, you can't just say and go, you know what, I'm just like Bernie Sanders, I'm just like Cortez. It's actually poor campaigning and it's embarrassing to be quite honest. You need to be able to articulate your own ideas and explain those policies that you say that you want to move forward.

But Venezuela also used to be one of the richest countries in the world and Democrats who are in the middle-of-the-road trying to hold onto those Trump voters to switch from Obama to Trump are terrified to answer the question about whether they support socialism in these far left policies. But the key question here is this. Yes, cost of course is the number one issue we have to deal with and not a lot of people are doing that when they are talking about Medicare for all and free college tuition, but the real question about Medicare for all especially is whether it will make the lives of people better. And when it comes to socialized medicine we've seen in states across the country, where single payer has been implemented, it has failed. In Great Britain people wait 100 days for essential surgeries and 750 people per month die waiting for services and as a result of that care. So, the big question is will a huge expansion of government really actually make the lives of people better? And the answer is absolutely not, especially through these socialist programs."

Me too just insure myself and my daughter cost $450 a month. There certainly needs to be some option other than what we have now. I don't believe we should completely rid of the private sector but there does need to be a better public option for people to buy into. I think to allow those two things to compete, government to compete with private sector is a good thing. Being able to say that they should be totally government defendant may not be the way to go. But if that is something that Senator Sanders wants to do our people who are left that's something they need to do the math and be able to explain. Because we all know that the majority of Americans, even Republicans and Democrats they do sit in the center and we can't assume that just because someone that Bernie supported that they are a socialist because I worked for the man and I am not. But I do believe that there should be some type of option they could provide better health care for both me and my child and many others like us."

In a brief statement after a board of directors meeting today CBS merely said it, quote, \"is in the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation.\" No other action was taken on this matter at today's board meeting. CBS did not put a timeline on when that outside counsel might be in place or how long it expects the investigation to take, but the company did announce its postponing its annual stockholders meeting, which had been scheduled for August 10th. The announcements follow sexual misconduct claims made by six women and published in the New Yorker last week. Some of the women also alleged Moonves had deliberately damaged their careers after they refused his advances. Moonves said in response to the allegations that he has made mistakes and recognized that, quote, \"There were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances.\" And he added, \"But I always understood and respected and abided by the principle that no means no, and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career.\" Moonves' wife Julie Chen, who hosts a show on her husband's network, briefly addressed the story today."

Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media and how that fake news has morphed into phrase enemy of the people, sad.\" Out of that meeting then the publisher of the New York Times responded, Howie, and he said this. \"I told the president directly that I thought his language was not just divisive, but increasingly dangerous. I told him that, although the phrase fake news is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists the enemy of the people. Instead, I implored him to reconsider his broader attacks on journalism, which I believe are dangerous and harmful to our country.\" What did you make of that exchange?"

Sulzberger, who is 37-year-old rookie publisher at the Times to challenge him. And now you have each side accusing the other essentially of risking people's lives because you have Sulzberger saying enemy of the American people, fake news is increasing risks to journalists around the world. And you have the president coming back with a tweet storm in which he calls some journalists unpatriotic, which is akin to enemy of the people, for revealing the inner workings of government.
