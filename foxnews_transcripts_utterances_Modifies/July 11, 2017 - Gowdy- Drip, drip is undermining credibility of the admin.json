We just won Indiana, but we're talking about a contested convention, things are going a million miles an hour again. And hey, wait a minute, I've heard about all these things, but maybe this is something; I should hear him out.  I've been reading about scandals that people were probably under-reporting for a long time. So, maybe it was something that had to do with one of those things. I mean, this was her, perhaps, involvement with the Russian government. So, you know, I didn't know if there was any credibility. I didn't know if there's something behind it. I can't vouch for the information. Someone sent me an e-mail. I can't help what someone sends me. You know, I read it, I responded accordingly, and if there was something there, I think it is pretty common.",

I mentioned the dossier; I mentioned BB and Victory 15, the campaign against Prime Minister Netanyahu. There's also this big Ukraine issue, and that is involving the Hillary Clinton campaign, involving the DNC. There was a meeting, it did take place at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, information was sought and was gotten and it did have an impact on the campaign resulting in Paul Manafort getting out. You know Martha, we are now living in the midst, I think, of the informational crisis in the country, and that is that we have media; they don't seem to care about mishandling, destruction of e-mails with Hillary Clinton. They don't seem to care about Hillary signing off on the Uranium one deal: up to 20 percent of America's Uranium going to Vladimir Putin; it sounds like a Russia conspiracy, and over $100 million kickback to her foundation. They don't seem to care, Comey, classified information, violation of the Espionage Records Act. They don't seem to care about 125 deep state leaks in 126 days. They don't seem to care about a meeting with Loretta Lynch on the Tarmac.  And my point is this: the media has lost all perspective in the country right now, and while they are focused on Russia, and one issue and they ignore Ukraine, and they ignored victory 15, and they ignore the dossier, you know, talking about hookers, and urinating in beds -- I'm not trying to be crude -- and they ignore real felonies and crimes committed. They've have done a disservice to the American people, their effort now is to delegitimize this president, prevent him from doing the job that what I call the forgotten men and women of America wanted him to do.",

Donald Trump Jr. himself said I never had any meetings, any substantial meetings with anybody with regard to Russia. So now, that turns out to not be true. So now, the pull -- the string is there to keep pulling on.  Who else said they didn't have meetings and what meetings were there, what was the nature of those? And then you have the sanctions issue here because if the Russian government looked at the Trump campaign and said, you know what, if we meet with them, they seem amenable to talking to us. Maybe we can convince them that if we, you know, we give them some stuff on Hillary Clinton they will lift these sanctions. And, in truth, President Trump has indicated that he's open to doing that.

Why? Because the contractors typically fill a very niche role that the commander needs like, say, anthropologist that speaks Pashto and studied the tribe. You don't find that very easily in the military or government. Or they do jobs that we don't want our trigger-polar doing. That we want to dedicate our trigger- polar to do other things, like, you know, they'll do logistics, or they'll do cooks, or those types of pieces. So they have a role, but I do not support, do not support, arm contractors taking the place of our military. You know, Martha, I think what this is showing here in this debate is that people are exhausted with Afghanistan, you hear a lot about how hard it is, we've been there 15 years, it's cost us billions of dollars. Is the war winnable? But my argument, and folks who serve their, tell me that they fully agree, we don't have a choice at this point. ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other groups will rise in the wake of Taliban gains. Right now, we are slowly losing. We're essentially treading time and treading water. We really don't have a choice but to stay engaged for the long haul. And keep in mind, these troops that we're talking about sending over that the generals out there have requested, they're not guys shooting bad guys and kicking in doors. They're advisors that are helping the Afghan army fight the war. And the strategy there is to build the Afghan army up. It's going to take a long time, just like it took a long time to build the South Korean army up. And then, to eventually wear the Taliban down so that they'll come to the negotiating table. But we cannot just quit like we did in Iraq, and that cost ISIS to create the Islamic State.",

Mr. Christie may be eyeing a radio job once his term ends in January. And we'll see if that works well. So the U.S. has a new regulatory czar, and this is a big job in the Trump administration. The senate confirming Neomi Rao, she will be tapped in implementing the president effort to roll back regulation. It's a big part of draining the swamp. She's got bipartisan support, how about that. And a final farewell to the NYPD's Miosotis Familia, officers lined the streets today to pay tribute to this woman of three, who was shot sitting in her patrol car. The flag on her coffin was presented to her young son. New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, spoke at the funeral. He's been criticized for jetting off to Germany to protest President Trump just days after this awful murder in his city. Reportedly hundreds of officers turned their backs to him in protest. So as you remember last week, comments from Muslim activists, Linda Sarsour, spark controversy over her use of the word jihad in terms of what she thought should happen against the Trump White House. Sarsour is now fighting back to her critics, calling them Islamophobic, writing, quote, ugly threats comes from people who also spout anti-Muslim, xenophobic, and white supremacist beliefs. She goes on to say the reasons I'm suggesting to such particularly public vitriol are simple. I'm a Palestinian-American woman in a hijab.

She began her remarks by crediting and giving praise to her mentor, Siraj Wahhaj, who was there and who she had described as her mentor, one of the unindicted co- conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. And I say all this because the hadith that she cited as the defense and definition of truth was also the same hadith that was used during the blind sheik's trial. Of course, everyone remembered that, in which Siraj Wahhaj, her mentor, was called as a witness for defense. And it was that same hadith that he used to actually justify physical force for jihad. Now, it's important to note that the same organization, Martha, have actually endorsed the duality of the definition as presented in the English translations, the reliance of the traveler, which mentions that as a struggle, spiritual and physical, but with the ultimate goal of Islamic jurisprudence in place of any other legal system which, by the basic definition in our country, would qualify as sedition, Martha.",

And much of what she says suggests that you don't really have to put yourself as a person in this country, sort of the law of the land does not necessarily apply to you if it's against the oppressor.

And then you have the sanctions issue here because if the Russian government looked at the Trump campaign and said, you know what, if we meet with them, they seem amenable to talking to us. Maybe we can convince them that if we, you know, we give them some stuff on Hillary Clinton they will lift these sanctions. And, in truth, President Trump has indicated that he's open to doing that. In fact, he's trying to do that to some extent, to a great extent at this point to fight against Congress. That's what all adds up and looks very bad."

The goodness for news for us, we have a guy named Robert Mueller, who's a former United States Attorney and the head of the FBI. And if you look at the document that empowers them with jurisdiction, the very first entry links coordination between the Russian government and members of the Trump campaign. So, I'm going to let Bob Mueller sort out all the criminality; that is not the job of members of Congress, and it's not the job of The New York Times."

      "speaker": "GOWDY",

The political level, Martha, here we are beginning another week, this one in July, with a new revelation about Russia. And then the third, which is more of a medical issue, is the amnesia of people that are in the Trump orbit. Someone close to the president needs to get everyone connected with that campaign in a room and say, from the time you saw Dr. Zhivago until the moment you drank vodka with a guy named Boris, you list every single one of those. And we're going to turn them over to the Special Counsel, because, drip, drip, drip, is undermining the credibility of this administration."

In terms this Magnitsky Act, which basically is a U.S. Act that went through Congress that limits friends of Vladimir Putin, close associates, from doing things they like to do, like traveling to the United States, traveling, you know, throughout other areas of the world, because it's a slap on the wrist for human right violence, and it's selective in terms of who it impacts. So, their punishment, the Russian government's punishment, was to say, we're going to end all of these adoptions that are happening to the United States, and a few other things that they did. Are you concerned that there was an effort to influence this campaign with regard to changing that or to find a, you know, sort of a sympathetic ear on that?"

      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "I'm not nearly as concerned with that. I've had members of my own church impacted by the inability to adopt children from Russia. I'm much more concerned about the purported reason for the meeting as opposed to the real reason. The purported reason was for an agent of a foreign power to try to influence our election. That concerns me more than someone trying to sit down with a member of, perhaps, an incoming administration to lobby for a policy change. I'm more concerned with the actual words in the e- mail than the real reason she wanted to meet."

And here we have this meeting that may amount to nothing, but here we are on a Tuesday on a weekly ought to be discussing infrastructure and tax reform, and we're still talking about Russia. And frankly, with some good reason, because this e-mail -- we should've known about it before yesterday."

But you know, in terms of the other story, Jim Comey and the leaking of the supposedly some classified information when he took those notes after his meeting with the president, is that do those notes become a government document, and do you want to hear more from him on this?"

    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",

Those two committees are probably the more appropriate committees to have a conversation with Director Comey. The memos are available. The FBI has made them available, and I'm going to look at them this week. I do not want to prejudge. I don't think it's fair to do it to Republicans, I think it's fair to do it to Comey to think that's because someone reported something that it's necessarily true. I don't know whether there's classified information in these memos are not. I'm going to read them this week. I'll have a better idea. That's probably going to be a House Intel issue as opposed to oversight."

Make no mistake, the pressure is on. Former congressman Jason Chaffetz, joins me; he's been tough on his colleagues on this. He's here to tell us what has to happen and by when. Also this, a controversial Muslim activist says she knows white people are upset now with her call for Jihad against President Trump. They're all bigots, really? They're all lashing.

Just as I was saying, this is a cover-up in search of a crime. There wasn't any evidence of collusion. There were lots of coincidences, lots of meetings, lots of nondisclosures, but that's all circumstantial. There was nothing to show that the Trump administration was aware of, or supporting the Russian interference in our elections. And this just showed up today in black and white, released by Don Jr. himself. This is not released in the, you know, the anti-Trump media, so you see it in black and white. This is not to say that collusion is a crime. It never was. But it is to say that the denial of collusion is very weak right now because it looks as if -- I don't know if there's any other explanation -- Don Jr. was receptive to receiving information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "OK. But that's different. You're saying he was receptive, and he said that himself in an interview with Sean; we played the sound bite. He said, you know, there's all this stuff going around, and you know, I get an e-mail from this guy that I know, who says, you know, we have something you should see. Every campaign is looking for dirt on the opposition, every single one, right? So, he goes to the meeting, and, you know, as per his claim, you know, nothing came out of it. He said it was a complete waste of time. So, you know, you've got the suggestion that, well, if you know something that would be helpful to us, I'd like to hear it. Is that in and of itself, you know, collusion when there was absolutely no fruit from the actual meeting? There's nothing there after the meeting is over?"

This is not somebody coming out of the woodwork in Indiana, where the story about the Clintons; this is a foreign power and not just any foreign power, an adversary from power. A foreign power that invades our allies in Georgia, in Ukraine, buzzes our airplanes. Just last week in the U.N., it mixed any attempt to get sanctions increased on North Korea. That supports a genocidal regime in Syria."

They agreed with the critics, today critics, that this is a bad thing to do, and they were saying for six months, we didn't do it, there is no evidence that we did it, how can you imagine that we did it? Now, they're saying, oh, yes, we did it but it wasn't so bad, and we were incompetent at it. That's not a very good defense."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But I do think when they go through this they're going to investigate, obviously, they are going to figure out whether or not there was any information that changed hands. And if no information changed hands, I think it's going to be tough to say that it was more than, you know, the sort of intention or the hope that he was going to get some information. But that the information never was -- there was no transaction, there was nothing communicated. And as you say -- I mean, there could be more. And we talked about this earlier, this creates a string to pull on, and there certainly could be more. That, in my mind, is what we don't know yet."

Look, this is incompetence. They got swindled. And he admits, if I had known, I wouldn't have done this. But to say, I love it to be informed that the Russians are working on their behalf, contradicts six months of stories. And I say again, I defended them because up until today, there was no \"there\" there. Well, now, there is a there. And now to say, as some are saying, well, collusion, we all do it. We did it in Israel. The Ukrainians are colluding. Come on. That is pathetic. The fact is, the Russians are an adversary, probably are most dangerous in the world. And when you get information that the Russians want to dig dirt on your opponent and give it to you, and support you in your election, you go to the FBI. You don't go to the meeting."

The army sergeant assigned 25th infantry Ottawa, who was trained as an air traffic controller and a combatant, and documents show the army reprimanded the soldier several times for threatening other service members and for arguing pro-ISIS views. An FBI forensic review of his computer also found classified military documents and hundreds of items referencing ISIS and violence."

And these disturbing developments come amid a growing debate inside the Trump administration over the next steps in the war on terror, the president putting power very much in the hands of the Pentagon, which now controls our troop levels in Afghanistan. But at the same time, White House insiders like Steve Bannon are reportedly pitching options such as using a private army in Afghanistan. Here with more, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Waltz, former Green Beret commander, and a Fox News contributor. Michael, good evening. Always good to see you. Great to have you here tonight."

      "utterance": "So the story is very interesting, and it comes as word is that there's only be 3,900 additional U.S. military to be involved in the push in Afghanistan. And you have to wonder, given what we're learning about what Steve Bannon has in mind, if they're not talking about making tens of thousands of other people on the ground with people from Blackwater and DynCorp and some of these private military contractors. What do you think of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, look, on this contractor issue, Martha, go into any modern military command today and you're going to see three types of people, you're going to see uniforms, you're going to see government civilians, and then you're going to see contracted civilians. Why? Because the contractors typically fill a very niche role that the commander needs like, say, anthropologist that speaks Pashto and studied the tribe. You don't find that very easily in the military or government. Or they do jobs that we don't want our trigger-polar doing. That we want to dedicate our trigger- polar to do other things, like, you know, they'll do logistics, or they'll do cooks, or those types of pieces. So they have a role, but I do not support, do not support, arm contractors taking the place of our military. You know, Martha, I think what this is showing here in this debate is that people are exhausted with Afghanistan, you hear a lot about how hard it is, we've been there 15 years, it's cost us billions of dollars. Is the war winnable? But my argument, and folks who serve their, tell me that they fully agree, we don't have a choice at this point. ISIS, al-Qaeda, and other groups will rise in the wake of Taliban gains. Right now, we are slowly losing. We're essentially treading time and treading water. We really don't have a choice but to stay engaged for the long haul. And keep in mind, these troops that we're talking about sending over that the generals out there have requested, they're not guys shooting bad guys and kicking in doors. They're advisors that are helping the Afghan army fight the war. And the strategy there is to build the Afghan army up. It's going to take a long time, just like it took a long time to build the South Korean army up. And then, to eventually wear the Taliban down so that they'll come to the negotiating table. But we cannot just quit like we did in Iraq, and that cost ISIS to create the Islamic State."

    {
      "speaker": "WALTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, the commander there is saying that he hasn't had any proof. We haven't heard from him for quite some time. I think, you know, Al-Baghdadi would want to show that he's alive, to show his followers and his recruits, so I'm trying to be a little bit optimistic. I do think it will hurt the Islamic state after losing Raqqa and Mosul. But, the Islamic State is not done as a movement, Islamic extremists is not done as a moment. So we still need that broader strategy to undermine the ideology as we keep taking out their leaders, just like we took out Osama Bin Laden."

      "utterance": "Governor Chris Christie confronting a critic, that's just one of the stories that we have for you tonight on the side. The New Jersey governor appearing on a local radio call-in show, he was slammed for his recent trip to a close to New Jersey beach, the caller a self-described Democrat. Mr. Christie may be eyeing a radio job once his term ends in January. And we'll see if that works well. So the U.S. has a new regulatory czar, and this is a big job in the Trump administration. The senate confirming Neomi Rao, she will be tapped in implementing the president effort to roll back regulation. It's a big part of draining the swamp. She's got bipartisan support, how about that. And a final farewell to the NYPD's Miosotis Familia, officers lined the streets today to pay tribute to this woman of three, who was shot sitting in her patrol car. The flag on her coffin was presented to her young son. New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, spoke at the funeral. He's been criticized for jetting off to Germany to protest President Trump just days after this awful murder in his city. Reportedly hundreds of officers turned their backs to him in protest. So as you remember last week, comments from Muslim activists, Linda Sarsour, spark controversy over her use of the word jihad in terms of what she thought should happen against the Trump White House. Sarsour is now fighting back to her critics, calling them Islamophobic, writing, quote, ugly threats comes from people who also spout anti-Muslim, xenophobic, and white supremacist beliefs. She goes on to say the reasons I'm suggesting to such particularly public vitriol are simple. I'm a Palestinian-American woman in a hijab. Now here, Dana Loesch, host of Dana on the Blaze TV, and Qasim Rashid, national spokesperson for the Muslim community in the United States. Good to have both of you here tonight."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So Dana, she says that she's being picked on, that jihad -- she meant and use the word jihad in a different context. That she was talking about the struggle, and that's the true meaning of the word."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOESCH",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, if that were all it was, I wouldn't see, maybe, perhaps, a problem with it. But we have to look at the context of the situation. She was speaking at a conference for an organization that has before featured as a keynote speaker, Anwar al-Awlaki. She began her remarks by crediting and giving praise to her mentor, Siraj Wahhaj, who was there and who she had described as her mentor, one of the unindicted co- conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. And I say all this because the hadith that she cited as the defense and definition of truth was also the same hadith that was used during the blind sheik's trial. Of course, everyone remembered that, in which Siraj Wahhaj, her mentor, was called as a witness for defense. And it was that same hadith that he used to actually justify physical force for jihad. Now, it's important to note that the same organization, Martha, have actually endorsed the duality of the definition as presented in the English translations, the reliance of the traveler, which mentions that as a struggle, spiritual and physical, but with the ultimate goal of Islamic jurisprudence in place of any other legal system which, by the basic definition in our country, would qualify as sedition, Martha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, Qasim, you heard Dana's argument. And Sarsour did go on to talk about the fact that we're not here to assimilate or to please any other people in authority. She says if you're Muslim and you're standing on the sidelines, you're aiding and abetting oppressors in the United States. And much of what she says suggests that you don't really have to put yourself as a person in this country, sort of the law of the land does not necessarily apply to you if it's against the oppressor. So it makes it pretty tough to argue that jihad just means a personal struggle in the way that she frames her argument."

      "speaker": "QASIM RASHID, AHMADIYYA MUSLIM COMMUNITY U.S.",

What I can tell you as a spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, the nation's oldest Muslim organization, founded by a man name, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, a messiah, who wrote a book at 1902 called, the British government and jihad, explaining that the true meaning of jihad is a jihad of the pen, it's of education, it's speaking truth to power. And I think this is the context that Linda was very clear about, that we cannot sit on the sidelines when we see in the United States, for example, record high levels of anti-Muslim violence and discrimination. What we want to do is, rather than engage in these attacks on one another, we want the truth."

      "speaker": "RASHID",
      "utterance": "Well, everyone is entitled to their opinion. My point is this. Rather than find ways to attack one another further, let's look at how we can find ways to work together. We all agree we don't want terrorism. We all agree we don't want violence. I mean, today, it happens to be the anniversary of -- genocide, where Christian terrorist killed 8,000 Muslims. We don't blame all Christians for that. What we need to do is find the proper understanding of jihad, and that happens through education."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, you can talk about that, but it's backed up the language the she used surrounding it. I'm so sorry, guys. We have a lot of breaking news, and we have to leave it there.

Our quote tonight is the officer's oath, I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I'm about to enter, so help me God.
