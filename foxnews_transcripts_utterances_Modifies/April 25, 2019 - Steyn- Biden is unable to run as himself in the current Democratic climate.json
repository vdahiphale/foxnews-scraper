Joe Biden has entered the 2020 presidential race and is immediately a front-runner, but can he beat 20 radical democrats fighting to take him down? Mark Steyn, one of your favorites will be here in just a minute to talk about that, plus the hecklers who went after Bernie Sanders last night, that's also just ahead.  But first, a Massachusetts judge and court officer who helped an illegal immigrant criminal escape the custody of I.C.E. have actually been indicted for obstruction of justice and several other criminal charges.

Last year, you had another judge had a had an illegal Dominican gangbanger in front of her who was accused of raping a BC college co-ed well while she was drunk and the prosecutors had asked for a high bail so that I.C.E. could grab this guy and get him deported or at least get him locked up while he faced charges.

Whether you agree with the wall or not, if you isolate just that, those remarks leave a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths and it just -- I think a lot of people who maybe even would have supported you know, some of -- a wall or extended fencing, when you hear what he says about Muslims and Mexicans, you just don't want to even be associated with it at all.",

Biden is tired and is in the awful position of being unable to run as himself because the Democrats have basically disowned 90 percent of what Joe Biden has been doing in Washington for the last 45 years.

The text Strzok and Page discussed using post-election briefings to find people they could quote \"develop for potential relationships,\" end quote, which may refer to cultivating sources to inform on the President's associates. The texts also discussed tracking lines of questioning they received and quote, \"assessing changes in demeanor by those at the meetings.\" Congressman Devin Nunes of California tells Fox that these texts are evidence of deep irregularities as you might imagine in the FBI's Trump- Russia investigation. Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson meanwhile have sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr demanding more information. We will continue to monitor this extraordinary story. Now California's cities are filling up with homeless camps, needles and human waste. Instead of fixing those problems, the government has given financial aid to illegal immigrants and banned straws. Now lawmakers have a new idea, they want to ban schools from suspending students for willful defiance as they call it.

We have a bunch of ideologues who are in charge of major states of the West Coast and they're kind of running them into the ground. When you look at something like this, it's usually about institutionalized racism, right? When you look at the data, it suggests that if you're a student of color, you're at a higher likelihood of being suspended. So they're looking at this and saying, okay, there has to be something wrong. There has to be something wrong beyond what the teachers are doing. Let's just stop it rather than look at the data. So they say, okay, we're not going to do the suspensions, but you're ignoring the root cause because I think all of us will probably agree there are some situations where teachers or administrators are rushing to suspending certain students or expelling students for whatever their conduct is. But if you take an entire tool out of that toolbox, well you're making it harder for the teachers and by the way, you're literally ignoring the fact that institutionalized racism or not, these are teachers and educators who are suspending these students, right? I mean, this should be seen as a slap in the face to teachers, but progressives like to say, you know we fight for the teachers. Not really, because you're telling me that they're racists and they're targeting African-American students at a disproportionately high rate. It's a little bizarre.",

What it really is, is you can do it for a price. So for example, with the glass buildings, you can still do it if you want to do it. You know, people who want to live in huge lovely towers, but he's going to charge you millions of dollars and it's the exact same thing with the bags. It's the same thing with the congestion pricing, the problem is that taxes in New York are too high already and people are fleeing because we can't do the salt deduction any longer, so they came up $3.4 billion short due to personal income taxes from people who fled the state and didn't pay.

The lead Federal investigator said quoting, \"The people of the this country deserve nothing less than to know that they're appointed and elected representatives that are working on their behalf while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law not a personal agenda.\" Today, the judge and court officer were indicted by a grand jury and pled not guilty to obstruction of justice.

There are these sanctuary jurisdictions all across the country, but no judge, no politician, no sheriff or police commissioner has ever been indicted for letting these illegal aliens go and in Massachusetts as in most other areas of the country, this has gotten to be a terrible problem in the same courthouse which is just outside of Boston - - Newton District Court. Last year, you had another judge had a had an illegal Dominican gangbanger in front of her who was accused of raping a BC college co-ed well while she was drunk and the prosecutors had asked for a high bail so that I.C.E. could grab this guy and get him deported or at least get him locked up while he faced charges. The judge cut the bail to $2,500.00 and he escaped out the back door.

There was like an effort made to help facilitate the escape. It wasn't even just using the law as a state might have passed it and we can debate whether that would be constitutional or legal, but this is an actual effort to facilitate the escape by this judge and that clerk.

It's people coming in through legal ports of entry and things like that. It would only cut about a third of illegal immigration, and I think a lot of people disagree with it on the front of number one, it's just not cost-effective to spend that much money to cut a third of illegal immigration and then also just the way that Trump promoted the wall which was essentially calling Mexicans rapists and criminals and so on and so forth. Whether you agree with the wall or not, if you isolate just that, those remarks leave a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths and it just -- I think a lot of people who maybe even would have supported you know, some of -- a wall or extended fencing, when you hear what he says about Muslims and Mexicans, you just don't want to even be associated with it at all."

He is a romantic figure. He is a romantic insane figure, but he is romantic. Biden is tired and is in the awful position of being unable to run as himself because the Democrats have basically disowned 90 percent of what Joe Biden has been doing in Washington for the last 45 years. So that's a terrible problem for a guy when you have to run in an essentially dishonest way, which is why he gave this tortured and weird rationale as to why he's decided to get into the race in this video.

But Biden doesn't even do the old thing well, because you say what you like about Russian collusion, but the basic premise of the Russian collusion fever was that Trump was some kind of deep sleeper or not so deep sleeper for Vladimir Putin. That doesn't indict all Trump supporters.

      "speaker": "RITCHIE",
      "utterance": "Well, let me be the first to say I certainly believe that we should pick the most qualified person to hold that position as Vice President, however I always find it very interesting that we seem to, when we talk about identity politics, Tammy, we always seem to focus on marginalized groups of people, right? We always focus on African-Americans or women. But it's weird because that same notion should also apply -- this identity politics notion -- should also apply to Republicans who may appeal to more white male dominated audiences. So is white or Caucasian a race? Isn't male a gender? So I'm not really sure why it's only when someone is speaking to issues to people that look like me that all of a sudden it becomes identity politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",

What are you -- or in the case of the question about the Vice President, are you going to elect a woman? It's a difference between that and policies that appeal across the board or to let's say blue-collar workers in the Midwest who might be primarily male or have a different point of view in that. It's a difference between deliberately appealing to a group of individuals for the sake of doing that versus having policies that happen to appeal to a particular constituency in the country. But I would also say, I don't know if you noticed this why would the men then -- somebody like Beto O'Rourke presuming that the women running are running to be his Vice President?"

You know, he sort of thought maybe he could pull some of those Hillary Clinton supporters after Barack Obama got the nomination from the DNC. He thought, \"Oh, I can pull those women.\" But it's about if you're going to do -- have a woman, don't say, \"I'm going to select a woman,\" say, \"I'm going to select the most qualified one,\" and that way, you're looking at her qualifications as opposed to her gender."

Text messages between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page indicate that the FBI may have tried to use post-election briefings to monitor the Trump team. These text messages were released in 2018, but Fox has learned that they are now under renewed scrutiny from congressional investigators. The text Strzok and Page discussed using post-election briefings to find people they could quote \"develop for potential relationships,\" end quote, which may refer to cultivating sources to inform on the President's associates. The texts also discussed tracking lines of questioning they received and quote, \"assessing changes in demeanor by those at the meetings.\" Congressman Devin Nunes of California tells Fox that these texts are evidence of deep irregularities as you might imagine in the FBI's Trump- Russia investigation. Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson meanwhile have sent a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr demanding more information. We will continue to monitor this extraordinary story. Now California's cities are filling up with homeless camps, needles and human waste. Instead of fixing those problems, the government has given financial aid to illegal immigrants and banned straws. Now lawmakers have a new idea, they want to ban schools from suspending students for willful defiance as they call it. In other words students can be disruptive as much as they want in class and schools will be powerless to punish them. Jason Rantz is a Seattle radio host, he joins us now. Jason, welcome aboard."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RANTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, my guess is what's behind it is social justice, right. We have a bunch of ideologues who are in charge of major states of the West Coast and they're kind of running them into the ground. When you look at something like this, it's usually about institutionalized racism, right? When you look at the data, it suggests that if you're a student of color, you're at a higher likelihood of being suspended. So they're looking at this and saying, okay, there has to be something wrong. There has to be something wrong beyond what the teachers are doing. Let's just stop it rather than look at the data. So they say, okay, we're not going to do the suspensions, but you're ignoring the root cause because I think all of us will probably agree there are some situations where teachers or administrators are rushing to suspending certain students or expelling students for whatever their conduct is. But if you take an entire tool out of that toolbox, well you're making it harder for the teachers and by the way, you're literally ignoring the fact that institutionalized racism or not, these are teachers and educators who are suspending these students, right? I mean, this should be seen as a slap in the face to teachers, but progressives like to say, you know we fight for the teachers. Not really, because you're telling me that they're racists and they're targeting African-American students at a disproportionately high rate. It's a little bizarre."

      "speaker": "BRUCE",

You know everybody loses with this kind of a policy."

So let's say you decide we're no longer going to do the suspensions, we're going to do some alternative form of punishment, okay fine, but that's still not addressing that root cause of what maybe is going on in the home and while you're dealing with this to your point, you've got students who are just there trying to learn who are constantly being interrupted."

Mayor de Blasio has loved his last hotdog and now he feels like we don't need them any longer. It's always a money grab when you look at these things. That's what you have to understand and this is part of as you said, the Green New Deal. We're going to do away with processed meats because you've heard about cows and animals and they're little bit gassy and we've got to get rid of them to have a livable planet. So this is part of his plan where he's going to take away buildings with lots of windows, no one is going to drive and we're going to get rid of plastic and paper bags in spots, but if you look closely, these things are never bans. What it really is, is you can do it for a price. So for example, with the glass buildings, you can still do it if you want to do it. You know, people who want to live in huge lovely towers, but he's going to charge you millions of dollars and it's the exact same thing with the bags. It's the same thing with the congestion pricing, the problem is that taxes in New York are too high already and people are fleeing because we can't do the salt deduction any longer, so they came up $3.4 billion short due to personal income taxes from people who fled the state and didn't pay. In a panic did they decide to spend less? Oh no, Tammy Bruce, why would they do that? No, they're going to dream up new ways to tax the rest of us and those few idiots like myself who are left here. They're going to drive us out by taking away our hotdogs and taxing us for living in a house with windows."
