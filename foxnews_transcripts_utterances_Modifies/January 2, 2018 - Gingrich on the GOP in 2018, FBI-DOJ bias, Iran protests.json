      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" President Trump, he is on fire right now, tonight, on Twitter, and he's driving the left, predictably, absolutely insane. You're going to love this. Also, tonight, you do not want to miss The Hill's, John Solomon out with an explosive report about the FBI's corrupt Clinton email investigation. We have that exclusive report and President Trump's 2017 successes have now created a republican blueprint for the mid-terms. Will they follow? And last year was an epic failure for fake news in this country, especially the fake cannabis news network. We'll explain all of that, but first tonight's breaking news, opening monologue for the new year.  So in spite of vicious media attacks and many political obstacles, well 2017 was a very successful first year for President Trump. Now, before we get to the full list that the media will never show you, let's take a look at the economy.  Stock market is at an all-time high and hit over 60 record closes in 2017 alone. The Dow Jones was up 25 percent, over $5 trillion in new wealth has now been created. Unemployment -- yes, unemployment at a 17-year low since -- just 4.1 percent. And since taking office, President Trump has created 1.7 million new jobs. African-American unemployment, a 17-year low.  We ended the year with consumer confidence sitting at a 17-year high. Home prices are up six percent as is home building. Regulations have been slashed at a historic rate. And the Trump administration cut 16 regulations for every new one that was created. Also, let's talk about GDP. Now, so far under President Trump, we have seen two quarters over three percent. Let's compare that with President Barack Obama, the only president in the history of this country to never reach three percent GDP growth for an entire year. And we can't forget about Obama's terrible economy. Millions more people on food stamps and in poverty, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the worst economic recovery since the 1940s, the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s, and the list goes on. Worst recovery since the 1940s, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years.  And unlike Obama, business confidence is now soaring under President Trump. In fact, the news is so good that even the liberal New York Times cannot even ignore this. Take a look at this headline. I didn't make it up. \"The Trump Effect: Business anticipating less regulation loosens the purse strings.\" This is exactly what we have been seeing happening all across the country. You couple that with the brand new $1.5 trillion tax plan that is now taking effect, and what you have a recipe for a Reagan-style economic explosion.  You, the American people, you are beginning to see the direct impact of this tax bill. For example, companies like Boeing, AT&T, Comcast, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bank Corps -- all announced employee bonuses or pay increases following that bill. That's real money back in the pockets of the forgotten men and women that deserve it in this country.   Take a look, for example, what happened over at, yes, liberal CBS News. They had an accountant crunch the numbers to see how the tax plan is going to impact the middle class in this country. Uh-oh, didn't come out the way they expected. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Look at that. All three families are saving money. The tax cut will help middle class families. They desperately need it. And by the way the bill also gets rid of the ObamaCare individual mandate and it opens up energy exploration in ANWR. Oh, the life blood of our economy, more energy independence. And by the way, long term secure jobs at high wages for Americans. And lower prices for the entire country. All good. And when it comes to ISIS, President Trump, he has unleashed the U.S. military and as a result, letting them decide, all but destroy the terror group. Look at these numbers from the Department of Defense that the President tweeted out. The military under President Trump's leadership has done more in 11 months to defeat ISIS than Obama did during his last 28 months. And that's just a small sample of President Trump's many accomplishments for 2017.   Take a look on your screen right there. Here is a list of President Trump's accomplishments for 2017. Ask yourself, have you heard the mainstream media, the destroy Trump Media, anybody on the left, any liberal ever mention any of these things? Have you heard them talk about how the president's accomplishment and all these accomplishments have positively impacted the country? Probably not. They want and have wanted from the beginning the president to fail. Now, this is exactly why the media, the pundits, the political elites are predicting a huge massive Democratic landslide in November of this year in the mid-terms. But, before they get too giddy, too excited, let's keep this in mind.  These are the so-called same experts, political experts, who all said President Trump never stood a chance. So, maybe they should put a little bit of the pump on the brakes here and not get so giddy. As a matter of fact, it may turn out to be just out opposite.  The president, by the way has created what I am calling for a blueprint for victory in 2018. I hope the Republicans in Washington are paying attention. Now they did get their act together in December, I do give them credit, but they need to do more. They need to keep the momentum going. Tax cuts, that's a great start, but they need to keep for example, like building the wall. Finish repealing the disaster that is ObamaCare, keep that promise. Replace it with free market solutions. Health care savings accounts, health care cooperatives. They should also pass welfare reform. It's desperately needed again. They should cut other wasteful government spending programs. We know the Democrats, they are signaling that they want all kinds of concessions in these upcoming negotiations in the coming weeks. Republicans, you need to show some backbone, at least for once, stand up for principles. Get your identity back, and here's why. You always get the tax cut -- you never get the tax cut, you always get the tax hike. You never get the future spending cuts. We always get the immediate concession or amnesty, but you never get the border wall built. You never get the border security. So you Republicans, you need to take this past approach and flip it upside down because so far it fails every time.   So the GOP, you want to win in November? You need to demand that things like the border wall will get built and built first before anything else can happen as it relates to immigration.  Now, the American people, they need to see 200, 300 miles of this border wall built before the election. That will help you politically and it's good for our security, and the same goes with other issues. That's the blueprint politically for success in 2018 in the mid-terms. And Republicans, you follow that you will be successful.  Also tonight, if 2017 is defined by any one thing, it will be the news media's epic fail. What do we hear all last year, the entire year from the mainstream liberal media? Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion, Russia, Russia, Russia. Well, that fake news narrative has pretty much completely blown up in their faces after a year of nonstop breathless reporting, anonymous sources, hysteria on their part. Because so favor, up to today, zero evidence of collusion between President Trump and the Russians.  So now the media, they have got to latch on to something quick. They are not going to admit they are wrong. So the new narrative of the liberal media is that conservatives actually hate the FBI. They hate law enforcement because of the bias, that we're exposing in the Russia investigation. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's the new narrative. Conservatives -- this is laughable. Republicans hate law enforcement. And you know why it's laughable? Because the liberal media, they are not the people that respect law and law enforcement and they have been that way for decades.   We'll explain in a second, but first, I want to educate all my failing colleagues in the media that have been that have been wrong so often. Now, if you had any sense of real law and order in our constitutional republic, you might investigate Hillary Clinton and, yes, the numerous felonies we know she committed. If you care about it, you should maybe look into her top aide Huma Abedin and her criminally mishandling of classified information in those emails. And if you in the media, if you really cared about truth at all, maybe look into this. And that's Mueller's merry band of Democratic donors, let's see, contributed, oh, only to Democrats, politicians like Obama and Hillary and the DNC. Imagine for a second if it was a bunch of Republican donors that were investigating through a special counsel, Hillary Clinton. Yes, you guys in the media, you would be foaming at the mouth on a nightly basis. And if the media, if you are interested in truth, why don't you ask why Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration, why would they ever do something really stupid and give 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia? Yes. That Russia. Putin's Russia. The adversary. The bad actor Russia. When by the way, we don't even have enough uranium as it is. And maybe you'd follow the money if it was Donald Trump and $145 million pouring into the Clinton Foundation and her coffers while she is Secretary of State from the very people involved in this particular deal.   Again, if it was Donald Trump, I know you would be all over it and, of course, you would want to know, oh, was there a quid pro quo? Was that pay to play? But of course, you don't want to know that truth.  Now, let's go back to this new narrative coming from the fake news media that conservatives hate the FBI. The exact opposite is true. Now, on this show, if you have watched -- this is now my 23rd year. I have always respected the men and women in law enforcement -- policemen, firemen, paramedics. I respect the intelligence community and, of course, the FBI and even the CIA. Yes, I respect the hard work they do.  Now the biased press, they are the ones who have this history of utter disdain for members of law enforcement. For example, it wasn't that long ago that the media was trashing police. Remember how many of them supported Black Lives Matter? You may remember this. There is a great invention, it's called videotape, it can remind you.  SALLY KOHN, CNN, DEC. 13, 2014: Thousands of Americans are marching in New York and Washington and across the country demanding a justice system that applies the same to everybody and honors our values and we want you to know that our hearts are out there marching with them.  MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, CNN, JAN. 18, 2017: Many African-American people said, \"Look we were introduced to terror long before 9/11,\" the vicious police forces of America that have victimized us and the way in which white supremacy operated.  JIM ACOSTA, CNN, APRIL 16, 2015: What's flared up in Baltimore has heightened awareness once again of police brutality, in Baltimore alleged police brutality.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "We have repeatedly said on this show that we have the utmost respect. We praise law enforcement, the FBI, the intelligence community. The issue we have in this particular case is very specific. Because you have a few select people that have shown a very anti-Trump political bias. So, we have to ask the media a couple of questions. Do you support people like Peter Strzok, the guy that Hates trump, loves Hillary, the FBI agent involved in everything and his FBI lawyer girlfriend, Lisa Page. Together by the way they called President Trump just about every single swear word that I can't even think of and I swear -- and by the way, attack Trump and their supporters. They also texted about an insurance policy in Andy's office which we think, of course, is Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, in case Donald Trump actually pulled off the impossible and won the election. So you media people, do you support people like the disgraced former FBI Director Comey, admitted under oath to having his friend leak information to the New York Times in the hopes it would bring about a special counsel which it did? And Comey also likely broke the law writing his Trump notes on FBI computers and then by the way, removing that government property from the bureau and by the way, exonerated Hillary Clinton -- this is my favorite -- in the email investigation, before he ever did the investigation? I'm sure if that was against Hillary, you guys would be pretty upset. And then, of course, Mueller's team of liberal donations. As we have told you, over $50,000 his team has donated over the years to Democrats, and by the way, none to President Trump. One of Mueller's top investigators, Jeannie Rhee, represented the Clinton Foundation during a 2015 racketeering case. I guess she is not biased.  And then you've got Andrew Weissmann, he's the guy that oversaw the highly controversial obstruction of justice case against Arthur Anderson and by the way, destroyed the company, it cost tens of thousands of jobs. In 2005 the U.S. Supreme Court turned over Weissmann's conviction, a 9-0 unanimous ruling, and as part of the Enron investigation, Weissmann also sent four Merrill Lynch executives to jail. That conviction was also overturned by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That's Mueller's team?  And next have you demoted DOJ official, Bruce Ohr and his wife, Nellie. Bruce Ohr met with Fusion GPS. You know, those officials that came up with a phony Russian propaganda dossier that we now know his own wife was working on the opposition against Donald Trump that produced and bought and paid for that fake news Russia propaganda. Sounds like collusion to me. And finally, of course, the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, his wife, Jill, took over half a million dollars from Clinton ally, former Governor Terry McAuliff and Democrats for a failed Virginia state Senate seat. That's an insane amount of money. McCabe is also directly tied well, like so many others, to the dossier. And during a recent testimony on Capitol Hill, McCabe conflicted statements from previous witnesses and also claimed not to know when he found out the Clintons and the DNC funded the dossier. And, according to reports, McCabe is expected to retire next year with a big fat taxpayer pension.  Does any of this matter to you in the liberal mainstream media or do you just like to fail and be wrong every day? You know, are you supporting all these people? You are supporting that conduct? You are supporting that political bias? You don't see a conflict of interest? Do you really think that this isn't corruption at the highest level? You know, these criticisms we are making, these are facts. They are not about institutions. They are about the violation of constitutional rights and the abuse of power at the top levels of our government. This is serious. And we have been right. You have been wrong. And finally tonight, three major foreign policy stories: North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is threatening the United States by saying that a nuclear button is always on his desk and that he has nuclear weapons that can now reach the United States. President Trump just about well, 45 minutes ago, fired back on Twitter saying, well, he has an even bigger nuclear button and his actually works. We will have more on that later. And President Trump is actually putting Pakistan on notice by tweeting and calling them out for helping terrorists and not fully cooperating with the United States. He is right on that point. And also finally, a major story, protests continuing tonight to break out in Iran. So far 20 people have been killed. Over 450 people have been arrested. These are people that are revolting against this repressive regime and these radical mullahs in Tehran. It's something that President Trump actually predicted would happen back in September. Now, the mullahs are scared out of their minds and this is now the opportunity of a lifetime for the people of Iran that have been oppressed, people that are getting killed for being gay and lesbian, women that are treated horribly. They can be free of these radical dictators.   Joining us now, reaction of the New York Times best-selling book, Vengeance. Former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, Newt Gingrich is with us. Mr. Speaker, welcome back and Happy New Year, sir. NEWT GINGRICH, AUTHOR, \"VENGEANCE\": Happy New Year.

Let's remember, the FBI was founded in 1908 by the Attorney General under Teddy Roosevelt precisely because the belief was a lot of investigative work was corrupt at the local level in big cities, et cetera.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" President Trump, he is on fire right now, tonight, on Twitter, and he's driving the left, predictably, absolutely insane. You're going to love this. Also, tonight, you do not want to miss The Hill's, John Solomon out with an explosive report about the FBI's corrupt Clinton email investigation. We have that exclusive report and President Trump's 2017 successes have now created a republican blueprint for the mid-terms. Will they follow? And last year was an epic failure for fake news in this country, especially the fake cannabis news network. We'll explain all of that, but first tonight's breaking news, opening monologue for the new year. So in spite of vicious media attacks and many political obstacles, well 2017 was a very successful first year for President Trump. Now, before we get to the full list that the media will never show you, let's take a look at the economy. Stock market is at an all-time high and hit over 60 record closes in 2017 alone. The Dow Jones was up 25 percent, over $5 trillion in new wealth has now been created. Unemployment -- yes, unemployment at a 17-year low since -- just 4.1 percent. And since taking office, President Trump has created 1.7 million new jobs. African-American unemployment, a 17-year low. We ended the year with consumer confidence sitting at a 17-year high. Home prices are up six percent as is home building. Regulations have been slashed at a historic rate. And the Trump administration cut 16 regulations for every new one that was created. Also, let's talk about GDP. Now, so far under President Trump, we have seen two quarters over three percent. Let's compare that with President Barack Obama, the only president in the history of this country to never reach three percent GDP growth for an entire year. And we can't forget about Obama's terrible economy. Millions more people on food stamps and in poverty, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the worst economic recovery since the 1940s, the lowest labor participation rate since the 1970s, and the list goes on. Worst recovery since the 1940s, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. And unlike Obama, business confidence is now soaring under President Trump. In fact, the news is so good that even the liberal New York Times cannot even ignore this. Take a look at this headline. I didn't make it up. \"The Trump Effect: Business anticipating less regulation loosens the purse strings.\" This is exactly what we have been seeing happening all across the country. You couple that with the brand new $1.5 trillion tax plan that is now taking effect, and what you have a recipe for a Reagan-style economic explosion. You, the American people, you are beginning to see the direct impact of this tax bill. For example, companies like Boeing, AT&T, Comcast, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bank Corps -- all announced employee bonuses or pay increases following that bill. That's real money back in the pockets of the forgotten men and women that deserve it in this country. Take a look, for example, what happened over at, yes, liberal CBS News. They had an accountant crunch the numbers to see how the tax plan is going to impact the middle class in this country. Uh-oh, didn't come out the way they expected. Watch this."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Look at that. All three families are saving money. The tax cut will help middle class families. They desperately need it. And by the way the bill also gets rid of the ObamaCare individual mandate and it opens up energy exploration in ANWR. Oh, the life blood of our economy, more energy independence. And by the way, long term secure jobs at high wages for Americans. And lower prices for the entire country. All good. And when it comes to ISIS, President Trump, he has unleashed the U.S. military and as a result, letting them decide, all but destroy the terror group. Look at these numbers from the Department of Defense that the President tweeted out. The military under President Trump's leadership has done more in 11 months to defeat ISIS than Obama did during his last 28 months. And that's just a small sample of President Trump's many accomplishments for 2017. Take a look on your screen right there. Here is a list of President Trump's accomplishments for 2017. Ask yourself, have you heard the mainstream media, the destroy Trump Media, anybody on the left, any liberal ever mention any of these things? Have you heard them talk about how the president's accomplishment and all these accomplishments have positively impacted the country? Probably not. They want and have wanted from the beginning the president to fail. Now, this is exactly why the media, the pundits, the political elites are predicting a huge massive Democratic landslide in November of this year in the mid-terms. But, before they get too giddy, too excited, let's keep this in mind. These are the so-called same experts, political experts, who all said President Trump never stood a chance. So, maybe they should put a little bit of the pump on the brakes here and not get so giddy. As a matter of fact, it may turn out to be just out opposite. The president, by the way has created what I am calling for a blueprint for victory in 2018. I hope the Republicans in Washington are paying attention. Now they did get their act together in December, I do give them credit, but they need to do more. They need to keep the momentum going. Tax cuts, that's a great start, but they need to keep for example, like building the wall. Finish repealing the disaster that is ObamaCare, keep that promise. Replace it with free market solutions. Health care savings accounts, health care cooperatives. They should also pass welfare reform. It's desperately needed again. They should cut other wasteful government spending programs. We know the Democrats, they are signaling that they want all kinds of concessions in these upcoming negotiations in the coming weeks. Republicans, you need to show some backbone, at least for once, stand up for principles. Get your identity back, and here's why. You always get the tax cut -- you never get the tax cut, you always get the tax hike. You never get the future spending cuts. We always get the immediate concession or amnesty, but you never get the border wall built. You never get the border security. So you Republicans, you need to take this past approach and flip it upside down because so far it fails every time. So the GOP, you want to win in November? You need to demand that things like the border wall will get built and built first before anything else can happen as it relates to immigration. Now, the American people, they need to see 200, 300 miles of this border wall built before the election. That will help you politically and it's good for our security, and the same goes with other issues. That's the blueprint politically for success in 2018 in the mid-terms. And Republicans, you follow that you will be successful. Also tonight, if 2017 is defined by any one thing, it will be the news media's epic fail. What do we hear all last year, the entire year from the mainstream liberal media? Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion, Russia, Russia, Russia. Well, that fake news narrative has pretty much completely blown up in their faces after a year of nonstop breathless reporting, anonymous sources, hysteria on their part. Because so favor, up to today, zero evidence of collusion between President Trump and the Russians. So now the media, they have got to latch on to something quick. They are not going to admit they are wrong. So the new narrative of the liberal media is that conservatives actually hate the FBI. They hate law enforcement because of the bias, that we're exposing in the Russia investigation. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Well, that's the new narrative. Conservatives -- this is laughable. Republicans hate law enforcement. And you know why it's laughable? Because the liberal media, they are not the people that respect law and law enforcement and they have been that way for decades. We'll explain in a second, but first, I want to educate all my failing colleagues in the media that have been that have been wrong so often. Now, if you had any sense of real law and order in our constitutional republic, you might investigate Hillary Clinton and, yes, the numerous felonies we know she committed. If you care about it, you should maybe look into her top aide Huma Abedin and her criminally mishandling of classified information in those emails. And if you in the media, if you really cared about truth at all, maybe look into this. And that's Mueller's merry band of Democratic donors, let's see, contributed, oh, only to Democrats, politicians like Obama and Hillary and the DNC. Imagine for a second if it was a bunch of Republican donors that were investigating through a special counsel, Hillary Clinton. Yes, you guys in the media, you would be foaming at the mouth on a nightly basis. And if the media, if you are interested in truth, why don't you ask why Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration, why would they ever do something really stupid and give 20 percent of America's uranium supply to Russia? Yes. That Russia. Putin's Russia. The adversary. The bad actor Russia. When by the way, we don't even have enough uranium as it is. And maybe you'd follow the money if it was Donald Trump and $145 million pouring into the Clinton Foundation and her coffers while she is Secretary of State from the very people involved in this particular deal. Again, if it was Donald Trump, I know you would be all over it and, of course, you would want to know, oh, was there a quid pro quo? Was that pay to play? But of course, you don't want to know that truth. Now, let's go back to this new narrative coming from the fake news media that conservatives hate the FBI. The exact opposite is true. Now, on this show, if you have watched -- this is now my 23rd year. I have always respected the men and women in law enforcement -- policemen, firemen, paramedics. I respect the intelligence community and, of course, the FBI and even the CIA. Yes, I respect the hard work they do. Now the biased press, they are the ones who have this history of utter disdain for members of law enforcement. For example, it wasn't that long ago that the media was trashing police. Remember how many of them supported Black Lives Matter? You may remember this. There is a great invention, it's called videotape, it can remind you. SALLY KOHN, CNN, DEC. 13, 2014: Thousands of Americans are marching in New York and Washington and across the country demanding a justice system that applies the same to everybody and honors our values and we want you to know that our hearts are out there marching with them. MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, CNN, JAN. 18, 2017: Many African-American people said, \"Look we were introduced to terror long before 9/11,\" the vicious police forces of America that have victimized us and the way in which white supremacy operated. JIM ACOSTA, CNN, APRIL 16, 2015: What's flared up in Baltimore has heightened awareness once again of police brutality, in Baltimore alleged police brutality."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "We have repeatedly said on this show that we have the utmost respect. We praise law enforcement, the FBI, the intelligence community. The issue we have in this particular case is very specific. Because you have a few select people that have shown a very anti-Trump political bias. So, we have to ask the media a couple of questions. Do you support people like Peter Strzok, the guy that Hates trump, loves Hillary, the FBI agent involved in everything and his FBI lawyer girlfriend, Lisa Page. Together by the way they called President Trump just about every single swear word that I can't even think of and I swear -- and by the way, attack Trump and their supporters. They also texted about an insurance policy in Andy's office which we think, of course, is Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, in case Donald Trump actually pulled off the impossible and won the election. So you media people, do you support people like the disgraced former FBI Director Comey, admitted under oath to having his friend leak information to the New York Times in the hopes it would bring about a special counsel which it did? And Comey also likely broke the law writing his Trump notes on FBI computers and then by the way, removing that government property from the bureau and by the way, exonerated Hillary Clinton -- this is my favorite -- in the email investigation, before he ever did the investigation? I'm sure if that was against Hillary, you guys would be pretty upset. And then, of course, Mueller's team of liberal donations. As we have told you, over $50,000 his team has donated over the years to Democrats, and by the way, none to President Trump. One of Mueller's top investigators, Jeannie Rhee, represented the Clinton Foundation during a 2015 racketeering case. I guess she is not biased. And then you've got Andrew Weissmann, he's the guy that oversaw the highly controversial obstruction of justice case against Arthur Anderson and by the way, destroyed the company, it cost tens of thousands of jobs. In 2005 the U.S. Supreme Court turned over Weissmann's conviction, a 9-0 unanimous ruling, and as part of the Enron investigation, Weissmann also sent four Merrill Lynch executives to jail. That conviction was also overturned by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That's Mueller's team? And next have you demoted DOJ official, Bruce Ohr and his wife, Nellie. Bruce Ohr met with Fusion GPS. You know, those officials that came up with a phony Russian propaganda dossier that we now know his own wife was working on the opposition against Donald Trump that produced and bought and paid for that fake news Russia propaganda. Sounds like collusion to me. And finally, of course, the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, his wife, Jill, took over half a million dollars from Clinton ally, former Governor Terry McAuliff and Democrats for a failed Virginia state Senate seat. That's an insane amount of money. McCabe is also directly tied well, like so many others, to the dossier. And during a recent testimony on Capitol Hill, McCabe conflicted statements from previous witnesses and also claimed not to know when he found out the Clintons and the DNC funded the dossier. And, according to reports, McCabe is expected to retire next year with a big fat taxpayer pension. Does any of this matter to you in the liberal mainstream media or do you just like to fail and be wrong every day? You know, are you supporting all these people? You are supporting that conduct? You are supporting that political bias? You don't see a conflict of interest? Do you really think that this isn't corruption at the highest level? You know, these criticisms we are making, these are facts. They are not about institutions. They are about the violation of constitutional rights and the abuse of power at the top levels of our government. This is serious. And we have been right. You have been wrong."

      "utterance": "North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is threatening the United States by saying that a nuclear button is always on his desk and that he has nuclear weapons that can now reach the United States. President Trump just about well, 45 minutes ago, fired back on Twitter saying, well, he has an even bigger nuclear button and his actually works. We will have more on that later. And President Trump is actually putting Pakistan on notice by tweeting and calling them out for helping terrorists and not fully cooperating with the United States. He is right on that point. And also finally, a major story, protests continuing tonight to break out in Iran. So far 20 people have been killed. Over 450 people have been arrested. These are people that are revolting against this repressive regime and these radical mullahs in Tehran. It's something that President Trump actually predicted would happen back in September. Now, the mullahs are scared out of their minds and this is now the opportunity of a lifetime for the people of Iran that have been oppressed, people that are getting killed for being gay and lesbian, women that are treated horribly. They can be free of these radical dictators. Joining us now, reaction of the New York Times best-selling book, Vengeance. Former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, Newt Gingrich is with us.

They were wrong in 2016 about whether or not he could win the nomination. They were wrong in the fall of 2016 about whether or not he could beat Hillary, and they have been wrong for all of 2017. So I start with the idea I listen to them carefully, take exactly the opposite position and almost every time, I'm doing better than they are. And I think this is going to be a good year. I think the tax cut bill is so central to the future of America and the philosophy behind it of lower taxes, more take home pay. More job creation, better business environment is so central to what makes America tick that I think the Democrats who unanimously voted no. Think about that Sean, they unanimously voted for higher taxes, bigger bureaucracy, fewer jobs, so the Democratic Party's offer is you are going to be out of work, but we will get you food stamps. I think that's a losing proposition."

That would be Hillary funding the dossier paid for with Russian lies, misinformation, propaganda, all to influence an election. Should that be a big issue or Comey and Peter Strzok writing an exoneration before an investigation? Or the Uranium One issue? Why would anyone have ever allowed 20 percent of America's uranium to go to Vladimir Putin, especially knowing about bribery, extortion, kickbacks and money laundering, you know, a year and a half earlier? Robert Mueller knew about it. So, do the Republicans -- does the Republican Party have an obligation now to go after what we did find as a result of the investigation that the democrats never really expected to find?"

It's the rule of law which normally protects every citizen from their own government. We have an obligation as Americans to want to know whether or not the Justice Department had been corrupted, whether or not senior leaders of the FBI had been corrupted. We have an obligation to find out whether or not they were putting in position of power people who were so totally biased that they couldn't possibly be part of a Department of Justice. They had to be a part of a Department that was going to go after and persecute people. And I think that -- well, have you have raised the tip of the iceberg.

So I don't see how you can walk off. It's not a question about vendetta against a person. How do you have this scale scandal and just walk off and forget it?

Four months ago, when the President was speaking at the United Nations, he predicted there would be an Iranian -- the Iranian people would revolt. Now we have Iranian protesters attacking police stations. They stormed an Iranian military base according to reports and they are chanting, \"Death to the Ayatollah.\" Very different than the Green Movement in 2009. Now, we have a president supporting those people that want liberty, freedom, maybe Eeven constitutional government. If you are the president, what do you do now to help those protesters?"

Second, I think we have an obligation to, first of all, maximize the production of our various radio and television programming going in to Iran. I think we should be gathering up and I understand from Ambassador Haley that they are likely to ask for a United Nations Security Council meeting on this issue. I think we should be putting real pressure on the Europeans. They are always pious about human rights. Well, here is a chance to stand up with us. We should be doing what the President has done to his credit, which is issuing very strong warnings against the Iranian dictatorship, killing its own citizens. And I would hope when they come back next week that the House and Senate will pass very strong resolutions condemning the dictatorship. I mean, here is a clear definitional moment when it is impossible to believe that the dictatorship is a popular government. Now, this is a repressive, brutal dictatorship. It killed over I think it was over 30,000 people in 1988. I am afraid that they are prepared to come back and kill a lot of people. We should be very aggressively, publicly opposing that."

The headline, Congressional investigators find irregularities in the FBI's handling of the Clinton email case. Solomon reports that documents reveal the FBI agents believe laws were, in fact, broken, just by the, \"Shear volume of classified information that, in fact, passed through Clinton's server.\" Also, Solomon reporting 17 witnesses -- key witnesses in the Clinton case were interviewed after James Comey and Peter Strzok had begun his exoneration statement. Here to break it all down, the author of Clinton Cash, number one New York Times best-seller Peter Schweizer. Now Fox News contributor and of course, investigative reporter, Sarah Carter and the man himself from The Hill, John Solomon, tonight. Okay, massive overwhelming evidence that laws were broken. Overwhelming. Tons of volumes of classified materials passed on. We all saw the exoneration before the investigation, John. And it goes on from there. And quoting, you know, one Congressman as saying, \"The whole thing was rigged,\" in other words, it was rigged to exonerate her and not have equal justice under the law, explain."

And I think one of the most interesting things, let's just take it and put it in context of Russia. If Bob Mueller had exonerated Donald Trump before he had interviewed 17 key witnesses outrage in Washington. If Bob Mueller had learned that a key witness had destroyed evidence that was under subpoena, then lied about it to conceal the fact that he destroyed it, and, instead of prosecuting that person, they gave him immunity we would be in outrage in Washington. That is what happened in this case. Lawmakers who got this briefing from Deputy Director McCabe on the 21st of December, were just floored by the level of criminality and concern the FBI had in the outcome. If you read the statement Comey, you swore they were exonerating her, this law makers felt like the FBI plenty of evidence to prosecute her."

Look, the FBI themselves, the FBI agents field agents who were working in these cases, thought the people on the seventh floor, not McCabe, not Comey, not Gattis, all these guys on the seventh floor in control of this investigation, the people that were on the ground, collecting the information, were just as angry. Were just as angry as these congressional members were at learning this information that John reported. We know there is so much more out there. We know that there is concern that McCabe may have obstructed justice. We are seeing this now, it is slowly trickling out in some of these reports. We don't know if that is completely true yet or not. I'm sure we are going to hear more information from the inspector general. There was concern within the FBI. This is not about bad mouthing the FBI. This is about the FBI cleansing itself and this is what FBI agents want to do. Both retired and members still working there."

And that is, you know, Republicans hired us first. But, Christopher Steele wasn't on the case with Trump-Russia collusion. Is he basically trying to justify. We didn't pay money. We don't know who paid what money. They looked at our bank accounts. What do we know about Christopher Steele's bank accounts? What do we know -- why did Hillary pay for what we now know are salacious lies and propaganda from Russian sources? That seems to be the bigger story that they don't want to talk about. PETER SCHWEIZER, \"CLINTON CASH,\" AUTHOR: Yes, I mean, Sean, one of the things that strikes me with the Trump dossier but also with the great reporting that John came out with today is how in these cases, the FBI leadership basically went against their own procedures in the case of the Steele dossier or in the case of the Clinton email investigation. Let's remember, the FBI was founded in 1908 by the Attorney General under Teddy Roosevelt precisely because the belief was a lot of investigative work was corrupt at the local level in big cities, et cetera. So they set up a series of procedures and those procedures basically let field offices do the leg work and the Washington headquarters would sort of a stay away. As John points out in the case of the Clinton email investigation, it was centrally controlled by leadership. So, to get back to your point."

And then have you Comey colluding with Strzok to put the fix in this particular case we are discussing. Then have you Bruce Ohr. He met with fusion GPS.

Also tonight the president responding to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recent nuclear threats by tweeting on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un just stated that quote, the nuclear button is on his desk at all times.

He has used it to great effect and they hate it that is why you have so many end of the year chin pulling editorials and calls from all of these liberal media types asking Donald Trump to stop tweeting. No, he should continue to do it. And look what he has done.

Or how about CNN who's former chief executive Ethan Jordan admitted that they covered up torture during Saddam's regime. These people have blood on their hands.
