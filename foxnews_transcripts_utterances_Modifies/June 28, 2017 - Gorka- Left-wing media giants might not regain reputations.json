      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News Alert. We are now witnessing the collapse of the liberal mainstream media right here in America. Sharyl Attkisson, Geraldo Rivera will have reaction tonight. Also, Sara Carter will join us, an explosive new report about the interim FBI director.  But first, CNN leading the way in the rampant decay of the liberal mainstream media. And tonight, I have a message for CNN's president, Jeff Zucker. That's tonight's \"Opening Monologue,\" Jeff.  All right, history is literally happening right in front of our eyes. We have the liberal destroy Trump mainstream media is now in a freefall and on the brink of complete and total collapse. That's not an overstatement, it's not hyperbole. Now, these propagandists and champions of fake news continue to be exposed day after day, and CNN is leading the way.  Now, I'm going to share my advice for the head of CNN, their chief of fake news and propaganda news, Jeff Zucker, in just a minute. Jeff, I'm trying to save your career. But first, let me explain how one of the biggest anti-Trump networks has lost all their credibility and can no longer be trusted by you, the American people.  Now, at this point, we should put CNN six feet -- you see right there -- underground for repeatedly spreading lies, propaganda, black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, and for viciously trying to take down this president. Now, let's just look at some of the network's many controversies and scandals, scandals they've had there. There's the image of CNN's former New Year's Eve co-host. Really, it's so graphic, every time we show you, we have to put a warning on the screen. Kathy Griffin posing like an ISIS fighter -- look at how despicable that it is -- with a bloody severed head of a Trump look-alike. Pretty disgusting. And after that vile photo shoot, CNN then fired Griffin. Fair enough.  And then earlier this month, CNN cut ties -- remember Reza Aslan? That's the unhinged liberal responsible for disturbing tweets like this one, quote, \"This 'POS'\" -- you know what it is -- \"is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency, he's an embarrassment to humankind.\" Oh, that's fair and balanced.   Now, kicking unhinged liberal hosts to the curb is just the beginning of CNN's massive credibility crisis. CNN has been routinely humiliated for pushing their fake news. Remember, earlier this week, three so-called journalists allegedly resigned -- I don't believe that -- after the outlet had to retract a completely made-up story about a Trump ally, a friend of mine, Anthony Scaramucci, which claimed that Anthony was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. Now, CNN and the rest of the destroy Trump media -- they have tried to play it off, \"Oh, it's just an honest mistake,\" and say that CNN did the right thing. They retracted the story. But according to an explosive report in The New York Post, it appears that CNN may have been forced to correct the fake news hit piece. Take a look at this headline. \"CNN faced $100 million lawsuit over botched Russia story.\" Now, according to The Post, CNN quickly retracted the story. Why? Anthony Scaramucci threatened a massive libel lawsuit.   Now, of course, that example is not the only time CNN has gotten a story completely wrong. Let's go back -- let's stay right there in the month of June. June 16th, the network had to delete a tweet and issue a correction for saying, \"Oh, only Democrats were praying before the congressional baseball game,\" remember, after Steve Scalise was shot in the assassination attempt. And the day before that, well, CNN senior unhinged White House correspondent Jim Acosta, he tweeted and then deleted his ridiculous claim that President Trump didn't visit Congressman Steve Scalise in the hospital. Not true. And also earlier this month, the head of the former FBI Director James Comey and his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, CNN had to alter a report that said that Comey would contradict President Trump's statements about not being under investigation by the FBI. Wrong! The embarrassment for CNN doesn't even end there. Now, take a look at the times CNN covered the president's so-called eating habits. These are really, really hard-hitting investigative reports that really matter to all the Americans in poverty, on food stamps and out of the labor force and those that can't buy a house. This matters to them. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Oopsy-daisy! Looks like Jones, it looks like CNN president Jeff Zucker have real serious explaining to do. Now, CNN put out a statement yesterday. They're standing by their producer, which I'm glad this guy's not going to get fired. They didn't mention anything about Zucker's, \"Let's get back to Russia,\" comments. Let's be clear tonight. Zucker is leading all the fake new circus at CNN. And as we said last night, all the blame for what is happening at CNN should be on his shoulders. Now, he's positioned his network to be one of the mainstream media leaders in trying to take down the president, this anti-Trump hate. He needs to be held accountable. And tonight, I'm going to do Jeff Zucker a favor. Hey, Jeff, you want to restore any sense of credibility at your network, you need to stop trying to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump and be on a jihad agenda to attack. And if you're willing to lie and collude to do that -- really? Where are your ethics?   Instead, here's my advice, Jeff. Start focusing on the six massive scandals that should really be investigated but are not being reported by your network. James Comey admitting under oath that he had his friend leak a memo to The New York Times, hoping it would lead to a special counsel. By the way, Jeff, look into the Records Act that might've been violated. That's a felony. And by the way, also, there's former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch possibly obstructing justice. How? Interfering in the Clinton email investigation. Now, senators are starting to look into that. Jeff, I suggest that you and your network may want to do some investigative work here. Now, Comey testified that Lynch told him to call the Clinton email investigation not an investigation, a \"matter,\" and he listened! And don't forget the 40-minute tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton just says before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook.   And then, of course, next is Hillary Clinton's many, many scandals. Jeff, there's a lot of smoke and fire here, and there's now evidence to suggest that the original server investigation was, in fact, compromised.  Plus, there's also the Clinton Russia collusion story. That's the Uranium One deal. We had 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons -- she signs off a waiver. It goes to Vladimir Putin and Russia. And meanwhile, people involved in the deal are kicking back millions to the Clinton Foundation. Jeff, that's called pay- to-play. And by the way, destroying or mishandling classified information, those are both felonies. And by the way, President Obama also has a serious Russia problem. Jeff, you might want to investigate this. Remember? After learning -- he learned in August of 2016 Russia was trying to meddle in our presidential election. Why didn't he do anything?  Also, look at Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. No matter how you feel about the guy, the only law we know that has been broken in this Russia collusion story is that they surveilled, unmasked, and then leaked intelligence on General Flynn! That's a violation of the Espionage Act. And finally, there's a special counsel. His name is Robert Mueller. Look at the glaring potentially illegal conflicts of interest here. Mueller's BFF is Jeff -- James Comey. Members of the team that Mueller is hiring have donated to Obama and Clinton! That's called a conflict of interest. And one of the attorneys he's hired actually represented the Clinton Foundation!  So Jeff, these are six stories you at CNN, and frankly, all of you in the left-wing destroy Trump media should actually be covering instead of black helicopter theories, tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.  You know what? Maybe it's time to step up and instead of publishing fake, misleading, flat-out false news, maybe it's time to tell the American people the truth. Do some real reporting.  Now, former Governor Palin -- she's now suing the New York Times for an op- ed that was published after the shooting of Congressman Scalise. The Times editorial board incorrectly linked Palin's rhetoric to the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Now, the New York Times did later issue a correction. And also, today, we learned that Vice News had to retract two stories about President Trump. This never ends! Here with reaction, the author of the brand-new book -- it's called \"The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives, Fake News Control What You See, What You Think and How You Vote,\" the anchor of \"Full Measure\" on the Sinclair network, Sharyl Attkisson, and Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera...",

I worked at CNN in 1990 to '93, and I can tell you it wasn't the CNN that you've described today or that you've talked about. So how did we get here? And by taking apart decades of what I call the smear industry, which are propaganda firms, PR firms, LLCs, non-profits, opposition research groups, which have grown into a huge industry, and they've understood how to get under the curtain at news organizations and say the right things, even get hired there, or write things that -- as reporter that will be printed in the press, even though these are simply paid-for partisan narratives -- it's pretty disturbing.

But first, CNN leading the way in the rampant decay of the liberal mainstream media. And tonight, I have a message for CNN's president, Jeff Zucker. That's tonight's \"Opening Monologue,\" Jeff. All right, history is literally happening right in front of our eyes. We have the liberal destroy Trump mainstream media is now in a freefall and on the brink of complete and total collapse. That's not an overstatement, it's not hyperbole. Now, these propagandists and champions of fake news continue to be exposed day after day, and CNN is leading the way. Now, I'm going to share my advice for the head of CNN, their chief of fake news and propaganda news, Jeff Zucker, in just a minute. Jeff, I'm trying to save your career. But first, let me explain how one of the biggest anti-Trump networks has lost all their credibility and can no longer be trusted by you, the American people. Now, at this point, we should put CNN six feet -- you see right there -- underground for repeatedly spreading lies, propaganda, black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, and for viciously trying to take down this president.

And after that vile photo shoot, CNN then fired Griffin. Fair enough. And then earlier this month, CNN cut ties -- remember Reza Aslan? That's the unhinged liberal responsible for disturbing tweets like this one, quote, \"This 'POS'\" -- you know what it is -- \"is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency, he's an embarrassment to humankind.\" Oh, that's fair and balanced. Now, kicking unhinged liberal hosts to the curb is just the beginning of CNN's massive credibility crisis. CNN has been routinely humiliated for pushing their fake news. Remember, earlier this week, three so-called journalists allegedly resigned -- I don't believe that -- after the outlet had to retract a completely made-up story about a Trump ally, a friend of mine, Anthony Scaramucci, which claimed that Anthony was being investigated for colluding with the Russians through dealings with a Russian investment fund. Now, CNN and the rest of the destroy Trump media -- they have tried to play it off, \"Oh, it's just an honest mistake,\" and say that CNN did the right thing. They retracted the story. But according to an explosive report in The New York Post, it appears that CNN may have been forced to correct the fake news hit piece. Take a look at this headline. \"CNN faced $100 million lawsuit over botched Russia story.\" Now, according to The Post, CNN quickly retracted the story. Why? Anthony Scaramucci threatened a massive libel lawsuit. Now, of course, that example is not the only time CNN has gotten a story completely wrong. Let's go back -- let's stay right there in the month of June. June 16th, the network had to delete a tweet and issue a correction for saying, \"Oh, only Democrats were praying before the congressional baseball game,\" remember, after Steve Scalise was shot in the assassination attempt. And the day before that, well, CNN senior unhinged White House correspondent Jim Acosta, he tweeted and then deleted his ridiculous claim that President Trump didn't visit Congressman Steve Scalise in the hospital. Not true. And also earlier this month, the head of the former FBI Director James Comey and his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, CNN had to alter a report that said that Comey would contradict President Trump's statements about not being under investigation by the FBI. Wrong! The embarrassment for CNN doesn't even end there. Now, take a look at the times CNN covered the president's so-called eating habits. These are really, really hard-hitting investigative reports that really matter to all the Americans in poverty, on food stamps and out of the labor force and those that can't buy a house. This matters to them. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Oopsy-daisy! Looks like Jones, it looks like CNN president Jeff Zucker have real serious explaining to do. Now, CNN put out a statement yesterday. They're standing by their producer, which I'm glad this guy's not going to get fired. They didn't mention anything about Zucker's, \"Let's get back to Russia,\" comments. Let's be clear tonight. Zucker is leading all the fake new circus at CNN. And as we said last night, all the blame for what is happening at CNN should be on his shoulders. Now, he's positioned his network to be one of the mainstream media leaders in trying to take down the president, this anti-Trump hate. He needs to be held accountable. And tonight, I'm going to do Jeff Zucker a favor. Hey, Jeff, you want to restore any sense of credibility at your network, you need to stop trying to destroy the presidency of Donald Trump and be on a jihad agenda to attack. And if you're willing to lie and collude to do that -- really? Where are your ethics? Instead, here's my advice, Jeff. Start focusing on the six massive scandals that should really be investigated but are not being reported by your network. James Comey admitting under oath that he had his friend leak a memo to The New York Times, hoping it would lead to a special counsel. By the way, Jeff, look into the Records Act that might've been violated. That's a felony. And by the way, also, there's former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch possibly obstructing justice. How? Interfering in the Clinton email investigation. Now, senators are starting to look into that. Jeff, I suggest that you and your network may want to do some investigative work here. Now, Comey testified that Lynch told him to call the Clinton email investigation not an investigation, a \"matter,\" and he listened! And don't forget the 40-minute tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton just says before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook. And then, of course, next is Hillary Clinton's many, many scandals. Jeff, there's a lot of smoke and fire here, and there's now evidence to suggest that the original server investigation was, in fact, compromised. Plus, there's also the Clinton Russia collusion story. That's the Uranium One deal. We had 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons -- she signs off a waiver. It goes to Vladimir Putin and Russia. And meanwhile, people involved in the deal are kicking back millions to the Clinton Foundation. Jeff, that's called pay- to-play. And by the way, destroying or mishandling classified information, those are both felonies. And by the way, President Obama also has a serious Russia problem. Jeff, you might want to investigate this. Remember? After learning -- he learned in August of 2016 Russia was trying to meddle in our presidential election. Why didn't he do anything? Also, look at Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. No matter how you feel about the guy, the only law we know that has been broken in this Russia collusion story is that they surveilled, unmasked, and then leaked intelligence on General Flynn! That's a violation of the Espionage Act. And finally, there's a special counsel. His name is Robert Mueller. Look at the glaring potentially illegal conflicts of interest here. Mueller's BFF is Jeff -- James Comey. Members of the team that Mueller is hiring have donated to Obama and Clinton! That's called a conflict of interest. And one of the attorneys he's hired actually represented the Clinton Foundation! So Jeff, these are six stories you at CNN, and frankly, all of you in the left-wing destroy Trump media should actually be covering instead of black helicopter theories, tinfoil hat conspiracy theories. You know what? Maybe it's time to step up and instead of publishing fake, misleading, flat-out false news, maybe it's time to tell the American people the truth. Do some real reporting. Now, former Governor Palin -- she's now suing the New York Times for an op- ed that was published after the shooting of Congressman Scalise. The Times editorial board incorrectly linked Palin's rhetoric to the shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Now, the New York Times did later issue a correction. And also, today, we learned that Vice News had to retract two stories about President Trump. This never ends! Here with reaction, the author of the brand-new book -- it's called \"The Smear: How Shady Political Operatives, Fake News Control What You See, What You Think and How You Vote,\" the anchor of \"Full Measure\" on the Sinclair network, Sharyl Attkisson, and Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera..."

That's profound! SHARYL ATTKISSON, AUTHOR, \"SMEAR\": I kind of dissect this process. How did we get to the point where the news could be influenced to such a degree. I worked at CNN in 1990 to '93, and I can tell you it wasn't the CNN that you've described today or that you've talked about. So how did we get here? And by taking apart decades of what I call the smear industry, which are propaganda firms, PR firms, LLCs, non-profits, opposition research groups, which have grown into a huge industry, and they've understood how to get under the curtain at news organizations and say the right things, even get hired there, or write things that -- as reporter that will be printed in the press, even though these are simply paid-for partisan narratives -- it's pretty disturbing. And one of the quotes I got from one of the smear operators I interviewed is, Everything that you see, you should suspect has been put there for a reason, every image and every narrative.

Several lower courts earlier ruled to block the president's travel ban. And the Homeland Security Department now demanding that airlines around the world step up the security measures for international flights bound for the United States, and if they don't comply they could face the possibility of a total electronics ban for planes.

And now President Trump wins the White House, Democrats, oh, all of a sudden they're crying foul and they've been pushing now for 11 months, Trump-Russia collusion, a phony narrative ever since.

If you look at how the media has spun this story, the latest Harvard poll says that more than 70 percent of Americans don't trust the media. Why? Because of these false, fake news, propaganda products like Russian collusion. Let me give you an example. We've had six months of Russia, Russia, Russia, by places like CNN. For my sins I go on CNN yesterday, and then they try to tell us we're going to go to war with Russia in Syria? Either we're in bed with Moscow or we want to go to war with them. Which one is it?

These places had relatively solid reputations in the past, CNN for infield reporting, \"The New York Times\" for being the gray lady. That's gone. That's gone in a puff of smoke. The house of cards has crumbled because they can't see beyond their political agendas, and the people see through it.

Now of course I'm talking about Joe Scarborough, liberal Joe. Now tonight we break down just how vicious, nasty, one-sided, petulant, arrogant his coverage has become.

This is pretty remarkable. So yesterday liberal Joe tweeted, quote, \"CNN has more integrity on its worst day than Donald Trump has on his best. Real news.\" Now, liberal Joe perhaps is hoping that his favorite fake news network will hire him. Now, if that's the case, I would say his audition is going really well sucking up and kissing Jeff Zucker's ass. In fact, Joe, because I'm such a nice person I put together a reel of some of your most interesting moments of your liberal bias so you'd fit right in there in case you get fired and NBC -- in other words, the most ridiculous coverage.

In case you, my viewers, are not familiar with Joe's material, let's take a look at how unhinged he is about Donald Trump, a recently released a music video.

The only thing mystifying to me other than why Scarborough made that horrific, cringe-inducing music video is why the liberal morning host is so completely obsessed with trashing the president. Maybe Joe should take a check from the song and look inside himself and ask himself if his daily biased coverage is really good for America. By the way, Joe, we are sorry you didn't get hired by Fox.
