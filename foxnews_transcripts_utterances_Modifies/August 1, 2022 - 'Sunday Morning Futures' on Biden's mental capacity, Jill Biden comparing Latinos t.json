President Biden coming home from the Middle East with no commitments from the Saudis after an embarrassing fist bump with the man he promised was a pariah to the world. And, instead, Biden receives another lecture, this time from the Saudis, who say the U.S. has made human rights mistakes. And oil was not even part of the summit, so no promises on producing more of it to push down gas prices in America. Coming up, Congressman Ronny Jackson on how Biden's mental capacity is affecting global relations and national security. Then: Tell us how you really feel.",

Coming up, newly elected Texas Congresswoman Mayra Flores on the Democrats' opinion of Hispanics, as viewed through Nancy Pelosi's shove of a child and Jill Biden's taco talk. Plus: It is one of the most important races in the Senate this November. Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters on the wide-open border, President Trump's endorsement, and big tech surveillance of America. Then: Iran, Afghanistan, China and beyond, the foreign policy mistakes piling up, as the world watches weak U.S. leadership. The impact on American families. Coming up, Florida Congressman and Green Beret combat veteran Michael Waltz on the state of the U.S. military today. All of that right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And first this morning: empty-handed and questioned. President Biden returning from his Middle East trip with no promises from Saudi Arabia to boost oil production, to send gasoline prices lower in America. Instead, the president has more gaffes and awkward moments on the world stage, including discussing the Holocaust and American troops, the ongoing cringeworthy moments that have sparked even supporters to question Biden's leadership. The New York Times, which endorsed Joe back in 2020, published a report last week on the president's age becoming -- quote -- \"an uncomfortable issue\" for Democrats, writing that he often shuffles when he walks and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events. And they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe. But as it -- is it more than just age? And, if so, has Biden's capacity become a national security issue over the last year?",

This man should not have been put in a position to be our commander in chief, our head of state and our president. And when I -- when I initially said that back before he was elected, there was a lot of pushback. And I said at the time, give us -- give it about another two years or so,and it won't be Ronny Jackson talking about it anymore. It's going to be his own party. That's what we see happening right now, because this is becoming a real issue for us. You can see what -- domestically, what he's done to our country. We have got our Southern border.We have our economy, the price of gas. People's lives are not in a good spot right now. And then overseas, he's a national embarrassment to us right now. And it's a big national security issue for us when we have somebody going over. And his job as our commander in chief and as our head of state is to inspire confidence and to project strength. And he does just the opposite. So I'm seriously worried about it. I think everybody in the country is starting to get extremely worried about him.

And we're watching this from America, but also watching this are our adversaries, the Chinese Communist Party, Iran, and North Korea, et cetera. Look, Congressman, you treated President Obama in the White House while Joe Biden was vice president. Can you compare what you saw then with Vice President Joe Biden to what you see now? And without asking you to diagnose or prescribe, tell me, roughly speaking, what you think is going on? He did the other day discuss his brain aneurysm, which really was a shock to me that he discussed it publicly, but he did mention it.",

I oversaw the guy that did take care of him, but I wasn't his physician at the time. But I have seen the same thing everybody else saw. I have saw Joe Biden that was always prone to gaffes. But these aren't gaffes anymore. Something's changed toward -- during the time that President Trump was our president, something happened, and Joe Biden started having another issue, a cognitive issue that's related to his age. And like I have said before, I'm not his physician. I haven't examined him, so I'm not going to make a diagnosis. But there's a lot of diseases out there that have a big cognitive component, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multi- infarct dementia. I don't know what he's got going on. But he has something that's causing him to have cognitive decline. And it's progressive, related to his age. And we -- there's a lot of stuff you can do, Maria. There's a lot of jobs you can have out there that you can still be successful if you're not at the top of your game. President of the United States is not one of them. So I see a different Joe Biden now than the one that I saw when he was vice president at the White House. And I think there's lots of tape and lots of video for 40 years of this man's career. And anybody can go back and compare some of those earlier years and some of the gaffes to what's happening now. And this is something very different. This is something very concerning. This man is not in control. And he's not leading this country. Something else is going on behind the scenes. And there are other people pulling the strings. And that is very concerning for us. And, like you said, every -- all of our adversaries see this as a window of opportunity right now. Everyone is going to try to get away with everything they can before he's done. I'm talking about China and Russia and Iran and everybody. This is putting our country at great risk right now.",

Scary.\" But after that tweet came out, you received a note from President Barack Obama. Tell me what Obama said to you. You write about this in your new book, \"Holding the line.\" He said: \"I have to express my disappointment on the cheap shot you took at Joe Biden via Twitter.

And I saw this tweet that Ronna McDaniel had put out with a video clip of Joe Biden, didn't know exactly what state he was in. He was confused, stated that he was running for the Senate. So, he didn't know what office he was running for. And it was just -- I mean, it was a cognitive mess. And then I just got a little frustrated with the double standard and the hypocrisy, because, if you remember, when I was President Trump's physician, the far left, the elites in academic medicine, the mainstream media, they were relentless in their pursuit of me. They were constantly coming after me about testing and President Trump's mental and his physical capabilities. And then here we have a present that's clearly got something going on, and it's crickets. Nobody's saying a single thing. So I retweeted that -- that video she said and made the comments that you read there. I thought it was fairly benign. And then, within 20 or 30 minutes, ding, my phone rings, and I get -- I look down, I got an e-mail from President Obama, directly from President Obama, just scolding me about this. And so I don't know. It was a little bit I had mixed emotions about it. It was kind of a combination between being a little pissed off about and a little angry about it, and having my feelings hurt just a little bit. I had a pretty close personal relationship with all three of the presidents that I served. And he came at me pretty hard. And so I didn't know exactly what I was going to do. I thought about it for a little bit. I called somebody who I knew would understand the situation I was in. I called my friend Dan Bongino. Dan talked me through it a little bit. And Dan said: \"Look, Ronny, you don't owe this guy anything. Don't even respond to this. This is a load of crap.\" And so I kind of followed Dan's lead. And I didn't -- I didn't reply to the e-mail.

I know he goes home to Delaware a lot, more than any other president. So I guess my question is, what did Obama know? What did Jill Biden know? And who's running the White House right now?

We don't know if it's Susan Rice or Ron Klain, or if it's Joe Biden, or who it is. But somebody else is doing this. They're doing exactly what you said. They're rolling him out at specific times during the day. He's got good days and bad days, good -- and whether or not they have him on drugs, I don't know. There are drugs out there that can increase your alertness and your memory and things of that nature and cover stuff like this up temporarily. So I'm sure some of that's going on as well. But we don't know, because his physician hasn't stood up and took the questions that I took when I was Trump's position and answered those questions. With regards to the Obama administration and who should have done something about it, they saw him every day, and they stayed in close contact with him, I'm sure, after the administration -- after the Obama/Biden administration was over. Somebody should have done something. But, Maria, I think that they were so blinded by the fact that, if Joe Biden came into office, they were going to be able to populate the entire West Wing with Obama folks. And that actually happened. Initially, there were a ton of Obama folks in the West Wing. And we have Susan Rice running domestic policy right now. So I think that they thought that the risk was worth it to get their people back into the West Wing. And they just ignored the fact that this man had some serious cognitive issues.

But there are other ways that they could get rid of him. And I see them looking the other way while some of this -- some of this Hunter Biden stuff blows up, and maybe just letting him fall on his sword like that. His party is already slowly starting to abandon him and run away from him because of his polling and because of his cognitive issues and the embarrassment that he's become for the party. And I think that they will look for opportunity to throw him under the bus in the next few years and try to -- or in the next few months and try to get rid of him, because I know that -- I think that they also know he cannot make it to the end of this term in 2024.",

The New York Times, which endorsed Joe back in 2020, published a report last week on the president's age becoming -- quote -- \"an uncomfortable issue\" for Democrats, writing that he often shuffles when he walks and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events. And they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe. But as it -- is it more than just age?

This man should not have been put in a position to be our commander in chief, our head of state and our president. And when I -- when I initially said that back before he was elected, there was a lot of pushback. And I said at the time, give us -- give it about another two years or so,and it won't be Ronny Jackson talking about it anymore. It's going to be his own party. That's what we see happening right now, because this is becoming a real issue for us. You can see what -- domestically, what he's done to our country. We have got our Southern border.We have our economy, the price of gas. People's lives are not in a good spot right now. And then overseas, he's a national embarrassment to us right now. And it's a big national security issue for us when we have somebody going over. And his job as our commander in chief and as our head of state is to inspire confidence and to project strength. And he does just the opposite. So I'm seriously worried about it. I think everybody in the country is starting to get extremely worried about him. And he's not -- he's not a -- he's not in a position to do the job he's currently -- currently being asked to do."

And we're watching this from America, but also watching this are our adversaries, the Chinese Communist Party, Iran, and North Korea, et cetera. Look, Congressman, you treated President Obama in the White House while Joe Biden was vice president. Can you compare what you saw then with Vice President Joe Biden to what you see now? And without asking you to diagnose or prescribe, tell me, roughly speaking, what you think is going on? He did the other day discuss his brain aneurysm, which really was a shock to me that he discussed it publicly, but he did mention it."

    {
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, I did. I saw him periodically throughout the years I was there, making the comment that I wasn't his physician at the time. I oversaw the guy that did take care of him, but I wasn't his physician at the time. But I have seen the same thing everybody else saw. I have saw Joe Biden that was always prone to gaffes. But these aren't gaffes anymore. Something's changed toward -- during the time that President Trump was our president, something happened, and Joe Biden started having another issue, a cognitive issue that's related to his age. And like I have said before, I'm not his physician. I haven't examined him, so I'm not going to make a diagnosis. But there's a lot of diseases out there that have a big cognitive component, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multi- infarct dementia. I don't know what he's got going on. But he has something that's causing him to have cognitive decline. And it's progressive, related to his age. And we -- there's a lot of stuff you can do, Maria. There's a lot of jobs you can have out there that you can still be successful if you're not at the top of your game. President of the United States is not one of them. So I see a different Joe Biden now than the one that I saw when he was vice president at the White House. And I think there's lots of tape and lots of video for 40 years of this man's career. And anybody can go back and compare some of those earlier years and some of the gaffes to what's happening now. And this is something very different. This is something very concerning. This man is not in control. And he's not leading this country. Something else is going on behind the scenes. And there are other people pulling the strings. And that is very concerning for us. And, like you said, every -- all of our adversaries see this as a window of opportunity right now. Everyone is going to try to get away with everything they can before he's done. I'm talking about China and Russia and Iran and everybody. This is putting our country at great risk right now."

Scary.\" But after that tweet came out, you received a note from President Barack Obama. Tell me what Obama said to you. You write about this in your new book, \"Holding the line.\""

And I saw this tweet that Ronna McDaniel had put out with a video clip of Joe Biden, didn't know exactly what state he was in. He was confused, stated that he was running for the Senate. So, he didn't know what office he was running for. And it was just -- I mean, it was a cognitive mess. And then I just got a little frustrated with the double standard and the hypocrisy, because, if you remember, when I was President Trump's physician, the far left, the elites in academic medicine, the mainstream media, they were relentless in their pursuit of me. They were constantly coming after me about testing and President Trump's mental and his physical capabilities. And then here we have a present that's clearly got something going on, and it's crickets. Nobody's saying a single thing. So I retweeted that -- that video she said and made the comments that you read there. I thought it was fairly benign. And then, within 20 or 30 minutes, ding, my phone rings, and I get -- I look down, I got an e-mail from President Obama, directly from President Obama, just scolding me about this. And so I don't know. It was a little bit I had mixed emotions about it. It was kind of a combination between being a little pissed off about and a little angry about it, and having my feelings hurt just a little bit. I had a pretty close personal relationship with all three of the presidents that I served. And he came at me pretty hard. And so I didn't know exactly what I was going to do. I thought about it for a little bit. I called somebody who I knew would understand the situation I was in. I called my friend Dan Bongino. Dan talked me through it a little bit."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, Congressman, there were signs that Joe Biden was declining during the 2020 campaign. I mean, let's face it. He stayed in the basement the whole time during the campaign. So who knew what when? Are they hiding this and feeding him drugs to allow him to function? I know he goes home to Delaware a lot, more than any other president. So I guess my question is, what did Obama know? What did Jill Biden know? And who's running the White House right now? And are they covering up for these mental issues?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the big question everybody's asking. Who's really pulling the strings? Who's running the country right now? We don't really know the answer to that. We don't know if it's Susan Rice or Ron Klain, or if it's Joe Biden, or who it is. But somebody else is doing this. They're doing exactly what you said. They're rolling him out at specific times during the day. He's got good days and bad days, good -- and whether or not they have him on drugs, I don't know. There are drugs out there that can increase your alertness and your memory and things of that nature and cover stuff like this up temporarily. So I'm sure some of that's going on as well. But we don't know, because his physician hasn't stood up and took the questions that I took when I was Trump's position and answered those questions. With regards to the Obama administration and who should have done something about it, they saw him every day, and they stayed in close contact with him, I'm sure, after the administration -- after the Obama/Biden administration was over. Somebody should have done something. But, Maria, I think that they were so blinded by the fact that, if Joe Biden came into office, they were going to be able to populate the entire West Wing with Obama folks. And that actually happened. Initially, there were a ton of Obama folks in the West Wing. And we have Susan Rice running domestic policy right now. So I think that they thought that the risk was worth it to get their people back into the West Wing. And they just ignored the fact that this man had some serious cognitive issues. And now they're going to have to answer why, because it's getting worse."

This is -- all of these issues we talked about with cognitive decline related to age, they get worse, not better with time. And this is going to continue to get worse, and they're going to have to do something about it. Now, I don't know if they will go so far as to enact the 25th Amendment or to talk him into resigning based on this cognitive issue and admit that they were wrong about that. But there are other ways that they could get rid of him. And I see them looking the other way while some of this -- some of this Hunter Biden stuff blows up, and maybe just letting him fall on his sword like that. His party is already slowly starting to abandon him and run away from him because of his polling and because of his cognitive issues and the embarrassment that he's become for the party. And I think that they will look for opportunity to throw him under the bus in the next few years and try to -- or in the next few months and try to get rid of him, because I know that -- I think that they also know he cannot make it to the end of this term in 2024."

And they think that, by giving us tacos, playing Latin music, that's all it's going to take for us to vote for them. And it's not. They're going to have to get to work. We really have had enough of the Democrat Party's far left policies that are hurting us tremendously here in South Texas and in the entire country."

A short break right now, and then a closer look at the border crisis erupting in your backyard, with some sheriffs in your state declaring an invasion. Why is the Biden administration ignoring the millions of illegal migrants swarming the United States and the thousands of pounds of illegal narcotics smuggled in? We will be right back."

We are back with Texas Congresswoman Mayra Flores. And, Congresswoman, I want to talk a bit about what's most important to the Hispanic community. We are all feeling the same issues.

It's costing the average American $460 a month. Can you imagine what it's like to be a senior citizen that lives on a fixed income? I worked with the elderly community for many years. And I can't imagine what their current situation is. And I really do believe that the reason why we were successful in the special election is because we were focused on God, family values, and the economy, and, of course, the border crisis that is hurting us tremendously here in South Texas and throughout the country."

This is just food, fuel and rent, soaring in the last year, largely because of all of the spending in the Democrat agenda. The president keeps blaming Vladimir Putin. But we know, obviously, that inflation really started stroking after the president signed into law his COVID relief package back in March of 2021. I want to get your thoughts on what the Democrats' strategy has been. They seem to be pitting you against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who calls you -- what did she call you, an extreme right-winger?"

And I will always represent the Hispanic community's values. I grew up with those values. They have been instilled in me since I was born. And I'm not willing to put my values aside for no political party. And the Democrat Party wants us to forget how we were raised. They want us to forget about our family values. They want us to be obedient to their party. And the moment that we're not -- no longer obedient, they go against us. I'm an immigrant. They claim to be in support of immigrants.

We have new pictures from Bill Melugin, who's doing an incredible job there at the border. We have brought this program to the border four times already. And I will be going again.

And the Biden administration doesn't care about children being abused and going through rape just to get here to United States illegally, and then sold into child sex trafficking. The Biden administration is at fault. They continue to encourage people to come here illegally, knowing that they're going to have to go through such dangerous journey to come here to United States. If -- why not focus on legal immigration and improve the legal process, so good people that want to come here to work hard for the American dream can do it, but not have to go through that dangerous journey? But it blows my mind. Why would they continue to push illegal immigration, knowing it's funding criminal organizations that have taken over the entire Southern border? I'm from Tamaulipas. I have family in the state of Tamaulipas. I cannot visit as often because I'm afraid. And a lot of people here in South Texas have families in Tamaulipas and throughout Mexico, and they cannot visit their loved ones because of the criminal organization. So we understand that we don't want what we're scared of to come here. I never want no American to ever feel afraid to visit their families. I don't wish that on anyone. And it's heartbreaking to see. And it's difficult for me, because I have family in Mexico still."

The lines are certainly being drawn across the world, as China has been supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine.

So, at least he took a stand to progressives there. But I was disappointed. He reverts right back to this giveaway of billions of dollars to the Iranian regime, in the hopes that they won't pursue a nuclear weapon. Look, Maria, no one wants any type of military action against Iran. But we have to make it clear to the Iranians it's on the table. The Israelis made that clear during the trip. But Biden fell back to the billion-dollar giveaway here. And only if Iran believes that that program could get taken out do I think at this point, as they race towards a nuke, which will set off an arms race in the Middle East, a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, will Iran back down. And the biggest way that we could do that is say it, make it clear on the international stage from the commander in chief, and give the Israelis the technical military equipment that they have been asking for and this administration's been holding back on."

As you said in your lead-in, the Russians and Chinese are absolutely happy to fill the void. What I thought was kind of pathetic was that the president left with no announcement on oil. They basically said, well, thank you very much for your visit, and we will think about it and we will talk to OPEC about it. I mean, the president would have done a lot better to visit Texas, visit Oklahoma. Let's talk about domestic production. And if he has to go abroad -- he refuses to stand up the progressives and do that here -- how about you go places like our friends the Kurds that are absolutely wanting to produce more oil in line with U.S. interests?

We know that there are many reports that the family has taken tens of millions of dollars from Chinese officials who are tied to the Communist Party. I mean, and this is -- and this is China's way of doing things, give gifts, lend money, and then overall take over. He has failed to demand any real investigation into the origins of COVID. He's spoken to Xi Jinping at least five times. And he -- and, as far as I know, he's not brought up the subject. Although he said he brought it up, we don't have any evidence of that. He has failed to confront China on fentanyl. The fentanyl is made in China, and it's pushed through Mexico. He is sending China oil from America's strategic reserves."

They are buying up huge tracts of land, which, oh, by the way, happened to be key farming tracts, but also near our military bases. They're buying up our food supply, chicken, pork, other producers. And they're buying up our technology. If they can't steal it, then they come in, and they -- and they buy it. And what are they doing with all of it? They're creating dependencies on them. And they're handing the technology over to their military, as they have the most rapid military buildup in modern history. And, look, at the end of the day, the Democrats want to talk about defund police. I have been saying let's defund dictatorships. Let's defund the Chinese Communist Party. But we have Wall Street, our politicians, academia, the sports industry, Hollywood, you name it, that are -- that are absolutely drunk on Chinese dollars. The Chinese communists know it. Xi knows it. And they are looking to win the economic war way before there's any type of military conflict. And we have got to wake up as a country. And this administration is totally asleep at the switch."

And the administration apparently is OK with unwitting investors investing in Chinese companies tied to the Chinese Communist Party that may very well end up turning around and fighting America. Tom Cotton has a problem with this ESG agenda. And he says that he wants to investigate ESG practices from groups like BlackRock, which he says have created a climate cartel to suppress investment in the fossil fuel industry in America.

That money is going right to the future Chinese stealth fighters, tanks and planes that will be shooting our men and -- shooting at our men and women. And we had an amendment to stop that, to ban it. And the Democrats came back and said, well, we will support you in banning funds going into Chinese firms if you agree to allow these ESG and environmental bans as well. The irony there, Maria, is that that's going to also flow to China, because they have cornered the market on solar panels. So it's shutting down American energy independence, flowing through this green obsession over into China. And I could show you satellite images that are available in the market of Chinese solar plants being powered by coal-fired plants right next door. This isn't about the environment for China. It's about creating dependencies and making America dependent. And the left is playing right into their hands."

He hides behind this facade of pretending to be a moderate and he used to be an astronaut. Actually, he votes in lockstep with Chuck Schumer and for the Joe Biden open borders, inflation agenda. And so to flip this seat, what I have to do this fall is just tell the truth about Mark Kelly.
