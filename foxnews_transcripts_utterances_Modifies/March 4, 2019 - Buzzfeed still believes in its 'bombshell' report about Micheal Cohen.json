      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" We have seen an awful lot of change during the two years Trump has been President. American politics has been completely reordered, but also the American media has changed forever.  News organizations that seemed like a big deal just five years ago are now extinct, some of them are totally forgotten. Those that remain have either degraded themselves beyond recognition like \"The New Yorker\" or they have been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for amazon.com like the \"Washington Post.\"  It's hard to remember that not so long ago, America had prestige media outlets. Harvard graduates went to work for \"Newsweek,\" rather than private equity. Not anymore. \"Teen Vogue\" now has a news division and so does a New York based cat blog called BuzzFeed.  If you are an affluent single person in that gentrifying part of Brooklyn who likes cats, of course that's redundant because they all like cats, then you know and you love BuzzFeed. When a BuzzFeed headline commands you to quote, \"Stop everything and watch this cat who loves the ocean,\" you do.  You stop everything and you watch that cat. When BuzzFeed offers one of its trademark cat quizzes, you dutifully take the quiz. What kind of purs-anality does your cat actually have? Or \"How cat are you? Take this quiz.\" Meow. You think you know a lot about cats.  BuzzFeed knows more.  On all questions feline, BuzzFeed is the final authority. But what happens when BuzzFeed tries to do real news? Well, in early 2017 we found out the site released the now famous Trump dossier. It was a catalogue of salacious and unverified gossip financed by the DNC originally about President-elect Trump. Many other news outlets, nearly all of them anti-Trump, had seen the dossier, but passed on it. It was just too irresponsible to run. But not BuzzFeed. They thought it was purr-fect, meow, so they ran it.  Two years ago later, the BuzzFeed dossier has come to define the entire Trump Russian collusion conspiracy tale. The problem is, a lot of dossier is pretty clearly untrue.   For example, one of the key claims in the dossier that BuzzFeed ran is that the Trump attorney, Michael Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague. They never offered any evidence that that happened, there never was any evidence, and then finally last week, Michael Cohen himself confirmed it never happened.",

Two years ago, BuzzFeed told us, you remember, we did a show on it that Michael Cohen held a secret meeting with Russian spies in Prague. We have been hearing that about ever since in Congress and on cable news.  We have in fact halted the normal workings of government in part because of that meeting. Now it turns out, it never took place. So it's not a small thing to learn from Michael Cohen. How did BuzzFeed cover this latest stunning development? Well, they didn't cover it. They ignored it completely. As of tonight, BuzzFeed was floating instead a story entitled, \"21 Completely Life Changing Things You Can Make In A Waffle Maker.\" There was nothing about the non-existent Michael Cohen-Russian spy meeting in Prague.  If you only read BuzzFeed, you would never know that that story was false.  Well, apparently, a lot of people in the media only read BuzzFeed and not simply for its lavish cat coverage. This January, BuzzFeed published a story with this sentence, quote, \"President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow,\" end quote. BuzzFeed presented no evidence to show that that was actually true, just unnamed sources, but it didn't matter. The cat lovers on cable news went crazy.",

But it was not true.  Instead, it was a lot like the claim that, I don't know, cat sucks the breath from babies or that a black cat brings bad luck. It was a wives tale posing as fact.   The Mueller investigation itself batted down BuzzFeed's story almost immediately after it came out, and yet, BuzzFeed never retracted the piece.  Once again, in its feline way, the site pretended that nothing had happened. You can yell at a cat, but you can't make a cat pay attention it turns out.  To be clear, here are the key quotes from the January BuzzFeed story, quote, \"Trump directed his longtime attorney, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress,\" end quote. And again, quote, \"The President personally instructed him to lie,\" end quote. And once again, quote, \"It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.\" Explicitly telling a subordinate to lie, that's the claim, okay.  Democratic members of Congress asked Michael Cohen last week about that specific claim. Cohen was under oath at the time. A declared enemy of Donald Trump, not someone who had any reason to lie about this. Here is how he responded.",

BuzzFeed claims that this is somehow proof that its original story was entirely accurate. Nineteen adorable Siamese kittens that are actually talented investigative reporters. We're waiting for that story next. Ben Smith is an editor-in-chief, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News. He was game enough to join us tonight, and obviously, we are grateful for that.  It's not his first time on the show, but I am thankful that you came. So Ben, let me just ask you first about the dossier. This really is a sincere question. So you published the dossier you and I have debated whether that was a wise move and ethical move, but you did. Then we learned in the testimony, and I don't think anyone would doubt it that Cohen did not in fact go to Prague.   Now, we only believed that didn't go to Prague because you ran the story.  But you never ran a follow-up story informing your readers of that. Why?",

Adam Schiff has been on the Sunday shows more than maybe any human in history, has been saying that there is already ample evidence in the public record to establish that collusion occurred, so he is also saying that we now have basis to simply disregard and wipe from the record the entire Mueller investigation because it's not necessary to prove collusion. These are the same people who have been screaming from the rooftops for two years that the entire edifice of American democracy rests on the sanctity of this investigation and the need to preserve it, and now they are saying that, you know, it just doesn't particularly matter. It's almost a remarkable about-face.

I mean I'm, a mother that's what I'm looking forward to, it's to be more with my family because we know that when we are investing with our children, we are investing in the long-term health of society and so, what moms like me have to say ought to be listened to because we're voters and we're also the people who are shaping the next generation, and if we're not there, those kids are going to grow up and really have a greater dependence and need that didn't have to be there if moms were just allowed to do what we are created to do what we want to do.",

And so it maybe -- there may be all kinds of reasons why only 2% of characters in Dr. Seuss are persons of color. There is not a lot of same- sex marriage in Jane Austen. There are very few Muslims in PG Wodehouse.  Authors generally are entitled to write about the characters they want to write about. If you talk with living novelists, for example, the bestselling American novelist, Lionel Shriver told me last year because she writes about characters who are not middle aged white women like herself, she gets accused of cultural appropriations. If a white woman writes in the voice of a black man, she is culturally appropriating. If a thin person writes in the voice of the obese, they are culturally appropriating.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" We have seen an awful lot of change during the two years Trump has been President. American politics has been completely reordered, but also the American media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal just five years ago are now extinct, some of them are totally forgotten. Those that remain have either degraded themselves beyond recognition like \"The New Yorker\" or they have been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for amazon.com like the \"Washington Post.\" It's hard to remember that not so long ago, America had prestige media outlets. Harvard graduates went to work for \"Newsweek,\" rather than private equity. Not anymore. \"Teen Vogue\" now has a news division and so does a New York based cat blog called BuzzFeed. If you are an affluent single person in that gentrifying part of Brooklyn who likes cats, of course that's redundant because they all like cats, then you know and you love BuzzFeed. When a BuzzFeed headline commands you to quote, \"Stop everything and watch this cat who loves the ocean,\" you do.  You stop everything and you watch that cat. When BuzzFeed offers one of its trademark cat quizzes, you dutifully take the quiz. What kind of purs-anality does your cat actually have? Or \"How cat are you? Take this quiz.\" Meow. You think you know a lot about cats.  BuzzFeed knows more. On all questions feline, BuzzFeed is the final authority. But what happens when BuzzFeed tries to do real news? Well, in early 2017 we found out the site released the now famous Trump dossier. It was a catalogue of salacious and unverified gossip financed by the DNC originally about President-elect Trump. Many other news outlets, nearly all of them anti-Trump, had seen the dossier, but passed on it. It was just too irresponsible to run. But not BuzzFeed. They thought it was purr-fect, meow, so they ran it. Two years ago later, the BuzzFeed dossier has come to define the entire Trump Russian collusion conspiracy tale. The problem is, a lot of dossier is pretty clearly untrue. For example, one of the key claims in the dossier that BuzzFeed ran is that the Trump attorney, Michael Cohen held secret meetings with Russian agents in Prague. They never offered any evidence that that happened, there never was any evidence, and then finally last week, Michael Cohen himself confirmed it never happened."

Two years ago, BuzzFeed told us, you remember, we did a show on it that Michael Cohen held a secret meeting with Russian spies in Prague. We have been hearing that about ever since in Congress and on cable news. We have in fact halted the normal workings of government in part because of that meeting. Now it turns out, it never took place. So it's not a small thing to learn from Michael Cohen. How did BuzzFeed cover this latest stunning development? Well, they didn't cover it. They ignored it completely. As of tonight, BuzzFeed was floating instead a story entitled, \"21 Completely Life Changing Things You Can Make In A Waffle Maker.\" There was nothing about the non-existent Michael Cohen-Russian spy meeting in Prague.  If you only read BuzzFeed, you would never know that that story was false. Well, apparently, a lot of people in the media only read BuzzFeed and not simply for its lavish cat coverage. This January, BuzzFeed published a story with this sentence, quote, \"President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow,\" end quote. BuzzFeed presented no evidence to show that that was actually true, just unnamed sources, but it didn't matter. The cat lovers on cable news went crazy."

Had this been true, the Trump presidency likely would have ended and for good reason, a legitimate reason. But it was not true.  Instead, it was a lot like the claim that, I don't know, cat sucks the breath from babies or that a black cat brings bad luck. It was a wives tale posing as fact. The Mueller investigation itself batted down BuzzFeed's story almost immediately after it came out, and yet, BuzzFeed never retracted the piece.  Once again, in its feline way, the site pretended that nothing had happened. You can yell at a cat, but you can't make a cat pay attention it turns out.  To be clear, here are the key quotes from the January BuzzFeed story, quote, \"Trump directed his longtime attorney, Michael Cohen to lie to Congress,\" end quote. And again, quote, \"The President personally instructed him to lie,\" end quote. And once again, quote, \"It is the first known example of Trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with Russia.\" Explicitly telling a subordinate to lie, that's the claim, okay. Democratic members of Congress asked Michael Cohen last week about that specific claim. Cohen was under oath at the time.

BuzzFeed claims that this is somehow proof that its original story was entirely accurate. Nineteen adorable Siamese kittens that are actually talented investigative reporters. We're waiting for that story next. Ben Smith is an editor-in-chief, the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News. He was game enough to join us tonight, and obviously, we are grateful for that.  It's not his first time on the show, but I am thankful that you came. So Ben, let me just ask you first about the dossier. This really is a sincere question. So you published the dossier you and I have debated whether that was a wise move and ethical move, but you did. Then we learned in the testimony, and I don't think anyone would doubt it that Cohen did not in fact go to Prague.

He hates Trump, too. Now he can tell us the truth, and instead, he tells us the opposite, that no, he didn't go. But that's not all. The dossier also claimed that poor Carter Page's life has been destroyed because of the salacious nonsense in that dossier. That he received $11 billion from a Russian energy company in a deal.

I actually -- you know, when we talked about this last time, I got the sense you basically agreed with that and certainly, the idea that Devin Nunes would have been able to press his case against the Russia investigation while saying there is this secret document. It really makes my case, but you are not allowed to see it. That you would have been able to make the arguments you've made about Christopher Steele about these documents and the people on the other side who would have all -- all the while saying that this document will scald your eyes out if you look at it.  So only, we, the elect, we, journalists can look at it."

We now know he didn't take $11 billion in a Russian energy company, that's untrue and you've spent all of this time trying to talk about whatever -- the Trump Tower -- like who cares in Moscow and this guy lives with this claim against his name and you have not corrected it.

Cohen described a personal meeting with Jay Sekulow and Trump, in which in discussing his testimony and this is something where everyone is chasing to get more detail of this, and it's a little hard for us to argue about it in the absence of like a transcript of the meeting. This isn't Nixon. We don't have audio. The things that Trump said, you said before were, \"No Russia, no deal.\" I mean, if that is in the context of his testimony, that sound, that is certainly personal. They are talking to each other about his testimony. Is it that explicit? I think that's a reasonable argument reasonable people can have, but the idea that this has been debunked, this is a hoax -- I mean, the hoax story has moved to a place where we're having a much narrower dispute here, Tucker. By the way, that story that is not about collusion, but that story is about lying about an amazing real estate deal in Moscow."

You saw the \"New York Times\" report that he had ordered Kelly to do something, but that they didn't know the exact words, and I do think that at some point, Michael Cohen who has trusted retainer, he has worked for him for a long time.

He says he hates Donald Trump and in the end, he revealed what? He said there were no secret meetings and no hidden payoffs, no pee tape, and no collusion. It doesn't matter. The people who believe in the Russia conspiracy believe just as much as they did before Michael Cohen testified. On a podcast last week, Hillary Clinton said, \"It's the job of her party to keep digging, if necessary, all the way through the Earth until they reach the Kremlin.\""

      "utterance": "Well, I think it is most instructive to look at what leading Democrats who have been leading the charge on this collusion narrative from the outside are now saying. They are totally changing their tune. Jerrold Nadler for example, who would lead impeachment proceedings against President Trump were it to come to that has now been saying that he reserves the right to disagree with Robert Mueller's final report. Adam Schiff has been on the Sunday shows more than maybe any human in history, has been saying that there is already ample evidence in the public record to establish that collusion occurred, so he is also saying that we now have basis to simply disregard and wipe from the record the entire Mueller investigation because it's not necessary to prove collusion. These are the same people who have been screaming from the rooftops for two years that the entire edifice of American democracy rests on the sanctity of this investigation and the need to preserve it, and now they are saying that, you know, it just doesn't particularly matter. It's almost a remarkable about-face. But because the media is so blinkered by their Trump fixation, they are not totally cognizant of it, and I think your exchange with Ben Smith was actually illustrative of that as well. I was watching that with my jaw on the floor. You referred to BuzzFeed as a cat blog run by depressed Brooklynites, which is funny and true in a lot of ways, but they actually do occasionally produce what could be described as legitimate journalistic work every now and then."

I will just give you another example of why none of this adds up. Jason Leopold who is one of the co-authors of the initial story appeared on MSNBC within hours of the story first breaking.

But she didn't take it. She took Ubers instead. Her campaign logged 66 separate airline transactions and took Amtrak just 18 times. Ocasio-Cortez did not dispute any of these findings, but said instead, she was quote, \"Living in the world as it is,\" end quote. Well, the cofounder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore was not impressed by this, he tweeted this, quote, \"The world as it is has the option of taking the subway rather than a taxi.

Every year, Democrats fly down to Selma, Alabama to posture about racism the Civil Rights and every year, they ignore the fact that the actual city of Selma is collapsing. Selma was once a major industrial center in the south. Most of the factories have since closed. The population has fallen by more than a third since 1960. More than 40% of the people who live in Selma right now live in poverty, the kids. By household income, it is the ninth poorest small city in the entire United States. A 2018 report found it to be one of the most dangerous places in the country and the most dangerous in the state of Alabama. In other words, Alabama -- Selma, rather is the city full of problems, real problems, the kind that Democrats used to genuinely care about. Now, they've moved on. If the city's unemployment rate is high, it's just more proof that they deserve replacement by foreign workers of some kind.

It says you have to be for free speech, but if you're going to follow Trump's executive order, that you have to be for Trump. They can't be for Trump, but anything Trump says, he's for and they're against. But to be against Trump is against free speech, so how do they square that circle? I think the way they do it is through Orwellian language, so what they mean is free speech is hate speech because you could be cruel to some group and censorship is called trigger warnings, segregation as safe spaces and having some skepticism that man-made global warming is sort of creationism or denialism. So in their way of and I'm saying they're going to make these efforts, Tucker, because there's $26 billion dollars at stake in Federal support for higher education, so they're going to be for free speech.

They change the language and they think that by changing the language, they change reality, so then they come back to Trump and they think, we solved the problem. We can beat for free speech and we can be against Donald Trump because that isn't really free speech. It's trigger warnings and micro aggressions and safe spaces and denialism. That's what they do and I don't think they're going to be able to pull it off, but they're in a very bad predicament, Tucker.

So also mothers themselves just really want to be with their kids because they love them and they want to spend time with them, so it's really not good for the overall health of our society to be breaking the mother-baby bond.

It is not good for a society if more children are committing crimes, you know when they grow up as it has happened in Quebec when they implemented a full government daycare program there. It's not good for society when children have more emotional disturbances and they're more aggressive. They're having more special needs placements and so forth, and so I mean all of that -- I mean, what's really, again, what we really need to do is think about what's most sustainable for society and of course business plays a role in that, but it's not the most important thing."

      "utterance": "Well, I think it's because most of the parties are listening more to pollsters and to the people who create push research rather than to the people who are closest to the families and to the children. If you particularly talked to low-income and middle class mothers, what they can say - they consider it a mark of luxury and a mark of having finally made it and feeling stable as a family for them to be able to devote more of their time to their family and less of it to paid work outside the home. So that's definitely something that mothers are looking for. I mean I'm, a mother that's what I'm looking forward to, it's to be more with my family because we know that when we are investing with our children, we are investing in the long-term health of society and so, what moms like me have to say ought to be listened to because we're voters and we're also the people who are shaping the next generation, and if we're not there, those kids are going to grow up and really have a greater dependence and need that didn't have to be there if moms were just allowed to do what we are created to do what we want to do."

      "utterance": "You could have seen this coming, Dr. Seuss is one of the most beloved children's authors. He is an American, but his books were written before 2008, so it was inevitable that somebody in academia was going to call them racist and that of course is exactly what happened. A new academic study argues that quote, \"Racism spans across the entire Seuss collection.\" The oov. The study says it's a myth that books like \"Horton Hears a Who,\" and \"The Sneetches,\" which are actually against racism for more tolerance. The chief argument is that Seuss' characters are too male and have the wrong skin colors, whatever those are. Author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us tonight. What? They have the wrong skin colors? What were the skin colors in Dr. Seuss?"

      "speaker": "MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "That's right, they have done a survey and concluded that only 2% of the characters in Dr. Seuss are persons of color and they find this problematic. I actually find the world \"problematic\" problematic, because it's a way for social justice warriors to label anything they don't like without actually engaging in it, in any coherent way. And so it maybe -- there may be all kinds of reasons why only 2% of characters in Dr. Seuss are persons of color. There is not a lot of same- sex marriage in Jane Austen. There are very few Muslims in PG Wodehouse.  Authors generally are entitled to write about the characters they want to write about. If you talk with living novelists, for example, the bestselling American novelist, Lionel Shriver told me last year because she writes about characters who are not middle aged white women like herself, she gets accused of cultural appropriations. If a white woman writes in the voice of a black man, she is culturally appropriating. If a thin person writes in the voice of the obese, they are culturally appropriating. So you can't win either way, and what these culture vandals are doing now are basically trying to make us live in a permanent year zero as they called it in Cambodia, where we have no cultural inheritance. And we're just bobbing around in the flotsam and the jetsam of a hyper present tense, which is no way to live."

His name was Greg Helgemo. He was suspended by the World Bridge Federation after a test found elevated testosterone levels. Bridge of course, not typically associated with homerun records. Are you surprised though that there is doping in bridge?"

I was playing solitaire with myself when I realized I had taken performance enhancing drugs. You can't get through -- all of these, you go to any senior center in Florida and traces of urine are being found and there are drug samples all the time.  This is the just the world we live in now -- performance enhancing drugs for Bridge Fours.
