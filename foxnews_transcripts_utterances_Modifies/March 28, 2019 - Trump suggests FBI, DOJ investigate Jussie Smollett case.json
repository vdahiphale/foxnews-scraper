Highlights and analysis in moments plus my “Angle” on the rise of the loser class. What does that mean? And the latest absurd developments in the Jussie Smollett case. Tonight, we have reaction from Chicago PD reps and you'll by the way, hear from a former DOJ official about how the Feds do plan to get involved.  And it was a resounding rebuke this morning. House Intel members taking aim at well, shiftless Adam Schiff, calling for him to step aside as Intel Chair and one of those members is here to react plus new details from the Hills, John Solomon.  But first we begin with the Fox news alert, President Trump is on its way to Florida at this hour after a rockers rally in Michigan. The President is rightfully basking in the glory after the Mueller report exoneration and hitting the Democrat fanatics in the process.",

The Russia hoax proves more than ever that we need to finish exactly what we came here to do, drain the swamp. We defeated a very corrupt establishment and we kept our promise to the American people and it's driving them crazy. The last two years, we've embarked on an unprecedented, economic revival, unprecedented.  America is now the hottest economies anywhere on the planet Earth. There's nobody close. Since our election win, the stock market is up almost 50%, you're looking like geniuses. We've created since my election, 5.5 million new jobs. Nobody would have believed that was possible.   We passed massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. While we're pushing and pursuing all of these common sense policies to advance the common good for our citizens, Democrats are pushing a cynical and destructive agenda of radicalism, resistance. Resist and revenge. We are taking on the extremists and they are really radical, radical extremist Democrats who want open borders and crime.

My friends, if you want to remake America from soup to nuts or rob some houses around Christmas time, well, you don't have time for recuperating or changing your technique. Instead what do you do? You double down on failure. You act like you won big, you just hit the Lotto. And you blame your loss on someone else. Very, very mature. No other profession treats losers this way that I can think of but in politics, reality is often suspended.  You don't deserve anything though, right? We were taught that you need to earn it. All those parents who brought their kids, way into college, thought their kids deserve to go to Yale or USC or Wake Forest or Stanford. It's just that the system was screwed up so they decided to game the system. And ultimately the fraud was discovered. I think the American people are sharper than the left gives them credit for. I don't think they like all this radicalism nor the entitlement mentality that seems to be infecting all races, all ethnicities today. Folks want basic fairness. Basic standards of decency. Common sense, not fanatical efforts to deconstruct America and reconstruct her and what Teddy Roosevelt called the a polyglot boarding house. Being a loser doesn't mean of course you can't win again, not saying that. Reagan showed us that. He lost in 76, came back in 1980, the rest is history. But it also doesn't mean that you should expect the rest of us to bow down at your every word just because you say them with enough breathless indignation about how much you don't like Donald Trump. Get up. Brush yourself off and try again. But you have to earn respect to win the votes.

And yet after suffering a defeat, person A emerges more arrogant and more self-assured than ever before proclaiming that had certain things just happened differently, he or she indeed would have won.

Now perhaps most disturbing in this scenario is when person A tries to use his or her loss as a selling point. Now for people in particular who fit the mold in recent weeks come to mind.

My friends, if you want to remake America from soup to nuts or rob some houses around Christmas time, well, you don't have time for recuperating or changing your technique. Instead what do you do? You double down on failure. You act like you won big, you just hit the Lotto. And you blame your loss on someone else. Very, very mature. No other profession treats losers this way that I can think of but in politics, reality is often suspended. You don't deserve anything though, right? We were taught that you need to earn it. All those parents who brought their kids, way into college, thought their kids deserve to go to Yale or USC or Wake Forest or Stanford. It's just that the system was screwed up so they decided to game the system. And ultimately the fraud was discovered. I think the American people are sharper than the left gives them credit for. I don't think they like all this radicalism nor the entitlement mentality that seems to be infecting all races, all ethnicities today. Folks want basic fairness. Basic standards of decency. Common sense, not fanatical efforts to deconstruct America and reconstruct her and what Teddy Roosevelt called the a polyglot boarding house. Being a loser doesn't mean of course you can't win again, not saying that. Reagan showed us that. He lost in 76, came back in 1980, the rest is history. But it also doesn't mean that you should expect the rest of us to bow down at your every word just because you say them with enough breathless indignation about how much you don't like Donald Trump. Get up. Brush yourself off and try again. But you have to earn respect to win the votes. And you're only going to do that by making a persuasive argument not by haughtily assuming that victory is going to be yours just because you showed up and you lost the first time.

For example, the exoneration of convicted killers what we think are just totally baseless arguments, who go out and then file multimillion dollar lawsuits against the detectives who did the - who investigated the case.

I think a lot of Americans realize something ought to be done. Second, this is why we have a U.S. Justice Department. Maybe they spent a lot of a lot of time investigating President Trump to no good effect, but now they actually exist to make sure there's no corruption going on in state department. If you look at the details of this case where Mrs. Obama's chief of staff calls the prosecutor, Kim Foxx, and then all of a sudden these machinations occur and then the case gets dropped, that is exactly what the Justice Department is supposed to be involved in, is to make sure that there is no corruption in state governments.

Plus, remember, he did this crazy thing before where he mailed himself fake chemical weapons. He mailed himself a white powder, claimed it was anthrax, tried to report that to the police. That's actually a federal crime, is to create a hoax about using chemical weapons."

That's pie in the sky thinking. So what is the recourse is here? How can the committee, which is critical to oversight, how can this committee be led by someone who has lied over and over again, and using the weapon of treason, and Trump being a Russian agent?"

There's very, very important work that we need to do, but we reached a point where we realized he was so blinded by politics where he's ruled by emotion and not fact, and we needed to make that point. But Laura, if I could tell you what I think is the biggest lie that he and others have told, and that is, as the clip said, they have accused the president of treason, they have accused him to aligning himself with a foreign government, not only another foreign government, our adversary for generations. This is a very serious charge. And if they really believed it, they would require, they would demand, they would work towards his impeachment."

This is going to get a lot hotter before it's all done. And here's the big moment it's going to happen. When the president declassifies all these documents and we see in real time what Adam Schiff was being told behind closed doors, and we can compare with what he said out from said out front in front of the cameras, Adam Schiff is going to be feeling a lot more uncomfortable than he did today. We know multiple briefings occurred that told him no collusion, and he's out driving that narratives. When these two documents can be compared, those two performances, I think the American public are going to be even more concerned than they are today."

He is very intelligent. He's a former prosecutor. He's no fool, I'll tell you that. Which brings me to the point, and that is he's not being fooled by this. He hasn't been deceived. He knows the truth, just like you and I know the truth. The American people know the truth. He just has made a calculated political decision that he doesn't care what is true. He just hates the president so viscerally, and is so offended the American people would choose this president over his friend, Hillary Clinton, he's essentially said the American people are stupid. We are going to overturn their decision, and we are going to do it by destroying this president through lies and accusations that he knows isn't true."

I think the bigger question is why keep extended this charade, this mirage. I think they are trying to keep people away from what might really have happened, and that is Hillary Clinton's campaign, the Democratic National Committee was working with a foreign power, Ukraine, to get some of their dirt on Donald Trump.

And I think it's overly optimistic for those who oppose this president to say, once again, well, we didn't find what we wanted, but we'll keep looking and we'll wait till we get through.

They all could agree on one thing, that the dream team, the professionals, the untouchables, the all-stars were going to get Trump. But as soon that vanishes, Laura, how do you -- a party of identity politics that says that one of their commands commandments is toxic maleness, toxic white males, has the three white males that are their top frontrunners so far in their future primaries. And then in addition, how do you reconcile the new green deal and reparations and a wealth tax, and Medicare for everybody, abolition of everything from student debt to ICE, if you don't have that Mueller bogeyman? And so once that's gone, they're going to start squabbling. This other thing is the last 22 months we've seen this drip, drip, drip, collusion, collusion, collusion, when there was nothing really there. And it helped them win the midterms. But now the process I think operates in reverse. And by that I mean the next 19 months, it's not going to be before the midterms, it's going to be for the general election, and it's not going to be a hoax, it's going to be fact.

How can you obstruct something that didn't exist?
