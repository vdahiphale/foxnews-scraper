Some of the top medical minds in the country are telling a much different coronavirus story than the one you see on TV. So why are they being ignored? We're going to talk to one tonight. Also, there's a piece of the Flynn story that is being overlooked. The handwritten note suggesting and trapping General Flynn were written by an agent right after meeting with Jim Comey. Carter, Huckabee and Weisenberg, dig into that.  And Raymond Arroyo would normally bring you \"Friday Follies\" tonight, but instead he's dug deep into the Joe Biden sexual assault case. The hypocrisy and the media's complicity and more.  But first my thoughts at the end of day 46, America in shutdown. I want to call this good news. Friday. At least 20 States began reopening today in some capacity, including Texas. A friend called me - this is such a great call - from the Katy Trail Ice House in Dallas.  I've been there a few times, a great place. It sounded like heaven. I could hear the music. I know the cold beer was flowing. And, well, of course, there was social distancing, but people just felt - and you could feel the happiness coming back to cities across the country. But what about all you poor people left in the states where stay-at-home orders haven't let up - North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, California. Well, the people of these States and more are, of course, done in many ways. They feel like they're done with the COVID shutdowns and they want to try to reclaim their livelihoods safely and responsibly. The Attorney General is watching this closely,",

      "sentences": "Laura, good evening. What I can tell you is that Orange County is not just taking this governor's order lying down. They are resisting and resisting hard. Several cities have already filed lawsuits. Several others are planning to do so.  They feel like they're being targeted by the governor for political reasons rather than scientific reasons. They say, look, there's 3 million people in Orange County, only 45 of them have died of coronavirus. The governor's math here, his reasoning just doesn't add up. So Huntington Beach was the first city to file a lawsuit. They've lost their first hearing earlier tonight. Judge sided with Governor Newsom for now and decided not to file an order to stop his mandate. So for now, Orange County beaches will remain closed.  But let's talk about how all this drama started in the first place. Take a look at these images from last week, and this was down in Orange County. We had a big heat wave out here in SoCal and thousands of people flocked to the beaches, primarily Newport Beach and Huntington Beach.  While these images got back to Governor Newsom, and he was less than pleased about them. As a matter of fact, he was quite angry. He said this was dangerous. There was no social distancing going on and he didn't like what he saw. So he hinted he would be taking some action to prevent this in the future. So everybody wondered what that meant. Fast forward to Wednesday night, a trusted source leaked me this memo. Take a look. We broke this story exclusively. This was put out by the California Police Chiefs Association. It was sent out to police chiefs across the state, essentially giving them a heads up that the governor's administration had explicitly told them, he would be announcing that today, Friday, May 1st, he would be closing all beaches in the State of California.  Well, when we put that story out on social media, the backlash was immediate and overwhelming to the governor. So apparently between Wednesday night and yesterday morning, the governor changed his mind. He walked back his decision and announced only Orange County beaches would be closed down. So take a look at earlier today, Orange County people were not happy about that. There was a big protest in Huntington Beach. Hundreds of people - maybe even thousands of people showing up next to the Huntington Beach pier to protest the closing of their beaches, and overall, the stay-at-home order in California. They say the cure is starting to get worse than the disease. They say the governor severely overstepped his authority and they wanted to speak out about it.   Now, Governor Newsome was asked about these protests during his press conference today and he might be seeing some of that political pressure because he indicated, he's been saying, it might be weeks to months before we get some orders lifted. Today, he started saying it might be a matter of days. Listen,",

Of particular concern by the way, are these handwritten notes from former FBI counter intel had built, Priestap.

And the other theory is, because he's a counter-intelligence guy, and they never end up in court, he didn't realize danger. He was too naive and didn't realize the danger of creating notes that can be shoved down your throat when you're on the stand. But the key here, Laura - the real key to the outrage here is both those interview notes and the materials that were released yesterday that show that the investigation of Flynn, that was part of crossfire hurricane was over. They were - they had actually prepared a closing memorandum on January the 4th, that doesn't get done unless everybody on the team that was doing the Flynn investigation, which never should have been started to begin with, agrees that it should be closed. And Peter Strzok on the 4th either asked or ordered them to keep it open. The only reason they kept it open was for so called Logan Act violation, which as you know, is a complete joke.

Dr. Burton Dickey, a founder and shareholder of Pulmotect, has been researching this for two decades in his lab at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and he says the drug lands on the surface of the epithelial cells in lung and signals them to produce superoxide and peroxide for several days, similar to the way bleach kills germs on a kitchen table. Superoxide and peroxide in the lungs rapidly kills germs that are inhaled. Two of the men working with Dr. Dickey to bring this drug to market are here with us tonight. Joining me exclusively, Dr. Colin Broom, physician and scientist and CEO of Pulmotect. Also with me is Leo Linbeck, chairman of the board of the company. Dr. Broom, let me start with you.

And what we have been able to do in Dr. Dickey's lab and Dr. Scott Evans and some of the other folks who helped develop this, we have been able to figure out how to stimulate that so we can turn on your innate immunity and put it on high alert.

The hypocrisy and the media's complicity and more. But first my thoughts at the end of day 46, America in shutdown. I want to call this good news. Friday. At least 20 States began reopening today in some capacity, including Texas. A friend called me - this is such a great call - from the Katy Trail Ice House in Dallas. I've been there a few times, a great place. It sounded like heaven. I could hear the music. I know the cold beer was flowing. And, well, of course, there was social distancing, but people just felt - and you could feel the happiness coming back to cities across the country. But what about all you poor people left in the states where stay-at-home orders haven't let up - North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, California. Well, the people of these States and more are, of course, done in many ways.

Remember, he wanted to do the whole state, then he just decided to punish Orange County. Well, the City Council of Dana Point is joining the legal attack voting four to one to sue Newsom. So will other California counties follow suit? For the latest news let's go live to KTTV Investigative Reporter Bill Melugin in Santa Monica, California, I know it well Bill"

      "utterance": "Laura, good evening. What I can tell you is that Orange County is not just taking this governor's order lying down. They are resisting and resisting hard. Several cities have already filed lawsuits. Several others are planning to do so. They feel like they're being targeted by the governor for political reasons rather than scientific reasons. They say, look, there's 3 million people in Orange County, only 45 of them have died of coronavirus. The governor's math here, his reasoning just doesn't add up. So Huntington Beach was the first city to file a lawsuit. They've lost their first hearing earlier tonight. Judge sided with Governor Newsom for now and decided not to file an order to stop his mandate. So for now, Orange County beaches will remain closed. But let's talk about how all this drama started in the first place. Take a look at these images from last week, and this was down in Orange County. We had a big heat wave out here in SoCal and thousands of people flocked to the beaches, primarily Newport Beach and Huntington Beach. While these images got back to Governor Newsom, and he was less than pleased about them. As a matter of fact, he was quite angry. He said this was dangerous. There was no social distancing going on and he didn't like what he saw. So he hinted he would be taking some action to prevent this in the future. So everybody wondered what that meant. Fast forward to Wednesday night, a trusted source leaked me this memo. Take a look. We broke this story exclusively. This was put out by the California Police Chiefs Association. It was sent out to police chiefs across the state, essentially giving them a heads up that the governor's administration had explicitly told them, he would be announcing that today, Friday, May 1st, he would be closing all beaches in the State of California. Well, when we put that story out on social media, the backlash was immediate and overwhelming to the governor. So apparently between Wednesday night and yesterday morning, the governor changed his mind. He walked back his decision and announced only Orange County beaches would be closed down. So take a look at earlier today, Orange County people were not happy about that. There was a big protest in Huntington Beach. Hundreds of people - maybe even thousands of people showing up next to the Huntington Beach pier to protest the closing of their beaches, and overall, the stay-at-home order in California. They say the cure is starting to get worse than the disease. They say the governor severely overstepped his authority and they wanted to speak out about it. Now, Governor Newsome was asked about these protests during his press conference today and he might be seeing some of that political pressure because he indicated, he's been saying, it might be weeks to months before we get some orders lifted. Today, he started saying it might be a matter of days. Listen,"

Sol Weisenberg, former Deputy Independent Counsel and Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor and host of \"The Sara Carter Show.\" All right, Governor Huckabee, as someone who, of course, ran a state, what would you make of these governors, these seemingly draconian moves?

We used to say in the governor's office in Arkansas, \"Trust the Lord and tell the people,\" and then we simply meant this. We're not God. The government can't be God. And some governments are acting like they're God almighty, and they need to quit it. The second thing is tell the people, explain to them what's helpful, what's common sense. Explain to them what they can do and need to do. But don't be a nanny state and have people on snitch patrol. This is getting out of hand and I'll tell you the pent up frustration in many states you're seeing it boil over. We've all just hunkered down for weeks.

Because these are people that live in elitist liberal bubbles that don't ever leave their homes half the time anyways. They'd be happy just typing away - and especially with the reporters, doing their blogs and typing away inside their home and not having to go out anywhere. But the actual American people, the workforce - we have nearly 30 million unemployment right now in the United States. People need to get out. They need to go to work. Obviously, people have common sense, I believe in the American people, Laura. See that's the difference between me and those other reporters is that I actually believe American people have common sense and they're going to do the right thing to help mitigate this virus. But going out to the beach with your family in the open air and enjoying some fresh air is actually quite healthy for you. The reverse is true if you're locked down for six weeks in your home, seven weeks in your home, and by the way, having police come and harass - harass people for allowing their kids to go out on a play date with their next door neighbor is ridiculous."

These governors at some point - there's got to be a check on their power. And if there's not - this is a very bad precedent to set going forward. I want to move on to these explosive documents that were unsealed, guys, this week. Of course, the Mike Flynn documents. Of particular concern by the way, are these handwritten notes from former FBI counter intel had built, Priestap. Now these notes suggest, I think, that the FBI tried to frame Flynn by getting him to lie, so then they could prosecute him or just get him fired. Well, they ended up, of course, getting him both. But here's another important detail. Fox news is reporting that the notes were penned Priestap after a meeting with then FBI Director Jim Comey and then FBI Director Andrew McCabe before Flynn's interview. Sol, what is your read on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEISENBERG",
      "utterance": "The key to the case - well, first of all, one big question is why did Priestap make notes at all? It's very unusual to make such notes in a spit balling session like that. There's one theory is that he was creating his own insurance policy since he's not really part of the whole Comey-McCabe-Strzok axis. And the other theory is, because he's a counter-intelligence guy, and they never end up in court, he didn't realize danger. He was too naive and didn't realize the danger of creating notes that can be shoved down your throat when you're on the stand. But the key here, Laura - the real key to the outrage here is both those interview notes and the materials that were released yesterday that show that the investigation of Flynn, that was part of crossfire hurricane was over. They were - they had actually prepared a closing memorandum on January the 4th, that doesn't get done unless everybody on the team that was doing the Flynn investigation, which never should have been started to begin with, agrees that it should be closed. And Peter Strzok on the 4th either asked or ordered them to keep it open. The only reason they kept it open was for so called Logan Act violation, which as you know, is a complete joke. This was an incredibly corrupt - this was incredibly corrupt and sleazy. He shouldn't have been questioned at all."

This is a big deal and I'm not going to personally be satisfied until some of the people responsible for this are frog marched across their own front lawns at 6:00 AM by a SWAT team in 29 vehicles, just like Roger Stone was, and have the cameras rolling, so the world can see that we don't tolerate this kind of a ridiculous overstep of the force of the badge."

Now, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy whose authors include a historian, warns COVID-19 could be around for up to two years. OK. That came out.

In other words, how many people died from people who had known infections and symptoms.

There are two groups of people who really do poorly with the COVID-19 illness. You've mentioned the people who have underlying serious health conditions. A bigger group, not in size, but in the effect, are the elderly, particularly those who live in nursing homes. They often have comorbid illnesses. And in my own institution, in my region, three-quarters of the deaths are in people who are elderly. I think a smarter way to attack this would be doing proof of the background health, as you mentioned, and also target those who are the most vulnerable, starting with the elderly, particularly those in nursing homes. That may be easier to transition to then using broader social tools"

We've begun to ramp that back up. We continue to do not only emergency, but some essential care. Because elective care means it's scheduled, but it doesn't mean that it's unnecessary. You've heard stories around the country of people who delayed their care either because of their fears or their physician responding to request to cancel anything that's not an emergency and paying the price for that.

But the President wasn't wrong about the power of, quote, disinfectants in many ways in the body. We can announce tonight the advent of a potential treatment from a Houston- based company Pulmotect that harnesses the ability of the lungs to generate superoxide. Dr. Burton Dickey, a founder and shareholder of Pulmotect, has been researching this for two decades in his lab at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and he says the drug lands on the surface of the epithelial cells in lung and signals them to produce superoxide and peroxide for several days, similar to the way bleach kills germs on a kitchen table. Superoxide and peroxide in the lungs rapidly kills germs that are inhaled. Two of the men working with Dr. Dickey to bring this drug to market are here with us tonight. Joining me exclusively, Dr. Colin Broom, physician and scientist and CEO of Pulmotect. Also with me is Leo Linbeck, chairman of the board of the company. Dr. Broom, let me start with you. Explain for our audience if this works out in the clinical trial, how this drug would be administered."

      "speaker": "DR. COLIN BROOM, PULMOTECT CEO",

And as you referred to, when it lands on the lungs' surface, it stimulates and signals the epithelial to be aware and start producing a noxious chemical barrier. This is natural. This is evolution. This is what we call innate immunity, which you referred to earlier on. And what we intend to do is to run two clinical trials, one to prevent infection, and the other to treat early infection in patients with COVID-19."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Of course, you wouldn't breathe this stuff in. Nature has evolved this really exquisite mechanism for getting your lungs to secrete superoxide at the time that they need them. And what we have been able to do in Dr. Dickey's lab and Dr. Scott Evans and some of the other folks who helped develop this, we have been able to figure out how to stimulate that so we can turn on your innate immunity and put it on high alert. This is your frontline defense. And by doing that, we can prevent infection in lungs. And that's the game. The game here is to stop pneumonia. Pneumonia is what kills people. And if we can stop that, then this turns into a very different kind of virus."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

They help people in many cases, but they also -- we know the story of what happened with the swine flu, never got an HIV vaccine. So this could be a treatment, again, if it works, a treatment that changes the way we even think about this. Correct, Dr. Broom?"

    {
      "speaker": "BROOM",
      "utterance": "Yes, indeed. And the studies that we're planning to do, which we intend to start dosing next week, are very well controlled studies. And of course, we have to look at not just the potential positive affect, but also the drugs for safety. So these well-controlled studies are executed very quickly and be in a position where we could potentially do larger studies and potentially have a treatment available before year end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Leo, a lot of people are saying, and another individual just said, Dr. Jorge Rodriguez earlier today on CNN, he basically says we don't have any immunity to this. He claims that this, that COVID is like, he equated it to smallpox, which obviously was incredibly deadly. But we do have innate immunity, and we have to make sure we can trigger it if possible, and that's what you're trying to do, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LINBECK",
      "utterance": "That's correct. We really have two immune systems. We have an innate immune system and an adaptive immune system. A lot of the attention is focused on vaccines and antibodies, and those really leverage the adaptive immune system. We are focused on the innate immune system and stimulating that. And what's really exciting about the innate immune system is it is not specific to a pathogen. So if we can figure out a way to unlock and harness the power of the innate immune system, and not only can we protect against COVID, but future emerging pathogens could also be responsive to the same treatment."

But they want to stay in this perpetual panic mode because they think that is maybe good for their ratings or maybe it's bad for Trump. I don't know what their analysis is. Next up, a \"New York Magazine\" reporter, Adam, doesn't understand the difference between losing people in a war versus a pandemic. OLIVIA NUZZI, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"NEW YORK MAGAZINE\": If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?"

      "utterance": "Adam, a lot of the folks made this comparison this week. \"L.A. Times\" had a headline, and we've had really bad flu seasons that have had almost that amount of deaths as well. This year was a bad flu season. We don't even have those full numbers. Your thoughts on this?"

      "utterance": "It's unbelievable. First they wanted to make this Trump's Katrina. Now they are trying to make it Trump's Vietnam. Any minute, they are going to start putting the calendar in the bottom corner of the screen with the deaths each day. Rachel Maddow is going to start telling people the pandemic is now unwinnable and distributing cyanide tablets for her viewers to put in their kombucha. Their overstatement of this is outrageous."

JIM MESSINA, 2012 OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: There's a real difference between the media looking into these allegations, which is what they have done to Tara Reade and what they did to Brett Kavanaugh, and Mitch McConnell, who got that process over as fast as he could get it over with to protect the nominee for the Supreme Court."
