It doesn't give us any indication of what's happening behind closed doors. If we get it, we'll bring it to you.  But let's bring in our panel, start there, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Matthew, it seems like President Trump is continuing to talk tough. It doesn't seem like the Chinese are refiguring things, at least not the indication we are getting at. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I think there is a lot of focus on the stock market, Bret. But the fact is, there is more to this than the stock market. This is really a fight over who defines the 21st century, the United States or China. So we're in the midst of a trade war. It began a couple of years ago. But the trade war is just one component of a quickly emerging second cold war that has military dimensions, espionage dimensions, cyber dimensions, and ideological dimensions. So this fight is just getting started. It's nowhere near being concluded.",

The political pressures and the timing of this, if you've noticed, the Republicans on Capitol Hill about NAFTA in 2017 and about tariffs in 18 were pretty quiet in their discussions with the president. They waited about six months after the midterm elections, but started -- Senator Grassley, the Finance Committee Chairman, is starting to talk about pushing back on Section 232 authority, the way you impose tariffs and our national security criteria, the beginnings of more public rumblings.   Now they are about to lose it. So the timing is right when we thought the Chinese really were at the table, and then he threatened these new tariffs, now the deal really is falling apart. They are running out of time on the electoral calendar. The farmers are hurting. The retaliatory tariffs on steel and aluminum against us are so devastating to political constituencies for Republicans that I think unless he brings the Chinese back to the table, they are going to start to pushing loudly and publicly to roll back this deal on aluminum tariffs.",

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": And if you read the statements from Chinese officials, they make it very clear that these things do hurt. And as bad as I think that they probably are, nobody likes tariffs, or if you like free markets, you don't like tariffs. But they are bad for China too. And I talk to farmers a lot about this. And A.B. is right, they are taking it in shorts right now. It is, across the country, it is an enormous pain for them.  But at the same time, the next thing they say is that they also do want better markets. And this is what got Donald Trump elected I think more than just about anything except for immigration. This is an important issue. And if Donald Trump can come up on the other end and make China squeal and get the concessions that Trump wants and a better trading environment, those farmers are going to be very happy in the long run.",

This is really a fight over who defines the 21st century, the United States or China. So we're in the midst of a trade war. It began a couple of years ago. But the trade war is just one component of a quickly emerging second cold war that has military dimensions, espionage dimensions, cyber dimensions, and ideological dimensions. So this fight is just getting started. It's nowhere near being concluded."

The political pressures and the timing of this, if you've noticed, the Republicans on Capitol Hill about NAFTA in 2017 and about tariffs in 18 were pretty quiet in their discussions with the president. They waited about six months after the midterm elections, but started -- Senator Grassley, the Finance Committee Chairman, is starting to talk about pushing back on Section 232 authority, the way you impose tariffs and our national security criteria, the beginnings of more public rumblings. Now they are about to lose it. So the timing is right when we thought the Chinese really were at the table, and then he threatened these new tariffs, now the deal really is falling apart. They are running out of time on the electoral calendar. The farmers are hurting. The retaliatory tariffs on steel and aluminum against us are so devastating to political constituencies for Republicans that I think unless he brings the Chinese back to the table, they are going to start to pushing loudly and publicly to roll back this deal on aluminum tariffs."

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": And if you read the statements from Chinese officials, they make it very clear that these things do hurt. And as bad as I think that they probably are, nobody likes tariffs, or if you like free markets, you don't like tariffs. But they are bad for China too. And I talk to farmers a lot about this. And A.B. is right, they are taking it in shorts right now. It is, across the country, it is an enormous pain for them. But at the same time, the next thing they say is that they also do want better markets. And this is what got Donald Trump elected I think more than just about anything except for immigration. This is an important issue. And if Donald Trump can come up on the other end and make China squeal and get the concessions that Trump wants and a better trading environment, those farmers are going to be very happy in the long run."

Of course, this takes place in the context of Iran really struggling under the latest round of sanctions, the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization. And now Iran is threatening to exit the Iran deal and telling Europe that they are going to start spinning the centrifuges again if Europe doesn't play. That's nuclear blackmail, and it's exactly the reason why the United States left the deal a year ago this week."

And so this is obviously there have been discussions, and they apparently, John Kerry has informed Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, about his discussions. I'm sure they are still a major irritant to the president. But right now, if you look across the board, I think the great news is that Mr. Shanahan is going to be the secretary of defense. He has been nominated to be no longer acting after five months. We're in three wars and two potential other conflicts."

There's reporting out of NBC today that there was a secret meeting at the CIA about Iran with John Bolton and General Dunford and Gina Haspel and Mike Pompeo. And we are not really sure with the White House's message that they've intentionally gotten out at his displeasure with John Bolton's stance on promises on Venezuela what the policy on Iran is right now. And I think the world is watching and are listening to these mixed signals. And the administration needs to find a way to speak with one voice and they are being accused by Democrats of provoking a war with Iran."

But he's always campaigning. And I think he always understands that Chinese and Iran, they are both wondering, OK, does this guy win reelection, or can we possibly wait him out?

And this is the problem with Joe Biden, you don't actually know what he's going to say at any given time or what trouble he's going to cause by his words. He's doing very well now in the Democratic primary. The problem is in two weeks, the past two weeks, he's delivered two statements that are going to cost some real trouble in the general election. The first one was when he said that the people who have imprisoned a million Uighurs and are waging economic and political warfare against this country, the government of China, are good people. And the second gaffe came today when he left it open that he is for possible health insurance for illegal immigrants, which I am sure would be unpopular in a general election."

There's always a bill. But the audience responded. They were clapping throughout and really engaged with her, and I think she was her at her best. But no one is hungering for a moderate. The reason they're hungering for Biden is they think he's going to win and they're terrified. So in the course of trying to keep his competition at bay and remain the front runner, he's definitely going to dip into left rabbit holes. And on immigration, the whole party is -- or the driving energy in the party is prioritizing immigrant rights in way that's totally out of step with the mainstream of the country."

And the conventional wisdom around here is that Biden is the perfect match up against Trump, but I think what we are seeing, we're being reminded. He is gaffe prone. He tries this folksy thing, but he's says a lot of stupid things.

But that World War II vet was the big winner, just days from the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Congratulations. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
