And she was dang clear that she would not vote for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 05 and, again, in 2013. And here they all are not caring apparently this time around that there's a strong evidentiary assumption happening that in fact the government did expound its limits.

The 63-year-old woman jailed for years on non-violent drug charges and I say why not. After all, if this person could become a lawyer and this person can become a lawyer and this person could become a lawyer and I say person loosely, why can't Kim. She's got more sense than all of them combined. By the way, Avenatti just got his $5 million private jet confiscated. What's that tell you that this litigating lollipop had $5 million and spent it on a private jet. The point lawyers get away with everything because they know how to get around everything. Avenatti only got caught because the media's roach motel drew him out of the nooks and crannies where he did his dirty work. CNN and MSNBC put that creep on TV a zillion times only because they thought he was just like them. Maybe they were right. Look, we should all become lawyers because if you look at life, it's basically a game of Monopoly and lawyers are the people who write the instructions and actually take a few minutes to read them without a lot agree we're just saps. So, instead of mocking Kim for bringing a little boom boom to the courtroom we should follow her lead and let her rest her case wherever she wants.

Julian Assange could soon be extradited to the United States after being arrested this morning. He'd been hold-up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for almost 7 years before being evicted. Dramatic video showing the bearded WikiLeaks founder shouting as he was being hauled away. The DOJ charging him with conspiracy to help former army intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning, hack into the Pentagon's computers to steal information. Assange's attorneys are vowing to fight the extradition and saying it's a crackdown on the free press."

      "utterance": "I can't tell you how I feel about Assange, and I don't think most of America even remembers because the last three to four years has been turned upside down. Every ideology, every side, every team sport has been somehow mixed up and changed, so I can't tell you how I feel. But I will find an argument in this. So people that are upset about this arrest are saying this is an attack on journalism, a dark day on journalism. If that is true, then you could never arrest anybody hacking into your computer or maybe even breaking into your apartment. Let's say my assistant goes into my computer and takes all of my emails, right? It doesn't matter if there's good stuff in there or bad stuff, she is stealing my property. Let's say if she ships that over to the Washington Post and they have a story about me running this amazing drug ring out of my office, not true."
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "But the point is she has broken the law. Now if you want to commit journalism and there's a risk of breaking the law, then fine. You've got to pay the price. But if somebody is taking something that belongs to you, in this case that's what the charge is, is breaking into a state department computer and stealing. If somebody comes in and is taking my emails, that is theft. Can you call theft journalism? I don't think you can. There is no reporting in theft, right? It's only a story if they find something in your emails. But that's not journalism. That is hacking. That's my theory."

And the Trump administration should be like, look at us, we figured it out, because they were the ones - - I don't know whether to additional investigation, maybe we'll find this out, but they were the ones who say this is not a first amendment claim, this is a national security threat. This was theft. And for the rest of these people -- they want all of our information to be open and free to everybody, except for they howl about internet companies and privacy. It's bizarre."

And I guess that's the new collusion, perhaps, is that it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, I think, you know, he was encouraging them. And then today, when he was here he says, WikiLeaks, I know nothing about WikiLeaks. I mean, it's so obviously wrong-headed and he's just trying to avoid any connection. But, you know, let's leave that alone. I mean, that's politics."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. I didn't want to get on. But clearly, the first step is that they had been granting him asylum by holding him in that embassy. And once he's out, then he's subject to possible extradition. And that's when -- now, the U.S. charge is very careful. It doesn't get into the argument that Greg and Dana have been going through about journalism, not journalism. It simply says you were a co-conspirator in terms of helping Chelsea Manning to hack into our defense department computers. That's clearly illegal. That's their strongest stand. And that's why I think he can be then extradited, and he's likely to lose that case, in my opinion. When you ask me, though, I mean -- you know, I got hurt by WikiLeaks because I lost my cell phone and I was awakened in Las Vegas after it was hacked and they had my cell phone and I just -- it's just very unpleasant."

Chopped liver here? But I got to say, serious news organizations, you -- well, you can be handy. You can walk in and say, hey, Juan, here's the Pentagon papers. And I'll say, well, let me see it. And I -- you know, but it's not me telling you here's how you go get -- here's how to break the law."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right, the allegation was he was trying to crack the passwords in order to infiltrate the state department system. And amazing how he was able to stay in the embassy for seven years. There must have been a lot of behind the scenes dealings between the Ecuadorians, and the British, and the U.S."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Well, no longer. And you guys -- all of you are -- your feelings, you inclination, they're totally correct. So legally think of it as a brilliant strategy, frankly, that the U.S., DOJ has undergone at this point because their burden of proof on this is so low, it's so clear, it's so simple. You are right, it has nothing to do with what was stolen or what was published or what was done. It's -- you broke into the house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "So there's no defense beyond that, that even needs to be address at this point. The U.K.-U.S. extradition treaty is such that, right now, at this point, the next step after this whole jumpy and bail thing which we know he might face up to a year in jail in the U.K., is that they will, the U.K. court, will review the indicting, the charging document. And if there is the requisite specificity that goes to their level of acceptance, then they extradite him here. So, as we know, he also faces up to just simply five years in prison. And to me, that's also is interesting. We kind of talked about this before the show that the seven years of his self-imposed exile and the wretched creature we saw being brought out of the embassy today, he was in a worse hell and worse prison anticipating all of this and worrying about it and freaking out, than --"

      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "If there is, it's usually five years. However, because he was granted asylum by Ecuador, to me it tolls the statute of limitations. And there is no way that the U.S. underwent all of this in the grand jury proceedings last year without having them know that they can rely on that to toll it, which means to pause it. So I think the first amendment arguments --"

And we, as Americans, have the right to know is the argument. But this is not about this. This is about a guy who was participating what I think was an illegal breach of American security."

I mean, to me, you know, the I.G., the inspector general at justice is apparently already looking into this. He should have simply said let's wait and see what the inspector general finds. And to Jesse's point, you know, a FISA report, even if you said we used a FISA document, that's thoroughly legal. That's part of the legal structure."

But we have been harmed, too, since then. That would have been the shift. But she felt that she couldn't say that because she didn't want to offend her host.

She chooses her words carefully as well and it's for that exact reason. Other than the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, the Republicans best political tool to use is to go against her and her comments. There are 31 Democrats that won this past year in 2018 where Trump won the district as well. So, Trump won in 2016, the Democrats squeaks out a win in 2018. They are the ones that are the targets for the Republicans to try to take back the House. And every single one of them is going to have to answer. Do you agree with Congresswoman Omar? And they're going to have to figure out a way to distance and this happens in wave elections like in 2018.

She goes like this like a robot, which is weird. She sits down, acts totally uncomfortable and insecure. The audience is dead silent. It's probably the worst booking of all time but on to what she said, she doesn't know how to read the room. She's in Congress now, she's not back in her district in Minnesota with her radical friends. She represents the United States of America. And as a member of Congress you do not act dismissively towards 9/11 and about the 9/11 hijackers. She obviously doesn't get that and that's a huge problem. And what she does is, this is her MO, she says dumb and controversial things. She gets called out for it and then she plays the victim and plays the race card. And it's not a clever act and it's getting tired and you know who is probably the most tired of it, Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi, they do well. The Democrats when they try to keep a lid on the radicalism. Omar has come in the first three months blown the whole lid off.

You know what, everybody sees that for what it is. And the New York Post that's an inflammatory cover. There are lots of news organizations that wouldn't even use that cover and haven't used it. But I think that you know even if you say it's appropriate because of her comments I would say it doesn't live up.

It reminded me of those mass discovery teams that are employed for big cases in law where just a bunch of young attorneys are like looking through documents. This one's privileged. Is this one and it's so rife with error. And then I just want to bring up two questions that it's - they're open ended. What is the duty and what is the scope? Do these people I keep saying kids do these people have a duty to report when they overhear a sexual assault. Because from what we know thus far when they brought it to the chain they didn't.

The 63-year-old woman jailed for years on non-violent drug charges and I say why not. After all, if this person could become a lawyer and this person can become a lawyer and this person could become a lawyer and I say person loosely, why can't Kim. She's got more sense than all of them combined. By the way, Avenatti just got his $5 million private jet confiscated. What's that tell you that this litigating lollipop had $5 million and spent it on a private jet. The point lawyers get away with everything because they know how to get around everything. Avenatti only got caught because the media's roach motel drew him out of the nooks and crannies where he did his dirty work. CNN and MSNBC put that creep on TV a zillion times only because they thought he was just like them. Maybe they were right. Look, we should all become lawyers because if you look at life, it's basically a game of Monopoly and lawyers are the people who write the instructions and actually take a few minutes to read them without a lot agree we're just saps. So, instead of mocking Kim for bringing a little boom boom to the courtroom we should follow her lead and let her rest her case wherever she wants.

As you said a four-year deal and you know what, let's look at the positive side. As you said Emily, she's very influential with young people who hold her up, who admire her. Clearly, she has now morphed into somebody who says I want to do more with my life. I really want to have impact on America and the criminal justice system. Go girl you've got it."
