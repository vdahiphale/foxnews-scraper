Fox 31 in Denver as the district attorney says a television station security guard accused of fatally shooting a pro-police demonstrator will be charged with second-degree murder. 30-year-old Matthew Dolloff is accused of killing 49-year-old Lee Keltner, following opposing rallies last Saturday. Fox 2 in San Francisco as Pacific Gas and Electric says it expects to restore electricity today to all homes and businesses in Northern California. Power had been cut off to reduce the risk of wildfires. And tonight, Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, says President Trump has approved his major declaration -- disaster declaration request of a wildfire damage. Earlier in the day, the administration had rejected that request.  This is a live look at Honolulu, from our affiliate KHON, sunny day in Hawaii. One of the big stories there tonight. About 8,000 people land in Hawaii on the first day of a pre-travel testing program, allowing travelers to come to the islands without quarantining. The travelers must produce a negative coronavirus test. The state-run program is an effort to stem the devastating downturn the pandemic has had on Hawaii's tourism-based economy. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.",

This as the average of recent polls nationally has Biden still holding a lead in the RCP average, and then in the battleground states you can see the lead in the various states, the key battlegrounds. Some new polls out the president is referencing, saying he's closing the gap in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania, we'll see how that all pans out. We have 18 days to go as the candidates make their closing arguments. Let's bring in our panel, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters,\" Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" All right, Kimberley, where do you see this race, and what about each candidate's closing pitch?"

And so both candidates obviously trying to capitalize with closing arguments. You have Biden pretty making the same argument he's made all along, which is coronavirus and the character of the president. I think you see the president trying a little bit harder now to make his own argument about the economic restoration, about a promise of trying to triumph over the virus, and then using things like the Barrett confirmation hearing to talk about promises kept. So we'll and see how those play out."

And I think he in some ways boxed himself in with that answer by forcing himself or suggesting that he will give some sort of an update on his position before November 3rd. That's not something he or the campaign have said before, so it's begging further questions of him in the coming weeks before November 3rd as to what his actual position is on court packing. But in general, this issue seems to be more positive for President Trump, and the fact that these hearings with Judge Amy Coney Barrett went off pretty much without a hitch is something that he can now continue to emphasize in these coming weeks."

And the question is, if we are talking about the politics of all of this, the question is, if you put a third Supreme Court justice on the bench before the election, how does that play out for the various Senate races where they no longer have to say you need me there to vote to confirm, and it takes one of these major persuasive things for President Trump, who in 2016, that was one of the main things that got them across the finish line was the promise of putting new justices on the bench. If he gets three on, it kind of gives some people permission saying, OK, we got what we wanted out of this. But it's a clear win for the administration on the merits."

And that's because if you look at the polls right now, everybody is suggesting that this is in the bag for Biden, and I am saying, as we just talked about, as you get closer, these are going to be the days that matter. More likely you are already seeing polls start to tighten, and in the states that matter. So this is a race, and I think it's entirely up in the air."

But I think Donald Trump has essentially a one in four, one in five chance of pulling it out at this point. I don't think it's all that similar to 2016 for a host of reasons, and so I'm putting $80 on Biden and $20 on Trump."

Vice President Biden was campaigning there today and included a shout out for Senator Gary Peters, who has been leading in that race, but Republican John James has been gaining on him according to recent polls. So if the Republican were able to win over that seat, that would help keep the control of the Senate in the Republican hands."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",

I remember three or four weeks ago, all the headlines were about just how bad it was for every Republican candidate, so bad that they were worried about Texas and Kentucky, Mitch McConnell and the Lindsey Graham. But what you're seeing in these final weeks is because of some good issues Republicans have, and had in particular the Supreme Court hearing, which Mr. Graham has really capitalized on, you see some Republican on the fence and voters coming home, and you see those polls tightening to the extent that some of the races now seem to be pretty much in hand for Republicans."

I will admit one of the reasons why I'm looking at this is because I'm lazy and like to go to bed early, and on election night, I think this is a real bellwether to tell whether the Republicans are going to hold onto the Senate. Right now it's a toss-up with Perdue a one point advantage, basically a statistical tie. Jon Ossoff is very much a very woke liberal Democrat, and if he actually topples Perdue, that is a bad sign for the Republicans overall in a state like Georgia."

She gave the most eloquent appraisal and recommendation of Amy Coney Barrett this week. It was something to watch. My loser is Nancy Pelosi and her meltdown with Wolf Blitzer this week, an indication of how Democrats too often react when they are asked simple questions."

On the loser side, I'm sad to say this because he's a very nice guy, but Steve Scully of C-SPAN, I don't think we've seen a more unforced error in Washington politics in a long time where he claimed he was hacked and he wasn't, and it's sad to see the hit to a guy who is very well respected around here."
