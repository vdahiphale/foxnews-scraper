The president didn't say everything they want the way they want it said about Charlottesville. They are twisting, they are distorting, they are taking the president's words out of context. And tonight, we're going to do something they don't do. We will lay out all the facts and tell you the truth about what is really going on in a very divided America tonight. And that's tonight's 'Opening Monologue.'  What the destroy Trump media is now doing is beyond malpractice. The destroy Trump media has now worked themselves into a frenzy over the president's comments about the chaos in Charlottesville. Here's what the president said yesterday. Take a look.",

Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible. And it was a horrible thing to watch.  But there is another side. There was a group on this side. You can call them the left. You've just called them the left that came violently attacking the other group.

But he also laid out some of the facts about what happened. Here are the facts nobody wants to tell you.   Here's the video from Saturday. Everybody agrees these white supremacists -- you know what? They evoke a natural rage in people. And the people who provoked everything were them, the white supremacists. They are without question the most responsible in things that happened here. And every decent, good American should unequivocally oppose everything they stand for. But there is violence, what the president said is true, that came from both sides. That is clear from the video that you're watching. What seemed to set the media off yesterday is that the president said there was violence on both sides. Whether we like it or not, this is an important point. The First Amendment does protect even hate speech. It's why even the ACLU defended these white supremacists and their right to say what they want to say, whether or not we like it or not.   You are not allowed in America under the rule of law to get into fist fights, to punch people, engage in fighting because you don't like what they say. Despite those facts, the media is living in an alternative universe. Why? Because all they want to do is destroy the president. Watch this insanity.",

Here something the media won't tell you. Republicans have been the party of Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation. Democrats? What have they been? The party of segregation, the Southern Manifesto.  Remember back in 1956, it was Democrats who introduced what was known as that Southern Manifesto. That's a document to resist the Supreme Court decision, Brown vs. the Board of Education and the ruling in segregation in schools. Let's see. People like Bill Clinton's mentor, who he praised many times, J. William Fulbright, well, who's been praised throughout his entire career, signed it. It was overwhelmingly signed by Democratic members of Congress in 1956. According to Politico, only two Republicans supported that. Then we go back to the 1960s, passage of the Civil Rights Act in '64, the Voting Rights Act in '65. Same Southern Democrats that tried to stop these historic pieces of legislation from being passed, including filibustering the Civil Rights Act for months! And then there's the actual vote tallies. Let's take a look at the no votes for the Civil Rights Act of '64. 112 Democrats in Congress voted against it. 41 Republicans. And then for the 1965 Voting Rights Act, 78 Democrats in Congress voted against it, 25 Republicans voted no. So I don't understand. The Democrats, the media, that's their history. And some people in the Democratic Party today praised those people that were involved in that history. Here's another fact the media is ignoring. George Wallace, one of the most racist pro-segregationists in history, Democrat for most of his political career. Then there's Democratic senator, remember the former Klansman? Wasn't in charge that -- really that long ago, Robert Byrd. He filibustered the Civil Rights Act for over 14 hours before voting against it. And other well-known Democrats, you know, to vote no, well, let's see, that's Bill Clinton's mentor, J. William Fulbright, and even Al Gore's father, Al Gore, Senior.  Once again, you would think Democrats would denounce and force those type of people out of their party. But instead, Democrats did the complete opposite, especially when it comes to Robert Byrd, former Klansman. Hillary Clinton -- we've got the tape -- praising him as her mentor after he died!

      "sentences": "Pretty shocking, former Klansman -- would you call someone who says that your mentor like Hillary? This just highlights the Democrats' massive double standard when it comes to race in America, the divide that they are contributing to. They have made race a political wedge issue in this country for decades, and they have used it, sadly, to rip this country apart. Last night, we showed you how President Obama -- remember? He rushed to judgment, raced to conclusions before any evidence, any facts came out, any the testimony came out in four particular high-profile race cases, rush to judgment. President Obama made it a point to associate himself with groups like Black Lives Matter that chant things like, What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now. Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon. President Obama even invited Black Lives Matter to his White House and praised a Black Lives Matter leader, DeRay Mckesson, while completely excusing his anti-police remarks. Just take a look at a couple of McKesson's tweets. Quote, 'This feared for my life language is perhaps the new execution motto of America's largest gang, the police.' Should someone who spews that hatred really have been invited to Obama's White House? Where was the media's outrage then, let alone he was praised by the president at the time, President Obama.  Then there's the issue of leftists destroying public property and tearing down monuments like what we saw happen in Durham, North Carolina, this week. The left -- they're up in arms over President Trump asking where America should draw a line when it comes to removing these monuments. Well, now, look, people can agree with what they think these statues represent. They have honest disagreement. They don't have a right to destroy property. They don't have a right to be violent because they disagree with what they stand for. We have a political process for that. And as the president said, let local municipalities decide. If the left is so upset over Confederate monuments, then maybe they should feel the same way about displays that honor racist Democrats, the ones we just told you about. Take a look at this statue, Robert Byrd, the former Klansman in the West Virginia state capitol. The Democrats now think it needs to be taken down? According to a local West Virginia website, there are at least 56 buildings, bridges, highways, centers and other places that are named after Robert Byrd. Do they need to be renamed? Do they need to be taken out? There are also highways, statues, other things that are dedicated to people like Al Gore, Senior, J. William Fulbright, George Wallace! If the left, members of the media -- they're going to lose their collective minds over the latest attack against President Trump, I think it's important to remember this in many ways is selective moral outrage. And more importantly, at the end of the day, a huge distraction. This last election was about the forgotten men and women of this country, people on poverty, people on food stamps and people that cannot find a job! As all these fights go on and all the undermining of the president continues, none of those people are being helped. That is a huge, huge shame for the American people.

And tonight, we're going to do something they don't do. We will lay out all the facts and tell you the truth about what is really going on in a very divided America tonight. And that's tonight's 'Opening Monologue.' What the destroy Trump media is now doing is beyond malpractice.

But there is another side. There was a group on this side. You can call them the left. You've just called them the left that came violently attacking the other group.

They evoke a natural rage in people. And the people who provoked everything were them, the white supremacists. They are without question the most responsible in things that happened here. And every decent, good American should unequivocally oppose everything they stand for. But there is violence, what the president said is true, that came from both sides. That is clear from the video that you're watching. What seemed to set the media off yesterday is that the president said there was violence on both sides. Whether we like it or not, this is an important point. The First Amendment does protect even hate speech. It's why even the ACLU defended these white supremacists and their right to say what they want to say, whether or not we like it or not. You are not allowed in America under the rule of law to get into fist fights, to punch people, engage in fighting because you don't like what they say. Despite those facts, the media is living in an alternative universe. Why? Because all they want to do is destroy the president. Watch this insanity."

      "utterance": "This happens, we can predict, every two to four years, disgusting, offensive. But it compels -- it pales in comparison to what the Democrats have tolerated in their own party. Here something the media won't tell you. Republicans have been the party of Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation. Democrats? What have they been? The party of segregation, the Southern Manifesto. Remember back in 1956, it was Democrats who introduced what was known as that Southern Manifesto. That's a document to resist the Supreme Court decision, Brown vs. the Board of Education and the ruling in segregation in schools. Let's see. People like Bill Clinton's mentor, who he praised many times, J. William Fulbright, well, who's been praised throughout his entire career, signed it. It was overwhelmingly signed by Democratic members of Congress in 1956. According to Politico, only two Republicans supported that. Then we go back to the 1960s, passage of the Civil Rights Act in '64, the Voting Rights Act in '65. Same Southern Democrats that tried to stop these historic pieces of legislation from being passed, including filibustering the Civil Rights Act for months! And then there's the actual vote tallies. Let's take a look at the no votes for the Civil Rights Act of '64. 112 Democrats in Congress voted against it. 41 Republicans. And then for the 1965 Voting Rights Act, 78 Democrats in Congress voted against it, 25 Republicans voted no. So I don't understand. The Democrats, the media, that's their history. And some people in the Democratic Party today praised those people that were involved in that history. Here's another fact the media is ignoring. George Wallace, one of the most racist pro-segregationists in history, Democrat for most of his political career. Then there's Democratic senator, remember the former Klansman? Wasn't in charge that -- really that long ago, Robert Byrd. He filibustered the Civil Rights Act for over 14 hours before voting against it. And other well-known Democrats, you know, to vote no, well, let's see, that's Bill Clinton's mentor, J. William Fulbright, and even Al Gore's father, Al Gore, Senior. Once again, you would think Democrats would denounce and force those type of people out of their party. But instead, Democrats did the complete opposite, especially when it comes to Robert Byrd, former Klansman. Hillary Clinton -- we've got the tape -- praising him as her mentor after he died! Take a look."

      "utterance": "Pretty shocking, former Klansman -- would you call someone who says that your mentor like Hillary? This just highlights the Democrats' massive double standard when it comes to race in America, the divide that they are contributing to. They have made race a political wedge issue in this country for decades, and they have used it, sadly, to rip this country apart. Last night, we showed you how President Obama -- remember? He rushed to judgment, raced to conclusions before any evidence, any facts came out, any the testimony came out in four particular high-profile race cases, rush to judgment. President Obama made it a point to associate himself with groups like Black Lives Matter that chant things like, What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now. Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon. President Obama even invited Black Lives Matter to his White House and praised a Black Lives Matter leader, DeRay Mckesson, while completely excusing his anti-police remarks. Just take a look at a couple of McKesson's tweets. Quote, 'This feared for my life language is perhaps the new execution motto of America's largest gang, the police.' Should someone who spews that hatred really have been invited to Obama's White House? Where was the media's outrage then, let alone he was praised by the president at the time, President Obama. Then there's the issue of leftists destroying public property and tearing down monuments like what we saw happen in Durham, North Carolina, this week. The left -- they're up in arms over President Trump asking where America should draw a line when it comes to removing these monuments. Well, now, look, people can agree with what they think these statues represent. They have honest disagreement. They don't have a right to destroy property. They don't have a right to be violent because they disagree with what they stand for. We have a political process for that. And as the president said, let local municipalities decide. If the left is so upset over Confederate monuments, then maybe they should feel the same way about displays that honor racist Democrats, the ones we just told you about. Take a look at this statue, Robert Byrd, the former Klansman in the West Virginia state capitol. The Democrats now think it needs to be taken down? According to a local West Virginia website, there are at least 56 buildings, bridges, highways, centers and other places that are named after Robert Byrd. Do they need to be renamed? Do they need to be taken out? There are also highways, statues, other things that are dedicated to people like Al Gore, Senior, J. William Fulbright, George Wallace! If the left, members of the media -- they're going to lose their collective minds over the latest attack against President Trump, I think it's important to remember this in many ways is selective moral outrage. And more importantly, at the end of the day, a huge distraction. This last election was about the forgotten men and women of this country, people on poverty, people on food stamps and people that cannot find a job! As all these fights go on and all the undermining of the president continues, none of those people are being helped. That is a huge, huge shame for the American people.

Then the Romans, the Greeks, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson as the president and you both referenced. I think it's very, very dangerous when you start trying to bring historical figures and monuments and mementos up to contemporary political standards. It's very dangerous, very much susceptible to political correctness. But that is a separate issue from the failure to denounce neo-Nazis. Those are two different issues.

The major story here is whether racism remains a major problem in America and whether or not Charlottesville represents that. David Duke ran for governor of Louisiana in 1991, was shunned by the local Republicans. They supported his opponent, a Democrat and a crook. The RNC refused to give him any support. George Herbert Walker Bush, the president, referred to David Duke as a holocaust denier and a racist. Duke goes on to lose the race by a million votes, then a record, I think it's still a record. He runs for office four more times, Sean, loses every time, goes to jail for bank fraud and tax evasion, and who are we talking about? David Duke? If it weren't for cable TV digging him up every two years or four years he'd be working road construction in Kalamazoo under an assumed name. The real story right now is the fact that in Charlottesville, a black man, a police chief, one of the CEOs who resigned from the president's commission is a black man, CEO of Merck, and a black man named Larry Elder has a nationally syndicated radio show talking to you about it, and Obama, and Trump's predecessor for eight years was a black man named Barack Obama.
