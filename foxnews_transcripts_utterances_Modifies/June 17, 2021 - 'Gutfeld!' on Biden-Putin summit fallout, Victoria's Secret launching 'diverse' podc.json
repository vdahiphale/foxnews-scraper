This is now the second request by the same suitor, and still no way to contact him. If you don't want to contact me directly, then have your parole officer D.M. me. But it's good to know I lead late night talk show hosts in marriage proposals from anonymous men at baseball games. It's like my mother used to say, you don't attract bees with vinegar. So there was no excuse for feeding as bees and vinegar. It's kind of like the summit between our president and Vlad Putin. Or Vlad. How's that for a transition?  Caitlyn Jenner is like, nice.

Joe making it through the whole trip without breaking his hip on a staircase is something we can all be proud of. But this is the same reset routine that impresses no one but a fan-girling media.   It's fun for them, they get to fly to Geneva, mix Ambien with vodka on the plane and wake up at a time zone with their pants on their heads. Shout out to Acosta. Let's talk about the dumbest thing a president has ever done since FDR tried to jump the White House pool. Yesterday, Joe Biden told us what he said to Putin about cyberattacks. It's amazing.",

He tells Putin what's off limits for attack. Does that suggest that everything not on that list are on limits? Putin has the perfect defense if he wants to hack SpaceX. All right. Sorry, it wasn't on the list. Now I went through this list because like Miley Cyrus has asked, it's available for everyone to see. It's on the CISA Web site. So we can all reference it. And there's a lot there that Joe didn't put in there like say Fox News, or my duplex in Damascus. But don't we all see how weird this is to give your adversary boundaries? Like he's your dominatrix? Spank me but no tickling? It's like a mobster who's about to be whacked but asked his killers. No, please not in the face, which guarantees himself a closed casket.  Asking bullies nicely doesn't even work against Chrissy Teigen. If Joe were any more naive, he'd be sending a plane full of cash to Iran. I wonder how the angry white male sees this.",

Robbers, if you think of breaking in please do not target the safe behind the painting in the living room, or the wife's diamonds in the bedroom dresser. And most important, do not check the red container in the basement. That's where we keep Walt Disney's head. Biden's list is as effective as a drug use is prohibited sign at Charlie Sheen's house.  How can you be so clueless to give a world leader a list of our vulnerabilities? Put is the president of Russia. He's not your shrink. Now I get it. The list is generic and obvious. So is Applebee's menu but I'm still going to try a few things. There's this mention of dams. Who knew you could hack a dam? But now we all do. Thanks, Joe. And you thought of making this list in the first place? Could you imagine the brainstorming meeting?   Hey, the boss asked us to come up with demands for Putin. Well, I got an idea. They've been launching cyberattacks. Why don't we give them a list of stuff not to cyberattack? That should solve the problem. Yes, great idea, Pat. And here we thought hires for the sake of diversity were worthless. And what did they expect Putin's response? Oh, thank you so much. This is a much better gift than that stupid reset button. I'm going to have to rethink our plan to attack these places. The Biden staff think this would start a negotiation. Prison Putin. Here are the 16 places we'd like you not to target. Oh, thank you, President Biden. We'll back off on the post office. They seem capable of in competence on their own. But we'd still like to target the energy sector, the chemical and critical manufacturing. Well, OK, Mr. Putin. That's progress. So we've gone from Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall to please Mr. Putin, don't attack this firewall. Look, I'm no presidential historian. I collect toes from drifters. But -- I don't know if I should have confessed that but we know Biden's weak in Putin's not. We also know that Putin is blessed with always being in charge while we change leaders every four to eight years. He's Bill Belichick and we are the New York Jets changing head coaches constantly.  See? I know baseball, Kat. So it's always us who has to deal with him and he gets to sit back and grin at the new guy. And he's correctly thinking why buy the cow if you can get the pipeline for free? So why make it so easy, you can clap for blood. Biden comes off as human resources telling Putin the boss to stop flirting openly with China. All the while our media swoons over Biden, it makes me wonder how is CNN covering the summit outcome.",

A scientist who recently published a letter along with 18 others calling for a closer look into the COVID lab leak theory is now admitting why she and some colleagues didn't speak out sooner. Trump. Meet Alina Chon she's a -- or Chan. She's a genetic engineer who works at MIT and Harvard, which means unlike Jimmy, she can read. She tells NBC news that she and her colleagues fear discussing the leveling theory thinking that words would be labeled racist. She was more concerned with a potential bogus accusation then, that admitting lacking integrity now. But now they can speak out because they no longer risk aligning with Trump, said Chan. At the time it was scarier to be associated with Trump and to become a tool for racist. So people didn't want to publicly call for investigation into lab origins. So there you have it, the science changes based on who the media thinks is a racist. Now, when you hear scientists changing tune from a no way on the lab league theory to yes, maybe including guys like Fauci just know it's not scientific. It's purely political, and always has been. Science has become as a political as the phrase men can give birth. So in other words, if Trump were still president, they'd still be biting their lip pretending to search the planet for a guilty looking pangolin. But I guess it's nice of them to finally admit it a year later in too late. But it's like my 95-year-old uncle used to say, better late than never, he just got it Grindr. Very excited. Very excited, Robby. So, another example of how media narratives are so destructive because media narratives can make the population thinks something is false.

I hope he doesn't think I'm going to live there. A stranger pleads for my hand in matrimony. But by the looks of him, he just might want the hand and nothing else. This is now the second request by the same suitor, and still no way to contact him. If you don't want to contact me directly, then have your parole officer D.M. me. But it's good to know I lead late night talk show hosts in marriage proposals from anonymous men at baseball games. It's like my mother used to say, you don't attract bees with vinegar. So there was no excuse for feeding as bees and vinegar. It's kind of like the summit between our president and Vlad Putin. Or Vlad. How's that for a transition? Caitlyn Jenner is like, nice.

Joe making it through the whole trip without breaking his hip on a staircase is something we can all be proud of. But this is the same reset routine that impresses no one but a fan-girling media. It's fun for them, they get to fly to Geneva, mix Ambien with vodka on the plane and wake up at a time zone with their pants on their heads. Shout out to Acosta. Let's talk about the dumbest thing a president has ever done since FDR tried to jump the White House pool. Yesterday, Joe Biden told us what he said to Putin about cyberattacks. It's amazing."

He tells Putin what's off limits for attack. Does that suggest that everything not on that list are on limits? Putin has the perfect defense if he wants to hack SpaceX. All right. Sorry, it wasn't on the list. Now I went through this list because like Miley Cyrus has asked, it's available for everyone to see. It's on the CISA Web site. So we can all reference it. And there's a lot there that Joe didn't put in there like say Fox News, or my duplex in Damascus. But don't we all see how weird this is to give your adversary boundaries? Like he's your dominatrix? Spank me but no tickling? It's like a mobster who's about to be whacked but asked his killers. No, please not in the face, which guarantees himself a closed casket. Asking bullies nicely doesn't even work against Chrissy Teigen. If Joe were any more naive, he'd be sending a plane full of cash to Iran. I wonder how the angry white male sees this."

How can you be so clueless to give a world leader a list of our vulnerabilities? Put is the president of Russia. He's not your shrink. Now I get it. The list is generic and obvious. So is Applebee's menu but I'm still going to try a few things. There's this mention of dams. Who knew you could hack a dam? But now we all do. Thanks, Joe. And you thought of making this list in the first place? Could you imagine the brainstorming meeting? Hey, the boss asked us to come up with demands for Putin. Well, I got an idea. They've been launching cyberattacks. Why don't we give them a list of stuff not to cyberattack? That should solve the problem. Yes, great idea, Pat. And here we thought hires for the sake of diversity were worthless. And what did they expect Putin's response? Oh, thank you so much. This is a much better gift than that stupid reset button. I'm going to have to rethink our plan to attack these places. The Biden staff think this would start a negotiation. Prison Putin. Here are the 16 places we'd like you not to target. Oh, thank you, President Biden. We'll back off on the post office. They seem capable of in competence on their own. But we'd still like to target the energy sector, the chemical and critical manufacturing. Well, OK, Mr. Putin. That's progress. So we've gone from Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall to please Mr. Putin, don't attack this firewall. Look, I'm no presidential historian. I collect toes from drifters. But -- I don't know if I should have confessed that but we know Biden's weak in Putin's not. We also know that Putin is blessed with always being in charge while we change leaders every four to eight years. He's Bill Belichick and we are the New York Jets changing head coaches constantly. See? I know baseball, Kat. So it's always us who has to deal with him and he gets to sit back and grin at the new guy. And he's correctly thinking why buy the cow if you can get the pipeline for free? So why make it so easy, you can clap for blood. Biden comes off as human resources telling Putin the boss to stop flirting openly with China. All the while our media swoons over Biden, it makes me wonder how is CNN covering the summit outcome."

A scientist who recently published a letter along with 18 others calling for a closer look into the COVID lab leak theory is now admitting why she and some colleagues didn't speak out sooner. Trump. Meet Alina Chon she's a -- or Chan. She's a genetic engineer who works at MIT and Harvard, which means unlike Jimmy, she can read. She tells NBC news that she and her colleagues fear discussing the leveling theory thinking that words would be labeled racist. She was more concerned with a potential bogus accusation then, that admitting lacking integrity now. But now they can speak out because they no longer risk aligning with Trump, said Chan. At the time it was scarier to be associated with Trump and to become a tool for racist. So people didn't want to publicly call for investigation into lab origins. So there you have it, the science changes based on who the media thinks is a racist. Now, when you hear scientists changing tune from a no way on the lab league theory to yes, maybe including guys like Fauci just know it's not scientific. It's purely political, and always has been. Science has become as a political as the phrase men can give birth. So in other words, if Trump were still president, they'd still be biting their lip pretending to search the planet for a guilty looking pangolin. But I guess it's nice of them to finally admit it a year later in too late. But it's like my 95-year-old uncle used to say, better late than never, he just got it Grindr. Very excited. Very excited, Robby. So, another example of how media narratives are so destructive because media narratives can make the population thinks something is false.

Turns out Victoria's Secret was being afraid of the far left. The spokeswoman will include Indian actress, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, married to a Jonas Brother?

When the Brand Chief Executive Martin waters was asked about the brand's angels returning, he said simply, right now I don't see it as being culturally relevant, then he ran away and hid under a rock. So, to recap, this is what Victoria's Secret used to be. And this is how it's going to be from now on. It's true. And I'm talking about the sabbatic nature of it.

The tacks were found on the very laptop the media told you didn't exist. And they read like the screenplay for \"Django Unchained,\" which I never saw so I don't even get the joke. And speaking of things getting exposed, Jeffrey Toobin was out partying with CNN's -- with his CNN colleagues this week at a party for Brian Stelter's new book. The title of the book, \"Please Don't Talk about My Ratings.\" Is there any party worse than a Stelter party? I'd say the Donner Party but at least they had better hors d'oeuvres. Oh, wow, too soon? Jesus, that happened like 100 years ago. Cannibalism is fun. Many of -- I condemn cannibalism. Many of CNN anchors were at the party, which raises the question did their viewer notice? Singular, you get that? Toobin himself told Politico, \"It's in the past. People have moved on.\" It sounds like somebody cleared their browser history. But if reputation mattered at CNN, Chris Cuomo would be sent home faster than a kid with head lice. But it's like my dad always said, when we found that thirsty last hitchhiker.

According to the Military Times, my second favorite times after medieval, the number one concern among new military recruits, when's the best time to go number two? I would have said number three. Apparently, tons of recruits have hit social media and message boards to ask about the bathroom situation and basic training. It's signing up to be Marines is like taking a job at Walgreens. One of the most common pieces, pieces of advice go after dark. (INAUDIBLE) one responded, \"Poop at night. It's most peaceful then technically you can always ask to go to the head if you absolutely can't hold it. Usually, you'll get effed with but they'll still let you go.\" Talk about being relieved of your duty. All right, we have to be quick on this. I totally get this. I'm probably older than everybody here, Robby. But I when I had that registered for the draft, this was my big fear. It wasn't about being killed, captured, or shot, I was worrying about how to poop or pee in a disturbing setting."
