It is 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We begin tonight with news that is sending shockwaves throughout the political world. Steve Bannon, a lightning rod for critics of the Trump administration, is leaving his post as the president's chief strategist. Mr. Bannon spoke to the Weekly Standard today about his departure saying, quote, \"The Trump presidency that we fought for and won is over. We still have a huge movement and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It will be something else. And there will be all kinds of fights and there will be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.\" Some really strong words there from Mr. Bannon.  Chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins us now at the inside story. John?",

      "sentences": "Jesse, good evening to you. There are some thought among people like Steve Bannon and others, a lot of his acolytes, the Democrats are now in control of what the president here is here at the White House. As for Steve Bannon himself, he's back at work today at Breitbart. Employees there tweeting out that he has returned to his position as the executive chairman. Even cheering the afternoon editorial meeting today.  There's also word that Bannon plans to go on the warpath against opponents of President Trump, in Congress, in the media and in corporate America. And against what Bannon refers to as globalists within the White House. That would be people like Gary Cohn who is very critical of an American prospect article earlier this week. Jared Kushner, H.R. McMaster, and Steven Mnuchin. In some ways, Bannon is now unchanged from the constraints of the White House that sort of had him pinned down. And now he is free to go out and do whatever he wants. Now, what's the reason why Bannon is gone? You've seen that cover of the \"Time\" magazine article from back to spring. The president was upset. That it looked like Bannon was the real power behind the throne here at the White House.  There was also the book, \"Devil's Bargain\" in which Bannon was portrayed as the rocket that President Trump road all the way to the presidency. There was some talk back in July that Bannon may be leaving at the same time White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus was. But I am told by sources who are in the know here at the White House that Bannon tenured his resignation to the president on August the 7th. Sources closed to Bannon say, the deal was that his resignation and departure from the White House was going to be announced at the beginning of this week but that all of the events in relation to Charlottesville and the aftermath of that Jesse pushed that timetable back some. What's murky in all of this is what role John Kelly played because it looked Bannon had already given tendered his resignation but then we're told that John Kelly was evaluating his position here at the White House.  Kelly I think was the one who ultimately made the decision. You saw that statement from the White House saying, that the chief-of-staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon together agreed that today would be Bannon's last day. With also a little bit murky or foggy if you will is what role of this article the American prospect played in Bannon's departure. A lot of people here at the White House were very upset by it.   You can't contradict the president on items like North Korea. You can't say the things you did about some of the people closest to the president like Gary Cohn, without having repercussions but then Bannon for all intents and purposes was already out because as we were told, he tendered his resignation. So, it may have been Jesse just kind of a massive exit interview where Steve Bannon got the air all his grievances. Particularly his concerns about trade in China in a forum where he was sure that a lot of Democratic working people might see it -- Jesse.",

Some of the traditional political Republican people. And now, he's gotten rid of Steve Bannon who is more of the ideological populist nationalists type of person. He has surrounded himself by generals, his family, and some moderate Wall Street people. It is that how you see it?",

It's so irrational that it is likely wrong. So, the White House lost a chief strategist but the good news is, cable news has gained a new talk show host. The question is, where is he going to go?

Obviously, Steve Bannon saw what having an off the record conversation with a journalist can do. It gets you relieved of your post. Some said that, you know, Bannon didn't necessarily want to quit, he wanted to be fired. It's better I think for his personal narrative. But what we have seen from Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus and even Anthony Scaramucci when they left the White House, was, you know, these very cordial postmortem interviews. Where they said glowing things about the president, they talked about serving the country and Bannon is like -- he's finally someone who is spilling the beans. And he said this presidency is over. So, number one, he's willing to talk. He knows he has an outlet. He didn't have to give that conversation which he knew was on the record. That means that he's got a lot more vitriol, a lot more ammunition. And now he's certainly got the platforms.",

You know, a strong message to sort of working-class Democrats, that he stands with them and that he was all about fighting against the Chinese.  Some people go inside the White House and they saw him as far too friendly to Russia and Putin and encouraging that aspect. But I think the inside fight here is what catches my attention. So, you have people like Bannon who was aligned with say, Reince Priebus, and the whole nationalistic -- we were in the campaign, we knew how to push the right buttons on immigration, even race and all of the like. Now, those people have been, it seems to me, total eclipsed. You know what?  Because now you see Jared Kushner right there. Right? With Ivanka.

It is 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We begin tonight with news that is sending shockwaves throughout the political world. Steve Bannon, a lightning rod for critics of the Trump administration, is leaving his post as the president's chief strategist. Mr. Bannon spoke to the Weekly Standard today about his departure saying, quote, \"The Trump presidency that we fought for and won is over. We still have a huge movement and we will make something of this Trump presidency. But that presidency is over. It will be something else. And there will be all kinds of fights and there will be good days and bad days, but that presidency is over.\" Some really strong words there from Mr. Bannon. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts joins us now at the inside story. John?"

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Jesse, good evening to you. There are some thought among people like Steve Bannon and others, a lot of his acolytes, the Democrats are now in control of what the president here is here at the White House. As for Steve Bannon himself, he's back at work today at Breitbart. Employees there tweeting out that he has returned to his position as the executive chairman. Even cheering the afternoon editorial meeting today. There's also word that Bannon plans to go on the warpath against opponents of President Trump, in Congress, in the media and in corporate America. And against what Bannon refers to as globalists within the White House. That would be people like Gary Cohn who is very critical of an American prospect article earlier this week. Jared Kushner, H.R. McMaster, and Steven Mnuchin. In some ways, Bannon is now unchanged from the constraints of the White House that sort of had him pinned down. And now he is free to go out and do whatever he wants. Now, what's the reason why Bannon is gone? You've seen that cover of the \"Time\" magazine article from back to spring. The president was upset. That it looked like Bannon was the real power behind the throne here at the White House. There was also the book, \"Devil's Bargain\" in which Bannon was portrayed as the rocket that President Trump road all the way to the presidency. There was some talk back in July that Bannon may be leaving at the same time White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus was. But I am told by sources who are in the know here at the White House that Bannon tenured his resignation to the president on August the 7th. Sources closed to Bannon say, the deal was that his resignation and departure from the White House was going to be announced at the beginning of this week but that all of the events in relation to Charlottesville and the aftermath of that Jesse pushed that timetable back some. What's murky in all of this is what role John Kelly played because it looked Bannon had already given tendered his resignation but then we're told that John Kelly was evaluating his position here at the White House. Kelly I think was the one who ultimately made the decision. You saw that statement from the White House saying, that the chief-of-staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon together agreed that today would be Bannon's last day. With also a little bit murky or foggy if you will is what role of this article the American prospect played in Bannon's departure. A lot of people here at the White House were very upset by it. You can't contradict the president on items like North Korea. You can't say the things you did about some of the people closest to the president like Gary Cohn, without having repercussions but then Bannon for all intents and purposes was already out because as we were told, he tendered his resignation. So, it may have been Jesse just kind of a massive exit interview where Steve Bannon got the air all his grievances. Particularly his concerns about trade in China in a forum where he was sure that a lot of Democratic working people might see it -- Jesse."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right. John, thank you very much. So, Gutfeld, I think the understanding is now that the president has gotten rid of Reince Priebus and Sean Spicer. Some of the traditional political Republican people. And now, he's gotten rid of Steve Bannon who is more of the ideological populist nationalists type of person. He has surrounded himself by generals, his family, and some moderate Wall Street people. It is that how you see it?"

I'm always wary of the thought mob. And you know, thought mob is when everybody saying exactly the same thing. And it strikes me, the way that he was painted for six or seven months. It's so irrational that it is likely wrong. So, the White House lost a chief strategist but the good news is, cable news has gained a new talk show host. The question is, where is he going to go? It could be Bannon and The Mooch. It could be morning drive time. I don't know."

    {
      "speaker": "LISA KENNEDY, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes. But I also think he might also push the President. There are a couple of things here that are really interesting. Obviously, Steve Bannon saw what having an off the record conversation with a journalist can do. It gets you relieved of your post. Some said that, you know, Bannon didn't necessarily want to quit, he wanted to be fired. It's better I think for his personal narrative. But what we have seen from Sean Spicer and Reince Priebus and even Anthony Scaramucci when they left the White House, was, you know, these very cordial postmortem interviews. Where they said glowing things about the president, they talked about serving the country and Bannon is like -- he's finally someone who is spilling the beans. And he said this presidency is over. So, number one, he's willing to talk. He knows he has an outlet. He didn't have to give that conversation which he knew was on the record. That means that he's got a lot more vitriol, a lot more ammunition. And now he's certainly got the platforms."

He wanted to talk to a Democrat. Right? He got out there, something you touched on is. You know, a strong message to sort of working-class Democrats, that he stands with them and that he was all about fighting against the Chinese. Some people go inside the White House and they saw him as far too friendly to Russia and Putin and encouraging that aspect. But I think the inside fight here is what catches my attention. So, you have people like Bannon who was aligned with say, Reince Priebus, and the whole nationalistic -- we were in the campaign, we knew how to push the right buttons on immigration, even race and all of the like. Now, those people have been, it seems to me, total eclipsed. You know what? Because now you see Jared Kushner right there. Right? With Ivanka. And they are much more align with people like Dina Powell, right? And Gary Cohn, the whole Goldman Sachs, Wall Street crowd. I don't know why you call them moderate.

It's likely not going to be. President Trump is going to be President Trump. That said, it is an eye-opener. I think people saw it coming. The word was that he was on his way out and that the administration, the president had made that the decision with General Kelly's kind of guidance a couple of weeks ago. Bannon is telling people that he offered his resignation August 7th. And that today was going to be the last day. It is a change. But it doesn't take away, one, the uniqueness of this president or two, the firepower of Steve Bannon, who now in his words, has a lot more weapons in his old job as the executive of Breitbart News."

And then you see everything else that has transpired, this was not a stellar week for this president. As far as number one, getting Capitol Hill engaged on his agenda come the fall.

And I think he's a lot more political minded about the future and laying things out as far as an agenda then people may have given him credit for. Remember he was a legislative liaison to two defense secretaries. Leon Panetta and Bob Gates, he knows his way around Washington. And I think he has a lot more political savvy in that role than people may know.

He's not going to change because Steve Bannon is there or not. There is reporting tonight that Bannon met with Bob Mercer, the Hedge Fund billionaire this week, and so did President Trump -- we haven't independently confirmed that but multiple places are confirming that.

The interview that Bannon gave to the Weekly Standard in which he said, this presidency, eight months and, it's over. So, for people like you're watching and thinking, what's going on here -- is that real, do you think that that's a signal about potentially coming from the right-wing media towards the president, because of Bannon's dismissal?

I think more significantly, Juan, is the quote that you mentioned at Weekly Standard, that Steve Bannon gave the Weekly Standard tonight in which he says that that presidency, the presidency that we fought for and won is over. Essentially saying that he is going to battle not President Trump, he's going to help President Trump in his mind perhaps who President Trump is and what he wants to get done. But he's going to battle the forces that are trying to turn President Trump into a more traditional establishment figure. And some of those forces are inside the Trump White House. You know, as you say, Steve Bannon, you know, talking about in the American prospect interview with Gary Cohn, and Steven Mnuchin, Dina Powell, these are forces inside the Trump administration."

What he is worried about her but think he is right about, that others will show up and cause violence. What he is contributing to is the elimination about his ability to congregate and ability to have conversations -- every time you eliminate that step between emotions and violence, you end up with violence. You need people to be able to relieve tension and discuss things and meet and talk about things, even if their ideas are repugnant to you, if you can't stand their ideas. The fact is, the more you push stuff down, you find these and other countries, the more you cut out a certain religion -- the more radical that religion becomes.

He is going to have a ton of news. He is going to feed off the energy of the crowd. And then in three years, he is going to win back Arizona like wanted last time. This is a lot of sour grapes from the sky to excuse from MSNBC and, I would not consider a badge of honor, but maybe for it is. This is what people are going to do and all the states where Trump holds rallies. They are going to show off, bluff, flex their muscles and act like you can't come here. You are a racist and then Trump will drop air force one and dominate the local media markets, raise a ton of cash. And then go back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as a winner.

The whole handful of issues he has to deal with them ethically. Relieving Steve Bannon of his post today was part of that, trying to calm at least that storm. I do think what the mayor said in Phoenix was politically motivated. But also if you take politics out of it, look at it for a second, I think the President would actually be more effective if he did have a beat between the conversation we are having about Charlottesville and having another rally, because I actually think, unfortunately, we've been so distracted by what the president said and everyone reacting to, its reaction to Charlottesville, that we haven't actually talked about some of the failures. I think there are important lessons to be learned here from law enforcement and other cities -- a free-speech rally tomorrow in Boston.

Likely, right, he said Jeff Flake, he said oh, John McCain? The guy who killed ObamaCare? Or didn't kill ObamaCare? What you get is a situation where the aftermath of Charlottesville, he chooses to go and has a campaign style rally. The stuff he was always condemning Obama for. You're constantly campaigning. He is constantly campaigning and doing so in a moment where things are at nerves and, as Kennedy was saying, they are going to have a big rally in Boston this weekend. They are worried about violence there. Trump now inserts himself, and when the alt-right and neo-Nazis and white supremacist show up, oh, not his fault. He didn't do it."

So I can understand him going to his voters and saying, don't forget why we are here. How this happened, because right now, you are being demonized by the media. They are saying guilt by association.
