It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" About three hours away from NFL kickoff. Players will begin taking the field for the first time since Monday's anthem protest, and there's expected to be some more controversy at tonight's Bears-Packers game. Green Bay says its players, coaches, and staff will link arms during the anthem this evening, and they've encouraged their fans to do the same. President Trump and a lot of other Americans upset with the league's ongoing demonstrations. He spoke exclusively about it with Fox News in a new interview.",

They're scared of being seen as, you know, when you have people saying, well, if you stand you're a racist. There are people saying that now.  So there is this peer pressure that is happening that you used to have in middle school. I thought the Cowboys created a pretty good solution. Kneel before the anthem because that removes the confusion. Here's what you have to understand, most Americans when they see you kneel during the anthem think you're protesting the flag. You can say no, no, no, we're not. It's about social injustice. But, you've got to forgive us for being confused. If you've got to explain your protest, your protest is a failed one. So separate it.

By the way, at my gym the TVs are always on Bravo so it's all Kardashians. Congratulations, Kim, by the way, on the pregnancy. It's enough to make you puke on the stair-climber.

I just find a screaming baby nearby and listen to that instead. But Reality's attitude is too common. It's this: \"I'm not getting what I want, so you're going to pay.\" It's a childish response to life's challenges and thrives among those too jaded to see a country full of opportunity. Thanks to a media asserting that every cloudy day is someone else's fault, we've got a generation biting the hand that has overfed them. They're ignorant of their lucky birth in a nation affording them the luxury of petulance. But if life gives you lemons, or FOX News, you make lemonade or you put on the headphones. America offers a million choices. Betraying it doesn't have to be one of them. But I guess these days when traitors are now heroes, why not? Chelsea Manning is 2017's Che Guevara. Snowden is a Hollywood icon. And Reality Winner will have a press agent soon enough. Good for her: immature, bitter, nutty. She could fill an hour on MSNBC. You know, so many ways to go with this.

People resisted him even in his own party in the general election. They were more concerned about conserving their congressional majorities. And then you have leaks also. You have the Russia investigation. Obama repeal failed. There's a lot of suspicions out there about the establishment. So I think Trump's biggest kryptonite right now is inaction. Because he's such a man of action. He's just constantly moving. And the voters wanted action. They voted for Republicans to control both houses. They voted for a Republican in the White House.

It was -- it was exciting if you saw a magazine, because that's all you saw. When you were a teenager, you had to, like -- you had to sneak a peek at Playboy at the barbershop. Unfortunately, pornography now is the opposite of scarcity. It's plentiful. It's like water. It's trucked into your home via bandwidth, and it's because of decentralization, which has killed -- it's killed Playboy, killed the way iTunes killed albums. Now you can get as much as you want whenever you want. And it's -- it's changing people. I think it's turning teenagers into their own Hugh Hefners, where they're creating their own pornography at home. You have a jaded generation that's more inclined to the easy access of porn than actually going out and meeting someone and dating someone. And what is that going to do? Physical attraction was supposed to get you outside to meet somebody, to marry somebody.

And if they don't do it, and I think Trump is right -- I think they're scared. Because they're scared of online mob peer pressure. They're scared of being seen as, you know, when you have people saying, well, if you stand you're a racist. There are people saying that now. So there is this peer pressure that is happening that you used to have in middle school. I thought the Cowboys created a pretty good solution. Kneel before the anthem because that removes the confusion. Here's what you have to understand, most Americans when they see you kneel during the anthem think you're protesting the flag. You can say no, no, no, we're not. It's about social injustice. But, you've got to forgive us for being confused. If you've got to explain your protest, your protest is a failed one. So separate it. Kneel somewhere else. And by the way, if I were a cop. You know, you've got to do your job there. They're kneeling because of the police. The cops should kneel when the players are coming out on the field."

And Americans generally think, you know, it's not so cool to disrespect the flag in any way. But they also think what President Trump's response has been is way wrong. So that even more people that have any trouble with the kneeling when the flag is shown and the anthem played, more people say President Trump's response is out of order.

They're not talking about that issue. I think the issue that they want to talk -- they have absolutely every right to do so, OK? But it doesn't give people then the right to disrespect the hardworking men and women that are police officers and law enforcement in this country by large measures that serve admirably and courageously and put their lives on the line every day. So I have no tolerance for that kind of disrespect of officers when you're doing things like this and calling for police officers, pigs in a blanket, and for them to be killed, and behaving the way people are. I agree with Michael Bennett of the Seahawks. Treat everybody, treat people with respect.

People resisted him even in his own party in the general election. They were more concerned about conserving their congressional majorities. And then you have leaks also. You have the Russia investigation. Obama repeal failed. There's a lot of suspicions out there about the establishment. So I think Trump's biggest kryptonite right now is inaction. Because he's such a man of action. He's just constantly moving. And the voters wanted action. They voted for Republicans to control both houses. They voted for a Republican in the White House. They want to get things done. So when things stall and it returns the status quo, that drives the president crazy. And that's why you see him triangulate with Nancy and Crying Chuck, because he's just going to pivot around them."

But the FOX News poll shows consistently and again last night, 83 percent of the Republicans support Trump. The last two big major efforts that failed failed because of, basically, four or five Republicans in the Senate. Those are not Mitch McConnell. Now, maybe his leadership is not good enough to try to get those four people to vote with the majority. But also, perhaps you need to have better policy that they would want to vote for.

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, I like the way it's being framed as a First Amendment thing. He was a capitalist. He was making money off naked women. Let's not pretend that this was a big First Amendment thing. However, if you look back at Playboy and how quaint it is, compared to the way life is now, our audience was probably raised on the idea of scarcity. It was -- it was exciting if you saw a magazine, because that's all you saw. When you were a teenager, you had to, like -- you had to sneak a peek at Playboy at the barbershop. Unfortunately, pornography now is the opposite of scarcity. It's plentiful. It's like water. It's trucked into your home via bandwidth, and it's because of decentralization, which has killed -- it's killed Playboy, killed the way iTunes killed albums. Now you can get as much as you want whenever you want. And it's -- it's changing people. I think it's turning teenagers into their own Hugh Hefners, where they're creating their own pornography at home. You have a jaded generation that's more inclined to the easy access of porn than actually going out and meeting someone and dating someone. And what is that going to do? Physical attraction was supposed to get you outside to meet somebody, to marry somebody. It's like -- it's like if they invented a food they didn't have any calories, but it tasted just like food, and so you ate that food. Over time, your species would die. That is what is happening."

But that is what is happening with -- humans are becoming more and more inhuman when it comes to physical attraction, because they don't need to go out and actually meet somebody. We don't like talking about this, but it is affecting families. It's affecting marriages. If you talk to any priest or parish, they will tell you this is a big problem, because -- because the biggest vulnerability to monogamy is sexual novelty. And pornography is now being trucked into your house like that all the time. And monogamy is strong until you get to that point. That is the biggest challenge. And it is a big issue, but nobody wants to talk about it. Instead they talk about freedom and liberation. But we have -- there's no way you're going to change this. But at least you should acknowledge the reality of what has happened since Playboy came out, which is we now have something -- we have a faucet of flesh in our house."
