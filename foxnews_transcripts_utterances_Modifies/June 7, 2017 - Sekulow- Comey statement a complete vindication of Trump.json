      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a Fox News Alert.\" Tonight, former FBI director James Comey releases his opening remarks ahead of tomorrow's congressional testimony. It raises serious legal concerns for himself, and not the president. Plus, the president's lawyer says the commander-in-chief -- he feels vindicated tonight by Comey's prepared testimony, and he is now ready to move forward. We will have full legal analysis and reaction of Comey's prepared statement. And also, the left, the mainstream media -- they are outright lying to you about this at a level never before seen in our country's history!  Their goal is to destroy the president by now any means necessary. They are nothing more than agenda-driven ideologues. They stage protests. They call the president a piece of you know what. They even have people posing like ISIS fighters with a severed head of the commander-in-chief.  They attack the first lady's, the president's children, even his 11-year- old son. Now, this is all designed to stop what you, the American people, voted for in November by any means necessary.  So tonight, it's time to stand up and fight for the soul and future of this country. And tonight, that starts by being honest and giving you coverage you won't find anywhere else about the former FBI director James Comey and his agenda-driven mission. Now, did James Comey himself commit a felony and break the law by not coming forward with his claims? That is tonight's all-important \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, so earlier today, the former FBI director James Comey released his opening statement that he will give tomorrow before the Senate Intelligence Committee. This statement contains several key points that blow the Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory completely out of the water. And it completely shoots down the media and the Democrats and all the hyperventilating and foaming at the mouth about obstruction of justice. And now we've discovered, by the way, that they have been lying to you for months. Now, we're going to cover everything in terms of this self-serving document released by Comey -- it almost reads like a novel -- in great detail tonight. But here are some very key points that I want to tell you about.  Number one, the president did not obstruct justice. Comey never says his interactions with the president were inappropriate or illegal, and by the way, that this is key, that they constituted in any way an obstruction of justice of violation of the law.   Number two, Comey told President Trump that he was not personally under investigation. The president wasn't. Number three, Comey admits that there was confusion between him and the president over a so-called loyalty pledge. Number four, if Comey thought it was obstruction of justice and he didn't come forward, did Comey commit a felony and violate the law? Number five, unlike his conversations with President Trump, Comey writes that he never created memos about interactions with President Obama. Now, remember, he also didn't put Hillary Clinton under oath during her FBI interview and Comey didn't bother to have the bureau create a full transcript of that interview.   So let's start with the first point, the president did not obstruct justice. Now, Comey described the February 14th meeting in the Oval Office as follows. Quote, \"The president then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, 'He's a good guy. He's been through a lot.' And he repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but the fact that he had misled the vice president. He then said, 'I hope'\" -- I hope -- remember, \"I hope,\" key words here -- \"'you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He's a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' And I replied only, He's a good guy.\" Well, first of all, any lawyer, legal expert will tell you that this alleged conversation doesn't come anywhere close to obstruction of justice like the media is claiming tonight. And then there's this from Comey. \"I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn's departure and the controversy around his accounts of his phone calls. Regardless, it was concerning, given the FBI's role as an independent investigative agency.\" So according to Comey in his opening statement tomorrow, President Trump only mentioned Flynn and didn't try to bring up the topic or try to impede the overall, quote, \"Russia investigation.\"  And here's another major point that the media won't tell you. There were only two people in the room. This is only James Comey's version of events and how he perceived Trump's comments. Now, the president may have a much different interpretation, in spite of all the insane, breathless coverage you might have watched earlier today.   Again, there's no legal basis for obstruction. And that means the destroy Trump media, which has been hyperventilating, foaming at the mouth about this -- they've been completely wrong. Watch this coverage.",

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right, now, here's the most important point that the media will never tell you. If James Comey did, in fact, think this was obstruction of justice and he didn't come forward, Comey could have committed a felony and he himself broken the law.  Now, we're putting up the law, the actual law, on the side of your screen. And as my colleague, Gregg Jarrett, has pointed out -- and he will be here in a minute to explain more -- if James Comey thought the president was doing something illegal, he had a legal obligation to come forward immediately!  That's not what Comey did. In his testimony, Comey says he didn't bother to tell the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, about his conversation with President Trump because, in part, well, he thought Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. That would not be a reason not to follow the law! And then when Comey complained to the attorney general, Sessions, face to face about not wanting to be left alone with the president, he once again decided not to tell Sessions about his conversation with the president.   Another key major point. Comey also told President Trump he was not personally under investigation, not once, multiple times. Now, this means, once again, every conspiracy theory you have heard for month after month after month about President Trump colluding with the Russians -- the president colluding with the Russians -- is not true. And given the mainstream media's nonstop, incessant coverage and the fact that Comey told Trump he's not under investigation, it is unreasonable for the president to say -- Hey -- you know, it's not unreasonable to say, \"Everyone's claiming that, in fact, you know, I might be involved here, and you are telling me I'm not under investigation, can you just come forward and set the record straight and tell the American people the truth to clear my name because it's interfering with my job\"?  Now, do you think that's unreasonable? Shouldn't the FBI director come forward and tell the truth that he believes to the American people?  But that's not all. Comey admits there was confusion between him and the president over a so-called loyalty pledge which happened at a private dinner. Now, take a look at this from Comey's prepared testimony. \"He then said, 'I need loyalty. I replied, 'You will always get honesty from me.' He paused and then said, 'Well, that's what I want, honest loyalty.' I paused and said, 'Well, you will get that from me.' As I wrote in the memo that I created immediately after the dinner, that it was possible the we understood or misunderstood the phrase 'honest loyalty' differently, but I decided it wouldn't be productive to push it further.\" So was it loyalty? Was it honest loyalty? And by the way, what does this mean anyway? I could have been a ton of different things. Is it loyalty to the Constitution and the rule of law, not loyalty to the deep state, Comey -- or not loyalty to the former administration that Comey worked for? Comey even admits that there was confusion about that part of the conversation.   And there's also a glaring double standard here. Unlike with President Trump, James Comey -- he didn't write memos about his conversations with President Obama. I said this weeks ago. I think that's because Comey is planning on writing a novel or a tell-all book and probably be working for MSNBC and following probably Rachel Maddow every night. And he's a perfect black helicopter conspiracy theorist, it seems, himself.  And there's also the fact that James Comey did not require -- think of this. Hillary Clinton was not put under oath when she was interviewed about her server or that a complete transcript of that interview was said to be created. Why not? Why wasn't that done? For example, look at what happened to Michael Flynn. Now, the guy was tarred and feathered by the press when Trump allegedly said, Well, I can hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. You know, he's a good guy. I hope you can do this. I hope you can let this go.  Was it similar to what the president said on \"60 Minutes\" about the Clintons, that he, quote, \"didn't want to hurt them?\" That -- you know, he was basically saying he wanted to let them go.  Now, Comey apparently didn't want to hurt the Clintons, either, because remember back during the campaign, he felt it was necessary to come out and announce the FBI's findings about Hillary Clinton. And Comey laid out that Clinton had secret, top secret, special access program, classified information on her unsecure server that we believe 99 percent certainty was hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies. But then after all that, well, he treated Clinton with kid gloves. You may remember this in July of last year.",

By the way, Clinton broke several laws, committed several felonies, but she gets the courtesy of the public announcement. But the president, who the FBI director told a number of times did nothing wrong, wasn't under investigation, did not get the same treatment. That's ridiculous, and Comey, by the way, should be ashamed of himself. This reads like a political document in every way, shape, matter or form. Now, by the way, there's more to say in terms of the big story that we're following earlier today. Now, the media won't cover this tonight. Earlier, during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, earlier today, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and the NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers -- they threw cold water on the narrative that President Trump acted inappropriately during their conversations with him.

Why do we even have intelligence if we're not going to go after the lowest hanging fruit, the people we know believe this?",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a Fox News Alert.\" Tonight, former FBI director James Comey releases his opening remarks ahead of tomorrow's congressional testimony. It raises serious legal concerns for himself, and not the president. Plus, the president's lawyer says the commander-in-chief -- he feels vindicated tonight by Comey's prepared testimony, and he is now ready to move forward. We will have full legal analysis and reaction of Comey's prepared statement. And also, the left, the mainstream media -- they are outright lying to you about this at a level never before seen in our country's history! Their goal is to destroy the president by now any means necessary. They are nothing more than agenda-driven ideologues. They stage protests. They call the president a piece of you know what. They even have people posing like ISIS fighters with a severed head of the commander-in-chief. They attack the first lady's, the president's children, even his 11-year- old son. Now, this is all designed to stop what you, the American people, voted for in November by any means necessary. So tonight, it's time to stand up and fight for the soul and future of this country. And tonight, that starts by being honest and giving you coverage you won't find anywhere else about the former FBI director James Comey and his agenda-driven mission. Now, did James Comey himself commit a felony and break the law by not coming forward with his claims? That is tonight's all-important \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, so earlier today, the former FBI director James Comey released his opening statement that he will give tomorrow before the Senate Intelligence Committee. This statement contains several key points that blow the Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory completely out of the water. And it completely shoots down the media and the Democrats and all the hyperventilating and foaming at the mouth about obstruction of justice. And now we've discovered, by the way, that they have been lying to you for months. Now, we're going to cover everything in terms of this self-serving document released by Comey -- it almost reads like a novel -- in great detail tonight. But here are some very key points that I want to tell you about. Number one, the president did not obstruct justice. Comey never says his interactions with the president were inappropriate or illegal, and by the way, that this is key, that they constituted in any way an obstruction of justice of violation of the law. Number two, Comey told President Trump that he was not personally under investigation. The president wasn't. Number three, Comey admits that there was confusion between him and the president over a so-called loyalty pledge. Number four, if Comey thought it was obstruction of justice and he didn't come forward, did Comey commit a felony and violate the law? Number five, unlike his conversations with President Trump, Comey writes that he never created memos about interactions with President Obama. Now, remember, he also didn't put Hillary Clinton under oath during her FBI interview and Comey didn't bother to have the bureau create a full transcript of that interview. So let's start with the first point, the president did not obstruct justice. Now, Comey described the February 14th meeting in the Oval Office as follows. Quote, \"The president then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, 'He's a good guy. He's been through a lot.' And he repeated that Flynn hadn't done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but the fact that he had misled the vice president. He then said, 'I hope'\" -- I hope -- remember, \"I hope,\" key words here -- \"'you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He's a good guy. I hope you can let this go.' And I replied only, He's a good guy.\" Well, first of all, any lawyer, legal expert will tell you that this alleged conversation doesn't come anywhere close to obstruction of justice like the media is claiming tonight. And then there's this from Comey. \"I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn's departure and the controversy around his accounts of his phone calls. Regardless, it was concerning, given the FBI's role as an independent investigative agency.\" So according to Comey in his opening statement tomorrow, President Trump only mentioned Flynn and didn't try to bring up the topic or try to impede the overall, quote, \"Russia investigation.\" And here's another major point that the media won't tell you. There were only two people in the room. This is only James Comey's version of events and how he perceived Trump's comments. Now, the president may have a much different interpretation, in spite of all the insane, breathless coverage you might have watched earlier today. Again, there's no legal basis for obstruction. And that means the destroy Trump media, which has been hyperventilating, foaming at the mouth about this -- they've been completely wrong. Watch this coverage."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, now, here's the most important point that the media will never tell you. If James Comey did, in fact, think this was obstruction of justice and he didn't come forward, Comey could have committed a felony and he himself broken the law. Now, we're putting up the law, the actual law, on the side of your screen. And as my colleague, Gregg Jarrett, has pointed out -- and he will be here in a minute to explain more -- if James Comey thought the president was doing something illegal, he had a legal obligation to come forward immediately! That's not what Comey did. In his testimony, Comey says he didn't bother to tell the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, about his conversation with President Trump because, in part, well, he thought Sessions was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. That would not be a reason not to follow the law! And then when Comey complained to the attorney general, Sessions, face to face about not wanting to be left alone with the president, he once again decided not to tell Sessions about his conversation with the president. Another key major point. Comey also told President Trump he was not personally under investigation, not once, multiple times. Now, this means, once again, every conspiracy theory you have heard for month after month after month about President Trump colluding with the Russians -- the president colluding with the Russians -- is not true. And given the mainstream media's nonstop, incessant coverage and the fact that Comey told Trump he's not under investigation, it is unreasonable for the president to say -- Hey -- you know, it's not unreasonable to say, \"Everyone's claiming that, in fact, you know, I might be involved here, and you are telling me I'm not under investigation, can you just come forward and set the record straight and tell the American people the truth to clear my name because it's interfering with my job\"? Now, do you think that's unreasonable? Shouldn't the FBI director come forward and tell the truth that he believes to the American people? But that's not all. Comey admits there was confusion between him and the president over a so-called loyalty pledge which happened at a private dinner. Now, take a look at this from Comey's prepared testimony. \"He then said, 'I need loyalty. I replied, 'You will always get honesty from me.' He paused and then said, 'Well, that's what I want, honest loyalty.' I paused and said, 'Well, you will get that from me.' As I wrote in the memo that I created immediately after the dinner, that it was possible the we understood or misunderstood the phrase 'honest loyalty' differently, but I decided it wouldn't be productive to push it further.\" So was it loyalty? Was it honest loyalty? And by the way, what does this mean anyway? I could have been a ton of different things. Is it loyalty to the Constitution and the rule of law, not loyalty to the deep state, Comey -- or not loyalty to the former administration that Comey worked for? Comey even admits that there was confusion about that part of the conversation. And there's also a glaring double standard here. Unlike with President Trump, James Comey -- he didn't write memos about his conversations with President Obama. I said this weeks ago. I think that's because Comey is planning on writing a novel or a tell-all book and probably be working for MSNBC and following probably Rachel Maddow every night. And he's a perfect black helicopter conspiracy theorist, it seems, himself. And there's also the fact that James Comey did not require -- think of this. Hillary Clinton was not put under oath when she was interviewed about her server or that a complete transcript of that interview was said to be created. Why not? Why wasn't that done? For example, look at what happened to Michael Flynn. Now, the guy was tarred and feathered by the press when Trump allegedly said, Well, I can hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. You know, he's a good guy. I hope you can do this. I hope you can let this go. Was it similar to what the president said on \"60 Minutes\" about the Clintons, that he, quote, \"didn't want to hurt them?\" That -- you know, he was basically saying he wanted to let them go. Now, Comey apparently didn't want to hurt the Clintons, either, because remember back during the campaign, he felt it was necessary to come out and announce the FBI's findings about Hillary Clinton. And Comey laid out that Clinton had secret, top secret, special access program, classified information on her unsecure server that we believe 99 percent certainty was hacked by five foreign intelligence agencies. But then after all that, well, he treated Clinton with kid gloves. You may remember this in July of last year."

That's not -- or getting rid of emails, some 30,000-plus, even top-secret emails. By the way, Clinton broke several laws, committed several felonies, but she gets the courtesy of the public announcement. But the president, who the FBI director told a number of times did nothing wrong, wasn't under investigation, did not get the same treatment. That's ridiculous, and Comey, by the way, should be ashamed of himself. This reads like a political document in every way, shape, matter or form. Now, by the way, there's more to say in terms of the big story that we're following earlier today. Now, the media won't cover this tonight. Earlier, during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, earlier today, the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, and the NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers -- they threw cold water on the narrative that President Trump acted inappropriately during their conversations with him. Oh, they're saying something different. Let's start with Rogers. While he would not comment on his private conversations with the president, he made his point crystal clear. Take a look."

And by the way, couple that, Sean, with all of the statements from Sally Yates, from all of the other -- besides all the intelligence individuals -- heads of the intelligence agencies, James Clapper, all of them are saying no evidence!"

So he didn't fire Director Comey because he suspected he was under investigation. He fired Director Comey for the way he was handling the FBI. And if we just take a step back and look at all of that -- I mean, even with the stories about Russia and collusion, this is all hearsay. There's no facts to support it. We've been reporting this for quite a long time, that there is no evidence of collusion between President Trump and the Russians. And yet it perpetuates itself in the media.

Under the law, that doesn't matter. So tomorrow, Comey has to say, Oh, yes, the -- the conversation was concerning to me, but he cannot say it was obstruction of justice.

And he would have to be under oath saying that he thought there was a case for obstruction of justice and bring a charge under a 18 USC 4 against James Comey? So what did he do? His lawyer said, You know what? You better not testify on a false statement of your own because now James Comey, by the way, is the former FBI director. He is a witness. He's under oath.

Security Council passed a resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea claims the missile testing. North Korea claims the missiles are needed to counter U.S. aggression. Twelve people are dead and dozens injured after a pair of terror attacks in Iran. Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked Iran's parliament and the tomb of its revolutionary leader. ISIS is claiming responsibility for that, but Iran blames the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. President Trump is among several world leaders condemning the attacks tonight.

Joining us with reaction, former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee, and still with us from CircaNews.com, Sara Carter. To my good friend, Austan, glad to have you. Here's a question. Do you agree that Hillary Clinton putting top secret information and special access program information on a server in a mom and pop shop bathroom in a closet that have a 99.9 percent certainty ended up in the hand of five foreign intelligence agencies, would you say by definition that's mishandling of classified material?"

Look, there was a lot of concern among U.S. federal law enforcement personnel, FBI personnel that were investigating Hillary Clinton's server, multiple servers. And the concern was that there was classified information on there and she knew that this information was classified even though she claimed she didn't understand what she was sending or what she was looking at certain points during their interview with her. I can tell you this because I've interviewed numerous people connected to this investigation. And not only that, because McCabe brought it up, the acting deputy director of the FBI brought this up in his testimony and said there were people that were angry. In fact, I was told some FBI agents actually threw sandwiches at the television when Comey made that announcement. People were angry. And I don't think the American public understands that."

And look, why are they allowing them? They complain in England that they don't have enough people to monitor all these terrorists that they have? Then why are you allowing those that you know served with ISIS that came back, returned from Syria? Kick them out of the country and take away their citizenship. I think the Europeans need to development a backbone, and now is the time to start."

      "speaker": "SCARBOROUGH",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump again being a schmuck, thinking that he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over to the White House and wowing them. I'm sorry, that's how he thinks."
    },

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, liberal Joe Scarborough called the president of the United States a schmuck today on NBC News. Now we will have more of liberal Joe and Mika's emotionally unhinged moments. That's all coming up straight ahead. And we get reaction from Herman Cain. Stay with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And welcome back to \"Hannity.\" So the destroy-Trump propaganda press is unrelenting in their abusively bias, negative, and sometimes apocalyptic coverage of the Trump administration. Now for months one cable show with some of the most absurd and, frankly, emotionally a little unhinged coverage has been none other than MSNBC's liberal Joe. That's the liberal Joe show, low rated, by the way. And we are calling them out tonight. And that is our next mini monologue. All right, so earlier today liberal Joe and his cohost, Mika Brzezinski, they continued their usual nasty coverage of President Trump, this time calling the president of the United States of America a schmuck. Watch."

      "speaker": "SCARBOROUGH",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump again being a schmuck, thinking that he can buy people's integrity by inviting them over to the White House and wowing them. I'm sorry, that's how he thinks. I know that first hand. He thinks if he invites you to the White House and gives you food, that you are going to cut him a break, cut him slack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Liberal Joe also took some time to bash a certain cable network that dared to report the devastation of the cultural leaks in Washington. Take a look at this."

      "speaker": "SCARBOROUGH",
      "utterance": "If Republicans end up looking like they are reading the talking points from the White House or from -- now the Trump run RNC, or from certain cable news shows on other networks, and all they are talking about are leaks, they will pay a heavy, heavy price in 2018 for caring more about protecting a corrupt -- apparently corrupt -- president and administration than getting to the truth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Liberal Joe, he can critique this network or any other network, and their coverage of Washington and leaks, and so on and so forth, but liberal Joe, you really shouldn't be throwing stones from your incredibly fragile glass house. After all, liberal Joe routinely features some of the most vile, unfair, disgusting, and even emotionally unhinged coverage of President Trump. But don't take my word for it. Instead, here are some of the lowlights. Take a look yourself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARBOROUGH",
      "utterance": "He looked like a thug. He looked like a goon. You look at the handshake. Look at this. Just what a thug. What an embarrassment. Look, he's mauling him like an idiot. What an embarrassment to the United States."

      "utterance": "Optic matter. I understand why you liked him, but this man is lying to you. This presidency is rotten all the way to the core and right to the top. You've got to stop putting Kellyanne on the air. It's politics porn."

      "speaker": "SCARBOROUGH",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Actually, it's really funny. Joining us now, former presidential candidate, Fox News contributor Herman Cain. All right, Herman, \"schmuck, thug, goon, mauling, idiot, embarrassment, liar, unbalanced, unfit mentally.\" Let's keep going, \"political porn, rotten to the core, disgusting,\" just a small sampling of the emotionally unhinged coverage. But there's a certain viciousness to all this. I want to get your thoughts."

    },

      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "I like the accomplishments that this president and his administration -- that they are making despite this vitriol coming from people like Joe and Mika. Secondly, they literally think people are believing their poisonous vitriol. They have taken Trump derangement syndrome to a whole new level, Sean. And that is sad because they are assuming that the American people are stupid."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, Herman, good to see you. When we come back, we need your help with a very important question of the day, and yes, the Hannity Hotline is back, straight ahead."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Time for tonight's \"Question of the Day.\" James Comey's opening statement released today, what did you think about his prepared remarks? Obviously pretty angry, bitter over being fired, disgruntled employee. And by the way, no obstruction of justice. But we want to hear from you, Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. All right, good or bad, hit me with your best shot. It's the Hannity hotline."
