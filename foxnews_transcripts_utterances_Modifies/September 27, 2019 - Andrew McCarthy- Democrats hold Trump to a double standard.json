And that has to do with the whistle-blower saying he or she was told that State Department official T. Ulrich Brechbuhl also listened in on the call between President Trump and Ukraine's president. That's the one where the president urged Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. A State Department official says Brechbuhl was not on the call. Brechbuhl is a State Department counselor, a former business partner and a longtime friend of the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. The whistle-blower cites White House officials as the basis for their complaint.   Democrats are also asking the State Department for information on any role the department may have played in this, as the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani says that State asked and helped him to get in touch with Ukrainian officials.  Senator Bob Menendez has sent Secretary Pompeo a letter requesting information about State's knowledge of Giuliani's outreach. State officials say an ambassador put Giuliani in touch with a Ukrainian presidential adviser because the adviser requested it, and stressed that Giuliani is a private citizen, and does not speak for the U.S. government - - Neil.",

There's a lot of other witnesses that they want to hear from. Now, there's a whole laundry list of various ambassadors -- and I'm reading this right off my phone because this just came down the pike here -- who they want to hear from who might have a part of this dealing with Ukraine. We're also being told that, at some point, they want to hear again from the inspector general for the intelligence community. That would be Mike Atkinson. They also want to hear from Rudolph Giuliani, the president's personal attorney. And also at some point the big fish here is the whistle-blower. I spoke again today with some senior sources about the time -- timing of that. We're told, Neil, that that's probably a couple of weeks away. But, again, just because Congress is in recess, you're going to have a two- track approach right now over the next two-week period. You're going to have members of Congress, the Democrats, going back to their districts and explaining the process to their constituents, and also trying to get some of them on board in defending them. There are 31 Democrats who represent Trump districts. And then here on Capitol Hill, you're going to have more appeals for witnesses and hearings and subpoenas. And behind the scenes, what they're going to be doing is trying to craft these articles of impeachment. There's a quote from Winston Churchill. He was given a bowl of pudding at one point, and he said, well, there's no theme to this putting, and he sent it back.

I mean, in theory, I guess you would go through the SEC to have it delisted. There's money already in these -- these ADRs, is what they actually are typically, with the larger ones, like Alibaba. What do you do if you already own it? You have to sell it, or it's going to now sell trade abroad? Because you can also invest in these in foreign markets. We would have very little control over that. Ironically, Chinese, they don't really want foreign money in all their stocks. They have always restricted that into some level from foreign investment. And, in some ways, it pushes their currency down to not have flows of money go into their stock market. And they like to keep their currency cheap.

There's generally always a quid pro quo in the middle of it. The question always is, when you're talking about bribery or corruption, whether it's an inappropriate quid pro quo. So, here, I think the interesting thing is, a lot of this comes down to, what do you think of the Barr investigation? Because in the Zelensky phone call, the Ukrainian president, when the president first says, but I want you do me a favor, he doesn't go to Biden. He goes to the Barr investigation.

That kind of thing goes on all the time. Now, when you get to Biden, the question is, does that have any relevance to the Barr investigation?

They called up the leading securities analyst in the country, Ray Dirks, because they couldn't get the SEC and the insurance regulators to move. He came out, heard their stories, and was able to verify that management was actually forging insurance policies in order to convince the auditor that they were still doing business. When he reported all that, what happened was that all senior management went to prison. But the SEC turned around and sued Ray Dirks because they didn't like being embarrassed, among other reasons.

Remember, Biden, seen as the more moderate when compared to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, isn't backing the more extreme wealth tax. Let's review that for a second. Warren's wealth tax calls for a 2 percent charge on households that have a net worth of more than $50 million, and 3 percent over a billion. Sanders is calling for 1 percent on couples with $32 million to $50 million. Then it rises gradually to 8 percent on sums over $10 billion. And the wealth tax is about taxing accumulated wealth. It's money that people have already paid tax on. And Sanders was very clear when he told The New York Times: \"I don't think that billionaires should exist.\" Now, if the Biden camp goes through with its proposal, it could seem a little bit more left, a little more reasonable. However, it's not just going to hit select groups. Taxing stock and bond sales could hit anyone with a pension, a 401(k), or any equity-related investments. So that's not just the super-rich. A lot of people on Main Street could be impacted by this as well, Neil.",

Democrats are also asking the State Department for information on any role the department may have played in this, as the president's attorney Rudy Giuliani says that State asked and helped him to get in touch with Ukrainian officials. Senator Bob Menendez has sent Secretary Pompeo a letter requesting information about State's knowledge of Giuliani's outreach. State officials say an ambassador put Giuliani in touch with a Ukrainian presidential adviser because the adviser requested it, and stressed that Giuliani is a private citizen, and does not speak for the U.S. government - - Neil."

Donald Trump has really left Nancy Pelosi and Democrats no other choice. If you go back to the whistle-blower complaint, it has been deemed urgent and credible.

They want to get their hot hands on those documents. No response yet from the secretary of state. In the meantime, I want you to meet one of the few Democratic congressmen coming out and telling his fellow Democrats, let's cool it on this. Jeff Van Drew will be my special guest tomorrow on \"Cavuto Live.\" That begins at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. We will also -- fair and balanced -- be talking with South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott, get his take on this.

Now, technically, the House and Senate are out for the next two weeks. But we were told that there would be hearings probably over this recess. There's a lot of other witnesses that they want to hear from. Now, there's a whole laundry list of various ambassadors -- and I'm reading this right off my phone because this just came down the pike here -- who they want to hear from who might have a part of this dealing with Ukraine. We're also being told that, at some point, they want to hear again from the inspector general for the intelligence community. That would be Mike Atkinson. They also want to hear from Rudolph Giuliani, the president's personal attorney. And also at some point the big fish here is the whistle-blower. I spoke again today with some senior sources about the time -- timing of that. We're told, Neil, that that's probably a couple of weeks away. But, again, just because Congress is in recess, you're going to have a two- track approach right now over the next two-week period. You're going to have members of Congress, the Democrats, going back to their districts and explaining the process to their constituents, and also trying to get some of them on board in defending them. There are 31 Democrats who represent Trump districts. And then here on Capitol Hill, you're going to have more appeals for witnesses and hearings and subpoenas. And behind the scenes, what they're going to be doing is trying to craft these articles of impeachment. There's a quote from Winston Churchill. He was given a bowl of pudding at one point, and he said, well, there's no theme to this putting, and he sent it back. What they have to do is try to figure out the theme to this pudding, what these articles of impeachment would actually look like."

It didn't just -- I mean, it hurts Chinese stocks the most, obviously, but it actually hurt all stocks, because investors really don't want the government telling them where they can and can't invest. I mean, we have to win a trade war, so we want to have all things on the table. But it's not something investors want to hear. It's also hard to implement. I mean, in theory, I guess you would go through the SEC to have it delisted. There's money already in these -- these ADRs, is what they actually are typically, with the larger ones, like Alibaba. What do you do if you already own it? You have to sell it, or it's going to now sell trade abroad? Because you can also invest in these in foreign markets. We would have very little control over that. Ironically, Chinese, they don't really want foreign money in all their stocks. They have always restricted that into some level from foreign investment. And, in some ways, it pushes their currency down to not have flows of money go into their stock market. And they like to keep their currency cheap. And they're trying to lower it now too as their way they battle the trade war. So, in other words, how this is going to play out is going to be very interesting and what the mechanisms of doing it."

This is -- to block that with any one country would really limit that country's ability to grow and keep their economy going, even if they don't blatantly access maybe our IPO markets for a while because of this. It's just not -- it's not a good -- it sends a message that we have got other plans, and it's not just because you don't buy that much actual stuff from us.

I think that somebody smarter than me, when this all started to get rolling about a week ago or a year ago, I should say, said that the thing about impeachment is, nobody's really in charge of it. And once the wheels start to turn in the direction of moving toward it, there's nobody who really is in charge who can stop it. And you can see all along that -- I doubted that was true when I first heard it, but I'm starting to see the wisdom in it, because I -- there's a lot of senior Democrats who know this is a bad idea electorally, but the base really wants it. It's not like they don't have anything to play with. I don't think they have anything impeachable, but they have some things that can cause some embarrassment for the administration. We have to remember -- I know it seems like a long time ago that we knew this, but there are actually things that presidents do which are bad, but aren't impeachable. So those things are going to get explored. There's a lot of heavy rhetoric about it. But I think, ultimately, it's really a two-edged sword for them. And most of the smarter ones know it."

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, it's a great question. Quid pro quo, literally -- it's Latin. It literally just means this for that. And what separates bribery from other exchanges is that it's a corrupt this for that. But the reason it's important to make the distinction is, contrary to what you might think from what happened or what we heard during the Clinton e- mail scandals, when foreign leaders talk to each other, or world leaders talk to each other, it's not about yoga routines. There's generally always a quid pro quo in the middle of it. The question always is, when you're talking about bribery or corruption, whether it's an inappropriate quid pro quo. So, here, I think the interesting thing is, a lot of this comes down to, what do you think of the Barr investigation? Because in the Zelensky phone call, the Ukrainian president, when the president first says, but I want you do me a favor, he doesn't go to Biden. He goes to the Barr investigation. He basically says, I want you to give the attorney general assistance in this investigation that we're doing in the United States. I don't have the transcript in front of me. And I'm not trying to characterize it."

But it happens to be a legitimate, authorized investigation of the United States Justice Department that has prosecutors and investigators assigned, that has grand jury authority, et cetera. The reason that's important is, there is nothing inappropriate about the president of the United States or the United States government asking a foreign government for help in a criminal investigation. That kind of thing goes on all the time. Now, when you get to Biden, the question is, does that have any relevance to the Barr investigation? I think Ukraine actually does have relevance to the Barr investigation. But even if I'm wrong about that, if there are Foreign Corrupt Practices Act's -- Act -- behavior that or implications in the idea that Barr (sic) the younger was cashing in on the influence of Barr (sic) the elder, that would be an appropriate thing for the Justice Department to investigate.

And once let loose, let's say it can get out of control. Boardroom coups have seen a host of top CEOs removed for a whole host of reasons.

I want to stress that. But, clearly, there was, in the case of the whistle-blower, some concern about what was going on. And does that feed on itself?

SEC, which stems from the fact that a company called Equity Funding, once the favored of the stock market among new high-flying insurance companies, it started to fail. And junior management realized that senior management was hiding their failure, and they were going to be in trouble for running a corrupt and insolvent insurance company. They called up the leading securities analyst in the country, Ray Dirks, because they couldn't get the SEC and the insurance regulators to move. He came out, heard their stories, and was able to verify that management was actually forging insurance policies in order to convince the auditor that they were still doing business. When he reported all that, what happened was that all senior management went to prison. But the SEC turned around and sued Ray Dirks because they didn't like being embarrassed, among other reasons. And we have had whistle-blowers from honest corporate officials, and it's had devastating consequences."

      "utterance": "Hey. Good afternoon, Neil. Well, The Washington Post reporting that Joe Biden's advisers are mulling a new tax on Wall Street, one that would tax the sale of stocks and bonds. Remember, Biden, seen as the more moderate when compared to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, isn't backing the more extreme wealth tax. Let's review that for a second. Warren's wealth tax calls for a 2 percent charge on households that have a net worth of more than $50 million, and 3 percent over a billion. Sanders is calling for 1 percent on couples with $32 million to $50 million. Then it rises gradually to 8 percent on sums over $10 billion. And the wealth tax is about taxing accumulated wealth. It's money that people have already paid tax on."

      "speaker": "And Sanders was very clear when he told The New York Times",
      "utterance": "\"I don't think that billionaires should exist.\" Now, if the Biden camp goes through with its proposal, it could seem a little bit more left, a little more reasonable. However, it's not just going to hit select groups. Taxing stock and bond sales could hit anyone with a pension, a 401(k), or any equity-related investments. So that's not just the super-rich. A lot of people on Main Street could be impacted by this as well, Neil."

      "speaker": "BAIA",
      "utterance": "But this is a movie that seems to be somewhat drawing on Scorsese's cult classic \"The King of Comedy,\" which is even -- has De Niro playing Rupert Pupkin that..."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But you wouldn't pull the movie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIA",
      "utterance": "No, because, at the end of the day, if you start then -- I don't the torture porn movies, those very violent, graphic horror movies. But if you start nitpicking on what you or you don't like, then it's almost telling you what you can -- what kind of art you can produce and what you can't produce. It's up to the viewer or the consumer to censor what you're going to see for children and that kind of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. But, obviously -- and I think Abby touched on this -- you have now have people judging whether it's safe to go to a movie because of all these warnings. People get afraid because some nut is going to act on it, right?"

      "speaker": "HORNACEK",
      "utterance": "I will say that Cinemark decided not -- well, right now, it's reported that they will not be playing the movie in that Aurora theater, which I think is very smart, because you do have the copycats who want to recreate something that happened."

      "speaker": "HORNACEK",
      "utterance": "So that's a very good move by them, in my view."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIA",
      "utterance": "And then also, the other side of this is, if you do start making this all obvious, it's the people who then get the idea from hearing this publicity. Oh, maybe the sick individual out there who will want to go do something like this gets the idea to go do some horrible, catastrophic tragedy there because of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I would like to stick with this issue, Pam, if you're listening here. And the reason why, because -- and, Kat, this has come up again and again and again. When we have violent incidents, a lot of people say, it's the guns, the guns, the guns. And I don't doubt that there are a great deal of guns out there and all that. I get that. But they never really think violent movies or anything that. And that will start, if God forbid something happens as a result of this. Hope not, pray not."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Of course. But the reality is -- and I think this is something that deep down everyone has to understand. If somebody goes out and commits a horrific act of violence, like what did happen in Colorado, you can't say it was a movie. There was -- clearly, someone that does that has underlying issues. That's a sick individual. No normal person is going to see a violent movie and become a mass murderer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And there have been a lot of violent movies since where no such incident occurred."

    },

      "utterance": "But it is going to plant that seed. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HORNACEK",
      "utterance": "It is. And I will say a lot of the parents touched on the fact that this is really bothering the PTSD of these victims, because something like this will get them going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, gets people, gets them thinking and fearing."

      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. That's right, his first public campaign event. In just a few minutes, Joe Biden will address a crowd of about 200 or so supporters and the media. And if his statements yesterday are any indication, he will continue to blast President Trump and brush aside any concerns that he and his son did anything wrong. At a pair of fund-raisers yesterday in Southern California, Joe Biden accused President Trump of playing dirty politics to win reelection and referred to that phone call with the Ukrainian president, saying -- quote - - It's a tactic that's used by this president to try to hijack an election, so that we do not focus on the issues that matter in our lives, in your lives,\" he said. He also read an excerpt from the whistle-blower report and made do so again here today, claiming that the president abused his power. Now, this is Biden's third trip to the Silver State in as many months. Nevada is an important early voting state, third in the lineup behind Iowa in New Hampshire, its caucus just five months away. And we expect this campaign event to begin any minute -- Neil."
