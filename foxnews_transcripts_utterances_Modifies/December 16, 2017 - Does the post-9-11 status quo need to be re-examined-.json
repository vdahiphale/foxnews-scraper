In a last-minute tweet to bring Florida Senator Marco Rubio on board, the final deal expands access to the child tax credit for low and middle-income families.  President Trump made his final push for overhaul on Wednesday.",

It will look nothing like when Reagan lowered the top rate from 50 to 28. No one expects that. But what it does do it is a symbol the top rate is not permanent. If Republicans declined to lower the top rate at all, remember that the Senate bill only lowered it to 38 and the House didn't touch it, and in some brackets, increased it. This represents some progress Republicans can fight another day on this question."

I wish Marco Rubio had not gotten his child care tax provision because, let's be honest, this is redistributionist policy. It's taking from some taxpayers and giving to others. This should not be good conservative policy. It's also not pro- growth policy. It adds nothing to growth, and can, in fact, be a discouragement from people working."

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday he has seen no reason to fire Mueller, thus far, despite growing Republican concerns of bias in the Russia investigation. The Justice Department this week released 90 pages of text messages exchanged last year between FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who was later assigned to Mueller's team, and FBI lawyer, Lisa Page. The anti-Trump texts describes the possibility of his election victory as, quote, \"terrifying.\" But do they go beyond political antipathy? Kim, let's try to put this into some context. Why should we care what we are discovering about members of the special counsel's team?"

The question is whether the hostility expressed in these texts go beyond that to a bias, and whether there is any evidence, more important, that the agents were willing to act on that hostility. One text message in particular talked about the importance of having an \"insurance policy\" in case Trump were to win the election. What does that mean? There's a lot of thoughts about it. Was that the dossiers that they were using, what it something else? Was the FBI actively trying to thwart Trump's presidency?"

And just in case dumb voters choose Trump, the FBI needs to intervene. Maybe it doesn't mean what it seems to mean. Mr. Strzok, if he doesn't dodge it, should have the opportunity to come before the House Judiciary Committee, and perhaps other committees, and explain what he meant by this.

Paul, I think the FBI and the Department of Justice are wadding into very deep water here.

What I'm trying to say, Paul, is that eventually you are going to get to the point where the American public is going to start asking these questions themselves, and confidence in the FBI will break below a level that the FBI and Justice Department doesn't want to go.

But on the other hand, the special counsel has an obligation to basically make sure that when he presents evidence and cases, they are credible, not only because, if it is a legal case, he has to convict somebody in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt, but if he makes a recommendation to Congress, for example, you want people to think, OK, this was based on considered judgment by people who are fair-minded. If that confidence is undermined by these actions, we are in a pretty bad place."

We've also had an entire raft of stories this week about other people on Mueller's team that would appear to be pro-Clinton, and we assume anti- Trump, and so this is really undermining confidence. Also, bear in mind, I think this is important, too. These Strzok text messages have been known about by Rod Rosenstein and Robert Mueller since July and they know the amount of attention Congress is putting on this issue and, yet, they deliberately kept them from Congress for four months. That undermines their credibility as well. It looks like they have something to hide, which they apparently did."

His approval rating is very low. It is worrisome to Republicans going ahead. More than Alabama, that is an anomaly, given the poor candidate quality down here.

But Gillibrand is making a political transformation from her old moderate persona as a blue dog Democrat in the House and is trying to lurch leftward, as a progressive. But I would note that Hillary, to the extent she could, would reduce a lot of issues to gender identity. She had a lot of other flaws but, to the extent she made everything about being her being a woman and her qualifications of having two X chromosomes, it didn't help her."

      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. And since Harvey Weinstein, this issue of sexual harassment of women has been elevated. There is a new story every day. And they are running it at Donald Trump. Again, it failed in the campaign, but they are going to run it towards 2018."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "That's right. That is the key, I think, Kim, 2018. A large part of this is Democrats are looking at the Alabama suburbs where a lot of Republican women either didn't vote, came out for Roy Moore, or voted for a write in, or they voted for Doug Jones. And that is where the Democrats are aiming in 2018."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Absolutely right. That's the number that has not gotten enough attention this week, which was nearly 60 percent of women in Alabama, who voted for Democrat Doug Jones, and somewhere close to 30 percent or more of white women who voted for Doug Jones, which is twice the number of white women voters who voted for Barack Obama in 2012. They believe this issue is a way to turbocharge them in the election because they had similar results in Virginia. And that is why they are throwing their own guys over, and let no good crisis go to waste. They will try to turn this into a campaign strategy."

In fact, Bitcoin uses that icon. People think it's a Krugerrands. Some of them are speculators who see the run and know there's more money to be made and hope they will get out before they end up being the last greater fool."

You don't think it is the store of value. Why not?"

    {
      "speaker": "BAXTER",
      "utterance": "I'm sure that is the well-intended origins, that the idea was this is currency that is transferred directly between individuals without the need for government involvement, and that would liberate the world's economy eventually from what is perceived by ideologues as the tyranny of governments and central banks. I don't think a lot of speculators think that far. They see an opportunity to make a buck, and they're willing to take the high risks involved, because the awards so far have been huge."

      "utterance": "Some people think -- in fact, we had another op-ed after yours in our paper this week, saying, look, regulation of Bitcoin would be helpful. It would be reassuring to investors and look like it had some controlling legal authority. You think regulation is a great danger here, and once that takes place, it will hurt Bitcoin. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAXTER",
      "utterance": "Frist, because regulation is inevitable. People get hurt, will demand it. But once you get regulation in, it becomes more expensive currency. There's, all the compliance involved and so on. And if you do that, you take away the advantage of Bitcoin that it's a cheaper method of generating currency. There's a myth out there that the current systems of currency are expensive. They are not expensive. The margins are very low, and they could go lower still with competition. So Bitcoin has to make the case that in a regulated environment, it is still superior to what we already have."

Basically, the computers solve the puzzles that are set for the miners and when the miner solves a puzzle, they get awarded Bitcoins. It is like the old analogy of gold mining. It is very lucrative if you strike gold. Those huge server farms, most of which are in China, are huge consumers of power. And a think tank in Australia -- I was reading this today -- has project it's conceivable they would ultimately use 60 percent of the world's energy."

He is not only a very talented jurist, but someone rare in the judicial world. He's very amusing. He is famous for having a Twitter account with 100,000 followers. It is funny. It is witty. Now, Democrats tried to use that against him and tried to discourage him from using it anymore. My plea to him is don't want to stop. We need more laughter in this political age."

Big increase in consumer spending in November versus a year ago. So Atlanta Fed now saying another quarter over 3 percent growth. It's looking like a great economy."

You need to understand we are just going back to the model of regulation of the Internet that brought us Google and Amazon and reigned for 20 years. And special point for Pai for doing this with a happy warrior mentality amid threats from the left about bonds and death threats and protests outside his out. But he has continued to press the case as a happy warrior who made us a video about why you'll still be able to post Instagram photos of our food."
