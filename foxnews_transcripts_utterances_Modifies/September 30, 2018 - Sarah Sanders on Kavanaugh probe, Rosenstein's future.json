And to have another standard would mean that someone, out of the blue, with an accusation, under certain circumstances, you are guilty until proven innocent, that is manifestly unfair. It means that unverified allegations can be used to ruin your reputation and damage your life forever without verification. It is absolutely impossible to think that we as a nation are going to go there and yet, remember, three members of the committee, the judiciary committee, and Minority Leader Schumer all said there's no presumption of innocence.

They're going to go and they're going to provide information and the Senate is going to have to make a determination to either vote for Brett Kavanaugh or not. This can't become a fishing expedition like the Democrats would like to see it be. Look, I think you have to go back to the very beginning of day one of when President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh. From that very first moment before any of these allegations were brought up, Democrats said they were not going to support him, they weren't going to vote for him and they were going to do everything within their power to fight him. We've seen that play out over the last couple of months. They've been absolutely disgraceful in the way they've handled this process, in the way they've exploited both Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. I think we cannot allow the people that have acted in bad faith to determine and allow this to become a total fishing expedition by the FBI. The Senate is going to lay out, Senate Republicans are going to lay out and dictate those terms and we look forward to this wrapping up so we can see what was seen in the last six investigations that Judge Kavanaugh has been a part of."

They could have done all of this in a private way to protect Dr. Ford.

Equally heartbreaking. Look at the destruction of his family, look at how this is played out. The biggest thing that I think is so disgraceful and so disgusting is the way that the Democrats have allowed this process to play out and allowed both of these individuals to be so beaten down, so destroyed by frankly the media, who have played a big role in this. Not to say they shouldn't report it, but they're putting so much information and so much pressure on these two individuals that I think this all could have been avoided had Dianne Feinstein and her team done this behind closed doors, not done this in such a public setting. That was what Dr. Ford asked for. She wanted this to be done in a private way and it wasn't, and it could have been and a lot of this could have been avoided, and the pain and the suffering that she's had to relive and that Judge Kavanaugh is having to experience, all could have been avoided."

Well, Brit, let me start with you. What did you think of Jeff Flake's decision, supported by two other moderate Senate Republicans, to go along with the Democratic demand for an investigation, in this case, a one week FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh?"

It's not clear to me at all what the Democrats gave for this. This is exactly what they wanted and all of what they wanted. Now, maybe they would have liked it to go on in perpetuity but I don't think Mr. Flake got much for his so-called compromise, and I think that you have to remember this -- everyone knows on the committee what an FBI background check is like. It is not a criminal investigation. It is not an in-depth investigation like the kind we associate with this. It is simply a background check and which will go and interview people about a nominee or candidate and they are going to look into some of these charges and it's worth remembering that in all these instances, no one has corroborated the charges and it's a little hard to imagine that when the FBI finishes this, they will find corroboration that no one else has been able to discover from witnesses who have so far pretty well deny that they saw this or even that it happened."

And let's keep in mind, the votes were not there because, clearly, Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski were not on the same train without this FBI investigation.

And I look at Dr. Ford and I'm going to tell you something, I've worked with, over the years, 20 years, a lot of victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. She was incredibly credible. The things that she could remember where, as she said, indelible to the hippocampus, and I think that the FBI is going to get to some truth, and the scope of the investigation should not be limited and you got to look at his drinking, you got to look at his companions during this time period and there will be people to interview.

And this is what the FBI is now attempting to do, but it remains the case that before these hearings and after these hearings there is not a single piece of evidence beyond Christine Blasey's word in this that this happen. If we are willing to overthrow all of due process in the country and just say, OK, that won't be the standard anymore, one accusation is enough to lose you your job, your life, your home, we've got some really big problems. So, the FBI is going to go out, that you already Democrats undermining the very FBI probe they called for, saying it's not long enough, it's not wide enough, it's not going to go on long enough.

To what degree does this call for an FBI investigation just playing out time and hopes, with all due respect to Congresswoman Edwards, she's already said, well, we need to go, maybe a week isn't enough and try to push this past the midterms, in the hope that Democrats take over and that Donald Trump never gets another Supreme Court justice? MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: I think unfortunately there are some Democrats where that is true. I don't think that is where a majority of Democrats are. I think -- there are some Democratic activists out there who are saying, let's just -- let's delay this and then we'll find something else to delay and then we'll find something to delay after that and ride this through 2020, and I think they're doing the Democratic Party, of which I'm a proud member, a disservice. But I think to the fact -- these are Democrats out there who believe that when there's a credible allegation like Dr. Ford's against someone who is seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, that is worth pumping the brakes and doing a real investigation. I don't believe -- I personally do not believe that she was treated with the respect and the credibility that many people are patting themselves on the back and saying they gave her. I think when -- Democrats are oftentimes criticized for saying, you know, they came out against him before all of this started, right? They said that they were -- right? Republicans were saying before the hearing started that they were going to vote for him afterwards.

But I -- I want to just push back a little bit on the idea that she didn't have any corroboration. So, she took a lie detector test. And there was -- it wasn't admitted and we didn't have testimony from the person who administered it, but that is actually important.

She claims that she attended several parties in the early '80s where she saw Brett Kavanaugh spike the punch so girls could be gang raped.

They gave contemporaneous accounts of it to other people and patterns as well. It wasn't just one woman, or six, seven in the case of Harvey Weinstein, a lot of people come out. That's what gave heft to it and made people step back and go, OK, there's a problem here.

And if you talk -- if men began to have a conversation with their wives and their girlfriends and their friends, they are going to find out a lot about what they've experienced. And I think that's the moment that we're in. And so when you're talking about standard of proof, burden of proof, I think if we were in the middle of a court proceeding, absolutely.

This idea that it is only in a court of law in a criminal case of some kind or a legal case that you are innocent until proven guilty is far more deeply embedded in our nation and our culture as an ordinary sense of fairness. And to have another standard would mean that someone, out of the blue, with an accusation, under certain circumstances, you are guilty until proven innocent, that is manifestly unfair. It means that unverified allegations can be used to ruin your reputation and damage your life forever without verification. It is absolutely impossible to think that we as a nation are going to go there and yet, remember, three members of the committee, the judiciary committee, and Minority Leader Schumer all said there's no presumption of innocence. It -- that is where we are -- that is where we seem to be going. And I don't -- I -- I don't think -- I hope and trust the public won't stand for it."

Look, I am -- I -- I am going to try to take off -- take this out of the politics because this question is playing itself out in corporate board rooms, in newsrooms, in all sorts of other venues outside of politics across our country. And it is complicated. And it is hard. I'm a guy and I'm a dad of a son and I don't want to be accused and I don't want my son to be falsely accused. I also have a daughter and if, God forbid, she was ever in this situation, I want her to be heard and I want her to be believed. And so this is really a cultural battle that is emerging in a way that I have not -- Brit and I were talking about it in the green room earlier, this is probably one of the most divisive cultural issues we have faced and that has polarized us as a nation as far as I can remember. I believe that the women ought to be heard. And when these charges come up and these accusations come up and these questions come up in corporate board rooms, in newsrooms, in other venues, whether it's political or not, I think they need to be looked at, they need to be investigated, the women need to be treated absolutely seriously.
