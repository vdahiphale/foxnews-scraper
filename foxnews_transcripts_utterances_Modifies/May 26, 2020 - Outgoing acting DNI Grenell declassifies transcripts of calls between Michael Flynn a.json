I'm Martha MacCallum and this is THE STORY tonight. After 9/11, the stock market was closed for four days. During the pandemic, trading has been open, although some thought that it should have closed for a time, it did not. But today, two months later, traders return to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. And as the lockdowns unlock one-by-one across most of the country and The Wall Street Journal writes that the worst may be behind us. Let's hope so. The markets took off on that news. And, of course, the President took notice.",

And then you've got today, the U.S. stock market performing really well in the neighborhood of 25,000 once again. Now, there's some folks who look at that. And, you know, the consumer confidence number is coming off of a pretty steep low.

There's also the practical matter of close to $10 trillion of fiscal and monetary stimulus coursing through the veins of the American economy.   Certainly, some of that is finding that way in the stock market. But what this President cares about and what I care about is not Wall Street. It's Main Street. And what I see basically, as we open up this economy, we're going to have to do it gradually because of the social distancing. But we are going to be doing that. And I think that - what matters here is trends. And we basically crash to a stop and now I think what you're going to see is a steady trend upward. And again, what's going to be important here is making sure that we manufacture things here, because that's the only way we're going to be able to have the kind of medicines and protective equipment we need, but also the kind of jobs we need. So that's kind of my focus. We've got to have both the assembly plants here for whatever it is and the supply chains.

The evidence, Martha, is overwhelming that the Chinese Communist Party foisted this pandemic on the world, destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth, and they killed close to 100,000 Americans so far.   If Joe Biden wants to blame President Trump for that and not even talk about China, that's perfectly consistent with the kowtowing he did for eight years as Vice President and 30 years when he was up on Capitol Hill.

Then they will go ahead with this crazy insanity of basically trying to basically grind with their jackboots, the people of Hong Kong into the dirt. And it's their choice, not ours.

When I said it was a duty, what I meant was that at least in our case and we don't assert that our situation is instructed for anybody else, but in our case we got 40 plus thousand young people who have indicated that they want to be on our campus. They sent money and deposits in record numbers. And for us to say we're just not up to this, we can't figure out how to protect those who are vulnerable, so you all take a year off or find another option we believe would not be to live up to our assignment and our duty.",

But today, two months later, traders return to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

My focus, Martha, is on making sure that a lot of the new jobs that get created, or the ones in manufacturing, because those are going to be the ones that ultimately propel us through this crisis."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And given the situation that is underway, that needs a rethink. But I just want to pop up this consumer confidence number for me, which was a surprise to the upside. And then you've got today, the U.S. stock market performing really well in the neighborhood of 25,000 once again. Now, there's some folks who look at that. And, you know, the consumer confidence number is coming off of a pretty steep low. But the stock market, some think, is hyper inflated that to rebound when we are going to continue to have some economic troubles and some jobs that won't come back is a bit overly optimistic. What do you say to them?"

And basically, what the stock market is, is a look forward to a future stream of expected earnings. And as we're getting back to work, things are looking much better in that regard. There's also the practical matter of close to $10 trillion of fiscal and monetary stimulus coursing through the veins of the American economy. Certainly, some of that is finding that way in the stock market. But what this President cares about and what I care about is not Wall Street. It's Main Street. And what I see basically, as we open up this economy, we're going to have to do it gradually because of the social distancing. But we are going to be doing that. And I think that - what matters here is trends. And we basically crash to a stop and now I think what you're going to see is a steady trend upward. And again, what's going to be important here is making sure that we manufacture things here, because that's the only way we're going to be able to have the kind of medicines and protective equipment we need, but also the kind of jobs we need. So that's kind of my focus. We've got to have both the assembly plants here for whatever it is and the supply chains.

From a political perspective, the Biden campaign is beginning to make the argument that the mistakes that were made by the Trump administration led to this economic devastation, that the crisis of the pandemic would not have been as bad as it has become if it weren't for some of the things that happened from this White House. So, that's the argument that they're going to make and that that led to the shutdown of the economy and economic devastation. What will be your answer for that, Mr. Navarro?"

The evidence, Martha, is overwhelming that the Chinese Communist Party foisted this pandemic on the world, destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth, and they killed close to 100,000 Americans so far. If Joe Biden wants to blame President Trump for that and not even talk about China, that's perfectly consistent with the kowtowing he did for eight years as Vice President and 30 years when he was up on Capitol Hill. And that's not going to stand, have at it, Joe, we're coming at you on China, if you're going to pull that kind of stuff."

But I can tell you is what the Chinese Communist Party is trying to do with Hong Kong is take away their promised freedoms 30 years earlier and do what they did with the people in Xinjiang in Tibet, put them in concentration camps. And so, what we have here is a choice by the Chinese Communist Party if they want to end. Hong Kong is the financial capital of Asia. Then they will go ahead with this crazy insanity of basically trying to basically grind with their jackboots, the people of Hong Kong into the dirt. And it's their choice, not ours. If they make that choice, I think the world is going to react in a way just like they did with Tiananmen Square."

What this President's about, what we're here about at the White House is American jobs for the American people. And these pharma companies need to get that memo.

China seems to be gearing up its military actions over there. China is also putting pressure on Taiwan. China is also taking up some actions in the East China Sea. It's also trying to impose some restrictions on other countries, especially in the Western Hemisphere, not to deal with Taiwan. And look at what they are trying to do to Hong Kong right now. And I think that it's quite obvious that the Chinese government is trying to take advantage of the situation that everybody is busy. But I think we need to stay vigilant and we are staying vigilant. If Hong Kong falls or if the Chinese government imposed a national security, the legislation on Hong Kong, we don't know what is going to happen next.

But what they are trying to do is fully taking over Hong Kong's administration. And we are also concerned that China might take some military action against Taiwan. That's what I said all along. When the Chinese government is facing crisis domestically, the best way forward is to find a scapegoat outside. And Taiwan can be a very easy scapegoat for China. And we are watching very carefully. And of course, we don't want China to think that Taiwan is so vulnerable that they can take over Taiwan very shortly by military means. So, we're trying to get the support from the United States and from around the world diplomatically.

He is with his wife, with whom he's been quarantined for, what, 10 weeks? Something like that. Nine weeks. He's not a COVID carrier. So, the idea you're wearing a mask to protect someone else doesn't seem to apply here, especially the fact that he's outdoors, where there's very little empirical data indicating that the virus spreads very easily outdoors. In addition to that, if you look at all the other video of the event, he said, well, out of six foot range for nearly everybody he comes in contact with, and you really don't get it by simply passing somebody.

People who tend to be conservative and or support Donald Trump tend to think that the danger of this outbreak has been overblown and people who think it's absolutely terrifying. And that we all might likely to die. I think are tend to be people who do not support Mr. Trump and are not conservatives. And that's just the way it goes.

You know, he goes to this whole ritual with his hair, he sprays it into submission, and he's got it all combed up in a certain way so that it covers his forehead. He's obviously very, very concerned about his appearance. A lot of people don't think he has very good taste. But this is the way he wants to look, and he cares a lot about it and doesn't like to look at any other way. And I think, you know, he put on that mask out at that plant without in Michigan or wherever it was the other day. And I don't think he'd like the way it looked on him.

And while we have seen many new documents in this case, we still haven't seen the transcript of the actual calls. Do those transcripts exist? It appears that they do and that now we may be one step closer to getting a look at them. In a final move by acting spy chief Richard Grenell, he'd declassify those transcripts along with additional Russia investigation document, so now it is up to President Trump's newly minted Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to decide whether or not he will make those public.

We will probably give them a second chance but it will go on the record and if they are defiant about it well, at our school at least, we don't -- we don't tolerate repeated rules violations, and we ask them to depart."

      "utterance": "OK. There is an interesting poll that shows that 18 percent of teachers say that they are not likely to return to teaching. And 69 percent say that they will. You were given some criticism recently for sounding, you know, somewhat unsympathetic to a teacher who said that, she wasn't ready to face hordes of students until there was a vaccine. Well, what's your comment on that at this point, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANIELS",
      "utterance": "Complete mischaracterization, I couldn't have been more sympathetic. It's a very -- you know, fear is probably the most basic human emotion and we shouldn't criticize anyone who expresses it. However, what is important here is our entire focus all those things I just mentioned and dozens more I could is aimed at protecting those might be vulnerable. It starts with our faculty. It includes our staff too. It will include some students --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I want to squeeze in one last question, because I think that you address this when you talked about how much students wanted to come back, you gave a very interesting virtual commencement speech and you talked about one of our biggest concerns for this age group is loneliness. And you said that 50 percent -- that being lonely or lacking strong relationships raises the risk of premature death by 50 percent, is worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Why are you so concerned about loneliness among young people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANIELS",
      "utterance": "I never expected to be but I'm hardly alone. There are a lot of studies and books out which alerted me to this issue. I'm concerned because I think it so sadly ironic. In the first place we live in the richest, freest and despite the current pandemic, safest world that's ever been. A terrible irony to be sad, let alone lonely there in that situation. And I'm also concerned that much about the current society that plummeting birth -- in birth rates mean that a lot of these young people have fewer siblings or relatives, they can't control that but they could control it. And I mentioned this, the social media addiction which I guess all of us from time to time fall prey to."

      "speaker": "JIM GRAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the NBA is going to return. They'll have a meeting this week and then they will take a vote to the board of governors, it looks like they'll sequester everybody and they will go into quarantine in Orlando and they will decide whether they are going to finish the regular season or just go straight to the playoffs. So, the NBA it looks good. Major League Baseball has a tremendous problem with the union. Those players are going to have to come together, they are going to take pay decreases and the owners and the players are going to exchange proposals and that's not looking too good. Football will play. I believe Stephen Ross is right, he would know, he's an owner in the National Football League. Whether or not they have fans is going to depend on these municipalities. So, I think that there are some hurdles with that, but certainly playing, as long as they can keep all of these people healthy and the virus cooperates in the summer, I believe the NFL will kick off on time."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Just 30 seconds, but it's amazing one NBA player testing positive changed so much in that sport. What's going to happen now if people test positive? Will it be very different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they know a little bit more about the virus, and as long as the rest of the team (AUDIO GAP) contaminated and they don't test positive you'll have to take that player out for however long it takes them to get well. Quarantine them and then recirculate and bring them back if they're healthy enough to play. The problem would be for football. If you had three or four offensive lineman, if they got injured in a meeting and they got -- came down with this virus, then you've got a quarterback whose stand back and back there is going to get killed without his regular guys, then you've got a much bigger problem. So, there are a lot -- a lot of logistics --"
