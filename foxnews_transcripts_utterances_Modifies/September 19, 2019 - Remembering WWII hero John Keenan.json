We're talking about a country that is continuing to, directly and indirectly, support al-Qaeda.  Now, we just observe the 18th anniversary of the day that al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11. The day that, that evil visited our country killing thousands of Americans. So, I don't take lightly people who say, well, you know, Saudi Arabia, yes, they're not -- they're not that great, but you know, we need them.  Look, Saudi Arabia is continuing to support our enemy, al-Qaeda, in places like Yemen, and Syria.

This complaint concern conduct by someone outside the Intelligence Community and did not relate to any intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the DNI.\" For context, the President is outside the Intel Community and has broad power to declassify Intel secrets. But this has created a big-time standoff over the separation of powers and House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff believes the information is being illegally withheld. Listen.",

In the five weeks prior to the complaint, the President spoke with Russian President Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, along with leaders from Pakistan, the Netherlands, and Qatar. And the President himself called it fake news saying he knows people are listening to his calls. \"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call? I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA.\" We should note, lawmakers on both sides have indicated the allegation might be a bit overblown. Martha?",

And later spent more than 30 years in New York City law enforcement. Worked his way up to become New York City's chief police detective and then after all of that, what did he do? He caught the serial killer known as the Son of Sam who terrorized New York City. This was a remarkable man who lived a remarkable life and had a beautiful family. It is hard to imagine a more full and blessed life and we are grateful that we got the chance to meet John Keenan and we send our sympathies to his beautiful family on this night.

That was from the other day So, then, after that, Secretary Pompeo made it clear that the United States believes that it was Iranian weapons that were used. There is a picture of them on the New York Post today. And that the attack came from the north, not from the south where the Houthi rebels in Yemen originally claimed responsibility.

Not that we would take orders from Saudi Arabia about how we would respond."

      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple of points here. First of all, I think Trump's tweet was very clear. And if he didn't mean what he said, then he should clarify and actually say what he means. As president of the United States, you've got to be very careful about the words that you're using, because they carry a lot of impact. Secondly, this is -- this is about something bigger than, you know, just a complex relationship with Saudi Arabia or having an ally who is not perfect. We're talking about a country that is continuing to, directly and indirectly, support al-Qaeda. Now, we just observe the 18th anniversary of the day that al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11. The day that, that evil visited our country killing thousands of Americans. So, I don't take lightly people who say, well, you know, Saudi Arabia, yes, they're not -- they're not that great, but you know, we need them. Look, Saudi Arabia is continuing to support our enemy, al-Qaeda, in places like Yemen, and Syria. What to speak of what they're doing every year spending billions of dollars to propagate this extreme Wahhabi ideology that's fuelling terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda."

But there are also people who, you know, look back at the things that you have said in the past, and sort of see that there are kind of two camps in the Middle East. That you have, you know, that you have Iran and Syria with the backing of Russia. And then you have the United States and Israel, and the Saudi and -- the Saudi Arabia and the UAE. So, they see you more in the camp that is on the side of Iran and Syria. And they question that Congresswoman Gabbard. What do you say to them?"

And I took an oath and I promised to be willing to put my life on the line to serve and protect our country. To protect the people of our country. So, that is my sole focus.

      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we've got to look at the situation for what it is. This, provocation as you put it did not just come from out of nowhere. It is a retaliation and it's a retaliation against the extreme sanctions that are on Iran. That's basically making it impossible for them to sell their oil around the world. So, we've just got to be clear-eyed about what's really happening and how -- if we continue down this course, this path we are on. I think you heard former Secretary Panetta allude to this that we will see a cycle of retaliation, tit-for-tat just continuing to go forward and escalate that can only lead to an all-out inferno."

I mean, this is a person who's aligned herself with Bashar al-Assad, who is the mass -- who refuses to call him a murderer, refuses to call him a war criminal. Said that when she traveled to Syria, everybody supported Bashar al-Assad, a man who has massacred between quarter a million and half a million people, and used poison gas in his own people. And is also the number one ally of Iran, as you pointed out. So, let's take her criticism with a grain of salt. But if you want to prove it, just there in that interview, when you asked her, she blamed Donald Trump for the tensions. It's not Iran. Iran is the number one state sponsor of terror in the Middle East. They're supporting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Shia militias, the Houthi rebels in Yemen. This is aggressive regime that is spreading terror and expansionism across the Middle East, and she blames Donald from sanctions for provoking this attack? That's absolutely absurd."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "But then -- but then she just defended Iran, and basically said that Donald Trump is responsible for the escalation. Look, let's put this in context. This is not -- this is a conflict that started before Donald Trump came into office. In 2012, Iran launched a massive cyber-attack against Saudi Aramco, because of Barack Obama sanctions. And what they were doing is they were testing the Obama administration to see whether they would impose costs on them for their -- for their aggression. And instead, what Barack Obama did is he gave them billions of dollars in sanctions relief through the nuclear deal and that didn't change Iran's behavior, it fuelled it. So, when Trump came into office, Iran was on the march across the Middle East. If they had nothing to do with his sanctions, they were -- they were on the -- in Syria, and in Yemen, and across the Middle East."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "So, he has to impose some sort of cost. But, it doesn't necessarily have to be kinetic. So, when they shot down a U.S. drone, he didn't respond with a kinetic attack, but he responded with a cyberattack that was quite devastating. And then, when they started threatening shipping and oil shipping in the Middle East, he launched -- The New York Times reported, it's gotten very little attention, he launched a massive cyber-attack that absolutely crippled Iran's ability to target shipping. So, what they have done now is they've escalated, now they're going after the Saudi oil refineries. So, there's lots of options on the table that don't involve an attack -- kinetic attack on the Iran property. He could take in it -- he could take out Iranian targets inside Syria who are not supposed to be there. Or he could launch another cyberattacks. So, there's a -- I'm sure that his military advisors and Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Esper are going to give him a plate of options. And there are many things that he could choose to do that would be an appropriate response. But doing nothing is not an option and certainly not giving in the way Congresswoman Gabbard wants to do by giving -- by lifting the sanctions in extremity. I mean, lifting sanctions in exchange for a terror or for an attack on the -- on the U.S. ally? Is she insane?"

The Inspector General for Intel agencies Michael Atkinson read the complaint, believed it was urgent and thought he was legally obligated to notify Congress. But the acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is refusing to give lawmakers the complaint and the general counsel for the DNI offered this reasoning. \"The allegations did not fall within the statutory definition of an urgent concern. This complaint concern conduct by someone outside the Intelligence Community and did not relate to any intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of the DNI.\" For context, the President is outside the Intel Community and has broad power to declassify Intel secrets. But this has created a big-time standoff over the separation of powers and House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff believes the information is being illegally withheld. Listen."

Another source told the Times the complaint was part of a commitment the President made during the communication with another world leader, but which foreign leader remains unknown. In the five weeks prior to the complaint, the President spoke with Russian President Putin, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, along with leaders from Pakistan, the Netherlands, and Qatar. And the President himself called it fake news saying he knows people are listening to his calls. \"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially heavily populated call? I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA.\" We should note, lawmakers on both sides have indicated the allegation might be a bit overblown. Martha?"

And so I agree with you, on one of the rare situations I agree with Mr. Mudd. I think this is outrageous conduct and the President is entitled to negotiate on behalf of the United States and its constitutional power. And I just can't imagine a situation where whatever he said to one of these individuals could be said as making a promise or a commitment that steps over the line because the President's powers are so broad."

What about the criticism of the Department of Justice? Because some are saying that they sort of stepped in between here to prevent what Democrats see as the correct procedure which would be to release the report to the Intelligence Committee to get them to have a look at it but the DOJ is standing in the way of that?"

The chief economist there said, yes, more people are going to go to smoking to get that nicotine rather than doing something that's 95 percent safer."

And I like the fruity flavor. A lot of adults do. I don't know if I would have ever switched to vaping if it was only the tobacco flavors. And to conflate this issue with the illnesses and the deaths is completely illogical because most sources say that the most of the cases are due to the illegal THC vapes because it has a vitamin E component in there. But I actually spoke to someone named Kerrie Wage (Ph), she is a (Inaudible)reduction researcher, she has a background in pharmacology, background in neuroscience. She said she would be surprised if any of them were due to nicotine, because that component is not required to heat up the nicotine to make it go away."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",

Now there's a lot of things out that kids shouldn't be doing that adults can do even though it's not good for them. For example, there's a lot of kids that struggle with obesity. That's a real problem in this country too. I still think that I, as an adult, should be allowed to eat a cheeseburger if I want. It's the exact same thing."

    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, this is even more extreme because again, these are THC vapes that are off the black market, most of the black market, but THC vapes. That's completely different than nicotine in the way that politicians and the media have treated this issue is very irresponsible because they just write in the headline another death from vaping. Another there's from vaping. I have people telling me you need to quit. You're going to die immediately. I'm like that's not what happening. That's totally different and it's irresponsible, and it's whipping up hysteria that's completely not necessary and now I can't get my mango pods anymore and when I can get my mango pods, we have a problem."

The World War II veteran from the greatest generation dedicated his life to serving our country. He landed on Utah beach on June 6th, 1944. Fought in the Battle of the Bulge. And later spent more than 30 years in New York City law enforcement. Worked his way up to become New York City's chief police detective and then after all of that, what did he do? He caught the serial killer known as the Son of Sam who terrorized New York City. This was a remarkable man who lived a remarkable life and had a beautiful family. It is hard to imagine a more full and blessed life and we are grateful that we got the chance to meet John Keenan and we send our sympathies to his beautiful family on this night. This is “The Story,” Thursday, September 19, 2019. “The Story” goes on. So we will see you back here in New York City tomorrow night at 7:00 o'clock. Good night, everybody.
