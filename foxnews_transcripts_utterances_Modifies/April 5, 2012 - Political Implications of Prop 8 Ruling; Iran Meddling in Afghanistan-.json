It's going to end up in the Supreme Court. It's quite likely the Supreme Court will reverse this.   What I think we're doing here is recapitulating the history of abortion, when in the early '70s the judges decided to wipe out all the laws of the land on abortion and say that abortion is legal. Now, I'll read you what Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Supreme Court Justice, a liberal who supports legalized abortion, said that before she ended up on the courts: \"Roe v. Wade halted a political process that was moving in a reform direction and thereby prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue.\" This is exactly what has happened here with gay marriage. At the time abortion was being legalized in New York and elsewhere and we ended up with a large number of Americans who felt left out with no democratic means of changing the ruling. That's happening on gay marriage.   Look, Prop 8 passed by 52 percent of the vote. The same referendum eight years earlier in the same state passed with 62 percent. It's obvious where the trend is headed and over time states are legalizing gay marriages is happened the right bay by legislative action in D.C. in Maine -- I'm sorry, in Vermont and New Hampshire. And that is how it ought to be done. Otherwise we're going to have embittered the country and there's going to be no recourse in the vote in the legislative assemblies because of a ruling by fiat of judges.

At the same time, though, he opened the door that I think should have remained closed when he talked about the United States and Iran having quote \"mutual interests\" unquote in Afghanistan. It is preposterous for him to be saying that right now. We have reams of evidence of Iran supporting Al Qaeda, supporting Taliban, supporting like-minded groups in Afghanistan -- people who are killing our soldiers every day. Nobody disputes this. Nobody serious disputes this.   We saw in the WikiLeaks documents that came out last week more evidence of this, things that details about the extent of the support. And it's very troubling. If you are Ahmadinejad, and the president of United States is saying that we have mutual interests in Afghanistan, you are meeting with Hamid Karzai and thinking, what is the president of the United States saying?

When the Soviets left, the leader was Afghanistan was left behind, hid in the U.N. compound was ripped out by the Mujahedeen, tortured, lynched and left in a horrible position indescribable on television. The Afghans remember that. And when they hear, as Julie and Stephen said, a) that the president yesterday is talking about negotiations with Iran over Afghanistan, cutting a deal and secondly hearing in the speech that the president gave in December that he is going to do a surge but we're going to begin leaving in July of 2011, when they hear all of that, they remember what happened. And that's why, he's looking to cut his deal before the Americans leave. That is why it's all understandable. I think the original sin here was announcing a transition withdrawal date and also, these negotiations with Iran. How can the president of Afghanistan, who lives in the region, and Iran is not going away, be more anti-Iranian than the Americans who want to open negotiations?

      "utterance": "They were. The timing is bad. And you had the president in a meeting with journalists and think tank-types talking about both sanctions and the effect they are having and the fact that the administration is being tougher on Iran with respect to sanctions, trying to squeeze with our European allies. And the administration thinks it's having some effect. At the same time, though, he opened the door that I think should have remained closed when he talked about the United States and Iran having quote \"mutual interests\" unquote in Afghanistan. It is preposterous for him to be saying that right now. We have reams of evidence of Iran supporting Al Qaeda, supporting Taliban, supporting like-minded groups in Afghanistan -- people who are killing our soldiers every day. Nobody disputes this. Nobody serious disputes this. We saw in the WikiLeaks documents that came out last week more evidence of this, things that details about the extent of the support. And it's very troubling. If you are Ahmadinejad, and the president of United States is saying that we have mutual interests in Afghanistan, you are meeting with Hamid Karzai and thinking, what is the president of the United States saying? Does he not understand that we are basically at war with them in Afghanistan?"

      "utterance": "Karzai, what a scamp, right? He loves playing U.S. and Iran off of each other. He is upset about this early pull out of Afghanistan, so he is saying, oh, you are going to leave me, now this is going to happen. And then on the other hand we have a sort of incoherent policy from Washington, you wonder if State Department is talking to the NSC because you have two such different messages coming out of the State Department and White House. So it's hard to suss out where the administration is going with, you know, overture of possible negotiations. It's hard to imagine what kind of constructive role Iran could play in Afghanistan."

      "utterance": "However, you have to think in his terms. When the Soviets left, the leader was Afghanistan was left behind, hid in the U.N. compound was ripped out by the Mujahedeen, tortured, lynched and left in a horrible position indescribable on television. The Afghans remember that. And when they hear, as Julie and Stephen said, a) that the president yesterday is talking about negotiations with Iran over Afghanistan, cutting a deal and secondly hearing in the speech that the president gave in December that he is going to do a surge but we're going to begin leaving in July of 2011, when they hear all of that, they remember what happened. And that's why, he's looking to cut his deal before the Americans leave. That is why it's all understandable. I think the original sin here was announcing a transition withdrawal date and also, these negotiations with Iran. How can the president of Afghanistan, who lives in the region, and Iran is not going away, be more anti-Iranian than the Americans who want to open negotiations? So even though personally he is not a sweet guy, you have to understand his motive."
