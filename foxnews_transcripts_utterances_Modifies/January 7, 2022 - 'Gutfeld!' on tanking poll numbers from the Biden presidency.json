It's day five of our no audience shows. I'm starting to understand how Chris Hayes feels. The Dork. That kid? No, no, I doubt. So it appears that Joe's got no time to think as his ratings continue to shrink. A new poll shows a measly 11 percent of adults believe Biden is a very strong leader. The same 11 percent also think Tiger Woods is a scary place for a picnic. That's like a Rob O'Neill joke. Meantime, 57 percent of respondents, that's a majority, Kat, call him a weak leader. But if the President were standing here today, would he say he's never given any free time? Or any time to think?",

You can probably find that answer in a tweet that he posted yesterday to commemorate the only thing he has going for him, the January 6 riot or as I like to call it Ashli Babbitt day. Yes, Joe, put that in your ensure and drink it you, mummy. Here's his tweet in full. I've said it many times, and it is no more true or real then when we think about the events of January 6, we are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that by the grace of God, and by the goodness and greatness of this nation, we will win. So to quote Gandhi, what it the (BLEEP) is that about? Seriously, this is kind of a big deal, because the President of the United States just said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And that implies a good side and a bad side, right? With two teams. Which means if you're watching this show, and you like this show, you're probably on the bad team. So he's not including you in the we. So who is we? Him and Jill? Him and Kamala? Him and his imaginary friend Walter? The talking celery stick? Is it Liz Cheney? If she were any more of a phony Democrat, she'd get an extra vote in 2020. But the thing is, it can't be all Americans, right? Because then his premise for that speech would make any sense. And the special day of commemoration wouldn't be necessary because we'd all be unified and he'd be a beloved president. It would all be dancing naked in a meadow like Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy on ketamine at the Lilith fair. Those were the days.",

And that scrambled egg he calls a mind. But he's made this claim on a fabricated commemoration targeting his political adversaries. And Democrats were saying it's worse than Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Yes, that might be the worst comparison since the NFL is like slavery. But Joe's defined himself against something that doesn't even exist. A white substance This movement of violent insurrection. None of that is real. Of course he also tried to compare himself against Trump but Trump's not even President, he's not even running against Joe. So again, Joe's defining himself against a mirage. And why is that? Because his leadership is a mirage, a disaster on four legs, you can't get worse than Joe and Kam. So they need to distract by demonizing you. And this from the administration that brought you parents complaining about schools are terrorists. But in that tweet, and in that speech yesterday, he wasn't talking to us. He was talking about us, and that's pretty gross. Maybe I'm nuts, but to Joe just kind of declare a civil war on a sizable portion of America, because I can't believe he thinks we're at war with just one guy like Trump or a freakin a viking hat. He just picked one-half of the country gets the other like he was picking sides for a dodgeball game. By the way, you might not even believe this crap. Because like his bladder, it's not him who's in control. But there are people in his White House who believe were evil, you and me, because he didn't vote for them. Maybe you voted for the other guy, who knows? And now Joe uses January 6 to declare a war over the soul of a country. So back to that question, is Joe a strong leader? Well, hard times are supposed to bring out the best in men? But what if the best in one man is long gone? And all you have is a hollowed out husk open for exploitation from any woek operative. But I guess when you collapse Afghanistan, spike inflation and crime and can't control corona, all that's left is creating a fake emergency. It seems like that's what we have right now. And when I say we, I mean we the people as an all Americans, and we all know that there's no battle for the soul of this country. But the fact that the President says it, so should scare the crap out of all of us.",

It's day five of our no audience shows. I'm starting to understand how Chris Hayes feels. The Dork. That kid? No, no, I doubt. So it appears that Joe's got no time to think as his ratings continue to shrink. A new poll shows a measly 11 percent of adults believe Biden is a very strong leader. The same 11 percent also think Tiger Woods is a scary place for a picnic. That's like a Rob O'Neill joke. Meantime, 57 percent of respondents, that's a majority, Kat, call him a weak leader. But if the President were standing here today, would he say he's never given any free time? Or any time to think?"

You can probably find that answer in a tweet that he posted yesterday to commemorate the only thing he has going for him, the January 6 riot or as I like to call it Ashli Babbitt day. Yes, Joe, put that in your ensure and drink it you, mummy. Here's his tweet in full. I've said it many times, and it is no more true or real then when we think about the events of January 6, we are in a battle for the soul of America. A battle that by the grace of God, and by the goodness and greatness of this nation, we will win. So to quote Gandhi, what it the (BLEEP) is that about? Seriously, this is kind of a big deal, because the President of the United States just said we are in a battle for the soul of America. And that implies a good side and a bad side, right? With two teams. Which means if you're watching this show, and you like this show, you're probably on the bad team. So he's not including you in the we. So who is we? Him and Jill? Him and Kamala? Him and his imaginary friend Walter? The talking celery stick? Is it Liz Cheney? If she were any more of a phony Democrat, she'd get an extra vote in 2020. But the thing is, it can't be all Americans, right? Because then his premise for that speech would make any sense. And the special day of commemoration wouldn't be necessary because we'd all be unified and he'd be a beloved president. It would all be dancing naked in a meadow like Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy on ketamine at the Lilith fair. Those were the days."

And that scrambled egg he calls a mind. But he's made this claim on a fabricated commemoration targeting his political adversaries. And Democrats were saying it's worse than Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Yes, that might be the worst comparison since the NFL is like slavery. But Joe's defined himself against something that doesn't even exist. A white substance This movement of violent insurrection. None of that is real. Of course he also tried to compare himself against Trump but Trump's not even President, he's not even running against Joe. So again, Joe's defining himself against a mirage. And why is that? Because his leadership is a mirage, a disaster on four legs, you can't get worse than Joe and Kam. So they need to distract by demonizing you. And this from the administration that brought you parents complaining about schools are terrorists. But in that tweet, and in that speech yesterday, he wasn't talking to us. He was talking about us, and that's pretty gross. Maybe I'm nuts, but to Joe just kind of declare a civil war on a sizable portion of America, because I can't believe he thinks we're at war with just one guy like Trump or a freakin a viking hat. He just picked one-half of the country gets the other like he was picking sides for a dodgeball game. By the way, you might not even believe this crap. Because like his bladder, it's not him who's in control. But there are people in his White House who believe were evil, you and me, because he didn't vote for them. Maybe you voted for the other guy, who knows? And now Joe uses January 6 to declare a war over the soul of a country. So back to that question, is Joe a strong leader? Well, hard times are supposed to bring out the best in men? But what if the best in one man is long gone? And all you have is a hollowed out husk open for exploitation from any woek operative. But I guess when you collapse Afghanistan, spike inflation and crime and can't control corona, all that's left is creating a fake emergency. It seems like that's what we have right now. And when I say we, I mean we the people as an all Americans, and we all know that there's no battle for the soul of this country. But the fact that the President says it, so should scare the crap out of all of us."

Yes, apparently more time at home more trash, more food waste, and more workouts in our living rooms, have room -- have homes smelling worse than Kilmeade after eating four bowls of oat bran. Thanks to fewer social occasions and everyone working from home. Or as Jeffrey Toobin calls it masturbating.

And that's where the smell comes from. Everyone was stuck in the same place in the same room just breathing and farting together like pets and people and kids and you're making your own food. And then, people got the bright idea. They watched \"Game Changers\" on Netflix, that documentary about going vegan. So, everyone went vegan at the beginning of the pandemic, and everyone was eating beans because you need something that fills you up. Because, you know, it's like potato chips and salt aren't going to do it. Oddly enough. Yes, people were just breathing, farting, vegan bean eaters in misery and those who lost their sense of smell were actually the lucky ones."

Of course, burrito is Spanish for little donkey, another thing North Koreans would gladly eat since they're starving. The propaganda network airing mouth-watering images of burrito making and happy North Koreans chowing down on the popular street food and selling the story that their former dictator actually birthed the idea that burrito before he passed away in 2011.

Thrice at this point now. That's two shots and a booster. And I've been pretty lucky through this whole process. I haven't shown any symptoms during this, but my you know, all my kids are dealing with it right now. So, my household is dealing with it, my neighborhood is dealing with it. And when you turn on the news, you'll literally get -- a Fauci will give a speech, then President Biden will give a speech, then the head of the CDC will give a speech. And each speech is literally a different language. So, it's just too confusing. I just don't, I don't even bother anymore. The first they told us 10 days, then it was, oh, we ran out a test. OK, scratch it. Make it five days. You don't make deals like that you do that when you're making when you're bartering or negotiating on used car, not not dealing with pandemic?"

Your doctor's going to give it to you straight, and you're not going to get the (INAUDIBLE) or the politicalization of all this, because that's really what it's becoming is extremely frustrating for those of us who have to work for a living and travel for a living.
