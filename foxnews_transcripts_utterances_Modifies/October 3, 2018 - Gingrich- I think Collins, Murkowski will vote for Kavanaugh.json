      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. And from Washington, D.C., welcome to \"Hannity.\" This is a Fox News alert: we can report sources are telling us tonight the FBI supplemental report on Judge Kavanaugh is now complete, it is done, and my sources say the Senate is now in possession of copies. And they will be looking at it tomorrow. My sources are also telling me tonight, no new bombshell information in this report. It just reiterates what we already know. From the Senate Judiciary Committee investigation, and what they have already found. And now, it's time for senators to step up and do their job and vote. Enough with the delay tactics, enough with the smears and the slander. We have a lot more on this in just a moment tonight. Also, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, he has been stonewalled by Professor Ford's partisan legal team. They are denying all access to very extremely important pieces of evidence and this comes as new questions are being raised about Professor Ford's testimony by a longtime ex-boyfriend. We'll bring you that report. And also tonight, now that the smears and the FBI investigation are not working, don't be surprised because the Democrats, they want to shift the topic. Now, they want the vote to be about temperament and whether Judge Kavanaugh threw ice at a bar at somebody in college. Any Republican that allows the slander to become the new standard in this country is a disgrace. It will never end and you will be encouraging this behavior. We have all the latest examples of the left trying to govern by mob rule as they continue to stop over simple, basic, American human rights, decency, due process, and something called the presumption of innocence. And, by the way, a heavy dose of common sense and so much more. But we are watching is a thirst for power that knows no bounds. Lying, smearing, besmirching, bludgeoning, bullying, to score cheap political victories, no matter how many lives are destroyed in the process. And, of course, your friends in the corrupt media, the best friends of the Democrats, they are cheering all of this on, moving from story to story, raising the bar day after day, all to malign the president, and anybody and everybody around him. All right. Stay tuned for tonight's jam-packed Washington, D.C., swamp breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "As we just reported moments ago, sources are telling me tonight the FBI has in fact completed their background check on Judge Kavanaugh. All 100 senators and nine staff members will have access to that report, which will be kept in a safe for the Senate Judiciary Committee. This comes as the chairman of that committee, Chuck Grassley, is sounding the alarm about obstruction coming from Professor Ford's extremely bitterly partisan legal team. Now, this week, we told you about this, the Judiciary Committee requested access to material evidence of Professor Ford's sexual misconduct claims, including notes for her therapy sessions that she already had handed over to \"The Washington Post.\" Any reportings of her polygraph test, and Professor Ford's attorney are flatly denying the Senate Judiciary's request. So much for a real investigation. And tonight in a letter, Grassley fired back. He wrote, quote: The Constitution tasks the Senate, not the media or the FBI, with providing advice and consent for Supreme Court nominees. It is beyond disappointing that Dr. Ford's attorneys were willing to share evidence with \"The Washington Post\" many weeks ago but to this day refused to share the same evidence which Dr. Ford relied on in her testimony with the U.S. Senate. It's important to remember that Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, as you see on the screen, she is a far left, huge, big-time Democratic donor. Remember, she was the one that was recommended by Dianne Feinstein. He wouldn't tell the Republicans about the whole issue for weeks and weeks, after -- two weeks after, and once vowed to resist Donald Trump. We've showed you that tape on ABC. Katz has not been cooperative with a committee from the very beginning, stalling whenever and however possible. And according to Professor Ford's sworn testimony, her attorneys never even released numerous and persistent attempts from Senator Grassley and Republicans to arrange an interview with Senate Judiciary investigators. Debra Katz is not to be trusted. Her motivations, again, recommended by Dianne Feinstein, have long been political, including multiple instances when she defended Bill Clinton and creepy Al Franken from their misconduct allegations. She even made light twice of Paula Jones' accusations against Clinton, saying that Jones -- oh, she suffered no repercussions because the incident only lasted 10 to 12 minutes. He exposed himself in front of Paula Jones and he wanted a sexual favor. I thought Dianne Feinstein recommended a lawyer. I thought this woman was supposed to be a champion of women's rights. It's only true for Democratic women. And meanwhile, Professor Ford is facing some allegations of her own. In a written declaration to the U.S. Senate, a man who was Professor Ford's longtime boyfriend between 1992 and '98 is raising serious issues about her testimony tonight. During the hearing, Ford claimed to have issues with confined spaces, riding in airplanes, homes with only one door, because of PTSD symptoms surrounding her alleged sexual assaults. According to her former boyfriend, whose name has been redacted, Ford never expressed these issues with small spaces. She frequently flew in airplanes to and from Hawaii, lived in a small 500 square foot apartment, with only one door, never mentioned anything about being assaulted. He also claimed that Ford once counseled a friend on how to pass a polygraph test prior to a job interview with the FBI, a claim that friend has denied. Now, remember, during Ford's testimony, she emphasized her total and experience with polygraphs. And naturally, ABC, CBS -- well, they have totally ignored the story during their morning coverage. That is called bias of omission. It shouldn't shock us. Now, meanwhile, in case of just plain bias, \"The Daily Caller\" is reporting that three different NBC News stories on Judge Kavanaugh, three of them, face huge accuracy issues. By the way, Andy Lack, Tom Brokaw, are you proud of your network? Tom Brokaw, the brand you spent a lifetime building, are you happy now to be an arm of the Democratic Party? And as you can see, the left does not care about evidence, due process, presumption of innocence, the Constitution, none of it. They don't even care with this impending FBI report will uncover or not uncover. Dianne Feinstein doesn't want to show it to you. Almost all Democrats have been against Brett Kavanaugh or whoever the president would have chosen from day one. They are only now pretending to care about allegations against Kavanaugh because they want to stop the confirmation vote. To them, sadly, this is about power and political gamesmanship. Whether or not Kavanaugh is guilty makes no difference in the Democrats in this pursuit of power. Something by the way even Spartacus himself, Senator Cory Booker, admitted to during a recent interview. Take a look. SEN. CORY BOOKER, D—N.J.: So, my hope is that beyond vicious partisan rancor that is going on, beyond the accusations, we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country and ultimately ask ourselves the question, is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment? Ultimately, not whether he is innocent or guilty, this is not a trial, but, ultimately, has enough questions be raised that we should not move on to another candidate?",

Guilty of all charges regardless of what the evidence shows? This is so reckless. Think of where this can take us! And if what Cory Booker said is the new standard -- well, guess what, Spartacus, you should not be a senator based on your own standards and your own words. Remember he once bragged about your own sexual assault as a young man writing about groping a woman in high school, even after she said no and pushed you away. Bye-bye, Spartacus. I guess it's time for you to leave the U.S. Senate in shame. Now, that's why we call them the party of smears. This is why I keep bringing up the idea of slander, and lies, and character assassination, and family bludgeoning, all for political power over -- and sacrificing the rule of law and justice. Things we should all hold deeply, that should not be political. As we speak, they are doing anything and everything to stall, scared Senator Jeff snowflake and others into voting against Kavanaugh's nomination and now moving the bar is much as they can. Maybe it's about temperament, not about what the FBI says. And as we predicted, the new talking point is the current FBI inquiry is being rushed. We don't trust the FBI? This despite absolutely no request from the FBI that more time is needed at all. It's all about delay. Now, we're going to talk about temperament, now we're going to talk about, well, maybe he didn't tell us exactly, exactly how much you drink, even though he said he drank a lot of beer and still drinks beer and sometimes drink too much beer. Watch this. SEN. BEN CARDIN, D—MD.: I trust the FBI. I hope they had the latitude, the time in order to get the job done right. SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D—N.J.: The Republicans held up a seat when Justice Scalia passed away for nearly a year. So, there is no reason to ram this through. There should be a full investigation of all of the allegations that have been raised and whatever other witnesses follow on as a result of the discussion or the interviews of both witnesses. REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D—CALIF.: The Senate should allow the FBI to pursue all the evidence and not to cap where they may go or put a leash on the investigation.",

So, yet, in another last ditch effort to smear Judge Kavanaugh, destroy his family, Senate Democrats are demanding for Senate Judiciary Committee retract the following tweet. Quote: Nowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse. Senate Democrats revealed zero evidence over why that tweet should be redacted. And the Senate Judiciary Committee fired back. Quote: Nothing in the tweet is inaccurate or misleading. The committee stands by its statement, which is completely truthful. More baseless innuendo, more false smears from Senate Democrats. As you can see the Democratic Party, they are the smear machine now in full gear and full panic. They don't want this boat. It's really despicable to watch. Think about what this means for your kids and your grandkids and the future of this country. Guilt by accusation. Enough accusations, you're done. Now, that is why they are flailing. And there's all these questions now -- oh, let's talk about his temperament. Forget the FBI report we demanded. How was someone accused -- get this, think of this yourself -- you are accused of systematically, regularly, drugging young teenage girls, being involved in -- well, frequent gang raping of young teenage girls. What is the proper reaction? What should the temperament be of somebody if you are falsely accused? What would you expect them to say very quietly, I'm innocent? Or do you think they would have such indignation, righteous indignation, anger, and outrage, that they want to make it as clear as possible they are innocent? I think the latter is how most people would probably react. And the far left mob, they are in overdrive. Remember, Maxine Waters, get in their faces. Well, guess what, Maxine, it's happening. Breaking tonight: congressional intern of a Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee has been arrested after he publicly posted sensitive information of pro-Kavanaugh Republican senators online. This is extraordinarily dangerous. And over the weekend, we saw Senator Mitch McConnell accosted in an airport after Ted Cruz, after Pam Bondi, Secretary Nielsen, after, you know, Sarah Sanders. Yesterday, a Republican congressman was actually assaulted in his Capitol Hill office by an angry group of protesters who question his door. In Texas, another angry mob confronting a group of pro-Kavanaugh students at UT-Austin. Take a look at this.",

It will be more and more radicalism, more and more allegations, make enough of them and you get your way. Basically mob rule, no law and order. Do you care about due process and the presumption of innocence? Because those three Republicans, we have, of course, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff snowflake. You are the ones that are going to decide, because if you go along with this it after you got what you wanted, this is what your future and our future as a country will be. Republicans won an election, we had a president that actually gave the names of the people he would consider pointing to the Supreme Court and he won mike. People want people want originalists, constitutionalists, confirmed for the Supreme Court. That is where they voted for. Look at this Fox News poll that just came out. The answer is yes. Republicans are now making gains in top Senate races all across the country and Republican enthusiasm has now increased significantly. Look at your screen. Now, these are the people who will decide the fate of Judge Kavanaugh, the future of the country. You want to call these people? Feel free to do so. Call their office, call the hotline, call the main line, I urge you to be polite. I think that is respectful of the office. Thirty-four days from tonight, and we'll know the results of the midterms. Those five senators, they choose to go along, move the bar, stop Kavanaugh because of what our uncorroborated allegations at every case. No evidence in every case. You know what is going to happen. They vote against Kavanaugh and guess what? They are up for reelection vote and you can vote them out. This is about whether or not we want to live in a country, the United States of America, where smears are rewarded and America where we accept character assassination on a regular basis, where we have no problem destroying political lives with no evidence, corroboration, and it can happen to you. An America where we throw out all due process out the window. We're willing to reward this behavior. And if Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Jeff snowflake, if they try and make this about anything other than what they asked for, a limited FBI report that is now complete, I will say they have zero character or honor themselves. And they will be responsible as this happens again and again and again, because Democrats -- they don't have a plan. Listen to any of them. What are they saying h they will do to improve the country? All you get from the Democrats is we know they want to impeach 45. They want impeachment. They want endless investigations into Trump and even Kavanaugh if he gets on the court. They want to impeach him. They want their crumbs back. They want higher taxes. They want to get rid of ICE. They want open borders. They want leftist judges that legislate from the bench. They want Obamacare. How is that working out for you? That's their agenda in 34 nights. You head to the polls, you get to vote. In House races, take a look on your screen. See if that's your district because if it is, it matters. And ask yourself one question. Is America better off than we were two years ago? When you vote one of the Senate races that you see on your screen, take note from the economy, to security, and national security, and trade deals, and eliminating burdensome regulations, the biggest tax cut in history, and all of these things. Well, that's all going to come to a halt if Republicans lose in November. You don't vote, you will get the government you deserve. If these lawmakers give into this tactic, it will happen again and again and again. He will be rewarding reckless, irresponsible, absolutely outrageous behavior and character assassination. You want to be a part of that? You choose and 34 days.

From the Senate Judiciary Committee investigation, and what they have already found. And now, it's time for senators to step up and do their job and vote. Enough with the delay tactics, enough with the smears and the slander. We have a lot more on this in just a moment tonight. Also, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, he has been stonewalled by Professor Ford's partisan legal team. They are denying all access to very extremely important pieces of evidence and this comes as new questions are being raised about Professor Ford's testimony by a longtime ex-boyfriend. We'll bring you that report. And also tonight, now that the smears and the FBI investigation are not working, don't be surprised because the Democrats, they want to shift the topic. Now, they want the vote to be about temperament and whether Judge Kavanaugh threw ice at a bar at somebody in college. Any Republican that allows the slander to become the new standard in this country is a disgrace. It will never end and you will be encouraging this behavior. We have all the latest examples of the left trying to govern by mob rule as they continue to stop over simple, basic, American human rights, decency, due process, and something called the presumption of innocence. And, by the way, a heavy dose of common sense and so much more. But we are watching is a thirst for power that knows no bounds. Lying, smearing, besmirching, bludgeoning, bullying, to score cheap political victories, no matter how many lives are destroyed in the process. And, of course, your friends in the corrupt media, the best friends of the Democrats, they are cheering all of this on, moving from story to story, raising the bar day after day, all to malign the president, and anybody and everybody around him. All right. Stay tuned for tonight's jam-packed Washington, D.C., swamp breaking news opening monologue."

All 100 senators and nine staff members will have access to that report, which will be kept in a safe for the Senate Judiciary Committee. This comes as the chairman of that committee, Chuck Grassley, is sounding the alarm about obstruction coming from Professor Ford's extremely bitterly partisan legal team. Now, this week, we told you about this, the Judiciary Committee requested access to material evidence of Professor Ford's sexual misconduct claims, including notes for her therapy sessions that she already had handed over to \"The Washington Post.\" Any reportings of her polygraph test, and Professor Ford's attorney are flatly denying the Senate Judiciary's request. So much for a real investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And tonight in a letter, Grassley fired back. He wrote, quote",
      "utterance": "The Constitution tasks the Senate, not the media or the FBI, with providing advice and consent for Supreme Court nominees. It is beyond disappointing that Dr. Ford's attorneys were willing to share evidence with \"The Washington Post\" many weeks ago but to this day refused to share the same evidence which Dr. Ford relied on in her testimony with the U.S. Senate. It's important to remember that Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, as you see on the screen, she is a far left, huge, big-time Democratic donor. Remember, she was the one that was recommended by Dianne Feinstein. He wouldn't tell the Republicans about the whole issue for weeks and weeks, after -- two weeks after, and once vowed to resist Donald Trump. We've showed you that tape on ABC. Katz has not been cooperative with a committee from the very beginning, stalling whenever and however possible. And according to Professor Ford's sworn testimony, her attorneys never even released numerous and persistent attempts from Senator Grassley and Republicans to arrange an interview with Senate Judiciary investigators. Debra Katz is not to be trusted. Her motivations, again, recommended by Dianne Feinstein, have long been political, including multiple instances when she defended Bill Clinton and creepy Al Franken from their misconduct allegations. She even made light twice of Paula Jones' accusations against Clinton, saying that Jones -- oh, she suffered no repercussions because the incident only lasted 10 to 12 minutes. He exposed himself in front of Paula Jones and he wanted a sexual favor. I thought Dianne Feinstein recommended a lawyer. I thought this woman was supposed to be a champion of women's rights. It's only true for Democratic women. And meanwhile, Professor Ford is facing some allegations of her own. In a written declaration to the U.S. Senate, a man who was Professor Ford's longtime boyfriend between 1992 and '98 is raising serious issues about her testimony tonight. During the hearing, Ford claimed to have issues with confined spaces, riding in airplanes, homes with only one door, because of PTSD symptoms surrounding her alleged sexual assaults. According to her former boyfriend, whose name has been redacted, Ford never expressed these issues with small spaces. She frequently flew in airplanes to and from Hawaii, lived in a small 500 square foot apartment, with only one door, never mentioned anything about being assaulted. He also claimed that Ford once counseled a friend on how to pass a polygraph test prior to a job interview with the FBI, a claim that friend has denied. Now, remember, during Ford's testimony, she emphasized her total and experience with polygraphs. And naturally, ABC, CBS -- well, they have totally ignored the story during their morning coverage. That is called bias of omission. It shouldn't shock us. Now, meanwhile, in case of just plain bias, \"The Daily Caller\" is reporting that three different NBC News stories on Judge Kavanaugh, three of them, face huge accuracy issues. By the way, Andy Lack, Tom Brokaw, are you proud of your network? Tom Brokaw, the brand you spent a lifetime building, are you happy now to be an arm of the Democratic Party? And as you can see, the left does not care about evidence, due process, presumption of innocence, the Constitution, none of it. They don't even care with this impending FBI report will uncover or not uncover. Dianne Feinstein doesn't want to show it to you. Almost all Democrats have been against Brett Kavanaugh or whoever the president would have chosen from day one. They are only now pretending to care about allegations against Kavanaugh because they want to stop the confirmation vote. To them, sadly, this is about power and political gamesmanship. Whether or not Kavanaugh is guilty makes no difference in the Democrats in this pursuit of power. Something by the way even Spartacus himself, Senator Cory Booker, admitted to during a recent interview. Take a look. SEN. CORY BOOKER, D—N.J.: So, my hope is that beyond vicious partisan rancor that is going on, beyond the accusations, we don't lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country and ultimately ask ourselves the question, is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment? Ultimately, not whether he is innocent or guilty, this is not a trial, but, ultimately, has enough questions be raised that we should not move on to another candidate?"

Guilty of all charges regardless of what the evidence shows? This is so reckless. Think of where this can take us! And if what Cory Booker said is the new standard -- well, guess what, Spartacus, you should not be a senator based on your own standards and your own words. Remember he once bragged about your own sexual assault as a young man writing about groping a woman in high school, even after she said no and pushed you away. Bye-bye, Spartacus. I guess it's time for you to leave the U.S. Senate in shame. Now, that's why we call them the party of smears. This is why I keep bringing up the idea of slander, and lies, and character assassination, and family bludgeoning, all for political power over -- and sacrificing the rule of law and justice. Things we should all hold deeply, that should not be political. As we speak, they are doing anything and everything to stall, scared Senator Jeff snowflake and others into voting against Kavanaugh's nomination and now moving the bar is much as they can. Maybe it's about temperament, not about what the FBI says. And as we predicted, the new talking point is the current FBI inquiry is being rushed. We don't trust the FBI? This despite absolutely no request from the FBI that more time is needed at all. It's all about delay. Now, we're going to talk about temperament, now we're going to talk about, well, maybe he didn't tell us exactly, exactly how much you drink, even though he said he drank a lot of beer and still drinks beer and sometimes drink too much beer. Watch this. SEN. BEN CARDIN, D—MD.: I trust the FBI. I hope they had the latitude, the time in order to get the job done right. SEN. BOB MENENDEZ, D—N.J.: The Republicans held up a seat when Justice Scalia passed away for nearly a year. So, there is no reason to ram this through. There should be a full investigation of all of the allegations that have been raised and whatever other witnesses follow on as a result of the discussion or the interviews of both witnesses. REP. ERIC SWALWELL, D—CALIF.: The Senate should allow the FBI to pursue all the evidence and not to cap where they may go or put a leash on the investigation."

It's really despicable to watch. Think about what this means for your kids and your grandkids and the future of this country. Guilt by accusation. Enough accusations, you're done. Now, that is why they are flailing. And there's all these questions now -- oh, let's talk about his temperament. Forget the FBI report we demanded. How was someone accused -- get this, think of this yourself -- you are accused of systematically, regularly, drugging young teenage girls, being involved in -- well, frequent gang raping of young teenage girls. What is the proper reaction? What should the temperament be of somebody if you are falsely accused? What would you expect them to say very quietly, I'm innocent? Or do you think they would have such indignation, righteous indignation, anger, and outrage, that they want to make it as clear as possible they are innocent?

You are the ones that are going to decide, because if you go along with this it after you got what you wanted, this is what your future and our future as a country will be. Republicans won an election, we had a president that actually gave the names of the people he would consider pointing to the Supreme Court and he won mike. People want people want originalists, constitutionalists, confirmed for the Supreme Court. That is where they voted for. Look at this Fox News poll that just came out. The answer is yes. Republicans are now making gains in top Senate races all across the country and Republican enthusiasm has now increased significantly. Look at your screen. Now, these are the people who will decide the fate of Judge Kavanaugh, the future of the country. You want to call these people? Feel free to do so. Call their office, call the hotline, call the main line, I urge you to be polite. I think that is respectful of the office. Thirty-four days from tonight, and we'll know the results of the midterms. Those five senators, they choose to go along, move the bar, stop Kavanaugh because of what our uncorroborated allegations at every case. No evidence in every case. You know what is going to happen. They vote against Kavanaugh and guess what? They are up for reelection vote and you can vote them out. This is about whether or not we want to live in a country, the United States of America, where smears are rewarded and America where we accept character assassination on a regular basis, where we have no problem destroying political lives with no evidence, corroboration, and it can happen to you. An America where we throw out all due process out the window. We're willing to reward this behavior. And if Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Jeff snowflake, if they try and make this about anything other than what they asked for, a limited FBI report that is now complete, I will say they have zero character or honor themselves. And they will be responsible as this happens again and again and again, because Democrats -- they don't have a plan. Listen to any of them. What are they saying h they will do to improve the country? All you get from the Democrats is we know they want to impeach 45. They want impeachment. They want endless investigations into Trump and even Kavanaugh if he gets on the court. They want to impeach him. They want their crumbs back. They want higher taxes. They want to get rid of ICE. They want open borders. They want leftist judges that legislate from the bench. They want Obamacare. How is that working out for you? That's their agenda in 34 nights. You head to the polls, you get to vote. In House races, take a look on your screen. See if that's your district because if it is, it matters. And ask yourself one question. Is America better off than we were two years ago? When you vote one of the Senate races that you see on your screen, take note from the economy, to security, and national security, and trade deals, and eliminating burdensome regulations, the biggest tax cut in history, and all of these things. Well, that's all going to come to a halt if Republicans lose in November. You don't vote, you will get the government you deserve. If these lawmakers give into this tactic, it will happen again and again and again. He will be rewarding reckless, irresponsible, absolutely outrageous behavior and character assassination. You want to be a part of that? You choose and 34 days.

He responded in a way that any normal, reasonable person would respond when facing those kinds of horrific allegations that were false. So, the American people saw that for themselves. What we do know and I think those three Republicans and Democrats should be concerned about tonight from NPR showing that the Democrat enthusiasm gap that existed, they used the word, Sean, evaporated. The enthusiasm benefit that the Democrats had over the Republicans has evaporated since mid-September to this point. In other words, because of the Kavanaugh hearings.

Signs that some might be questioning moving the bar about temperament. Maybe, well, did he not tell us exactly how much beer he drank. He threw ice in an incident in a bar when he was at Yale.

Senator Murkowski she better be taking notes because she is an attorney. Of the three you mentioned she is the only attorney. And she should understand that Brett Kavanaugh walked in there guilty and had to prove his innocence. And she should understand that the court of public opinion can destroy someone sometimes more than a criminal conviction can.

You know, to me, Andy, from the beginning it was about, OK. These are the allegations. Now you ask the people and they said in every case that there were people that could corroborate this.

I think these allegations in a normal process, he would have never heard of them, because there's a way that the Senate has to vet these kinds of claims where people say they want to remain confidential and they can go into this sort of thing. That's not what this was ever about. They were raising claims at the last minute in order to force delay. They've pushed for an FBI investigation to force delay, every day that the FBI investigation goes on they raise new questions about the depth of it and what it's actually about.
