      "sentences": "Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD, I'm Jesse Watters. President Trump expected to take the stage in the battleground state of Wisconsin tonight for his third and final rally of the day.  The President also had rallies in Ohio and North Carolina, which brings me to this: Trump is closing hard. That's the subject of tonight's Watters'  Words.  Last Saturday, we told you the tide was turning in the campaign. Trump recovered from the virus and restarted his rallies. Pence crushed Kamala Harris at the debate. Amy Coney Barrett sailed through the hearings, and Biden got rocked by a major scandal and Big Tech censored it. I said that if Trump rode this wave, he would have the momentum to win. And after this last week, he still has it.  Trump gave 12 speeches in 10 swing states this week. Biden gave four speeches in three states all week and barely anybody showed up. One of the speeches was in Delaware, not really known as a battleground.  His last press conference was in September. Biden is fading and the more the media tries to drag him across the finish line, the worst they look.   Trump sat down with Lesley Stahl for \"60 Minutes\" and she embarrassed herself. Her interview was so biased Trump released the raw interview before it aired just to show the country how dishonest the mainstream media is. Now, FOX isn't airing the raw footage for legal reasons. But go online, after WATTERS' WORLD of course. And what you'll see is a so-called journalist with solid pedigree from a prestigious network, not do her homework, lie about what the President said to his face, and not even know that his campaign was wiretapped. She told Trump she wouldn't air anything he said about hunter Biden's laptop. It's unbelievable.   Now, Trump has cornered the media. If the media reports on the Biden family scandal, they'll destroy their candidate. But if they don't report on the scandal, they'll destroy their credibility. And guess what's happening? The media is sacrificing their credibility just to elect their candidate. But the risk is huge because if Biden loses, both are destroyed. But the dam is breaking. The media can't hold it up much longer.  A former business partner of the Biden family has come forward and blown the lid off the scandal. He has impeccable credentials, a former Naval officer whose only donations have gone to Democrats.",

I have firsthand knowledge about this because I directly dealt with the Biden family, including Joe Biden. On May 13th, 2017, I received an e-mail concerning allocation of equity, which says 10 percent held by H for the big guy. In that e-mail, there is no question that H stands for Hunter, big guy for his father, Joe Biden.  On numerous occasions, it was made clear to me that Joe Biden's involvement was not to be mentioned in writing, but only face-to-face.",

He has hard evidence to back this up. The e-mails are out there. He turned over his phones to Federal investigators. The Senate has his phones, too.   The F.B.I. interviewed the ex-partner on Friday, and there is an open money laundering investigation involving Hunter's laptop. That seems important. One of Hunter's business partners is in Federal prison. The other, Devon Archer is awaiting sentencing. Here is Devon Archer with Joe Biden. Biden said he didn't know about his son's business. Right? He just golfs with his business partners before they go to jail. Messages suggest Biden was using his office as a cash register. His son and brother were selling access to Joe. Joe was for sale, and foreigners were buying influence. Maybe that's why Joe has been so soft on China his whole career. Follow the money.  The Chinese sent $70 million to the Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The school wasn't upfront about it, and Biden pulled a salary from the school. Now, what's that about?  Joe's campaign has issued very carefully worded denials such as, quote, \"There's no indication Joe has gotten money from these deals.\" Or, \"Nobody has held the stock for him.\" Nobody talked about stock. And here is the bottom line. Joe looks as crooked as Hillary and the rigged media is trying to run out the clock because if Joe wins, there's no way he survives an investigation into his family's business, so Kamala takes over then. And that's the plan.   Donald Trump raised the scandal at the debate on Thursday.",

Where Trump excelled the most, and I think this is the most important issue, it is what you just mentioned. He made clear that, look, we're coming out of an economic calamity driven by this pandemic and he made clear that he is for reopening the economy, letting small businesses reopen, letting people go back to work, letting kids go back to school, moving forward and back to prosperity. And it also made very clear that Joe Biden's approach is shut everything down and destroy jobs and that contrast, I think, an awful lot of elections, most elections when people go to the polls, jobs in the economy is front and center, number one, and I think Trump did very, very well on that issue.",

They shut down \"The New York Post's\" own social media account. That has never happened even in the world of bad conduct and social media censorship, taking the next step and censoring a major media outlet is uncharted territory, and it is an enormous abuse of power by Big Tech. That being said, I don't think this issue is going to decide the election. I thought the 10 to 15 minutes in the debate last night where they were going back and forth and alleging \"your family is corrupt; no, no, your family is corrupt.\" I think that was probably awash in that if you're with Trump, you were with him on that. If you're with Biden, you were with him on that.  So I was glad the debate fairly quickly shifted away from that stuff. And back to why does this make a difference for your family? For your kids?

You saw the Democrats come at her, try to attack her and I think she was calm, cool, collected. Her temperament was scholarly and judicious. And you quickly saw how bad it was going for Senate Democrats because by the second day, they were running for the hills. They wanted to get as far away from that hearing room as possible, because it wasn't helping them.  The American people I think, were very impressed. The Judiciary Committee, we unanimously voted her out. Now, the reason it was unanimous, is because the Democrats boycotted. They seem to be under the curious impression that they are somehow punishing us by denying us their presence. But be that as it may, actually another result of the Democratic boycott as we also subpoenaed Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Twitter and Facebook and the Democrats weren't able to delay it because they didn't show up. Getting Judge Barrett out of committee unanimously was a big deal. She will come to the floor on Monday. By Monday night, Judge Barrett will be Justice Barrett and I think it's the single biggest and most important decision the President has made in four years. Jesse, as you know, I've got a brand new book that just came out a couple of weeks ago called \"One Vote Away: How a Single Supreme Court Justice can Change History.\" And that book became the number one bestseller in the country on Amazon. It has been on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list three weeks in a row. And I think the reason people are going and buying the book is because it brings you inside the Supreme Court. It helps you understand in real world terms in clear and understandable terms what's at stake? Why this fight is over free speech and religious liberty and the Second Amendment and how our fundamental rights are really hanging in the balance.

Here are some of the polls that came out this week. The latest Trafalgar poll in Wisconsin shows Biden only up by a single point. And in Pennsylvania, only leading by two points. An Emerson poll from Georgia shows Trump leading Biden. I think he'll win by a little bit more than that and Trump is also edging Biden out in North Carolina by a point. FOX News shows Trump beating Joe Biden by three points in Ohio. I think, he will do a little bit better there, too. A new Susquehanna poll shows the President just took the lead in Arizona. We expect him to win that state and Trump has been holding steady with a three-point lead in Florida. Republicans looking very good in the early voting there. He also leads in Michigan, another Trafalgar poll. Now this pollster, he is the only guy that accurately predicted Trump winning Michigan in 2016. That's a significant poll. Trump has a two-point advantage on Joe Biden in Iowa. We expect him to win there, but Biden up by about five in Pennsylvania. There, that's another tough battleground for the President.

I'm in the studio, I don't get to go out and travel the country as much as I used to anymore. You've seen the crowds. You've been to a bunch of these states. What are you seeing and what are you hearing? And what does it feel like?",

And look, there's one thing that I'm hearing from a lot of people though, it is evident that the Democrats are outspending President Trump and Republicans. But it's also clear that we are out working the Democrats. We are knocking on more doors. We are making more phone calls. The President is doing more rallies. This will be a question in my opinion in the next 10 days: can you purchase an election with the help of the billionaire class like Joe Biden is with the help of his friend, Mike Bloomberg and the tech elites? Or can President Donald Trump win the election again, with the true sovereign in this country, We, the People? I'm seeing enthusiasm and energy unlike anything I've ever seen, including in 2016; however, Jesse, I don't think we're there yet. I think we still need to get our friends to go to the polls. I think that we still have got one last push. If I were going to give my honest analysis, I think we're trending towards victory, but I think we still have work left to do.",

The president beat Crooked last time with half the cash. And you're right, Biden is spending a fortune on the air, but he is not on the ground and I don't know, maybe people get annoyed listening to all the Biden ads. I think I think we'll see. He is also deploying Barack Obama. I saw this as a strategic mistake. If I was running the Biden campaign, I would have put Obama and Joe on the same stage together in the same picture that reminds Democrats that they were on the same ticket when they were in the White House together. But they're not doing that. They are deploying him to places where they think they need help. Right now, I think he went to Philly, because the black vote is not turning out in Pennsylvania over the mail so far, and then he was in Miami today, barely anybody showed up. It looks like early voting numbers have not been hitting targets for Democrats in Florida. What do you think about Barack Obama back on the trail?

That did not work well. And then Barack Obama campaigned heavily for Andrew Gillum in Florida in what was supposed to be the blue wave, and Ron DeSantis is now Governor DeSantis. Barack Obama made no impact in 2016, and he made little impact in 2018. Barack Obama is not going to move this race for Joe Biden. The only way Joe Biden wins is if the tech elites and the media continues their diabolical character assassination campaign against President Trump, and enough people are unfortunately misled. However, I remain optimistic, Jesse, I remain optimistic that people out there are going to bring their friends to the polls, that they are going to turn in their ballots, however, they feel the secure method to do so, voting early or actually handing in their ballot because I think and I feel underneath all of this, that the American people have grown tired of a ruling class that lives above the law that has a separate set of rules for them, and also seems to continue to benefit while the middle class and the muscular class of this country sees their wages go down, their schools closed and nine months of lockdowns. So Barack Obama going out there and trying to rev up the troops, I don't think that's going to move the dial at all for Joe Biden.",

In a lot of ways, it is morning in America on one side versus the dark winter on the other side. And what I mean by that is that is this President is out there hustling barnstorming the country, and he is acting as an inspiring leader, and he is convincing the people that there is a revival afoot in this country, and that it can continue with a great American Renaissance or recovery. On the other hand, we have Joe Biden warning of dismal doom. He is like a combination, an insipid combination of Nurse Ratchet and the Grim Reaper telling us that there is a looming dark winter ahead. No, there's not, Joe Biden. The sun is not setting on America; the sun is rising on America, and we need the kind of leadership that will inspire that. But to get to specific policies as well, because of course, we want to go there. Look, the number one issue far and away on voters' minds is the economy. It's also the issue on which we have the most compelling case to make that the economic -- the economy that Donald Trump built, both in the first three years of his presidency before the China virus artificially halted that economic rise, and then the economy that he is again rebuilding right now. All the recent economic statistics are just astounding. Wall Street, they are defying the critics. This is a country that is charging and roaring back to life. The way to accelerate and continue that momentum is to rehire Donald Trump as our national CEO, but we're also going to be defining the opponent.

Trump recovered from the virus and restarted his rallies. Pence crushed Kamala Harris at the debate. Amy Coney Barrett sailed through the hearings, and Biden got rocked by a major scandal and Big Tech censored it. I said that if Trump rode this wave, he would have the momentum to win. And after this last week, he still has it. Trump gave 12 speeches in 10 swing states this week. Biden gave four speeches in three states all week and barely anybody showed up. One of the speeches was in Delaware, not really known as a battleground. His last press conference was in September. Biden is fading and the more the media tries to drag him across the finish line, the worst they look. Trump sat down with Lesley Stahl for \"60 Minutes\" and she embarrassed herself. Her interview was so biased Trump released the raw interview before it aired just to show the country how dishonest the mainstream media is. Now, FOX isn't airing the raw footage for legal reasons. But go online, after WATTERS' WORLD of course. And what you'll see is a so-called journalist with solid pedigree from a prestigious network, not do her homework, lie about what the President said to his face, and not even know that his campaign was wiretapped. She told Trump she wouldn't air anything he said about hunter Biden's laptop. It's unbelievable. Now, Trump has cornered the media. If the media reports on the Biden family scandal, they'll destroy their candidate. But if they don't report on the scandal, they'll destroy their credibility. And guess what's happening? The media is sacrificing their credibility just to elect their candidate. But the risk is huge because if Biden loses, both are destroyed. But the dam is breaking. The media can't hold it up much longer. A former business partner of the Biden family has come forward and blown the lid off the scandal. He has impeccable credentials, a former Naval officer whose only donations have gone to Democrats."

In that e-mail, there is no question that H stands for Hunter, big guy for his father, Joe Biden.

He has hard evidence to back this up. The e-mails are out there. He turned over his phones to Federal investigators. The Senate has his phones, too. The F.B.I. interviewed the ex-partner on Friday, and there is an open money laundering investigation involving Hunter's laptop. That seems important. One of Hunter's business partners is in Federal prison. The other, Devon Archer is awaiting sentencing. Here is Devon Archer with Joe Biden. Biden said he didn't know about his son's business. Right? He just golfs with his business partners before they go to jail. Messages suggest Biden was using his office as a cash register. His son and brother were selling access to Joe. Joe was for sale, and foreigners were buying influence. Maybe that's why Joe has been so soft on China his whole career. Follow the money. The Chinese sent $70 million to the Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The school wasn't upfront about it, and Biden pulled a salary from the school. Now, what's that about? Joe's campaign has issued very carefully worded denials such as, quote, \"There's no indication Joe has gotten money from these deals.\" Or, \"Nobody has held the stock for him.\" Nobody talked about stock. And here is the bottom line. Joe looks as crooked as Hillary and the rigged media is trying to run out the clock because if Joe wins, there's no way he survives an investigation into his family's business, so Kamala takes over then.

I think he helped himself significantly more than Biden did, but I actually thought both of them put in strong performances. They did much better. Both of them did much better than previously. Where Trump excelled the most, and I think this is the most important issue, it is what you just mentioned. He made clear that, look, we're coming out of an economic calamity driven by this pandemic and he made clear that he is for reopening the economy, letting small businesses reopen, letting people go back to work, letting kids go back to school, moving forward and back to prosperity. And it also made very clear that Joe Biden's approach is shut everything down and destroy jobs and that contrast, I think, an awful lot of elections, most elections when people go to the polls, jobs in the economy is front and center, number one, and I think Trump did very, very well on that issue."

We saw last week, Twitter and Facebook both banned \"The New York Post's\" blockbuster stories, breaking the evidence of the scandal. They prohibited users from sharing them online. They shut down \"The New York Post's\" own social media account. That has never happened even in the world of bad conduct and social media censorship, taking the next step and censoring a major media outlet is uncharted territory, and it is an enormous abuse of power by Big Tech. That being said, I don't think this issue is going to decide the election. I thought the 10 to 15 minutes in the debate last night where they were going back and forth and alleging \"your family is corrupt; no, no, your family is corrupt.\" I think that was probably awash in that if you're with Trump, you were with him on that. If you're with Biden, you were with him on that. So I was glad the debate fairly quickly shifted away from that stuff. And back to why does this make a difference for your family? For your kids? For your future? Because I think those are the issues that Trump wins on."

      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly right. I think the last two weeks have been very, very good. In her hearing, I think Judge Barrett did a phenomenal job. You saw the Democrats come at her, try to attack her and I think she was calm, cool, collected. Her temperament was scholarly and judicious. And you quickly saw how bad it was going for Senate Democrats because by the second day, they were running for the hills. They wanted to get as far away from that hearing room as possible, because it wasn't helping them. The American people I think, were very impressed. The Judiciary Committee, we unanimously voted her out. Now, the reason it was unanimous, is because the Democrats boycotted. They seem to be under the curious impression that they are somehow punishing us by denying us their presence. But be that as it may, actually another result of the Democratic boycott as we also subpoenaed Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Twitter and Facebook and the Democrats weren't able to delay it because they didn't show up. Getting Judge Barrett out of committee unanimously was a big deal. She will come to the floor on Monday. By Monday night, Judge Barrett will be Justice Barrett and I think it's the single biggest and most important decision the President has made in four years. Jesse, as you know, I've got a brand new book that just came out a couple of weeks ago called \"One Vote Away: How a Single Supreme Court Justice can Change History.\" And that book became the number one bestseller in the country on Amazon. It has been on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list three weeks in a row. And I think the reason people are going and buying the book is because it brings you inside the Supreme Court. It helps you understand in real world terms in clear and understandable terms what's at stake? Why this fight is over free speech and religious liberty and the Second Amendment and how our fundamental rights are really hanging in the balance. I think that is the most important issue at stake on November 3rd."

A county President Trump won in 2016 with 61 percent of the vote. This will be his fifth campaign visit to Wisconsin this year, and he will be back again on Tuesday for another rally. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has only visited the state twice in the past two years. Both of those visits coming last month, though, the Biden campaign has said he will be back again before the election. Folks at home will remember though, Wisconsin was key to President Trump's victory in 2016. No Republican had won the state since 1984, and he narrowly won it with less than 23,000 votes. Now, the President is hoping to win the state again by an even bigger margin this time around and he is putting in a lot of time to try and make that happen -- Jesse."

Here are some of the polls that came out this week. The latest Trafalgar poll in Wisconsin shows Biden only up by a single point. And in Pennsylvania, only leading by two points. An Emerson poll from Georgia shows Trump leading Biden. I think he'll win by a little bit more than that and Trump is also edging Biden out in North Carolina by a point. FOX News shows Trump beating Joe Biden by three points in Ohio. I think, he will do a little bit better there, too. A new Susquehanna poll shows the President just took the lead in Arizona. We expect him to win that state and Trump has been holding steady with a three-point lead in Florida. Republicans looking very good in the early voting there. He also leads in Michigan, another Trafalgar poll. Now this pollster, he is the only guy that accurately predicted Trump winning Michigan in 2016. That's a significant poll. Trump has a two-point advantage on Joe Biden in Iowa. We expect him to win there, but Biden up by about five in Pennsylvania. There, that's another tough battleground for the President. Joining me now to discuss, Turning Point U.S.A. founder and author of \"The MAGA Doctrine,\" Charlie Kirk. All right, Charlie, I wanted to talk to you because you've been out there. I'm in the studio, I don't get to go out and travel the country as much as I used to anymore. You've seen the crowds. You've been to a bunch of these states.

And look, there's one thing that I'm hearing from a lot of people though, it is evident that the Democrats are outspending President Trump and Republicans. But it's also clear that we are out working the Democrats. We are knocking on more doors. We are making more phone calls. The President is doing more rallies. This will be a question in my opinion in the next 10 days: can you purchase an election with the help of the billionaire class like Joe Biden is with the help of his friend, Mike Bloomberg and the tech elites? Or can President Donald Trump win the election again, with the true sovereign in this country, We, the People? I'm seeing enthusiasm and energy unlike anything I've ever seen, including in 2016; however, Jesse, I don't think we're there yet. I think we still need to get our friends to go to the polls. I think that we still have got one last push. If I were going to give my honest analysis, I think we're trending towards victory, but I think we still have work left to do."

The president beat Crooked last time with half the cash. And you're right, Biden is spending a fortune on the air, but he is not on the ground and I don't know, maybe people get annoyed listening to all the Biden ads. I think I think we'll see. He is also deploying Barack Obama. I saw this as a strategic mistake. If I was running the Biden campaign, I would have put Obama and Joe on the same stage together in the same picture that reminds Democrats that they were on the same ticket when they were in the White House together. But they're not doing that. They are deploying him to places where they think they need help. Right now, I think he went to Philly, because the black vote is not turning out in Pennsylvania over the mail so far, and then he was in Miami today, barely anybody showed up. It looks like early voting numbers have not been hitting targets for Democrats in Florida. What do you think about Barack Obama back on the trail?

That did not work well. And then Barack Obama campaigned heavily for Andrew Gillum in Florida in what was supposed to be the blue wave, and Ron DeSantis is now Governor DeSantis. Barack Obama made no impact in 2016, and he made little impact in 2018. Barack Obama is not going to move this race for Joe Biden. The only way Joe Biden wins is if the tech elites and the media continues their diabolical character assassination campaign against President Trump, and enough people are unfortunately misled. However, I remain optimistic, Jesse, I remain optimistic that people out there are going to bring their friends to the polls, that they are going to turn in their ballots, however, they feel the secure method to do so, voting early or actually handing in their ballot because I think and I feel underneath all of this, that the American people have grown tired of a ruling class that lives above the law that has a separate set of rules for them, and also seems to continue to benefit while the middle class and the muscular class of this country sees their wages go down, their schools closed and nine months of lockdowns. So Barack Obama going out there and trying to rev up the troops, I don't think that's going to move the dial at all for Joe Biden."

But listen, before I get to the actual policy strategy, I want to just say a word about this approach that you've mentioned because this is really shaping up now, these final days of the campaign. In a lot of ways, it is morning in America on one side versus the dark winter on the other side. And what I mean by that is that is this President is out there hustling barnstorming the country, and he is acting as an inspiring leader, and he is convincing the people that there is a revival afoot in this country, and that it can continue with a great American Renaissance or recovery. On the other hand, we have Joe Biden warning of dismal doom. He is like a combination, an insipid combination of Nurse Ratchet and the Grim Reaper telling us that there is a looming dark winter ahead. No, there's not, Joe Biden. The sun is not setting on America; the sun is rising on America, and we need the kind of leadership that will inspire that. But to get to specific policies as well, because of course, we want to go there. Look, the number one issue far and away on voters' minds is the economy. It's also the issue on which we have the most compelling case to make that the economic -- the economy that Donald Trump built, both in the first three years of his presidency before the China virus artificially halted that economic rise, and then the economy that he is again rebuilding right now. All the recent economic statistics are just astounding. Wall Street, they are defying the critics. This is a country that is charging and roaring back to life. The way to accelerate and continue that momentum is to rehire Donald Trump as our national CEO, but we're also going to be defining the opponent.

This is perhaps the most shocking admission ever made during a debate where he goes in and he says no fracking, but he's been saying it. No fracking. He got the nomination, and all of a sudden, he is fracking. No fossil fuels and no gas powered cars. Ultimately, let's not have cars. Let's get rid of airplanes."

Almost impossible to do after something like that when 65 million people saw it. Let's bring in host of \"The Dana Show\" Dana Loesch who lives in the Great State of Texas. Wow. Two Texans on, on the same hour: Ted Cruz, Dana Loesch. Oil, very important. I don't know. This guy, they have been trying to say I'm not a socialist. I'm Joe for the entire general election. Then he says he wants to get rid of oil. Good job, Joe. DANA LOESCH, HOST, \"THE DANA SHOW\": Yes, he did great. Jesse, thanks for having me. And yes, the great Republic of Texas, we are just Texifying WATTERS' WORLD tonight. And that is Joe Biden is his own worst enemy and President Trump was smart. He just kind of sat back and let Biden create his rhetorical news, so to speak there and walk himself into this. And it is incredibly damning. I mean, you have like, what? A week and a half now of ads that can be used against Joe Biden. He spent -- think about this, and you mentioned this earlier, Jesse, on your show, he called a lid and spent all last week, reportedly preparing for this debate. He prepared for that moment? Really? I mean, you can't -- it took you that long and you still can't even come to a decision as to where you stand on fracking? I mean, for crying out loud."

You brought up the fracking. Trump is already on air in Pennsylvania hammering Joe for the no fracking thing. He said no fracking about a half dozen times and now, he is saying he is for fracking. He doesn't know what he is for. He is for whatever AOC wants him to say or whatever he thinks he needs to say to get elected. You've got 30 seconds. Go ahead."
