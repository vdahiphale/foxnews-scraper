After weeks of Schiff and company keeping you the American people in the dark, we are just 12 hours out from the first public impeachment proceedings. Tonight we are going to do something really important. We're going to take you through the many reasons to really understand what is going on here it could be complicated? Why this entire inquiry if you can call it that is a complete sham?  Along the way we're going to be joined by Congressman Doug Collins and Steve Scalise Lawyers Gregg Jarrett and Robert Ray. Also the President's son Eric Trump is going to be with us. Who is going to take us inside his father's thinking tonight and a lot more.  Also the Democrat's push for impeachment is routed in one inconvenient reality, there are 2020 roster front runners included are incredibly weak. Raymond Arroyo breaks down Joe Biden's Town Hall performance and what it means to the 2020 race. But first the House of lies that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Everyday Democrats insist that the case for impeaching the President is getting stronger and stronger. They see the public impeachment and hearings scheduled this week as the climax in the plot to take down Trump and their media stooges are happily hyping.",

We have to ask the same question when it comes to the Democrat's tactic of shielding the identity of the whistleblower which brings us to lie number 4. The whistleblower has a legal right to anonymity.  The actual statue if Democrats care about things like statues states that only the Inspector General \"Shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee\". In other words, it doesn't prohibit anyone else from revealing the identity of the whistleblower, Congress and the press included. Read the Statue.  That of course the biggest lie of all, the Democrats have been telling this over and over again that the President's conversation with the Ukrainian President was improper. I will say this. Listen closely. Not only did the President say nothing improper during that July 25th phone call, he made important points about the fact that other nations in the region are not pitching in enough to support Ukraine. It's about time we have a President who stands up for U.S. tax dollars. By the way we have the transcript too. We read it on a note two dozen times. We can see that the favor Trump requested was about investigating corruption and what really happened during the 2016 election. I think what happened is that when Trump released the Ukraine transcript it kind of caught the Democrats off guard. So the left's first reaction was to invent a bizarre conspiracy theory about the transcript remember that fake parity and the ellipsis over the in the transcript. It somehow hit a dastardly plot.",

Okay, so otherwise this record is complete? And I think he used the term \"Very Accurate\"? Yes. Of course, it is. This was a call listened in on by as many as a dozen other officials including people Trump knew were listening and probably not fans of his policy. Now this gets to the heart of what's really going on in here behind all of the democrat theatrics. This is going to play out over the next couple of days.   What Americans should take away from this phone call is not that this guy should be impeached but instead thank God someone is out there looking out for America's interest where we have all of these other diplomats and all these other experts' just want to shovel taxpayer money out of the door, no question asked. No concern about corruption. It doesn't matter what you did before tomorrow or next year. The money is going to keep coming. No questions asked.  Thank God we are not thinking that way anymore. We need more elected officials to do what Trump did on that call. Question the use of military aid and other aid we are giving countries all across the globe and focused on America First. If you are our friend, and you are important us in the region we will help but we're going to ask questions. And by the way that means Angela Merkel could do more to pay her fair share. Americans have to understand that. And this is why the Democrats are spinning. Leaking and they're trying to dramatize this impeachment farce for everybody to see. They are keeping any other evidence from seeing the light of day. That's why Adam Schiff's rules will rule over the next few days. That I just gave you a little primmer so you are going to understand this lot better by the time this thing wraps at the end of the week. That's “The Angle.” All right, joining me now is Doug Collins Ranking Member in the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman great to have you on tonight I know you are very busy. We have seen the Democrats lie, spin and block GOP cross- examination. What other stunts are you expecting at the public hearing tomorrow?",

They are fighting the fact to everybody that these evidences when they have done these interviews that it shown that there was nothing improper on the call - the fact that President Zelensky and President Trump both said there was no pressure on both ends of this. Did he ask proper questions? When we were called on as a government to make sure that corruption doesn't exist in a country we give aid to even if that happens to be a Former Vice-President and his son. That is a valid question on what happened in the past. This is something that the President was doing right. So what they're going to try to do tomorrow is spin - I call it putting flowers on the show. They are going to say here are the worst parts. They are going to put the witnesses together. So you really can't even take time to delve into each of them individually. You are going to go at it under Adam Schiff's rules saying here's the way we are going to do it. And that's all they want you to see is the show. What is appalling to me is how the media has started this process and saying oh, this going to be the most important day in history.

This is an open call, particularly within the CIA, to go down to the White House and take a two-plus year rotation. So there is an open process. There is a senior panel that sits down and decides whether or not you are fit based on your knowledge of the topic or the country. Then there is a second group of people, the country directors. And I'm simplifying this, but the upshot is you don't apply for that. You are tapped on the shoulder and said we believe, we being the senior folks all the way up to the seven floor, which would be Gina Haspel, the CIA, the director herself, would say we think you are going to be good at this, you could be good at this. We're going to nominate you to go downtown. So that is the process. So the question is, can that be politicized? So the short answer is yes, absolutely. For the midlevel folks, the working level analyst, the people who are picked ultimately have the support of their seniors because those folks have generally speaking sucked up. To move up, you suck up. That's usually how it works in the federal government. The other side of the house, much the same, except for these folks, they are not only just providing that substantive expertise. They are actually involved in the degree of the political ramifications of the things that they are recommending to the president or the national security advisor.

I can't speak for anyone else, but I would love to see you institute debate rule, which is simply if anyone interrupts the speaker, his or her mic will be cut.\" I have been asked that before. My problem is, does it apply to me as well? Only to be fair. I get it. It can be annoying. We do our best. We got this email from Robert Grayson. \"My wife and I are worried that someone forced you to quit wearing your cross on your show. I hope that is not the case.\" Of course, this is the night where I don't have the cross on. It is dictated by the type of top or dress I wear. But no, I sleep with it, I wear it all the time, but sometimes it doesn't work with the outfit. Nobody is telling me not to wear it. Believe, I will be buried in that cross, but I hope not too soon. Finally, Robert Hofawger sent this hilarious note. \"Now that San Francisco has gone totally socialist and is trying to protect the homeless and criminals, why won't they go to Pelosi's house and camp and defecate and shoot up outside her house since she's so worried about them. Maybe she will even invite them in for a snack.\" We've often hoped that Nancy Pelosi would open her commodious abode to the homeless and to the drug addicted, and maybe minister to them with that mellifluous voice of hers. All right. If you have any thoughts or comments about the show tonight, remember, e-mail us at ingrahamangle@foxnews.com. And we might feature your e-mail. It's all the time we have tonight.

After weeks of Schiff and company keeping you the American people in the dark, we are just 12 hours out from the first public impeachment proceedings. Tonight we are going to do something really important. We're going to take you through the many reasons to really understand what is going on here it could be complicated? Why this entire inquiry if you can call it that is a complete sham? Along the way we're going to be joined by Congressman Doug Collins and Steve Scalise Lawyers Gregg Jarrett and Robert Ray. Also the President's son Eric Trump is going to be with us. Who is going to take us inside his father's thinking tonight and a lot more. Also the Democrat's push for impeachment is routed in one inconvenient reality, there are 2020 roster front runners included are incredibly weak. Raymond Arroyo breaks down Joe Biden's Town Hall performance and what it means to the 2020 race. But first the House of lies that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Everyday Democrats insist that the case for impeaching the President is getting stronger and stronger. They see the public impeachment and hearings scheduled this week as the climax in the plot to take down Trump and their media stooges are happily hyping."

They are as follows. Number one, the claim that this inquiry is about getting at the facts, if that was the case why did a majority of House Democrats support impeachment before the Ukraine whistleblower's complaint went public? They never needed facts. They never needed evidence, not even member of the House Intel Committee who are now in charge of this inquiry."

We have to ask the same question when it comes to the Democrat's tactic of shielding the identity of the whistleblower which brings us to lie number 4. The whistleblower has a legal right to anonymity. The actual statue if Democrats care about things like statues states that only the Inspector General \"Shall not disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee\". In other words, it doesn't prohibit anyone else from revealing the identity of the whistleblower, Congress and the press included. Read the Statue. That of course the biggest lie of all, the Democrats have been telling this over and over again that the President's conversation with the Ukrainian President was improper. I will say this. Listen closely. Not only did the President say nothing improper during that July 25th phone call, he made important points about the fact that other nations in the region are not pitching in enough to support Ukraine. It's about time we have a President who stands up for U.S. tax dollars. By the way we have the transcript too. We read it on a note two dozen times. We can see that the favor Trump requested was about investigating corruption and what really happened during the 2016 election. I think what happened is that when Trump released the Ukraine transcript it kind of caught the Democrats off guard. So the left's first reaction was to invent a bizarre conspiracy theory about the transcript remember that fake parity and the ellipsis over the in the transcript. It somehow hit a dastardly plot."

Here's what he told the House Intel Committee back to the transcript here. Question, but you don't think there was malicious intent to specifically not add those edits? I don't think so. Okay, so otherwise this record is complete? And I think he used the term \"Very Accurate\"? Yes. Of course, it is. This was a call listened in on by as many as a dozen other officials including people Trump knew were listening and probably not fans of his policy. Now this gets to the heart of what's really going on in here behind all of the democrat theatrics. This is going to play out over the next couple of days. What Americans should take away from this phone call is not that this guy should be impeached but instead thank God someone is out there looking out for America's interest where we have all of these other diplomats and all these other experts' just want to shovel taxpayer money out of the door, no question asked. No concern about corruption. It doesn't matter what you did before tomorrow or next year. The money is going to keep coming. No questions asked. Thank God we are not thinking that way anymore. We need more elected officials to do what Trump did on that call. Question the use of military aid and other aid we are giving countries all across the globe and focused on America First. If you are our friend, and you are important us in the region we will help but we're going to ask questions. And by the way that means Angela Merkel could do more to pay her fair share. Americans have to understand that. And this is why the Democrats are spinning. Leaking and they're trying to dramatize this impeachment farce for everybody to see. They are keeping any other evidence from seeing the light of day. That's why Adam Schiff's rules will rule over the next few days. That I just gave you a little primmer so you are going to understand this lot better by the time this thing wraps at the end of the week. That's “The Angle.” All right, joining me now is Doug Collins Ranking Member in the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman great to have you on tonight I know you are very busy. We have seen the Democrats lie, spin and block GOP cross- examination. What other stunts are you expecting at the public hearing tomorrow?"

They are fighting the fact to everybody that these evidences when they have done these interviews that it shown that there was nothing improper on the call - the fact that President Zelensky and President Trump both said there was no pressure on both ends of this. Did he ask proper questions? When we were called on as a government to make sure that corruption doesn't exist in a country we give aid to even if that happens to be a Former Vice-President and his son. That is a valid question on what happened in the past. This is something that the President was doing right. So what they're going to try to do tomorrow is spin - I call it putting flowers on the show. They are going to say here are the worst parts. They are going to put the witnesses together. So you really can't even take time to delve into each of them individually. You are going to go at it under Adam Schiff's rules saying here's the way we are going to do it. And that's all they want you to see is the show. What is appalling to me is how the media has started this process and saying oh, this going to be the most important day in history.

This is someone who joined the others especially ones on the Intel Committee who have wanted to impeach this President long before they ever heard of Ukraine and probably you could find it on a map. This is the problem we're having right now is they simply want to impeach the President because they can't find a way to beat him. He is doing the things that he promised to do. He is looking after taxpayer dollars. He is putting America First around the world. He has his - one of the most appalling segments that you showed just a moment ago was when they said that this President was undercutting our diplomats. He is not undercutting our diplomats. He is making them strong if they have a President stands behind them."

They're the perpetual - they can call themselves whistleblowers when they are not to subvert Presidential authority executive authority and policy. That's what is happening on the Ukraine. You got a people who want money going to Ukraine including Former Bush Administration officials. You know who you are complaining about this?

Even in my committee which was got sidelined because they were so inept with everything they've done. They actually brought in bring your donor to work day when they allowed two of their consultants - one of their consultants in the Corey Lewandowski hearing to asks questions to Corey Lewandowski, he shouldn't been able to ask questions.

And this is what should concern every whether you are a Democrat or Republican or Independent, when you get to this point, the founding fathers warned us about this. They warned that a political impeachment was imperiling our country.

Joining me now is Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Legal Analyst Author of the phenomenal book \"Witch Hunt\" and Robert Ray Former Whitewater Independent Counsel.

These are your midlevel, middle-aged folks who have policy expertise on a particular country or issue. These folks actually have to apply. This is an open call, particularly within the CIA, to go down to the White House and take a two-plus year rotation. So there is an open process. There is a senior panel that sits down and decides whether or not you are fit based on your knowledge of the topic or the country. Then there is a second group of people, the country directors. And I'm simplifying this, but the upshot is you don't apply for that. You are tapped on the shoulder and said we believe, we being the senior folks all the way up to the seven floor, which would be Gina Haspel, the CIA, the director herself, would say we think you are going to be good at this, you could be good at this. We're going to nominate you to go downtown. So that is the process. So the question is, can that be politicized? So the short answer is yes, absolutely. For the midlevel folks, the working level analyst, the people who are picked ultimately have the support of their seniors because those folks have generally speaking sucked up. To move up, you suck up. That's usually how it works in the federal government. The other side of the house, much the same, except for these folks, they are not only just providing that substantive expertise. They are actually involved in the degree of the political ramifications of the things that they are recommending to the president or the national security advisor. And so if Gina Haspel believes that she wants to put her person in there, she can and she will. And that's a problem."

Our troops aren't getting the tools they need right now, Laura, because Pelosi is obsessed with impeachment. Our border is not secure because Pelosi is obsessed with impeachment. That's the kind of stuff they are hearing about when they go back home, as they should, because people are looking at this and going wait a minute, the president didn't do anything wrong. In fact, Zelensky himself - there were only two participants in the call, and Zelensky himself said there was no pressure, and he got the money.

      "utterance": "Last night I asked you to email me at IngrahamAngle@foxnews.com, and we received some amazing responses. Angle fan Rich King writes, \"Laura, I love your show. I can't speak for anyone else, but I would love to see you institute debate rule, which is simply if anyone interrupts the speaker, his or her mic will be cut.\" I have been asked that before. My problem is, does it apply to me as well? Only to be fair. I get it. It can be annoying. We do our best. We got this email from Robert Grayson. \"My wife and I are worried that someone forced you to quit wearing your cross on your show. I hope that is not the case.\" Of course, this is the night where I don't have the cross on. It is dictated by the type of top or dress I wear. But no, I sleep with it, I wear it all the time, but sometimes it doesn't work with the outfit. Nobody is telling me not to wear it. Believe, I will be buried in that cross, but I hope not too soon. Finally, Robert Hofawger sent this hilarious note. \"Now that San Francisco has gone totally socialist and is trying to protect the homeless and criminals, why won't they go to Pelosi's house and camp and defecate and shoot up outside her house since she's so worried about them. Maybe she will even invite them in for a snack.\" We've often hoped that Nancy Pelosi would open her commodious abode to the homeless and to the drug addicted, and maybe minister to them with that mellifluous voice of hers. All right. If you have any thoughts or comments about the show tonight, remember, e-mail us at ingrahamangle@foxnews.com. And we might feature your e-mail. It's all the time we have tonight.
