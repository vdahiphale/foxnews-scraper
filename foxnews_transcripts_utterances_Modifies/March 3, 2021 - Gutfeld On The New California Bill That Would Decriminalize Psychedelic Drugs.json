It's a full-blown disaster at our southern border courtesy of Joe Biden. We are learning today that over 100 illegal immigrants infected with COVID were released by border patrol and they're free to travel across the country.  Keep in mind, if an American citizen gets COVID they have to quarantine and if you are flying into America from a foreign country you have to show a negative COVID test but those same rules don't apply and there is even more.  A new report says the Department of Homeland Security is projecting, there will be 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants crossing the border this year, that breaks all records. Nearly a 50 percent increase from the all-time record and much higher than last year. The report also warning there is not enough resources to handle that surge. Everybody can clearly see this is a crisis, well unless you work at the White House.",

I think that's what he said, right? God willing, you know? It's like your doctor when he's leaving, yes, is everything OK? God willing. You know? Thanks, pal. One hundred seventeen thousand child migrants unaccompanied by adults. So I asked this last week, what happened to their loving parents since November when Trump was accused of ripping children from their parents? Now it's like I am beginning to think we were lied to about that. That there weren't parents, that it was always like this.    You know, my wife was gone for a couple months. She came home and found out all the plants were dead. And in science we call this cause and effect because I didn't water the plants and they all died. And so, what you are seeing on the border is the fastest, clearest refutation of disastrous liberal policy because its cause and effect. You remove friction, a barrier combined with a message that tells everybody it's OK to come. You get 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants.  So, if you want to follow the science, that science it's cause and effect. If you eat every day at Cinnabon you are going to get fat. Why is it a disaster for the Democrats? Because it destroys any trust people have in your ability to solve any problems, your feel-good objectives result in impossible logistical challenge, you can't take care of 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants. The Democrats have these adolescent childlike goals but they have no process because they have no parents and the party to solve the problem.",

It's the busiest border in the world.   So, they are our neighbors, they are our business partners and it's long overdue. I think you go back to the '80s. The last time that we had some significant immigration reform and set rules for what goes on, on the busiest border in the world including handling child migrants as opposed to simply saying, we are going to separate them from our parents and we're going to beat them up or something or build a fictional wall. I mean, this is all unbelievable. So I think for us on this show, if we are influencers, if we are voices I think all of us across political lines need to say to the Congress, stop the finger pointing, stop the blaming, get busy, let's do something significant for America and have immigration reform that does something about who crosses, when they cross, the DREAMers, the influx, let's do it.",

It doesn't matter, you can get 500,000 migrant children, they are not going to say it's a crisis because what you saw what Jen Psaki said, we are not going to meet your bar for that. OK, but that's fine. But people have their own eyes and ears. And to Juan's point, like I also, I think about, you know, the parents that tell their teenage kids, OK, this is where we drop you off, you are on your own, Godspeed. I mean, that -- it's not that they are heartless, it's like they are heartbroken. And the other thing that we haven't talked about is the fact that you cannot get all the things that one wants without border security. It's like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. You have to have security and then everything else can get you to enlightenment, but in the meantime, that base layer is security and part of that is also going to have to be really dealing with the cartels and the coyotes.  You saw what happened yesterday with all of those people, 25 people, 27 people crammed into one SUV to try to get them into America illegally. They got hit by a semi-truck, several of them die, others are like wandering around the desert, there's children there, they don't have any restraints. Like, that is not caring for the human condition at all. But before we can -- and that is why you have to have border security that will let you do all of the other things like a temporary worker program, visas, DREAMers and things like that but until you get that base layer you are not going to be able to get those things done in Congress.",

You had one woman in that http://foxnews.com piece who said, well, I tested positive, I don't feel anything so I'm going to get on a bus with my kid and go to North Carolina. Where is Dr. Fauci to talk about the super spreader event of a 100 positive people knowingly and voluntarily moving on to different parts of the country. Remember all these CDC graphics that they produced, one of the choirs, there is one, there are 67 people and one person in the choir had COVID and they spread it to six -- to 87 percent of the people in that room? So, if you add up the number of people, the 100 cases we know of that's thousands of people who are going to get this disease as a result of the federal government not doing a better job of making sure these people were quarantined. And the standards here are insane. Every state had different standards. In New York you have to quarantine for 14 days, or whatever, maybe it's changed since then, just for getting on a bus.

But here's the issue with people like Joe Biden and those clones, you can't win against the wait until it's 100 percent safe argument because it will never be a 100 percent safe. That's the prism of two ideas. That's why Joe said, hey, maybe everything will be OK by next year this time. We saw this coming. We knew this because leaders and the media both have no skin in this game. They have jobs, they have exemptions, they have kids in private schools and tutors, they can go on forever and they'll be just great. But I want to talk about Texas just quickly.

Illegality sending users to deadly substances. Look, the media narratives have of always gotten the big threats wrong, whether it's terror or the pandemic, instead they focus on fears that are easily marketable and understood, drugs are evil.

It's a full-blown disaster at our southern border courtesy of Joe Biden. We are learning today that over 100 illegal immigrants infected with COVID were released by border patrol and they're free to travel across the country. Keep in mind, if an American citizen gets COVID they have to quarantine and if you are flying into America from a foreign country you have to show a negative COVID test but those same rules don't apply and there is even more. A new report says the Department of Homeland Security is projecting, there will be 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants crossing the border this year, that breaks all records. Nearly a 50 percent increase from the all-time record and much higher than last year. The report also warning there is not enough resources to handle that surge. Everybody can clearly see this is a crisis, well unless you work at the White House."

I think that's what he said, right? God willing, you know? It's like your doctor when he's leaving, yes, is everything OK? God willing. You know? Thanks, pal. One hundred seventeen thousand child migrants unaccompanied by adults. So I asked this last week, what happened to their loving parents since November when Trump was accused of ripping children from their parents? Now it's like I am beginning to think we were lied to about that. That there weren't parents, that it was always like this. You know, my wife was gone for a couple months. She came home and found out all the plants were dead. And in science we call this cause and effect because I didn't water the plants and they all died. And so, what you are seeing on the border is the fastest, clearest refutation of disastrous liberal policy because its cause and effect. You remove friction, a barrier combined with a message that tells everybody it's OK to come. You get 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants. So, if you want to follow the science, that science it's cause and effect. If you eat every day at Cinnabon you are going to get fat. Why is it a disaster for the Democrats? Because it destroys any trust people have in your ability to solve any problems, your feel-good objectives result in impossible logistical challenge, you can't take care of 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants. The Democrats have these adolescent childlike goals but they have no process because they have no parents and the party to solve the problem."

Because the U.S. is Mexico's largest trading partner, Mexico is our largest trading partner, people cause -- cross that border for commerce, they cross for jobs, tourism and for immigration. It's the busiest border in the world. So, they are our neighbors, they are our business partners and it's long overdue. I think you go back to the '80s. The last time that we had some significant immigration reform and set rules for what goes on, on the busiest border in the world including handling child migrants as opposed to simply saying, we are going to separate them from our parents and we're going to beat them up or something or build a fictional wall. I mean, this is all unbelievable. So I think for us on this show, if we are influencers, if we are voices I think all of us across political lines need to say to the Congress, stop the finger pointing, stop the blaming, get busy, let's do something significant for America and have immigration reform that does something about who crosses, when they cross, the DREAMers, the influx, let's do it."

It doesn't matter, you can get 500,000 migrant children, they are not going to say it's a crisis because what you saw what Jen Psaki said, we are not going to meet your bar for that. OK, but that's fine. But people have their own eyes and ears. And to Juan's point, like I also, I think about, you know, the parents that tell their teenage kids, OK, this is where we drop you off, you are on your own, Godspeed. I mean, that -- it's not that they are heartless, it's like they are heartbroken. And the other thing that we haven't talked about is the fact that you cannot get all the things that one wants without border security. It's like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. You have to have security and then everything else can get you to enlightenment, but in the meantime, that base layer is security and part of that is also going to have to be really dealing with the cartels and the coyotes. You saw what happened yesterday with all of those people, 25 people, 27 people crammed into one SUV to try to get them into America illegally. They got hit by a semi-truck, several of them die, others are like wandering around the desert, there's children there, they don't have any restraints. Like, that is not caring for the human condition at all. But before we can -- and that is why you have to have border security that will let you do all of the other things like a temporary worker program, visas, DREAMers and things like that but until you get that base layer you are not going to be able to get those things done in Congress."

Remember all these CDC graphics that they produced, one of the choirs, there is one, there are 67 people and one person in the choir had COVID and they spread it to six -- to 87 percent of the people in that room? So, if you add up the number of people, the 100 cases we know of that's thousands of people who are going to get this disease as a result of the federal government not doing a better job of making sure these people were quarantined. And the standards here are insane. Every state had different standards. In New York you have to quarantine for 14 days, or whatever, maybe it's changed since then, just for getting on a bus.

I saw Newsom wagging his little finger at Abbott, where does he come off? Texas is beating California in pretty much every single metric and their economy is doing better. The major clusters in Texas are the nursing homes and the prisons. I'm sure people will still be wearing masks there. If you go to a restaurant, Dana, you put your mask on, you fake it until you walk to the table and then you rip it off and guzzle wine and have some, I don't know, steak and potatoes and then you put the mask on when you walk to the bathroom and then you leave.

We don't talk about the United States. We talk about the mayor of Portland, we focus on the actual individuals, we don't go after Biden voters, right? Or Californians. But here's the issue with people like Joe Biden and those clones, you can't win against the wait until it's 100 percent safe argument because it will never be a 100 percent safe. That's the prism of two ideas. That's why Joe said, hey, maybe everything will be OK by next year this time. We saw this coming. We knew this because leaders and the media both have no skin in this game. They have jobs, they have exemptions, they have kids in private schools and tutors, they can go on forever and they'll be just great. But I want to talk about Texas just quickly. If Texas were a person, it's the person who leaves the lost group of hikers to go and seek help, it's the person who assumes the risk first on behalf of others. The state actually stepped up. You need of Texas in a world of leaders who have no problem shutting down things indefinitely. And the media, the media is that person in every disaster movie that needs to be slapped by the hero.

They also demonized drug use because it attracts eyeballs. Meanwhile, the war on drugs produced more casualties than most real wars, forcing consumers to purchase drugs on the street and that's how people die, diverted to the ill-measured concoctions mixed with truly deadly crap sold on the streets that lead to O.D.'s. Those mass numbers of opioid overdoses weren't from prescriptions but street drugs laced with fentanyl. I wonder how many other drug overdoses were due to that same pattern. Illegality sending users to deadly substances. Look, the media narratives have of always gotten the big threats wrong, whether it's terror or the pandemic, instead they focus on fears that are easily marketable and understood, drugs are evil. But they aren't. The desire to obstruct your right to relief is. How is drug control any different than gun control? It's about your right as an adult to make educated decisions.

I think if you did it on a very small scale and had an open debate about it and more information on the other end of the spectrum about it, we could have a conversation about moving forward to maybe changing some things rather than sticking to the status quo and the same narrative. But you've also seen this on the other side of things where people who are in a lot of pain can't get legal drugs, meaning like painkillers, and they end up committing suicide because they have such a horrible, horrible living situation.

And in both places, the voters legalized it and said it's OK. So, you know, I mean -- you know, I don't get it in some ways. I voted against it, by the way. But this to me is an extension of marijuana legalization. You know, but to me psychedelics are much more serious than smoking pot. And, you know, I agree with you guys. Everybody said, war on drugs was a mistake. It put people in jail unnecessarily. But to me, you know, when you think about psychedelics, I think psychedelics are different not only than marijuana, they're different than cocaine, they're different than heroin.

      "speaker": "GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D-NY)",
      "utterance": "I'm not going to resign. I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it. I never touched anyone inappropriately. You can go find hundreds of pictures of me kissing people, men, women. It is my usual and customary way of greeting."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Jesse, he's not resigning. Could this buy him time and then by the time the investigation concludes, it's all old news?"

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. He's trying to ride it out. But listen to what he just said. This is my usual customary way of greeting. This is what politicians do. They live in a world where they work a room. You go in there, you backslap, your handshake, you hug, you kiss, and people come up to them, and they do the same thing to them. They're fans, they say, I love you, Governor, you're the best. So, you get this familiarity with this closeness and this warmth by the way you interact as a politician with crowds. But slime balls like Cuomo or Franken or even Joe Biden, who's been accused of doing the same thing, they take advantage of access to these types of people, fans or colleagues. So, it can very quickly go from consensual arm around to that arms going lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, until the woman say what are you doing. And it's so shocking for the woman because she generally usually admires this politician. And she can't believe that it just gone from a normal friendly interaction to this guy's putting his hands in places that I can't believe it's happening. So, I would suggest that women -- and I've gotten in trouble for saying this before, you slap the man in the face, and you do it immediately. Because if you wait too long, then the politician feels like he can keep doing this. And it doesn't matter if it comes out a year, three years later. Do it immediately when it's fresh."

I would rather have him apologize for shoving people's elderly parents and grandparents into nursing homes and then having them die and have him not care about any of that and cover up the numbers, and of course, not cooperate with the federal investigation or any kind of local investigation or turning over information to Democrat and Republican lawmakers in New York. I wish that he would apologize for that kind of behavior, in addition to apologizing for making a number of people uncomfortable."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, no. I think it just is -- you know, it continues and he is trying to buy time. This is what some of the other men have been accused of this stuff try to say to try to, like ride it out. You know, Joe Biden had a similar thing. He's like, I didn't know. I didn't realize. But here's the other thing that gets to me. He kept saying in this press conference. I didn't touch anyone, like, oh, is that the new standard of exercising power over a subordinate in the workplace? Someone alert the H.R. department because that's not -- that's certainly not how the sexual harassment training goes that we all go through that he put in place as governor."
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Probably, I don't know. It's a tough -- it's a tough question. My problem is why this and not that to Katie's point. You know, Cuomo could have kissed a thousand nuns on the lips every day for a month and it's still not as bad as the rest home massacre. So, I -- you know, I thought -- to me, I felt that the apology was pathetic. It was groveling. It was painful, because he's so serious and devastated for these accusations of three women saying that they made him uncomfortable, but that's -- but it's not about the rest homes. It's like - - it's like he's -- it's like you're guilty of armed robbery, but they're charging you with double parking. It makes no sense to me. And I just can't get past that. When I'm watching how -- like that apology should have been for the rest homes. When you're watching how he's choking up, that's what -- I'm like -- going like, how is this possible? Is this -- is this 2021 that it's far worse to do that than to do this? I don't know. I'm at a loss, Juan."

I noticed, and I bet you everybody will agree with me, people are way better looking now than when I was younger. And I think it's because of YouTube instructions have made everybody hotter. Like people now know how to do stuff. Like when I was a kid, I had to live with my pimples in my funky hair. But now you just go on YouTube and you get all the answers. And if you're a five, you go to a 10. That's all I got."
