It's a blue issue because the death and destruction that we are witnessing in major cities across the country is designed by Democrats. Joe Biden needs to stand up there, rather than talking about the gun lobby and going after federal firearms license dealers, he needs to say I stand up for the police, I stand up for the victims, I stand up for the terrorized citizens and residents of all of these cities and we will go after the criminals. Let me quote Joe Biden from 1994. \"Lock the SOBs up.\" But instead, he and Kamala Harris are just trying to paper over the carnage, this was the equivalent of some old kook coming into office and walking around with a clipboard trying to act like he's doing something and he's not getting anything done. One final thought, in addition to the defund, demoralize and defang the police movement by all of the liberals, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris stand up for bail reform, it is part of their policies. So, no bail, get out of jail if you are arrested, let me go back and look at. In the original bail reform bill here in New York City which is one of the reasons that crime has spiked, these are some of the people that Democrats think it should go back out on the street. Someone promoting or possessing a sexual performance by a child, reckless assault of a child, no jail. Manslaughter, hate crimes, and arson. That's who the Democrats are and we saw none of the ability of Joe Biden to talk down what's happening in this country.",

All we've seen is crime increase. And I know it takes a while to get money out there but money is not necessarily going to solve this problem. The last thing I would say is that he says that you -- the cities, states, you are welcome to use extra COVID relief money to pay for police. So, now are they for funding the police, but with money that was supposed to go for COVID.

And we can now return back to the good old days when we trusted our police and we needed our police. Now, they're getting around to this. And they're getting around to this because they think that they can put it on guns rather than on themselves, right? So, we were the -- we were the canaries in the crime mine. We were pleading for help through this whole thing. And while we were pleading for it, the folks over at CNN were laughing at us, right? They were -- and they were purposely turning their cameras away from the crime. And you could not expose what was going on because if you exposed that, you could show how the media was culpable in all of this. All of the people -- like, the best folks -- the best spokesman for the NRA is that guy, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, the media.

Every law-abiding person should have a gun because in this crime spike, the guns were there before and the guns were there after. So, that variable doesn't play into the crime wave. It's not about gun violence at all. It's about violence and how we live in a culture, a climate change.

She says I wasn't good, I was great. And then she says -- she said no to one dance move. And at that point, her management and others involved in the conservatorship went behind closed doors, and then they came out, and the doctors that they were in control of, she says, changed her medication suddenly, putting her on lithium. She said, \"I felt drunk.\" I never wanted to be on it. And then she said, \"Not only did my family not do a goddamn thing. My dad was all for it.\" She went on saying that Jamie Spears \"Approved all of it.\" And she says her dad forced her to go to a rehab center. She says she cried on the phone with him for an hour and \"he loved every minute of it.\" She compared what her father did in sending her to that rehab center to sex trafficking. She said, I cry every day. And she said, I don't know how the state of California can do this. She said, I want changes, I want them now, this \"stupid conservatorship should end.\" She said, she hasn't said anything like this publicly before because she's been so scared. She's been so embarrassed, but she says, \"It's time I got my life back.\" And Dana, she also said she does not want to go through any more medical evaluations. She says she has been through plenty of those. She actually suggested that it is others including her father, who should go through the medical evaluation. She says it's time she got her money back.

I don't personally believe that that kind of crackdown is going to do a dent in any of the violence that we are seeing here in this country but I noticed a few things, Dagen, that he did not mention.

It's a blue issue because the death and destruction that we are witnessing in major cities across the country is designed by Democrats. Joe Biden needs to stand up there, rather than talking about the gun lobby and going after federal firearms license dealers, he needs to say I stand up for the police, I stand up for the victims, I stand up for the terrorized citizens and residents of all of these cities and we will go after the criminals. Let me quote Joe Biden from 1994. \"Lock the SOBs up.\" But instead, he and Kamala Harris are just trying to paper over the carnage, this was the equivalent of some old kook coming into office and walking around with a clipboard trying to act like he's doing something and he's not getting anything done. One final thought, in addition to the defund, demoralize and defang the police movement by all of the liberals, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris stand up for bail reform, it is part of their policies. So, no bail, get out of jail if you are arrested, let me go back and look at. In the original bail reform bill here in New York City which is one of the reasons that crime has spiked, these are some of the people that Democrats think it should go back out on the street. Someone promoting or possessing a sexual performance by a child, reckless assault of a child, no jail. Manslaughter, hate crimes, and arson.

All we've seen is crime increase. And I know it takes a while to get money out there but money is not necessarily going to solve this problem. The last thing I would say is that he says that you -- the cities, states, you are welcome to use extra COVID relief money to pay for police.

So, I think now we're all supposed to pretend that this like year- long delusion that they all shared suddenly just no longer exists. And we can now return back to the good old days when we trusted our police and we needed our police. Now, they're getting around to this. And they're getting around to this because they think that they can put it on guns rather than on themselves, right? So, we were the -- we were the canaries in the crime mine. We were pleading for help through this whole thing. And while we were pleading for it, the folks over at CNN were laughing at us, right? They were -- and they were purposely turning their cameras away from the crime. And you could not expose what was going on because if you exposed that, you could show how the media was culpable in all of this. All of the people -- like, the best folks -- the best spokesman for the NRA is that guy, Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, the media. There were five million new legal gun owners last year and it wasn't because of Wayne LaPierre, right? Have you seen him? No."

I'm now more pro-gun than I ever have been in my life. And I will continue to be -- I want everybody to own a gun. Every law-abiding person should have a gun because in this crime spike, the guns were there before and the guns were there after. So, that variable doesn't play into the crime wave. It's not about gun violence at all. It's about violence and how we live in a culture, a climate change. We've had a change in our climate, where we now regard law and order as the bad guy and the bad guy as the victim. That's where we are.

She started off by saying to the judge, I have a lot to say, so bear with me there. She then talked about finishing a tour in 2018 and going into rehearsals for her Vegas show. She says I wasn't good, I was great. And then she says -- she said no to one dance move. And at that point, her management and others involved in the conservatorship went behind closed doors, and then they came out, and the doctors that they were in control of, she says, changed her medication suddenly, putting her on lithium. She said, \"I felt drunk.\" I never wanted to be on it. And then she said, \"Not only did my family not do a goddamn thing. My dad was all for it.\" She went on saying that Jamie Spears \"Approved all of it.\" And she says her dad forced her to go to a rehab center. She says she cried on the phone with him for an hour and \"he loved every minute of it.\" She compared what her father did in sending her to that rehab center to sex trafficking. She said, I cry every day. And she said, I don't know how the state of California can do this. She said, I want changes, I want them now, this \"stupid conservatorship should end.\" She said, she hasn't said anything like this publicly before because she's been so scared. She's been so embarrassed, but she says, \"It's time I got my life back.\" And Dana, she also said she does not want to go through any more medical evaluations. She says she has been through plenty of those. She actually suggested that it is others including her father, who should go through the medical evaluation. She says it's time she got her money back.

I don't even remember but I flew off the handle, ran away from home. I think the cops found me walking along a street and my dad had to pick me up. If my dad had put me into some conservatorship and frozen my finances, which were I think negative at the time, and then had a financial straight jacket around because I melted down at 18 -- who doesn't meltdown at 18? We've all been there. I think this thing has run its course. It's time to take the training wheels off. Maybe you don't say OK, you have your full freedom. You give her a little bit here. You give her a little bit here. Surely her legal team can say listen, she's a grown woman as Geraldo said. She's been successful in a professional capacity for quite some time.
