He was mad because someone raped his daughter in a transgender bathroom and the school covered it up. And that story is about a week old and the A.G. wasn't briefed on it. Didn't even know about that. The whole case that this whole frivolous thing was based on falls apart and the guy has no clue.

The meeting ended and some of the parents followed the medical experts into the parking lot and -- they had this all in film, and told the medical experts we know where you live. So, are there other examples of people who should be? And I think if you take the word parents out of the thing since -- I don't like the snitch line, but if you're going to go after people who try to assault and attack other Americans that's one thing. Now, this is a fine line we got a balance here because we should not discourage any American from going to any political setting and explaining where he or she feels and no one should try to suppress that. The line is crossed when a politician or citizen begins to threaten one another. And if you take the word parents out and politicians, I can't threaten someone that I disagree with.

That this memo is purely based on the letter that the National School Board Association wrote that they worked with the White House in crafting. Twenty state school boards recently have come out and disavowed that letter from the national organization saying we're not part of this. We haven't witnessed violence. The threshold for action by law enforcement, Harold, is the -- that the likelihood of violence that is real and imminent, not even -- threats of violence don't stand up. It has to be likely and real for law enforcement to intervene because the first amendment is so strong, the right to free speech and the right to spirited debate. Here's what's going on here. Questioning critical race theory, parents across the country, you got called a racist. That didn't shut them up. That didn't keep them at home and they kept going to school board meetings. So, now you need to call them domestic terrorists and seek the FBI and the Department of Justice on them. Why? Because these are parents. These aren't just white parents these are parents of color across the country that are trying to finally dismantle the ecosystem that is keeping children undereducated, uneducated, and stupid. And I'm talking about the stranglehold of the teachers unions. I'm talking about the white elitists who control school boards across this country. And the reason that they try to do this with the Department of Justice and this memo is because here's what's also coming out, and it came up in the hearing today, is the woke consultants who are being paid with taxpayer dollars and the dollars of parents who are peddling this critical race theory claptrap to students across the country., It is going into the hands of the rich and the few including Merrick Garland's son-in-law. So that's where it's going, but it's all -- these are parents -- this is -- the organization called Parents Defending Education. Watch Asra Nomani. Asra Nomani used to write for the \"Wall Street Journal\" and she is fired up. They're behind this Freedom of Information Act request. It's all going to come pouring out and finally parents across the country, regardless of your race, will take back the education of their kids from the unions and the woke consultants.",

What I've seen from Kyrsten Sinema is that she's not somebody that you want to dare because she is not going to be pushed around. She doesn't care about that. There's two big things for them. Senator Manchin says that he doesn't like the short sunsets. This is the gimmick where they pass all the freebies, but they only pay for it for a year and then in the election of 2022, they'll ask all the Republicans, how dare you not be for children et cetera.

We have no further comment at this time. Please respect their privacy.\" So, the national manhunt for Brian Laundrie is now officially over. It was in fact his human remains found here yesterday inside the nature park where he had been told by his mom and dad to the FBI that this is where he went off for a hike as he frequently did two days after Gabby Petito was finally reported missing up in Suffolk County, New York by her mother after not hearing from her for weeks and weeks. And of course, Brian Laundrie returned home from that big summer long road trip out west at all the national parks without Gabby Petito. What he told his parents to explain why she was gone, nobody knows. But the family did go camping following weekend up outside of Tampa, and they've been under investigation.

You have to put -- you have to admit that. But what's worse is how easy it was to motivate this guy to comply. Just send a letter. I might do that to you, Harold, just for the hell of it. I'll make up something. But it's also weird how removed he is from reality, right? He was talking about how he reads about stuff in the news. He had no idea about what happened with the Department of Interior last week. The dude is the attorney general, didn't know that an insurrection happened. He has no idea about the statistics behind these police suspect interactions. He gets all of his direction from secondary undocumented opinions.

You can write a letter to the A.G. and they can activate the FBI. Oh, and there were some articles in the letter that they linked to and I read some articles about it too. So he got a letter from a liberal and read some fake news and that's how you get an active FBI investigation? And the whole crux of the story was this one parent that was mad. Why was he mad? He was mad because someone raped his daughter in a transgender bathroom and the school covered it up. And that story is about a week old and the A.G. wasn't briefed on it. Didn't even know about that. The whole case that this whole frivolous thing was based on falls apart and the guy has no clue. And then he says, you know what, not really familiar with the facts of the case of the father. Well he wasn't familiar with the facts of all these other fake threats that they put in this letter. I read the letter, remember? Twenty threats, only one was credible. And he goes, oh, you know what, the father situation seems like a state's case. Well, what do you think an angry parent is?

It was a school board meeting down in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, I believe. And they had some medical experts and some of the parents were there and they disagreed with the experts. The meeting ended and some of the parents followed the medical experts into the parking lot and -- they had this all in film, and told the medical experts we know where you live. So, are there other examples of people who should be? And I think if you take the word parents out of the thing since -- I don't like the snitch line, but if you're going to go after people who try to assault and attack other Americans that's one thing. Now, this is a fine line we got a balance here because we should not discourage any American from going to any political setting and explaining where he or she feels and no one should try to suppress that. The line is crossed when a politician or citizen begins to threaten one another. And if you take the word parents out and politicians, I can't threaten someone that I disagree with. If Jesse and I disagree or you and I disagree and I threaten you with physical violence, there's a law -- law should be activated."

If I show up at a school board meeting and I yell and I tell a school board member I know where you live, I know where your kids go to school and you best believe you better watch out.

      "utterance": "But A.G. Garland has no facts. He admitted that. There's no body of evidence. That this memo is purely based on the letter that the National School Board Association wrote that they worked with the White House in crafting. Twenty state school boards recently have come out and disavowed that letter from the national organization saying we're not part of this. We haven't witnessed violence. The threshold for action by law enforcement, Harold, is the -- that the likelihood of violence that is real and imminent, not even -- threats of violence don't stand up. It has to be likely and real for law enforcement to intervene because the first amendment is so strong, the right to free speech and the right to spirited debate. Here's what's going on here. Questioning critical race theory, parents across the country, you got called a racist. That didn't shut them up. That didn't keep them at home and they kept going to school board meetings. So, now you need to call them domestic terrorists and seek the FBI and the Department of Justice on them. Why? Because these are parents. These aren't just white parents these are parents of color across the country that are trying to finally dismantle the ecosystem that is keeping children undereducated, uneducated, and stupid. And I'm talking about the stranglehold of the teachers unions. I'm talking about the white elitists who control school boards across this country. And the reason that they try to do this with the Department of Justice and this memo is because here's what's also coming out, and it came up in the hearing today, is the woke consultants who are being paid with taxpayer dollars and the dollars of parents who are peddling this critical race theory claptrap to students across the country., It is going into the hands of the rich and the few including Merrick Garland's son-in-law. So that's where it's going, but it's all -- these are parents -- this is -- the organization called Parents Defending Education. Watch Asra Nomani. Asra Nomani used to write for the \"Wall Street Journal\" and she is fired up. They're behind this Freedom of Information Act request. It's all going to come pouring out and finally parents across the country, regardless of your race, will take back the education of their kids from the unions and the woke consultants."

They didn't report it. MSNBC didn't report it. None of the mainstream media reported that. So he goes on this Capitol Hill hearing clueless about a major development in the crux of this case to label parents domestic terrorists because the mainstream media didn't cover that story because that didn't fit the narrative."

Senator Schumer's own PAC showed that in the last five months, President Biden with persuadable voters went from a plus five to a negative 30. So, it's not going in the right direction for the Democrats. And at the same time, you have the White House trying to woo Senator Manchin and they're trying to isolate Kyrsten Sinema. What I've seen from Kyrsten Sinema is that she's not somebody that you want to dare because she is not going to be pushed around. She doesn't care about that. There's two big things for them. Senator Manchin says that he doesn't like the short sunsets. This is the gimmick where they pass all the freebies, but they only pay for it for a year and then in the election of 2022, they'll ask all the Republicans, how dare you not be for children et cetera. But the other thing is Kyrsten Sinema has said she doesn't want any new taxes.

I'm not one that thinks you should over regulate anyone, but I am one that thinks that we've got to lay out what our priorities are and I would agree with Greg. As you saw yesterday, I thought the president missed an opportunity early in the speech that's why I wanted to go back to the speech because I thought maybe later in the speech he would have articulated more clearly, but he got going and it took him a while to get going, but you've got to lay out why are we spending this money. Is it too much? Is it too little? And at this point, I would agree we're not there yet. The narrative is not as tight as it should be, but they're going to get a deal. Manchin is going to get a deal with Sanders and if Sanders and the progressives don't want to play with Manchin, then we may not get anything at all and that would be a real disaster for my party."

They wouldn't say a rape of an incapacitated woman by an illegal immigrant was stopped. It would be like, you know, white man attacks black migrants seeking love.

The divide in carbon emissions between the U.S. and China is no longer even close. There's multiples of our carbon output which I think we should note at the very beginning of any conversation about global warming. But look, we don't have the capacity to build -- we don't have the materials, the rare earth materials among others, we don't have the manufacturing capacity to make the green energy so called projects that the Biden administration is now calling for. So, by definition, we start building these along the -- both coasts soon, that's China's win. Like they're the ones are going to be making them for us, period, and the batteries."

And so, they've been kind of taken advantage of by these mostly foreign wind power companies. The way to fight back, I think the environmental community to the extent there any honest people left, they could play a huge role in this. You're destroying a fishery. I mean, there's a lot of evidence that these things are killing -- make the California condor extinct, for example. Sending whales on the -- you know, in the wrong direction, interfering with the natural sonar of marine life. I mean, these things have a terrible effect on the environment.

And I understand that that's just happening across the country. But there's one other thing that we haven't mentioned here, and that was a part of that, which is when these wind turbines -- when the blades and they're live, they're useful live, when they go into a landfill, they do not disintegrate. You could not recycle them. They will be there forever."

I mean, every energy source has a downside, period, whether it's nuclear, hydro, coal plants, natural gas, it doesn't matter. They all have a downside. Energy is not free, it never will be. But the downside from wind farms so far exceeds their upside, that the only reason they exist -- I mean, there are towns -- and I'm very familiar with some of these towns, in northern New England, for example, where the majority of the town's annual budget comes from wind farm companies. So, it's kind of like a deal they can't refuse. They're being preyed upon because they're weak. That's the underlying story of green energy I would say."

So, the constituency died. That's the first thing. Second, if they're not complaining about an industry, that means they're being funded by the industry, so I would follow the money there.

But at that point, we still did not know the identity of whose bones they were. Then, about 5:15 across town over at the Laundrie home, an unmarked car pulled up, a couple of FBI agents went in for about three or four minutes. And then, just minutes ago, the FBI Denver which has been leading the FBI's investigation due to its proximity and control over the happenings in Wyoming where gabby Petito's body was discovered, they tweeted out, and I will quote to you exactly what they wrote. \"A comparison of dental records confirmed that the human remains found are those of Brian Laundrie.\" Steve Bertolino, the often-quoted attorney for the parents, Chris and Roberta Laundrie, has also put out a short note saying, \"The parents have been notified. We have no further comment at this time. Please respect their privacy.\" So, the national manhunt for Brian Laundrie is now officially over. It was in fact his human remains found here yesterday inside the nature park where he had been told by his mom and dad to the FBI that this is where he went off for a hike as he frequently did two days after Gabby Petito was finally reported missing up in Suffolk County, New York by her mother after not hearing from her for weeks and weeks. And of course, Brian Laundrie returned home from that big summer long road trip out west at all the national parks without Gabby Petito. What he told his parents to explain why she was gone, nobody knows. But the family did go camping following weekend up outside of Tampa, and they've been under investigation. But they probably won't be charged at all now that their son is dead and there's no way to contradict anything they had shared."
