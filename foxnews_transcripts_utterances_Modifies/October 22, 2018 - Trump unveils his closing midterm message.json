And Beto O'Rourke is actually -- he's saying that an indictment and impeachment are the same thing, which is just legally not true, and he should know that if he's running for senate. I do think that if he ends up losing in Texas you will see him on all of the shows for the next week, where the host will beg him to run in 2020 and President Trump should want that to happen because that is not a strong message. Cory Booker, where is he giving that speech? He's in South Carolina.  Is he in South Carolina because he's helping congressional Democrats who are really wanting to or challengers to Republicans because they really want to win. That's not happening in South Carolina. Unlike Lindsey Graham, for example. He going on a 12-state tour after Kavanaugh so he can do all those things.   President Trump said his closing argument is going to be Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense. Now, I think that saying that closing argument, two and a half weeks until the election in this news cycle is a little risky because by Saturday we could have a new closing argument because if you think about it, Kavanaugh was just two weeks ago. But the Democrats, they are bailing out of three important races today. Down in Texas 23rd, that's Will Hurd's seat, that was a district that Hillary Clinton won but now he's pulling ahead so Democrats are going to take money out of that, try to put it somewhere else. That's happened also in Nebraska 2 and Minnesota 8. So, places where the Democrats are thinking they could have pickups, those are now out of reach for them, possibly. Of course it depends on turnout, but if they are not going to put money in, that shows something. The Democrats' closing message is going to be this, healthcare, specifically pre-existing conditions, which we can talk about more if you wanted.  And if you see their ads, they're starting to say, check on President Trump. Vote for a check on President Trump. So, if you are a challenger to a Republican who is already in Congress, the ad would say, Jesse Watters votes with President Trump 98 percent of the time. You don't want that, do you?

You know, it's national security, crime and borders. It is law and order. It's really hard to find out what the Democrats are for. You only know what they're against. Him, and they're also against being out of power. So that leads you into the arena of what Nancy Pelosi said, which was particularly loathsome, that collateral damage is acceptable. And we know this. We know that the end justifies the means. By any means possible, they need their power.   So you saw with Kavanaugh, his family, collateral damage, right. If you look at what's happening now with the caravan, the collateral damage are those people who may suffer grave injury trying to cross a river or being sexually abused, but they want that spectacle, right, they want that. So that's collateral damage.  They want to raise taxes and increase regulation that hurts businesses, collateral damage. We'd go back all the way to Obamacare, right, collateral damage. You lost your doctor, your rates went up, but that was collateral damage because the idea of government running healthcare was such a big idea, didn't matter if you lost your doctor. So their message, it's not about ideas, it's not about progress. It's about power by any means necessary, and when you have that ideology, that means collateral damage is not just acceptable, it's practically the only thing you have.

So that means that you go back to red meat, you go back to the most kind of cultural war issues you can find. And for Trump, you know, his number one hit on the road has always been immigration, build the wall, go after 'em. And that's what he's trying to do.  So, he's trying to get his base revved up for the midterms with these kind of red meat issues, but it's so far that the big absence is that Republicans don't have a strong message when they thought they were going to have a message.

And no one -- Paul Ryan came into power as this one key spending, you know, he was a person who neutralized spending and talked about cutting costs and the debt is now $21 trillion. When Nancy Pelosi goes out and when she is the mouthpiece for this party, and when she talks about the house is going to once again rest in Democrat hands, that riles up Republicans more than anything, and independents, because she's not a likable person.

So, human beings with common sense naturally reject anything that doesn't have a process. Yet, the Democrats always choose issues where process is portrayed as inhuman or cold. So in the Kavanaugh hearing, if you yell due process, you must hate women, right. You are a pig for wanting due process.

I also look at the flip side, and there is an increase in immigration, which because we have a horrible immigration system, a lot tends to be illegal immigration in this country when there is economic help, and that is a good sign.

The low unemployment numbers are the biggest magnet for people. The problem is Greg is absolutely right, it is all about systems. There's so much confusion.

And Beto O'Rourke is actually -- he's saying that an indictment and impeachment are the same thing, which is just legally not true, and he should know that if he's running for senate. I do think that if he ends up losing in Texas you will see him on all of the shows for the next week, where the host will beg him to run in 2020 and President Trump should want that to happen because that is not a strong message. Cory Booker, where is he giving that speech? He's in South Carolina. Is he in South Carolina because he's helping congressional Democrats who are really wanting to or challengers to Republicans because they really want to win. That's not happening in South Carolina. Unlike Lindsey Graham, for example. He going on a 12-state tour after Kavanaugh so he can do all those things. President Trump said his closing argument is going to be Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense. Now, I think that saying that closing argument, two and a half weeks until the election in this news cycle is a little risky because by Saturday we could have a new closing argument because if you think about it, Kavanaugh was just two weeks ago. But the Democrats, they are bailing out of three important races today. Down in Texas 23rd, that's Will Hurd's seat, that was a district that Hillary Clinton won but now he's pulling ahead so Democrats are going to take money out of that, try to put it somewhere else. That's happened also in Nebraska 2 and Minnesota 8. So, places where the Democrats are thinking they could have pickups, those are now out of reach for them, possibly. Of course it depends on turnout, but if they are not going to put money in, that shows something. The Democrats' closing message is going to be this, healthcare, specifically pre-existing conditions, which we can talk about more if you wanted. And if you see their ads, they're starting to say, check on President Trump. Vote for a check on President Trump. So, if you are a challenger to a Republican who is already in Congress, the ad would say, Jesse Watters votes with President Trump 98 percent of the time. You don't want that, do you? And that's how they're trying to motivate the base. Republicans out there --"

He's basically out on the campaign trail all weekend.

You know, it's national security, crime and borders. It is law and order. It's really hard to find out what the Democrats are for. You only know what they're against. Him, and they're also against being out of power. So that leads you into the arena of what Nancy Pelosi said, which was particularly loathsome, that collateral damage is acceptable. And we know this. We know that the end justifies the means. By any means possible, they need their power. So you saw with Kavanaugh, his family, collateral damage, right. If you look at what's happening now with the caravan, the collateral damage are those people who may suffer grave injury trying to cross a river or being sexually abused, but they want that spectacle, right, they want that. So that's collateral damage. They want to raise taxes and increase regulation that hurts businesses, collateral damage. We'd go back all the way to Obamacare, right, collateral damage. You lost your doctor, your rates went up, but that was collateral damage because the idea of government running healthcare was such a big idea, didn't matter if you lost your doctor. So their message, it's not about ideas, it's not about progress. It's about power by any means necessary, and when you have that ideology, that means collateral damage is not just acceptable, it's practically the only thing you have. They're not Democrats, they're damage-crats."

They want to say we delivered on a tax cut for the forgotten man. What you see is Republicans are not running commercials about tax cuts because they're not having any traction with the voters. So that means that you go back to red meat, you go back to the most kind of cultural war issues you can find. And for Trump, you know, his number one hit on the road has always been immigration, build the wall, go after 'em. And that's what he's trying to do. So, he's trying to get his base revved up for the midterms with these kind of red meat issues, but it's so far that the big absence is that Republicans don't have a strong message when they thought they were going to have a message.

And when you talk about consumer optimism, which has been one of the big drivers for the economy and for the stock market, that is completely stifled when we finally get the bill for this outrageous money that we're spending on everything. And no one -- Paul Ryan came into power as this one key spending, you know, he was a person who neutralized spending and talked about cutting costs and the debt is now $21 trillion. When Nancy Pelosi goes out and when she is the mouthpiece for this party, and when she talks about the house is going to once again rest in Democrat hands, that riles up Republicans more than anything, and independents, because she's not a likable person. She's not only unlikable, she's a person who doesn't have a message and you can joke that Republicans don't have a message, and you may not agree with it, but something is simple, as jobs not mobs that, resonates to people because they would much rather have jobs and money for their kids than run up against a wall of protesters who are going to call them names and spit on them and stop their car and vandalize nice cities."

And right now, the Democrats, they have no process, or system, they just have a goal. And when you just have a goal, it always ends badly because it has no system. So, human beings with common sense naturally reject anything that doesn't have a process. Yet, the Democrats always choose issues where process is portrayed as inhuman or cold. So in the Kavanaugh hearing, if you yell due process, you must hate women, right. You are a pig for wanting due process. And the Khashoggi thing, if you're trying to say investigative process, they're saying there's emotional outrage, why aren't we doing something now. No, weh have an investigative process.

And they think that it increases their chances if there's one giant thing that's crossing the border, it increases their chances of making it to safety and prosperity. You know (inaudible) I don't think these are bad people. I also look at the flip side, and there is an increase in immigration, which because we have a horrible immigration system, a lot tends to be illegal immigration in this country when there is economic help, and that is a good sign. When there is a dip and when we have a recession, you don't see as many people trying to come across, but there are jobs to be had here. The low unemployment numbers are the biggest magnet for people. The problem is Greg is absolutely right, it is all about systems. There's so much confusion. We are hearing two sides on the exact same issue, and we don't know because you hear that, you know, detention centers are full and they are letting everyone go.

And then mentioned her cookbook, which Warren wrote in the '80s -- ready for the title? -- \"Pow-Wow Chow.\" Get it? \"Pow-Wow Chow\"? And it's a collection of recipes from families from the Five Tribes. She calls herself a Cherokee. That's her profiting off of this, Juan. And it also notes that three of the five recipes were plagiarized from The New York Times and Better Homes and Gardens. So she plagiarized her ancestry and her recipes. It's a slam-dunk for Republicans the more she's in the spotlight. And I think Haley is funny. That line killed. And the liberals that can't laugh about that, like Chaffetz did a little thing where he was posing in front of, I think, a wooden Native American statue at Disney World. And she was, yes, Pocahontas.
