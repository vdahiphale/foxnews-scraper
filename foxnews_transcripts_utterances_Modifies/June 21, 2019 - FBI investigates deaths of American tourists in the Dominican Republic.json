Meanwhile, as you know, Mark Esper, the Army secretary, is going to replace him on an acting basis, hopes to make it through the confirmation process. We are there when he speaks.  And then, of course, there is this, something that would be front and center for the Defense Department, \"cocked and loaded, a president saying that he is in no hurry to strike around, the president today defending his decision to call over retaliatory airstrikes just 10 minutes to go, saying it would have been probably not proportionate to the downing of an unmanned drone.  So what will the right response be, whenever it comes? We will ask the ranking members Foreign Affairs Committee, Mike McCaul.  Busy news day for you. Welcome, everybody. Happy to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto.  We have got FOX team coverage with Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon on what the military is saying now, and Kevin Corke at the State Department on why airlines are taking no chances now. We begin with Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Neil. Well, there's a very different atmosphere here at the Pentagon today from yesterday. Navy warships, we have learned, were in position and ready to strike with Tomahawk missiles, just awaiting the go orders. President Trump explained his change of heart in a tweet -- quote -- \"We were cocked and loaded to retaliate last night on three different sites when I asked how many will die?; 150 people, sir, was the answer from a general. Ten minutes before the strike, I stopped it. Not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I'm in no hurry.\" There remains serious questions about what changed the president's mind. Any military strike plan earlier in the day would have been accompanied by a casualty estimate. Those first briefings by the military occurred at 11:00 a.m. at the White House, not 10 minutes before the launch. This was a propaganda victory for Iran.   State TV released this video showing what it claims is the wreckage of the large U.S. Navy drone. It's the second time in a week Iranian forces fired on U.S. drones. There is no evidence, based on Iranian behavior, that these were rogue units. Furthermore, Iran said today it chose not to shoot down the manned U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon surveillance plane with 35 American service members on board to avoid casualties. That plane, we have confirmed with U.S. officials, was flying near the American Global Hawk drone and shot this video of the drone being shot down. Tensions are lower today, but the U.S. military, we're told, is still poised to respond if need be. There are still 70,000 U.S. troops in the region and an aircraft carrier strike group -- Neil.",

When you think about it, commercial airliners getting mistaken for military aircraft could certainly happen, and so they're being warned by American officials to steer clear of that area.  Let me share part of the notice sent to American aviation companies and individuals who might be operating aircraft in that part of the world. It reads thusly, at least in part: \"The NOTAM warns pilots that flights are not permitted in the overwater area of the Tehran Flight Information Region until further notice, due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions that might place commercial flights at risk.\"  It ends by saying this: \"The NOTAM applies to all U.S. air carriers and commercial operators.\"   This of course, all comes after Iran downed a $130 million surveillance drone, but to hear the Iranians tell it, Neil, it wasn't an accident, it was justified. One of their generals saying: \"We have issued verbal warnings, fired warning shots, and have repeatedly conveyed to American officials our objection through the Foreign Ministry, but apparently they don't plan to abide by international regulations. So it's normal that we react.\" Meanwhile, local long-haul carriers like Emirates and Etihad were among those that have changed their flight routes. I have been in that part of the world, as you have. As you know, it is a major hub to global air travel. And at least for right now, they are not taking any chances, Neil.

They have not necessarily responded entirely in kind. But they did remind the world that they were seeing a U.S. military plane with 35 on board that they opted not to shoot down.

We're going to break away here just to catch Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, who is saying his goodbyes at the Pentagon. We don't know if he's going to make formal remarks, per se.  But he's done. He is leaving. And, obviously, as you know, Mark Esper, the Army secretary, is going to replace him, also on an acting basis, as the defense secretary. This would be the third such defense secretary for this administration, obviously, in the middle of everything that's happening in Iran. We will keep very close track of that.   Do want to take your attention to the markets as well, because, for all of this back and forth, and the ships, and who's running the Defense Department and not, what's happening Iran and not, you would think that we would be freefalling, or at least oil prices would be skyrocketing. We're not.  We ended on a down note for the Dow today, but it could have been a lot worse, oil on the week up about $4.66 a barrel. But putting that in perspective against the first sort of unrest around OPEC oil cuts with us back in the early 1970s, they effectively doubled to quadrupled in about 48 hours. That was then, a very, very different reaction now. So we're going to be exploring that in a lot more detail here, but the world markets and our own markets holding up very nicely on the week, the Dow up about 2.5 percent, similar advances on all the other major market averages.

But I do think he's sort of stepped back for a minute to give the diplomacy a little more time, so that we don't escalate the situation.

He's obviously trying to put this back in Iran's court to do and respond.

It is important to note the United Nations Security Council is going to meet on this issue on Monday. I think he wants to get the full support from our allies before he takes action in the region. This is not a president who's shy to use force.  But I think he is using -- being a little more thoughtful and measured and deliberate in his approach, because, once you start this escalation, as the head of the IRGC, the general, said, he's calling on the proxies to go to war. They would respond in kind, and we would escalate the entire tension between the two countries. So, I think a little bit of a pause is probably not a bad idea here.

Meanwhile, as you know, Mark Esper, the Army secretary, is going to replace him on an acting basis, hopes to make it through the confirmation process. We are there when he speaks. And then, of course, there is this, something that would be front and center for the Defense Department, \"cocked and loaded, a president saying that he is in no hurry to strike around, the president today defending his decision to call over retaliatory airstrikes just 10 minutes to go, saying it would have been probably not proportionate to the downing of an unmanned drone. So what will the right response be, whenever it comes? We will ask the ranking members Foreign Affairs Committee, Mike McCaul. Busy news day for you. Welcome, everybody. Happy to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto. We have got FOX team coverage with Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon on what the military is saying now, and Kevin Corke at the State Department on why airlines are taking no chances now. We begin with Jennifer. Hey, Jennifer."

    {
      "speaker": "JENNIFER GRIFFIN, NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. Well, there's a very different atmosphere here at the Pentagon today from yesterday. Navy warships, we have learned, were in position and ready to strike with Tomahawk missiles, just awaiting the go orders. President Trump explained his change of heart in a tweet -- quote -- \"We were cocked and loaded to retaliate last night on three different sites when I asked how many will die?; 150 people, sir, was the answer from a general. Ten minutes before the strike, I stopped it. Not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I'm in no hurry.\" There remains serious questions about what changed the president's mind. Any military strike plan earlier in the day would have been accompanied by a casualty estimate. Those first briefings by the military occurred at 11:00 a.m. at the White House, not 10 minutes before the launch. This was a propaganda victory for Iran. State TV released this video showing what it claims is the wreckage of the large U.S. Navy drone. It's the second time in a week Iranian forces fired on U.S. drones. There is no evidence, based on Iranian behavior, that these were rogue units. Furthermore, Iran said today it chose not to shoot down the manned U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon surveillance plane with 35 American service members on board to avoid casualties. That plane, we have confirmed with U.S. officials, was flying near the American Global Hawk drone and shot this video of the drone being shot down. Tensions are lower today, but the U.S. military, we're told, is still poised to respond if need be. There are still 70,000 U.S. troops in the region and an aircraft carrier strike group -- Neil."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "It ends by saying this",
      "utterance": "\"The NOTAM applies to all U.S. air carriers and commercial operators.\" This of course, all comes after Iran downed a $130 million surveillance drone, but to hear the Iranians tell it, Neil, it wasn't an accident, it was justified. One of their generals saying: \"We have issued verbal warnings, fired warning shots, and have repeatedly conveyed to American officials our objection through the Foreign Ministry, but apparently they don't plan to abide by international regulations. So it's normal that we react.\" Meanwhile, local long-haul carriers like Emirates and Etihad were among those that have changed their flight routes. I have been in that part of the world, as you have. As you know, it is a major hub to global air travel. And at least for right now, they are not taking any chances, Neil. Steer clear of the area, we're all being told from our perch here -- Neil."

We haven't had any American ships hit in these two months. This was an unmanned global drone. I like it. I like the fact we didn't go to war. I also think that the president -- the administration has cut the decision process almost in half. And all the people complaining about this are wedded to the old bureaucratic system that brought us Vietnam and 18 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Colonel, I wondered whether the president is providing wide latitude with the Iranians to come up with maybe, I don't know, an ego-saving type of an alternative to say, all right, you could not have planned this attack on this drone, that it had to be an errant general or someone with a trigger finger, what have you, and then today to remind the Iranians that we were ready to strike, and he pulled it in the last few minutes. They have not necessarily responded entirely in kind. But they did remind the world that they were seeing a U.S. military plane with 35 on board that they opted not to shoot down. They said it was over their airspace. We have said the opposite. But is that the first sign that maybe the two sides are trying to deal with each other in a less bellicose way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUNT",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's a smart move on our part, a smart move on Tehran's part. We have really crippled them economically. They used to have two-and-a- half million barrels a day they was selling. Now it's down to 200,000. It's always a tense area. But what we didn't do yesterday was a strong signal that we're not looking to go to war. And a lot of people are complaining about this, but would have complained either way. I think it's a great move that we don't kill 150 Iranians and possibly go to war with Iran. We got 18 years of war we're still at in Afghanistan and Iraq."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Colonel, thank you very, very much. We're going to break away here just to catch Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, who is saying his goodbyes at the Pentagon. We don't know if he's going to make formal remarks, per se. But he's done. He is leaving. And, obviously, as you know, Mark Esper, the Army secretary, is going to replace him, also on an acting basis, as the defense secretary. This would be the third such defense secretary for this administration, obviously, in the middle of everything that's happening in Iran. We will keep very close track of that. Do want to take your attention to the markets as well, because, for all of this back and forth, and the ships, and who's running the Defense Department and not, what's happening Iran and not, you would think that we would be freefalling, or at least oil prices would be skyrocketing. We're not. We ended on a down note for the Dow today, but it could have been a lot worse, oil on the week up about $4.66 a barrel. But putting that in perspective against the first sort of unrest around OPEC oil cuts with us back in the early 1970s, they effectively doubled to quadrupled in about 48 hours. That was then, a very, very different reaction now. So we're going to be exploring that in a lot more detail here, but the world markets and our own markets holding up very nicely on the week, the Dow up about 2.5 percent, similar advances on all the other major market averages.

I think he weighs this very heavily. I think, at the end of the day, he didn't think it was a proportionate response to what the Iranians did. I do think a measured response is necessary. But I do think he's sort of stepped back for a minute to give the diplomacy a little more time, so that we don't escalate the situation. The intelligence community will tell you that, if we hit Iran and Iranians on Iranian soil, that we could really escalate the situation and have the people of Iran rally behind the ayatollah."

I think these additional sanctions will do the same. If I were going to maybe do strikes, perhaps the oil platforms in the Gulf that would hurt them economically, because, the more they're hurt economically, it could collapse. And what he stands up for are the Iranian people over the ayatollah. He doesn't want to see a nuclear Iran."

And he has held open the possibility that maybe the Iranians might have erred in this original drone attack, that it wasn't coming from Tehran, that, in fact, it was coming from someone who had a trigger finger, whatever, and, then again, with minutes to go, halting this that strike that was ready to go. He's obviously trying to put this back in Iran's court to do and respond. We got a hint of that, Congressman, with the Iranians saying they could have shot down a U.S. military jet with 35 on board, and didn't. So maybe something's happening. What do you think?"

It is important to note the United Nations Security Council is going to meet on this issue on Monday. I think he wants to get the full support from our allies before he takes action in the region. This is not a president who's shy to use force. But I think he is using -- being a little more thoughtful and measured and deliberate in his approach, because, once you start this escalation, as the head of the IRGC, the general, said, he's calling on the proxies to go to war. They would respond in kind, and we would escalate the entire tension between the two countries. So, I think a little bit of a pause is probably not a bad idea here. I do think they should -- they should suffer for what they have done in the Gulf area and their provocation. But I think the president was exercising caution here."

Do you think they're getting ahead of themselves?"

And the president knows that the American people are tired of wars in the Middle East. He also mentioned President Xi's interest in -- I think, 80 percent of their energy comes out of the Straits of Hormuz, so they ought to be bearing some of the burden here. And I think he's right about that. And so this is a -- this is an intense situation. I got to tell you, Neil, it's one of the most sobering meetings I have been in with, with the president there, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretary of state. And I think the president's using caution, but he's being patient. But his patience -- patience will wear thin, particularly if the Iranians continue in this provocation."

I would argue, though, that strikes have been done both under Clinton and Obama in the past without an AUMF. That wouldn't really apply if we engaged in hostile activities on the ground. And so I think it's premature. But I do you think going through Congress is always a better route. But, right now, it would be self-defense, which the president, under Article 2, is fully authorized to do to defend the nation and American interests, which is what this drone strike was."

He's got a lot of cache from having served as vice president under our first black president. And I think that that is the way they're going to go.

And the reality is, though, the times have changed. And he should know better than to know that, at this moment, with the way the Democratic Party is, it's probably not the best story to bring up.

Just a couple of blocks from our harbor-front position here, protesters were active. They surrounded and block the city's police headquarters for much of the day into the evening. Yes, they're upset and they are demanding the scrapping of that controversial extradition law, which could, they think, expose residents here to the very suspect Chinese justice system. They have a bunch of other demands too. We were out on the street. Here is how the protests kicked off on Friday. Take a look."

Now, the country itself is saying that there is no mystery to these deaths. The FBI is looking into this. Former FBI Special Agent Manny Gomez with us right now. Manny, there have been quite a number of deaths now. And you do see a pattern. What do you see?"

      "utterance": "Well, I see something that's happening that is very suspicious. These deaths have occurred at different resorts. It just hasn't been one resort. It's been at several different resorts in a short amount of time. So the main suspect is methyl alcohol. But if that's the case -- and obviously the FBI is there using their expert toxicology equipment to try to identify if that is the case, if it was methyl alcohol, or if it was another sort of poisonous substance that could have been introduced..."

      "speaker": "GOMEZ",

They're going to be traveling to the Caribbean, to other places. And the concern is, are there many more batches out there that could potentially be lethal or harm people? And so that's why the FBI is there. The Dominican Republic doesn't apparently have the resources that we have here in the States, specifically the FBI, to be able to identify what's going on. That being said, the next phase of it is the investigation. So, now, if they identify that there's a toxic substance in these drinks, then they have to find out where it came from and stop it, so it doesn't continue."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "GOMEZ",
      "utterance": "It tells me that they don't have control. The government, the resorts themselves, they need to have better control. They need to fully investigate, identify where -- if in case this is methyl alcohol or some other poisonous substance, where it came from, who was responsible, and make those people accountable."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOMEZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. But perhaps it's coming from the same distributor? Who knows? That's where the investigation has to lead. And that's where the Dominican Republic has to let the FBI do the good work that they do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we will watch closely. Manny, thank you very much, Manny Gomez, the former FBI special agent. By the way, we are learning that the U.S. Federal Reserve has just cleared 18 of the largest banks in this country, passing the Fed's annual stress test. In other words, if everything hit the fan, they try to gauge whether these banks are ready for that, akin to what we had during the meltdown. And they say the 18 largest U.S. banks are. Hope springs eternal. More after this."
