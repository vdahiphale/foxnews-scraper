Murder show -- shootings and other crimes are spiking the ball across our country and are highlighted by scenes like this in New York City where a 21-year-old man, he was a marine, shot in broad daylight in Times Square. A manhunt under way for that suspect and police are flooding the area where it happened with more cops, but Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says concerns about rising crime are being exaggerated.",

It's an interesting the sensibility if she was consistent about her own beliefs and her own actions because you can argue that her reaction to the Amazon with company moving to New York was a bit out of the ordinary. I mean, she literally went crazy over Amazon and Amazon did not move to New York. When she talks about looters and arsonists, she is -- the response to defending them is also very, very strange. I think that when you're talking about crime, we have to go further than just saying, OK, somebody got shot here and somebody got shot here.

This is an ideology that is pervasive on the left. The defund the police movement is pervasive in cities across the country. When you look at the chart of the cities, Portland, Baltimore, Chicago, L.A., New York, they all have D.A.'s who are not interested in putting criminals behind bars, they're interested in having a conversation and wondering why these things are happening. And so if you're not going to put bad guys behind bars, police are arresting the same people over and over again which completely destroys their morale because every day they're like, look, I'm up against guys in Times Square who are shooting people randomly and you keep putting them back on the streets which not only endangers me, but endangers the community that I am trying to protect and they have no interest in doing that. And when she wants to talk about AOC context, the context is exactly that. You have beaten down police departments across the country to the point where they have no ability to do their jobs, they're arresting the same criminals over and over again and there are real victims behind these crimes, hundreds of them. If you remember during the Trump administration Operation Legend, that was a federal program where local jurisdictions work with federal government to solve crimes like four-year-olds getting killed in their beds at night. I'd like to hear more about that than ghost guns which aren't what these criminals are using anyway in these crimes and focusing on victims rather than propping up criminals in a lot of the circumstances.",

It is massive, intense, and around the clock. News this morning, one more body recovered today on top of the four bodies found Sunday, bringing the confirmed death total to 10, none of them identified with 151 people still unaccounted for. Everyone is well aware that the window of survivability is shrinking by the hour and the day. The last survivor pulled out alive that was on Thursday morning, a boy just shortly after the building collapsed. His mother did not survive the collapse. Over the weekend, the city of Surfside released a report by a structural engineer from 2018, just three years ago, who inspected the building and warned of, quote, \"major structural damage that must be addressed. Cracks in the concrete, support columns and a major design flaw in that the underground parking garage was not poured in a way to properly allow rain water to drain.\" That red flag absolutely will be explored further and the Champlain Tower South sister building which was built at roughly the same time and a few blocks away that will be thoroughly inspected tomorrow here in Surfside. Residents there have not been told to evacuate but if they do voluntarily, the city of Surfside will find them hotel rooms. As for President Biden coming to Surfside to see this tragedy himself, as of now, there are no plans to do that. The White House is concerned that the massive presidential motorcade would really get in the way of the search and rescue and the hunt for survivors that is still going on round the clock two shifts, midnight to noon, noon to midnight. And there are eight total urban search and rescue teams in the state of Florida. They have all been brought here to search site. Jesse.",

But there's no question. If you have -- if you are vaccinated, you are more likely to avoid the Delta variant and you should feel more comfortable not wearing a mask. The reason I feel comfortable not wearing a mask is because I'm vaccinated and my family members are vaccinated. And that's what we ought to be encouraging people to do. Now, the four percent, 57 percent -- you know, who knows? I don't --- you know, I don't think Democrats want the virus to come back.

Murder show -- shootings and other crimes are spiking the ball across our country and are highlighted by scenes like this in New York City where a 21-year-old man, he was a marine, shot in broad daylight in Times Square.

It's an interesting the sensibility if she was consistent about her own beliefs and her own actions because you can argue that her reaction to the Amazon with company moving to New York was a bit out of the ordinary. I mean, she literally went crazy over Amazon and Amazon did not move to New York. When she talks about looters and arsonists, she is -- the response to defending them is also very, very strange. I think that when you're talking about crime, we have to go further than just saying, OK, somebody got shot here and somebody got shot here.

I couldn't find one. And then now we actually have on the record about two dozen Democrat city councils vote to defund the police, the mayor slaps his John Hancock on it and crime rose so where is the Washington Post with Pinocchio's? Where are the Pinocchio's, Washington Post? Then AOC says something that drives me crazy. She says we have to look at the context. Now when someone says we have to look at the context, that's just a ruse for simpleminded people.

This is why it's happening, and we are going to make the streets safer. Imagine someone just gets assassinated, Dana, and I come out and I say hey, let's not get hysterical, political assassinations were in much bigger in the 60s, there's context here. I'd be laughed out of the room. So, in the Bronx where she represents, I have some context, homicides are up 50 percent. Rapes up 10 percent, shootings are up 80 percent and that video we showed of that guy laying off lead in broad daylight, kids scrambling across the cement that was in the Bronx.

This is an ideology that is pervasive on the left. The defund the police movement is pervasive in cities across the country. When you look at the chart of the cities, Portland, Baltimore, Chicago, L.A., New York, they all have D.A.'s who are not interested in putting criminals behind bars, they're interested in having a conversation and wondering why these things are happening. And so if you're not going to put bad guys behind bars, police are arresting the same people over and over again which completely destroys their morale because every day they're like, look, I'm up against guys in Times Square who are shooting people randomly and you keep putting them back on the streets which not only endangers me, but endangers the community that I am trying to protect and they have no interest in doing that. And when she wants to talk about AOC context, the context is exactly that. You have beaten down police departments across the country to the point where they have no ability to do their jobs, they're arresting the same criminals over and over again and there are real victims behind these crimes, hundreds of them. If you remember during the Trump administration Operation Legend, that was a federal program where local jurisdictions work with federal government to solve crimes like four-year-olds getting killed in their beds at night. I'd like to hear more about that than ghost guns which aren't what these criminals are using anyway in these crimes and focusing on victims rather than propping up criminals in a lot of the circumstances."

I have no issue with her saying that I want the country to live up more to all of the country promises to be there for their citizens and we are striving every day to be a more perfect union.

It is massive, intense, and around the clock. News this morning, one more body recovered today on top of the four bodies found Sunday, bringing the confirmed death total to 10, none of them identified with 151 people still unaccounted for. Everyone is well aware that the window of survivability is shrinking by the hour and the day. The last survivor pulled out alive that was on Thursday morning, a boy just shortly after the building collapsed. His mother did not survive the collapse. Over the weekend, the city of Surfside released a report by a structural engineer from 2018, just three years ago, who inspected the building and warned of, quote, \"major structural damage that must be addressed. Cracks in the concrete, support columns and a major design flaw in that the underground parking garage was not poured in a way to properly allow rain water to drain.\" That red flag absolutely will be explored further and the Champlain Tower South sister building which was built at roughly the same time and a few blocks away that will be thoroughly inspected tomorrow here in Surfside. Residents there have not been told to evacuate but if they do voluntarily, the city of Surfside will find them hotel rooms. As for President Biden coming to Surfside to see this tragedy himself, as of now, there are no plans to do that. The White House is concerned that the massive presidential motorcade would really get in the way of the search and rescue and the hunt for survivors that is still going on round the clock two shifts, midnight to noon, noon to midnight.

The other thing that's happening, I don't understand these real estate rules and laws as well as somebody like Cheryl Casone of Fox Business, but her report today about what happens to the people who own those condos, and now there are families that inherit that debt, that there's a mortgage payment due on July 1."

There's a very, very 911 feel to it, in the sense not obviously the cause of it. But the tragedy of it, it's a smaller version, but that the fact that the people are there, and that the community is doing whatever they can to help everybody. It's a horrible situation. And when the horrible situation -- when the dust settles, so to speak, and then the legal stuff starts happening, it's going to -- be it's going to be a smaller, intense 911 type thing.

And whomever is to blame, whomever is at fault, the political -- the political rhetoric on both sides has been out of bounds and open and overheated at times and not as focused. But there's no question. If you have -- if you are vaccinated, you are more likely to avoid the Delta variant and you should feel more comfortable not wearing a mask. The reason I feel comfortable not wearing a mask is because I'm vaccinated and my family members are vaccinated. And that's what we ought to be encouraging people to do. Now, the four percent, 57 percent -- you know, who knows? I don't --- you know, I don't think Democrats want the virus to come back. I don't think Republicans are hoping that the virus only affects certain people or doesn't come back or comes back. We all want it to go away.
