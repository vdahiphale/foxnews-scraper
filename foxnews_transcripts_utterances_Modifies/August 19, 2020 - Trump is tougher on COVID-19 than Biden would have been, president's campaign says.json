Well, tonight, two of the president's fiercest adversaries back in the political arena to try to write the next chapter and fix what they believe they got wrong in 2016. President Obama and Hillary Clinton, each expected to deliver blistering indictments of the 45th president, while promoting someone that they have both known for a very long time during his many decades in Washington, Joe Biden. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story” live from the nation's capital. So, according to early excerpts released by the DNC, Secretary Clinton will try to get out the vote, warning Democrats this can't be another would, could, should election. And President Obama will unleash his harshest criticism to-date, President Trump has no interest in treating the presidency is anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves.  All of this ahead of tonight's address from Senator Kamala Harris, as she accepts the nomination for Vice President of the United States. Now, moments ago, the president offered a prebuttal specifically aimed at President Obama during a news conference at the White House. Watch this.",

TIM MURTAUGH, TRUMP 2020 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think it's really incredible that they would say that because the president has taken COVID very seriously. And in fact, Joe Biden thought that the president took it too seriously because when the president restricted travel from China way back in January, Joe Biden said that was xenophobic and hysteria and called it racist, essentially. And so, we know that if Joe Biden had been president, he would not have made that decision and restricted travel from China. But President Trump did. And in fact, his Coronavirus Rask Force was already meeting in January. So, President Trump has absolutely taken the Coronavirus situation seriously from the very beginning.

It didn't have to be that way, he said, it could have been handled better essentially.   Here's President Obama, a little bit of what he will say tonight. So, this is a quote that we have that I'm going to read. 170,000 Americans dead, millions of jobs gone. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the country badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.

Let's also remember that if Joe Biden had been president when this happened, the United States would be in far worse position because Joe Biden would not have restricted travel from China, which and when the president made that decision to actually do that to restrict travel from China, it prevented countless thousands of American deaths. And so, we know that Joe Biden as president would have been an utter disaster. But it's not surprising to us at all that none of the Democrats wants to talk about Joe Biden. All they want to talk about is Donald Trump. They don't talk about Joe Biden because they really can't at their own convention because they know they'd have to talk about his plan to raise taxes by $4 trillion, his plan to open our borders and give amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants, to give taxpayer funded health care to those illegal immigrants and also provide them all with work permits so that they can compete with Americans for jobs that they need coming out of this Coronavirus crisis.

And secondly, just like in other states, it's a big problem when you're just sending live ballots, not applications, but live ballots to every registered voter, whether they asked for one or not. They just tried this in their municipal elections in May, and it was a disaster. In Paterson, New Jersey, in those elections, 20 percent of the ballots were tossed out because they were bad votes, fraudulent votes, and in fact, a judge has ordered a redo of that election. So, does that what people are asking for? You think that's a good idea? That doesn't sound like a foolproof system to me. There's no strong measure that would prevent people because they're going to be in-person polling places open on Election Day with the universal mail in voting as well.  There's no real safeguard to prevent people from voting twice. It's going to be chaos. There was no need for the governor to do this because New Jersey already had no excuse absentee by mail voting already.

This all started earlier this week when a Goodyear employee at a plant in Topeka, Kansas, shared a slide that he claims came from the company's corporate office in Ohio. The slide looked very similar to this, and it split the employees dress code into two categories, acceptable and unacceptable. In the acceptable, category, you have Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. On the unacceptable column, you have blue lives matter, all lives matter, all MAGA attire and any political affiliated slogans or material.  Well, earlier of the day, earlier today, the White House Press Secretary actually asked Goodyear to clarify their statement. But so far, the company is sticking with this, we asked that associates refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party, as well as similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues. Well, now Joe Biden is actually weighing in with a statement of his own to the Beacon Journal, writing, to President Trump, those workers and their jobs aren't a source of pride, just collateral damage and yet another one of his political attacks. And now, it'll be very interesting to see just how much the president's call to boycott Goodyear tires is going to impact their bottom-line, Martha.",

President Obama and Hillary Clinton, each expected to deliver blistering indictments of the 45th president, while promoting someone that they have both known for a very long time during his many decades in Washington, Joe Biden. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story” live from the nation's capital. So, according to early excerpts released by the DNC, Secretary Clinton will try to get out the vote, warning Democrats this can't be another would, could, should election. And President Obama will unleash his harshest criticism to-date, President Trump has no interest in treating the presidency is anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. All of this ahead of tonight's address from Senator Kamala Harris, as she accepts the nomination for Vice President of the United States.

TIM MURTAUGH, TRUMP 2020 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think it's really incredible that they would say that because the president has taken COVID very seriously. And in fact, Joe Biden thought that the president took it too seriously because when the president restricted travel from China way back in January, Joe Biden said that was xenophobic and hysteria and called it racist, essentially. And so, we know that if Joe Biden had been president, he would not have made that decision and restricted travel from China. But President Trump did. And in fact, his Coronavirus Rask Force was already meeting in January. So, President Trump has absolutely taken the Coronavirus situation seriously from the very beginning. And we know that Joe Biden opposed his early measures."

It didn't have to be that way, he said, it could have been handled better essentially. Here's President Obama, a little bit of what he will say tonight. So, this is a quote that we have that I'm going to read. 170,000 Americans dead, millions of jobs gone. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the country badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before. So, we expect a pretty scathing speech tonight from the former president, Tim."

And it came from China, a country that Joe Biden will not pinpoint as the source of this, continues to make excuses for China and in fact says that he would continue to fund the World Health Organization that helped China cover it up. Let's also remember that if Joe Biden had been president when this happened, the United States would be in far worse position because Joe Biden would not have restricted travel from China, which and when the president made that decision to actually do that to restrict travel from China, it prevented countless thousands of American deaths. And so, we know that Joe Biden as president would have been an utter disaster. But it's not surprising to us at all that none of the Democrats wants to talk about Joe Biden. All they want to talk about is Donald Trump. They don't talk about Joe Biden because they really can't at their own convention because they know they'd have to talk about his plan to raise taxes by $4 trillion, his plan to open our borders and give amnesty to 11 million illegal immigrants, to give taxpayer funded health care to those illegal immigrants and also provide them all with work permits so that they can compete with Americans for jobs that they need coming out of this Coronavirus crisis.

One of the issues that we're also seeing push back on, which is understandable since it's been one of the biggest vulnerabilities for the Biden campaign, is Joe Biden's cognitive ability, how sharp he is, how up to the task he is of the job of president.

It's obvious that Joe Biden has lost his fastball. He's not the same guy that he was only just a few years ago. And this is an uncomfortable conversation to have to have. But Americans want to know that their president is going to be able to be on the ball. It's a very complex job. You have to deal with global matters, of course, and also very weighty domestic matters. They want a president who is going to be sharp and on the case all the time. And I think Americans have seen that there is really some serious doubts about that with Joe Biden."

I want to ask you about the Trump campaign lawsuit against New Jersey, which is now saying that they are going to institute universal mail in ballots. Tell me about that lawsuit. What are the grounds?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURTAUGH",
      "utterance": "Well, first, the governor does not have the authority to just change election law in New Jersey by himself. He has to go through the state legislature for that. And secondly, just like in other states, it's a big problem when you're just sending live ballots, not applications, but live ballots to every registered voter, whether they asked for one or not. They just tried this in their municipal elections in May, and it was a disaster. In Paterson, New Jersey, in those elections, 20 percent of the ballots were tossed out because they were bad votes, fraudulent votes, and in fact, a judge has ordered a redo of that election. So, does that what people are asking for? You think that's a good idea? That doesn't sound like a foolproof system to me. There's no strong measure that would prevent people because they're going to be in-person polling places open on Election Day with the universal mail in voting as well. There's no real safeguard to prevent people from voting twice. It's going to be chaos. There was no need for the governor to do this because New Jersey already had no excuse absentee by mail voting already. There's no reason to send ballots to all registered voters because we know all the addresses are wrong all the time."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURTAUGH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think everyone understands that there are a lot of Americans who do have concerned about voting in-person. But states have provisions for people to be able to vote absentee by mail. It's much more secure to vote absentee by mail. A lot of states do it. Florida is a perfect example. That provides security in election. You know that someone has requested a ballot. When you mail ballots to all registered voters, you don't know really who's going to be receiving them."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Those are the tires that are actually on the presidential limousine or the beast, as they call it. But during the briefing, President Trump was asked if he would be open to an alternative, if perhaps he'd be interested in swapping out those Goodyear tires on the beast. And the president said yes."

There's something wrong with the top of Goodyear."

      "utterance": "All right. So, let's back up a bit. This all started earlier this week when a Goodyear employee at a plant in Topeka, Kansas, shared a slide that he claims came from the company's corporate office in Ohio. The slide looked very similar to this, and it split the employees dress code into two categories, acceptable and unacceptable. In the acceptable, category, you have Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. On the unacceptable column, you have blue lives matter, all lives matter, all MAGA attire and any political affiliated slogans or material. Well, earlier of the day, earlier today, the White House Press Secretary actually asked Goodyear to clarify their statement. But so far, the company is sticking with this, we asked that associates refrain from workplace expressions in support of political campaigning for any candidate or political party, as well as similar forms of advocacy that fall outside the scope of racial justice and equity issues. Well, now Joe Biden is actually weighing in with a statement of his own to the Beacon Journal, writing, to President Trump, those workers and their jobs aren't a source of pride, just collateral damage and yet another one of his political attacks. And now, it'll be very interesting to see just how much the president's call to boycott Goodyear tires is going to impact their bottom-line, Martha."

She said it multiple times. So, this is the type of dangerous rhetoric that is coming out of the mouths of Black Lives Matter, faces and guest speakers at their rallies and obviously here in Portland. And so, this was about an hour or an hour and a half before these violent acts took place in the streets of downtown Portland.

But - and we're like in the time of the pandemic and it's very dirty. It's very disgusting. And every other business in Portland is getting shut down, but not a Black Lives Matter one. But anyways, some of the people that were actually physically assaulting some of the people in the video that you see actually were sitting down and hanging out at that Black Lives Matter little rib spot on the corner.

And it seemed like a slow night. But if you watch the video on my YouTube channel, you can see the full thing. It's 30 minutes long. Just go to Lives Matter on YouTube. Drew Hernandez, what you see, what began the event was the so-called security guards were offended and accusing this young white male of recording them. So, they begin to aggressively escort him away from the justice center, away from in front of the courthouse, down the street in front of a 7- Eleven. And as they're escorting this young man away, they're saying they're going to assault him, they're going to hit him. They tell him to walk, not run, because if he runs, they're going to chase him down the street and beat him. They eventually do. And you see this on the video. They start beating this one man -- they were accusing him of filming them in front of the 7-Eleven. And in the process of beating this young man, this is where you see the transgender woman, I don't know what she identifies as, but she stepped in or he or they stepped in and started to defend this young man getting jumped just telling the so-called security guards to leave them alone and let them run away. Their anger, they got so offended by that that their anger shifted to her, or they come or whatever she identifies as. They robbed this person, they beat this person, they teed off on this person even though this person was defending themselves because they were surrounded by all of these thugs and criminals.

It doesn't mean that life is always going to be sweet and mellow and you are going to have no obstacles in your way. You will. Everybody does. And it really depends on how you relate to them. And we've got to start putting these principles out once again, particularly so that our young people here more than one side of the story. Not that America is evil, not that somebody else is causing all your problems. But what about the can-do spirit that caused America to go from nothing to the pinnacle of the world in record time?

And you, and the president wrote an editorial that was in the Wall Street Journal, and in it, you said, we reversed an Obama-Biden regulation that would've empower the Department of Housing and Urban Development to abolish single-family zoning, compel the construction of high-density stock and pack apartment buildings in residential neighborhoods, and forcibly transform neighborhoods across America so they look and feel the way far- left ideologues and technocratic bureaucrats think that they should.

Ensure that school building reopening plans are inclusive and equitable for all educators and students by humanizing learning environments and designing spaces that are situated in the experiences of communities of color, not just through white, cis- hetero, and able-bodied lens -- lenses.

But they will also be going to talk to everyday people. We saw yesterday, you know, Joe Biden engage in the conversation about health care. The day before, he engaged in the conversation with a Connecticut nurse who got coronavirus. And he is laying out, and they are beginning to lay the framework of what will be --"

And let's remember, right, that this is not the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan. Even when you think about fiscal restraint. Right? This party is not the party of Ronald Reagan. That's the other argument you're going to vote for Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, former President Barack Obama they will make tonight."

I will say this, Martha, I was looking to the lineup tonight Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama, and Kamala Harris, and I'm like I'm going to need a stiff drink, I think, to get through this evening. It is going to be a demagoguery derby. We'll be watching. But I think it's going to be really pointed."
