MATT GAETZ, R—FLORIDA: They tell me that there's a glaring hypocrisy that is unfolding. And we have got the Department of Justice participating in it.  When Hillary Clinton was under investigation for crimes for destroying classified information, for having classified information mishandled, her own lawyers and her own team got to self-curate the documents that they produced.  And many of Secretary Clinton's and key aides even got immunity deals. Here, when the shoe is on the other foot, you have got President Trump's personal lawyer having to ask for the very FBI that is investigating the president to not be the entity that is curating those records. And so we're just in search of an equal standard that can be applied and then defended not based on politics or who is in the crosshairs.",
