      "sentences": "Hard having a great night, Tucker. So sad for our country. Great coverage as always. Thank you. Welcome to HANNITY.  We begin tonight, a FOX News alert. Multiple police officers have been shot, several more have been run over with automobiles, many are fighting for their lives at this very hour.  Business owners have been beaten to a pulp. Stores in dozens of neighborhoods all around the country have been looted for days on end. Buildings have been ablaze around the country, and we have anarchy rolling the streets of America's liberal cities.  And, sadly, we are watching government at its worst. We have mayors, we have governors cowering in fear, incapable of restoring order and refusing to even ask the National Guard, which is their responsibility -- and the president of the United States has been begging them to do. Now the president, as he said to a spokesperson earlier today, he may have to invoke what is called the Insurrection Act of 1807 and then usurp the power of these weak governors and mayors because they are so completely incompetent. They won't ask for the National Guard.  Our police officers are under attack. Some are killed. Some are gravely injured. There's absolutely no reason, no excuse that this continues to take place. These riots must be stopped. Lives and property are at risk. Curfews need to be enforced. Until now, they're not being enforced.  We have curfews now in effect in many cities that we'll be showing you throughout the evening. Nobody is listening. Law-abiding Americans are now finding they must defend themselves and their property, basically fending for themselves. The vile criminals, the thugs who are lighting our cities on fire and looting our businesses and destroying lives, they need to all go to prison for a very long period of time, and we have one presidential candidate that said nothing about the cops today. We'll have more of my monologue coming up in just moments.   But, first, joining us live on the ground in New York City with the very latest, Bryan Llenas is with us. Bryan, I've been watching all night, great coverage as usual. Thank you for all you're doing out there.",

And part of the more aggressive posture in New York City is these new check -- these are new checkpoints on 96th Street and Broadway, all up and down Manhattan. What they're doing now is they are really blocking off and cordoning off Manhattan because of all of the looting that we saw last night up and down Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Herald Square, Upper Eastside, you name it. Hundreds of stores hit. You can see over here, you got the police that are checking to see who lives in the neighborhood and they're also letting delivery -- some major delivery trucks as well as buses in, but this is completely different from what we saw last night. Last night, we saw plenty of vehicles full of really lots of stolen -- stolen items. They were packing up their cars and moving from one block to the next.  If you listen to the police scanner, it was one theft after the other. I was live on the air with you when we saw groups of looters, hundreds, dozens of them from different places in the city. Tonight, it's different. Those that are out and past curfew are mostly the peaceful protesters that had started before. We had some protesters in Brooklyn chant \"F the curfew\" but there aren't nearly as many calls of looting that we saw last night. Let's hope that it stays that way.   But here, the conversation has all been about whether or not the National Guard will be called in New York. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo blames the NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio for all of the looting that we saw last night. He said that they did not do their job. He also said that he did not believe that right now, that the U.S. National Guard should be called, though there are 13,000 troops he said on standby. He also went after the mayor saying that Mayor Bill de Blasio underestimated the threat, and so, we shall see where that goes. But, ultimately, the city believes and the NYPD that if they bring in the National Guard, it will escalate tensions. They do not believe that having uniformed personnel in New York City will help.  But last night, again, there were approximately 500 arrests for looting, 400 of them arrested in Manhattan, in the heart of New York City and because of New York's bail reform laws, nearly all of them, the NYPD tells me, will be released -- Sean.",

      "sentences": "Hey there, Sean.  We are about a half-hour into curfew and a group of thousands just dispersed after marching peacefully for about 15 miles. At one point, they stopped in the street kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds to remember George Floyd. It was really peaceful the whole time. There's only one tense moment where a person was taken into custody when police tried to block an intersection. They eventually allow that group to pass.   However, police did all down the entrances to the freeway after yesterday, a group got onto the expressway, stopped traffic and they were tear gassed, a number of them were arrested. The groups again didn't want any trouble like that today. They were saying don't give them what they want and encourage them to move on. You can look behind me, the National Guard is holding down city properties which has allowed police to go out into the neighborhoods and really patrol the area. Last night was quieter than the past few nights, although there have been 700 arrests over the weekend, including two fatal incidents involving looters last night. One was fatally shot by a gun store owner defending his property, 25 officers were hurt and a number of neighborhoods you saw people coming out with guns with baseball bats and defending their own properties. But now, after curfew, the group has dispersed and it was quieter last night with the National Guard here allowing them to go out and kind of monitor what's going on.  So, by and large, today, during the daytime, it's been peaceful, people sharing the message and wanting to show that image in contrast with the looting that you saw taking place over the last few days with a message of George Floyd so people remember versus that, Sean.",

That's basically the atmosphere here just north of Lafayette Park.  I'm going to step out of the camera for just a moment. You can see there are still a sizable crowd here, Sean. Curfew, of course, was two hours ago here in the nation's capital. Most of the crowd that we saw between, say, 5:00 and 8:00 has actually moved on, but we still, as you can see, have probably close to a thousand people out here, maybe several hundred right along the fence line on the north end of Lafayette Park. And for those of you who are unaware, Lafayette Park is directly in front of the White House.  So you have this blocked off with a chain-link fence and you have lots of protesters here. Again, not any damage that I've been able to see of significance. I did see a sign pulled down but that's about it so far, Sean, but they're not respecting the curfew. We'll see what law enforcement officials have to say about that as we continue into the night -- Sean.",

Meaning they don't like how money is being allocated right now. They believe too much is being set aside for police and not enough is being put in place for crucial programs right now, especially during what many have endured during this pandemic and many have suffered economically. So there outside here being extremely peaceful, many have marched from downtown to have their voices heard, chanting George Floyd, and the mayor is actually addressing in his citywide address right now from city hall.

In St. Louis, four more police officers were shot. And viewer warning, the videos we're about to show you are extremely disturbing. In Buffalo, in New York, two police officers were injured when a rider barreled into them with an SUV.   In New York City, another officer was intentionally mowed down, he went flying through the air. Also in New York City, another police officer, this time in the Bronx, was brutally beaten into the ground by a group of thugs.  By the way, comrade -- Mayor de Blasio, what part of this are you not seeing that you need help? Governor Cuomo, why aren't you acting? You talk, but you don't act. You have to ask the president for the help or he'll have to go back to 1807 and invoke the Insurrection Act.  Your police are under attack in your state and your city and your residents are getting assaulted and your stores are being looted up and down Fifth Avenue, all the way up to the Upper East Side of New York. Looters were just taking pretty much anything they wanted. Even the iconic Macy's flagship store, you know, the one Miracle 34th Street, that was looted. You have Cuomo, you have de Blasio, with zero answers and they are refusing the president's help and the president is offering to send immediately the National Guard to support them. They're too busy fighting with each other over who gets to ask the president for the guard and whether or not they will even ask for the guard. That's what's going on in New York.  Now they're leaving the citizens hanging out to dry while they fight amongst themselves. Cuomo even openly consider forcibly removing the mayor from office instead of calling in support troops.

I have a prediction, not hard to make. These events will accelerate a mass migration and history will group blame both of these people for their pathetic lack of action and preparedness. By the way, Democratic presidential candidate, the one ever forgetful Joe Biden, he didn't say anything about last night's violence against police officers all across the country. Yesterday, he came up with the genius idea and said he wants cops to shoot violent criminals that are coming at them with a knife, just shoot them in the leg. No police academy trains that. He also wants some kind of police commission. I have a message for the forgetful Joe Biden tonight. Well, why didn't you, why didn't Barack do this after the Cambridge police incident? The Ferguson incident? The Baltimore incident? The Trayvon Martin incident, why didn't you do it?  Take a look.",

Looking ahead in the first 100 days of my presidency, I've committed to creating a national police oversight commission. I've long believed we need real community policing. We need each and every police department in the country to understand the comprehensive review of their -- undertake a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, their de-escalation.

      "sentences": "Now, by the way, this just in by the New York City PBA and their leader, this is coming from the account of the entire PBA: Police officers have been brutally attacked and injured in our streets the past three days but we are still left wondering whether our elected leaders will support us when the sun comes up. Joe Biden, he is a representation of decades of old liberal failed leadership in cities and states all across this country. Those are the states that tend to be in more trouble, almost the vast majority of states. Governors run by Democrats, mayors -- by Democratic mayors in city after city, few Republican, mostly Democrat. In Richmond, Virginia, for example, rioters there, they set fire to a small apartment building while a small child was inside that building. So-called protesters have proceeded to block fire trucks from arriving at the scene to save people, thank God that child was safe.   This madness must stop, liberal mayors, governors, listen up. You cannot reason with those people that are out there burning your cities, looting these stores, hurting and attacking police officers and innocent citizens. You can't pander to that criminal element. You can't appease them. And New York, with their stupid laws, when you arrest them, they get released, guaranteed by law, they get a get out of jail free card within hours. So they get right back in the protest. You got to enforce your curfews. You need to set perimeters, you need to use overwhelming nonlethal force. It's usually tear gas and pepper spray and arrest, as Mayor Giuliani, has been telling us, every single one of these thugs breaking the law, putting people's lives in jeopardy and destroying property. If you refuse to lay down the hammer, you are putting in -- the president in a position of then invoking the Insurrection Act from 1807 because you're not doing your job.  The president does -- he has that legal authority, it's called Insurrection Act. You can send the U.S. military to enforce local laws. He's offered the National Guard, but they have to ask for it. That's the law too. And according to a brand-new Morning Consult poll, an overwhelming majority of Americans, they support the use of military forces to supplement local police that are being shot at, sometimes killed, and many injured. This chaos is completely out of control, unacceptable to most of the American people. Their conscience has been shocked watching this night after night. One way or another, orders will be restored at some point. In the vacuum left by incompetent liberal mayors, governors, many Americans are rightfully no exerting control over their own security.  There's a guy in Santa Monica, California, he owns a liquor store. He had to protect his own business with an AR-15. By the way, it scared them away. There was an owner at a bakery in Cleveland, scared off the looters there with a similar show of force with him and his sons. In Philadelphia, gun shop owner shot and killed a looter who broke into his store. Americans have the right and a duty to defend their lives and their property, especially when the cities are doing nothing to protect them. These liberal mayors and governors refused or unable to restore order. This president has said he will act and he will bail them out and he will send in federal forces to do their job, just like he did on corona. If not, there will be an all-out war on the streets of all of our major cities, and make no mistake -- there will be carnage, the likes of which we've never seen before. We need to protect our country. Law and order needs to be restored. This is not that complicated. It's hard, it's ugly. We wish it didn't happen. We also wish what happened to George Floyd never happened. This is not honoring his memory.  Anyway, joining us now, former NYPD detective, Pat Brosnan, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, former secret service agent, NYPD officer in his own right. Pat, we begin with you tonight. All I see is a retreat and I see a mayor under governor fighting each other and meanwhile, officers are attacked, civilians are attacked, stores are burned to the ground, looting is everywhere and nobody's doing their job.",

In fact, the New York Police Department says has evidence that anarchist groups were pushing the protests towards violence and vandalism. Federal law enforcement officials say the violence points to far left groups like Antifa. Others say far right groups might also be involved. And many of the looters don't need to be supplied with bricks and rocks because they show up with their own tools in hand, well-prepared to destroy property. Police in Minneapolis also found caches of stolen vehicles and incendiary devices in areas where numerous fires had broken out, and in Baltimore, there's evidence of double danger. Police have been sweeping the downtown area after, get this, finding both bricks and bottles with potential accelerants already inside them.

Now the attorney general announced the violence by the far left group Antifa or some like to say Antifa, along with any affiliate groups but the president has now deemed officially a terrorist organization will be treated as domestic terrorism. And as destruction, the rioters continue to leave a trail of carnage and destruction in the streets all across America. So who exactly are these far left radicals who are believed to be in many of these instances inciting the violence? Well, to explain, Antifa, they are a far left militant group that uses anarchist tactics and control and violence to achieve their radical political ends. The while the group's origins go back to the middle of the 20th century, new report, foxnews.com explains that the first modern Antifa violence occurred in Portland. That was in 2007. And since then, Antifa members, they have targeted citizen journalist. They have attacked conservatives. They have called for the killing of police officers and they have unleashed violence all across the country. And just this week in Pittsburgh, a 20-year-old linked to the violent group was charged with inciting riots in the city. And also breaking tonight in Illinois, a man accused of passing out explosives at Minneapolis, George Floyd protest, well, he has now been arrested.

And I don't mean abusive, I just mean aggressively maintaining peace, just like Rudy Giuliani was talking about. And in those cities, you're seeing the violence get worse. You're seeing the criminality get worse. You're seeing people come in from outside who want to take part in that.

It's more peaceful because of it, and the president has been very clear that that's the approach he's going to take, and if he has to go all the way up to using his legal authorities, as Geraldo said, noted, and I know you guys don't always agree, but he noted the president has the legal authority to utilize that level of federal resources if it's needed.

Multiple police officers have been shot, several more have been run over with automobiles, many are fighting for their lives at this very hour. Business owners have been beaten to a pulp. Stores in dozens of neighborhoods all around the country have been looted for days on end. Buildings have been ablaze around the country, and we have anarchy rolling the streets of America's liberal cities. And, sadly, we are watching government at its worst. We have mayors, we have governors cowering in fear, incapable of restoring order and refusing to even ask the National Guard, which is their responsibility -- and the president of the United States has been begging them to do. Now the president, as he said to a spokesperson earlier today, he may have to invoke what is called the Insurrection Act of 1807 and then usurp the power of these weak governors and mayors because they are so completely incompetent. They won't ask for the National Guard. Our police officers are under attack. Some are killed. Some are gravely injured. There's absolutely no reason, no excuse that this continues to take place. These riots must be stopped. Lives and property are at risk. Curfews need to be enforced. Until now, they're not being enforced. We have curfews now in effect in many cities that we'll be showing you throughout the evening. Nobody is listening. Law-abiding Americans are now finding they must defend themselves and their property, basically fending for themselves. The vile criminals, the thugs who are lighting our cities on fire and looting our businesses and destroying lives, they need to all go to prison for a very long period of time, and we have one presidential candidate that said nothing about the cops today. We'll have more of my monologue coming up in just moments. But, first, joining us live on the ground in New York City with the very latest, Bryan Llenas is with us. Bryan, I've been watching all night, great coverage as usual. Thank you for all you're doing out there."

And part of the more aggressive posture in New York City is these new check -- these are new checkpoints on 96th Street and Broadway, all up and down Manhattan. What they're doing now is they are really blocking off and cordoning off Manhattan because of all of the looting that we saw last night up and down Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Herald Square, Upper Eastside, you name it. Hundreds of stores hit. You can see over here, you got the police that are checking to see who lives in the neighborhood and they're also letting delivery -- some major delivery trucks as well as buses in, but this is completely different from what we saw last night. Last night, we saw plenty of vehicles full of really lots of stolen -- stolen items. They were packing up their cars and moving from one block to the next. If you listen to the police scanner, it was one theft after the other. I was live on the air with you when we saw groups of looters, hundreds, dozens of them from different places in the city. Tonight, it's different. Those that are out and past curfew are mostly the peaceful protesters that had started before. We had some protesters in Brooklyn chant \"F the curfew\" but there aren't nearly as many calls of looting that we saw last night. Let's hope that it stays that way. But here, the conversation has all been about whether or not the National Guard will be called in New York. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo blames the NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio for all of the looting that we saw last night. He said that they did not do their job. He also said that he did not believe that right now, that the U.S. National Guard should be called, though there are 13,000 troops he said on standby. He also went after the mayor saying that Mayor Bill de Blasio underestimated the threat, and so, we shall see where that goes. But, ultimately, the city believes and the NYPD that if they bring in the National Guard, it will escalate tensions. They do not believe that having uniformed personnel in New York City will help. But last night, again, there were approximately 500 arrests for looting, 400 of them arrested in Manhattan, in the heart of New York City and because of New York's bail reform laws, nearly all of them, the NYPD tells me, will be released -- Sean."

      "utterance": "Hey there, Sean. We are about a half-hour into curfew and a group of thousands just dispersed after marching peacefully for about 15 miles. At one point, they stopped in the street kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds to remember George Floyd. It was really peaceful the whole time. There's only one tense moment where a person was taken into custody when police tried to block an intersection. They eventually allow that group to pass. However, police did all down the entrances to the freeway after yesterday, a group got onto the expressway, stopped traffic and they were tear gassed, a number of them were arrested. The groups again didn't want any trouble like that today. They were saying don't give them what they want and encourage them to move on. You can look behind me, the National Guard is holding down city properties which has allowed police to go out into the neighborhoods and really patrol the area. Last night was quieter than the past few nights, although there have been 700 arrests over the weekend, including two fatal incidents involving looters last night. One was fatally shot by a gun store owner defending his property, 25 officers were hurt and a number of neighborhoods you saw people coming out with guns with baseball bats and defending their own properties. But now, after curfew, the group has dispersed and it was quieter last night with the National Guard here allowing them to go out and kind of monitor what's going on. So, by and large, today, during the daytime, it's been peaceful, people sharing the message and wanting to show that image in contrast with the looting that you saw taking place over the last few days with a message of George Floyd so people remember versus that, Sean."

That's basically the atmosphere here just north of Lafayette Park. I'm going to step out of the camera for just a moment. You can see there are still a sizable crowd here, Sean. Curfew, of course, was two hours ago here in the nation's capital. Most of the crowd that we saw between, say, 5:00 and 8:00 has actually moved on, but we still, as you can see, have probably close to a thousand people out here, maybe several hundred right along the fence line on the north end of Lafayette Park. And for those of you who are unaware, Lafayette Park is directly in front of the White House. So you have this blocked off with a chain-link fence and you have lots of protesters here. Again, not any damage that I've been able to see of significance. I did see a sign pulled down but that's about it so far, Sean, but they're not respecting the curfew.

Meaning they don't like how money is being allocated right now. They believe too much is being set aside for police and not enough is being put in place for crucial programs right now, especially during what many have endured during this pandemic and many have suffered economically.

By the way, comrade -- Mayor de Blasio, what part of this are you not seeing that you need help? Governor Cuomo, why aren't you acting? You talk, but you don't act. You have to ask the president for the help or he'll have to go back to 1807 and invoke the Insurrection Act. Your police are under attack in your state and your city and your residents are getting assaulted and your stores are being looted up and down Fifth Avenue, all the way up to the Upper East Side of New York. Looters were just taking pretty much anything they wanted. Even the iconic Macy's flagship store, you know, the one Miracle 34th Street, that was looted. You have Cuomo, you have de Blasio, with zero answers and they are refusing the president's help and the president is offering to send immediately the National Guard to support them. They're too busy fighting with each other over who gets to ask the president for the guard and whether or not they will even ask for the guard. That's what's going on in New York.

By the way, Democratic presidential candidate, the one ever forgetful Joe Biden, he didn't say anything about last night's violence against police officers all across the country. Yesterday, he came up with the genius idea and said he wants cops to shoot violent criminals that are coming at them with a knife, just shoot them in the leg. No police academy trains that. He also wants some kind of police commission. I have a message for the forgetful Joe Biden tonight. Well, why didn't you, why didn't Barack do this after the Cambridge police incident?

We need each and every police department in the country to understand the comprehensive review of their -- undertake a comprehensive review of their hiring, their training, their de-escalation.

Those are the states that tend to be in more trouble, almost the vast majority of states. Governors run by Democrats, mayors -- by Democratic mayors in city after city, few Republican, mostly Democrat. In Richmond, Virginia, for example, rioters there, they set fire to a small apartment building while a small child was inside that building. So-called protesters have proceeded to block fire trucks from arriving at the scene to save people, thank God that child was safe. This madness must stop, liberal mayors, governors, listen up. You cannot reason with those people that are out there burning your cities, looting these stores, hurting and attacking police officers and innocent citizens. You can't pander to that criminal element. You can't appease them. And New York, with their stupid laws, when you arrest them, they get released, guaranteed by law, they get a get out of jail free card within hours. So they get right back in the protest. You got to enforce your curfews. You need to set perimeters, you need to use overwhelming nonlethal force. It's usually tear gas and pepper spray and arrest, as Mayor Giuliani, has been telling us, every single one of these thugs breaking the law, putting people's lives in jeopardy and destroying property. If you refuse to lay down the hammer, you are putting in -- the president in a position of then invoking the Insurrection Act from 1807 because you're not doing your job. The president does -- he has that legal authority, it's called Insurrection Act. You can send the U.S. military to enforce local laws. He's offered the National Guard, but they have to ask for it. That's the law too. And according to a brand-new Morning Consult poll, an overwhelming majority of Americans, they support the use of military forces to supplement local police that are being shot at, sometimes killed, and many injured. This chaos is completely out of control, unacceptable to most of the American people. Their conscience has been shocked watching this night after night. One way or another, orders will be restored at some point. In the vacuum left by incompetent liberal mayors, governors, many Americans are rightfully no exerting control over their own security. There's a guy in Santa Monica, California, he owns a liquor store. He had to protect his own business with an AR-15. By the way, it scared them away. There was an owner at a bakery in Cleveland, scared off the looters there with a similar show of force with him and his sons. In Philadelphia, gun shop owner shot and killed a looter who broke into his store. Americans have the right and a duty to defend their lives and their property, especially when the cities are doing nothing to protect them. These liberal mayors and governors refused or unable to restore order. This president has said he will act and he will bail them out and he will send in federal forces to do their job, just like he did on corona. If not, there will be an all-out war on the streets of all of our major cities, and make no mistake -- there will be carnage, the likes of which we've never seen before. We need to protect our country. Law and order needs to be restored. This is not that complicated. It's hard, it's ugly. We wish it didn't happen. We also wish what happened to George Floyd never happened. This is not honoring his memory. Anyway, joining us now, former NYPD detective, Pat Brosnan, FOX News contributor Dan Bongino, former secret service agent, NYPD officer in his own right. Pat, we begin with you tonight. All I see is a retreat and I see a mayor under governor fighting each other and meanwhile, officers are attacked, civilians are attacked, stores are burned to the ground, looting is everywhere and nobody's doing their job."

He's got some experience in the security space at the highest levels. He has since left the job and is basically for hire at times. Phone ringing off the hook today, Sean. I'm not kidding.

They get it. They see it. They see there's no support. They recognize what the police are doing. They recognize that they could go in and punch an active-duty uniformed police lieutenant in 88th precinct and knock his teeth out with brass knuckles. Was that not the epitome of empowerment?

In fact, the New York Police Department says has evidence that anarchist groups were pushing the protests towards violence and vandalism. Federal law enforcement officials say the violence points to far left groups like Antifa. Others say far right groups might also be involved. And many of the looters don't need to be supplied with bricks and rocks because they show up with their own tools in hand, well-prepared to destroy property. Police in Minneapolis also found caches of stolen vehicles and incendiary devices in areas where numerous fires had broken out, and in Baltimore, there's evidence of double danger. Police have been sweeping the downtown area after, get this, finding both bricks and bottles with potential accelerants already inside them. But instead of being left out an open piles, these potential weapons are kind of being hidden in small areas, though it's unclear if they are associated with the protests or groups on either side of the spectrum -- Sean."

President Eisenhower, a World War II hero, General Eisenhower, supreme allied commander, President Eisenhower nationalized the Arkansas National Guard, made them federal, federalized the National Guard. He had absolute authority to do that. Once they were federalized, once they were in the chain of command at the Defense Department, the president had absolute authority in the governor was powerless, the integration, the integration of Arkansas public schools and proceeded peacefully. There's no doubt that President Trump, should he take that step, has the authority to nationalize or to impose the National Guard -- to nationalize the state National Guard appointments and make them federal. There's no doubt the president can do that, and doesn't need the cooperation of the governor."

This is the problem -- 97 percent, 98 percent of his cops are good, they're putting their lives on the line, they protect us and we have to protect them. And what better way to protect these police officers is to bring in additional support. Mr. President, forget these weak mayors, bring in federal assistance."

      "utterance": "All right. Now, you're looking at life pictures. This is a live protest in Times Square, New York City. Everyone at this protest is now violating a curfew in that city that started at 8:00 p.m. eastern. That would be an hour and 49 minutes ago. Great job, Mayor de Blasio, great job Governor Cuomo. Now the attorney general announced the violence by the far left group Antifa or some like to say Antifa, along with any affiliate groups but the president has now deemed officially a terrorist organization will be treated as domestic terrorism. And as destruction, the rioters continue to leave a trail of carnage and destruction in the streets all across America. So who exactly are these far left radicals who are believed to be in many of these instances inciting the violence? Well, to explain, Antifa, they are a far left militant group that uses anarchist tactics and control and violence to achieve their radical political ends. The while the group's origins go back to the middle of the 20th century, new report, foxnews.com explains that the first modern Antifa violence occurred in Portland. That was in 2007. And since then, Antifa members, they have targeted citizen journalist. They have attacked conservatives. They have called for the killing of police officers and they have unleashed violence all across the country. And just this week in Pittsburgh, a 20-year-old linked to the violent group was charged with inciting riots in the city. And also breaking tonight in Illinois, a man accused of passing out explosives at Minneapolis, George Floyd protest, well, he has now been arrested. Here to explain more on all of this is DHS official, Ken Cuccinelli, is with us. Ken, thank you for being with us. You're watching all of this live."

      "utterance": "You see a mysterious reluctance and resistance to do what police departments have historically done, what Mayor Giuliani explained in great detail now for days, and that is creating a perimeter, and using nonlethal weapons like tear gas and pepper spray, and they're not doing it."

    {
      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "Yeah, there is -- there is a complete gap between those parts of America where they're using forward-leaning pro-public safety law enforcement tactics on the numbers of officers needed to do it and they're achieving peace in their streets, and George Floyd protesters can protest peacefully there. And then there's the other side of the gap where they are too timid to bring out the guard when things get violent, or to offend the protesters by being aggressive in their police tactics. And I don't mean abusive, I just mean aggressively maintaining peace, just like Rudy Giuliani was talking about. And in those cities, you're seeing the violence get worse. You're seeing the criminality get worse. You're seeing people come in from outside who want to take part in that. Their opportunistically violent and that's what has to stop the president has been very strong, as you know, Sean, in advancing forward our assets at the Department of Homeland Security. We're the largest collection of law enforcement officers in America in the department and we have been supporting state and local officials around the country since this began and particularly here in Washington where our own Secret Service and the federal protective services and we have all our colleagues there, we are out on the streets of the city I'm sitting in come here in Washington, hoping to keep the peace. And guess what? It's more peaceful because of it, and the president has been very clear that that's the approach he's going to take, and if he has to go all the way up to using his legal authorities, as Geraldo said, noted, and I know you guys don't always agree, but he noted the president has the legal authority to utilize that level of federal resources if it's needed. Of course, we want to avoid that by achieving peace before that's necessary. And that's what we're working to do."

      "utterance": "Yeah. So, the Insurrection Act is a -- is a law that the president can declare an insurrection. It doesn't mean it has to be in the whole country, and then he can deploy military resources to help achieve peace wherever the insurrective behavior is happening, you know, cities that are out of control, for instance, what you and I have been talking about. And that's available and he's got military members deployed, forward deployed if that's needed. They're on federal property and so forth. But the president is ready to do that if needed. So far, we've been succeeding -- we've been doing better night by night with civilian police and with the National Guard, and like I said, where those have been aggressively employed, peace has been much more broadly achieved. You had a second question after that, Sean."

We're going to give the rioters some room to vent. Well, that isn't what you do. The minute that they get violent, you push them away from the targets of their violence, which sometimes can be other people in the crowd. That achieves peace and you have to keep doing it with more resources and more resources until it's entirely quelled and peace is restored. That's what this president is about."
