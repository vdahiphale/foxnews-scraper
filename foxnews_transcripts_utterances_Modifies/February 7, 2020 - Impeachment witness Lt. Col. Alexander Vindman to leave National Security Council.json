It's not to say they have it. They were tested for it and exhibiting symptoms of it. All the other passengers, close to 5,000, on this ship -- it's a biggie -- have been released. But would you want to get on that ship when it has a repositioned journey starting tomorrow? Today, we ask, and you decide.  Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto  And it's not just ships. 300 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, arriving back in the U.S. today on charter flights landing in California and Texas. Those passengers will now be quarantined for 14 days.  And on Wall Street, what should have been and otherwise good day for stocks on a very strong jobs report, well, a sell-off on worries that this outbreak is going to break the global economy, investors not wanting to take any chances going into a weekend. The latest now on that Royal Caribbean ship. It is called the Anthem of the Seas. Only issue now is whether folks slated to hop on board tomorrow want to take it to the seas.  To Bryan Llenas in Bayonne, New Jersey, with more. Hey, Brian.",

Yes, that is a great question, but the Royal Caribbean Anthem of the Seas, all of the thousands of passengers have disembarked off of this ship for today, all except for four passengers who did disembark, but were sent to a nearby hospital. All those other passengers went home just fine. But those four passengers sent to a local hospital are being evaluated for possible coronavirus. From what we understand, the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, says that 27 passengers on board this ship were met by CDC personnel here in Bayonne, New Jersey; 23 of those passengers were cleared immediately. But those four passengers were not.   Royal Caribbean says one of those four passengers tested positive for the flu. And in a statement Royal Caribbean, said this -- quote -- \"None of the four guests showed any clinical signs of -- or symptoms of coronavirus while they were on board our ship. All other guests have been permitted to disembark as usual.\" We spoke to passengers as they disembarked, and many of them said that they weren't worried. Royal Caribbean didn't say anything on the ship as to what was going on. But we did speak to one Chinese national, who says he was isolated. He was one of those 27 passengers isolated in a restaurant on board. And he says he's a Chinese national, but he hasn't been to China in three years. And now he's a little concerned.",

Some 11 Americans so far have been diagnosed with coronavirus on board that ship; 61 passengers on total have been diagnosed so far. They are quarantine on board that ship off the coast of Japan until February 19.  Another cruise ship is being quarantined off of Hong Kong as a precaution right now as well, all of this as two U.S. State Department evacuation planes carrying over 300 Americans from the virus epicenter of China, well, they land -- they are landed here in San Diego, as well as in San Antonio, and a third plane is also set to have arrived today in Nebraska.  And all of this, Neil, as Royal Caribbean just moments ago released brand- new travel restrictions. Anyone with a passport from China, Hong Kong or Macau will no longer be able to board any of their ships, at least through the month of February.

That was very fine. More to that in just a second.   It's this concern about the coronavirus and how it could slow economic activity. One big firm predicted that it is going to bring China's growth down to a near recession, growing at about a 1 percent clip, which is as low as you can get in China, if you buy the fact that they have been growing at a 6 percent clip. Market watcher Heather Zumarraga here with us right now.

So if the first cases were recently reported -- we're up to outbreak of over 20,000 now in China -- that could reach hundreds of thousands of people, if not already in China, because you're walking around showing a lot of symptoms, and you don't know you have it.",

The jobs number, 225,000 on the headline number, I think that's not the most important story. The most important story is that people feel confident to go back into the labor force and get a job; 180,000 new jobs were added. That's 183,000 new paychecks, and the unemployment rate holds steady near 50-year lows. They're historic lows, Neil. So that's the positive spin on the markets and the economy here in the U.S.",

Former Vice President Joe Biden will be front and center on the debate stage tonight, because polling averages put out between mid-December and yesterday still had him at the front of the pack. But since the Iowa caucuses, the spotlight has been on Senator Bernie Sanders and on former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who are locked in a virtual tie. And leading up to tonight's debate. Biden took some time off the trail to meet with advisers and fine-tune what's sure to be a critical performance ahead of Tuesday's primary. If Biden does poorly in New Hampshire, and after his fourth-place finish in Iowa, it could shake the support he's really relying on in the next early primary state in South Carolina. Meantime, Sanders and Buttigieg have been exchanging barbs, Sanders reading several newspaper headlines depicting Buttigieg campaign as being funded by billionaires. Sanders has long touted his own grassroots support. His campaign has more individual donors than any of his rivals. Buttigieg in a fund-raising e-mail to supporters leaned into that conversation, touting the 22,000 new individual donors, the e-mail also accusing Sanders' campaign of being -- supported by nine outside dark money groups. So, tonight critical for all of them, and also Elizabeth Warren, who's going to be clinging to a chance to stay in the top of the pack -- Neil.",

It's not to say they have it. They were tested for it and exhibiting symptoms of it. All the other passengers, close to 5,000, on this ship -- it's a biggie -- have been released. But would you want to get on that ship when it has a repositioned journey starting tomorrow? Today, we ask, and you decide. Welcome, everybody. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto And it's not just ships. 300 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, arriving back in the U.S. today on charter flights landing in California and Texas. Those passengers will now be quarantined for 14 days. And on Wall Street, what should have been and otherwise good day for stocks on a very strong jobs report, well, a sell-off on worries that this outbreak is going to break the global economy, investors not wanting to take any chances going into a weekend. The latest now on that Royal Caribbean ship. It is called the Anthem of the Seas. Only issue now is whether folks slated to hop on board tomorrow want to take it to the seas. To Bryan Llenas in Bayonne, New Jersey, with more. Hey, Brian."

Yes, that is a great question, but the Royal Caribbean Anthem of the Seas, all of the thousands of passengers have disembarked off of this ship for today, all except for four passengers who did disembark, but were sent to a nearby hospital. All those other passengers went home just fine. But those four passengers sent to a local hospital are being evaluated for possible coronavirus. From what we understand, the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, says that 27 passengers on board this ship were met by CDC personnel here in Bayonne, New Jersey; 23 of those passengers were cleared immediately. But those four passengers were not. Royal Caribbean says one of those four passengers tested positive for the flu. And in a statement Royal Caribbean, said this -- quote -- \"None of the four guests showed any clinical signs of -- or symptoms of coronavirus while they were on board our ship. All other guests have been permitted to disembark as usual.\" We spoke to passengers as they disembarked, and many of them said that they weren't worried. Royal Caribbean didn't say anything on the ship as to what was going on. But we did speak to one Chinese national, who says he was isolated. He was one of those 27 passengers isolated in a restaurant on board. And he says he's a Chinese national, but he hasn't been to China in three years. And now he's a little concerned."

But it's actually putting me at risk, because I hadn't been to China for the last month, and then some of the passengers have been to China, and they may infect me as well, but I just feel -- putting me at risk. Some 11 Americans so far have been diagnosed with coronavirus on board that ship; 61 passengers on total have been diagnosed so far. They are quarantine on board that ship off the coast of Japan until February 19. Another cruise ship is being quarantined off of Hong Kong as a precaution right now as well, all of this as two U.S. State Department evacuation planes carrying over 300 Americans from the virus epicenter of China, well, they land -- they are landed here in San Diego, as well as in San Antonio, and a third plane is also set to have arrived today in Nebraska. And all of this, Neil, as Royal Caribbean just moments ago released brand- new travel restrictions. Anyone with a passport from China, Hong Kong or Macau will no longer be able to board any of their ships, at least through the month of February. And as for this ship, all -- it's a go for right now for their cruise that's set to be an eight-day cruise to the Bahamas tomorrow -- Neil."

I think they handled that perfectly. They found people that were maybe suspicious of having an infection, screened them, found the ones that actually might have a higher likelihood of being positive, and let everybody else go home. You can quarantine people. You can do self-isolation. You can test people, and you really don't need to panic them. This can be done. We're doing this with people coming off of airplanes. We don't need to do anything different for cruise ships."

And they're monitored or they're checking in with public health officials. And we have been doing this for some time. And we do this with other infectious diseases as well. We don't need to quarantine people forcibly, if we can do this with self- isolation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "Yes, I would advise them to go ahead. We know that viruses can remain viable outside the body. But cruise ships are something -- a place where we often see viral outbreaks, usually norovirus, with those gastrointestinal outbreaks, and they have protocols in order to clean those ships, in order to make them less likely to transmit any kind of infection. So I don't think that there is a major risk. We do this in hospital rooms too. We clean hospital rooms after one person who has fluids in it, another person goes in. There are procedures you can follow that limit the risk."

All right, let's get the read on people who are not calm at the corner of Wall and Broad, not so much concerned about the economy here. That's fine. And we had a strong jobs report. That was very fine. More to that in just a second. It's this concern about the coronavirus and how it could slow economic activity. One big firm predicted that it is going to bring China's growth down to a near recession, growing at about a 1 percent clip, which is as low as you can get in China, if you buy the fact that they have been growing at a 6 percent clip. Market watcher Heather Zumarraga here with us right now. Well, that's the concern, right, Heather, that this is going to spill over, dampen economic demand across the region, certainly the Asian region, and that's going to spill over across the globe. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, we live in a very interconnected, global world now. If you think about U.S. companies like Apple, for example, Adidas, Nike, Starbucks all closing stores in China, some other U.S. companies may have to adjust their supply chain, depending on how bad it gets. And China is the second largest economy in the world right now. So it does matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So we're just learning, by the way, Heather, that Apple is working very hard to reopen a lot of its China offices, as are other U.S. entities. Obviously, they seem to be waiting who's the bravest first to stick their toes in the water. The longer they wait to do that, the longer the impact, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "Sure, absolutely. I think that the bigger impact on U.S. consumers, the longest -- the longer this virus goes on. But, remember, we don't really know how widespread this could be yet. You just had a doctor on previously that noted it takes about 15 days to show symptoms. So if the first cases were recently reported -- we're up to outbreak of over 20,000 now in China -- that could reach hundreds of thousands of people, if not already in China, because you're walking around showing a lot of symptoms, and you don't know you have it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, we had otherwise good news in this country, a startlingly strong jobs report, 225,000 more added to the economy in January. It's a good way to kick off the new decade, the unemployment rate still historically low at 3.6 percent. This was across-the-board strength that I think probably, Heather, on any other day would have been greeted by a huge run-up in stocks. So are we overreacting and playing off too many fears with the coronavirus, or is it justified?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "No, I think it's very justified. But, at the same time, the U.S. economy is on solid footing, Neil, but because we're so interconnected to China and say Europe growth is slowing down as well, then that's why there's an impact in the U.S. But before today, the markets have done -- held up very well, despite the coronavirus this week. The jobs number, 225,000 on the headline number, I think that's not the most important story. The most important story is that people feel confident to go back into the labor force and get a job; 180,000 new jobs were added. That's 183,000 new paychecks, and the unemployment rate holds steady near 50-year lows. They're historic lows, Neil. So that's the positive spin on the markets and the economy here in the U.S."

So, this is kind of a good year to maybe start repairing relationships a little, because you're probably not going to get anything done anyway. Obviously, the rhetoric is pretty harsh.

So I think there's a there's a possibility there that the message could get through that partisan warfare is not really the number one agenda item for most voters. And I think, for all of us, if you're a voter out there, of whichever party, and you're meeting candidates this year, I think it might be nice to say, I'd like you to work on X, Y and Z, and not work on shouting at the other party."

Dozens of Democratic senators and House members had joined that lawsuit, charging that the president was making money from foreign governments at a number of places, including the Trump International Hotel here in Washington. Now, the D.C. Circuit didn't decide the case on the merits.

It looks like he has. I mean, they're separated by a tick, I get -- I grant that. But he suddenly has emerged as a real force."

      "utterance": "He certainly has. He's gotten a bounce out of Iowa. And now just in the two or three sets of polls that we have seen, daily tracking, in New Hampshire, he's gone up in clumps, to the point where he's in a dead heat in New Hampshire with Bernie. And so the thing about New Hampshire, it's an independent state, and it's a moderate state in terms of even the Democratic primary. And with moderates and independents not being able so much to vote in a Republican primary, they could give Pete Buttigieg enough of a boost to not only tie Bernie Sanders, possibly even beat him. Buttigieg's biggest concern right now are the three moderates that are left in the race. How many votes will they take away from what could have been his own column if he'd faced Sanders just one-on-one?"

      "utterance": "How does this polling on your supporters and whether they're billionaires or millionaires help or hurt a candidate? I mean, you could clearly make the argument Buttigieg is the only not millionaire among the prominent candidates. So it's not as if he's a silver spoon in his mouth here. What do you make of that?"

      "utterance": "And, frankly, none of this is new. It certainly worked for him really beyond all expectations in 2016. But add to that the fact, this is essentially the modern-day version of the heart -- the battle for the heart and soul of the Democratic Party since 1968, the progressive wing vs. the moderate wing. And at least in -- where we stand today, Bernie is the king of the progressive wing."

      "speaker": "JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Former Vice President Joe Biden will be front and center on the debate stage tonight, because polling averages put out between mid-December and yesterday still had him at the front of the pack. But since the Iowa caucuses, the spotlight has been on Senator Bernie Sanders and on former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who are locked in a virtual tie. And leading up to tonight's debate. Biden took some time off the trail to meet with advisers and fine-tune what's sure to be a critical performance ahead of Tuesday's primary. If Biden does poorly in New Hampshire, and after his fourth-place finish in Iowa, it could shake the support he's really relying on in the next early primary state in South Carolina. Meantime, Sanders and Buttigieg have been exchanging barbs, Sanders reading several newspaper headlines depicting Buttigieg campaign as being funded by billionaires. Sanders has long touted his own grassroots support. His campaign has more individual donors than any of his rivals. Buttigieg in a fund-raising e-mail to supporters leaned into that conversation, touting the 22,000 new individual donors, the e-mail also accusing Sanders' campaign of being -- supported by nine outside dark money groups. So, tonight critical for all of them, and also Elizabeth Warren, who's going to be clinging to a chance to stay in the top of the pack -- Neil."
