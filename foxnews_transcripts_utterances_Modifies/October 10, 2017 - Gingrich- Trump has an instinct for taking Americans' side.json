      "sentences": "All right. Tucker as always, thank you. Great show. This is a Fox News Alert. The left's massive inexcusable hypocrisy continues to be exposed as new deeply disturbing accusations emerged against the now disgraced Hollywood executive, major Democratic political donor, Harvey Weinstein. In an explosive report from The New Yorker, three women are now accusing Weinstein of rape. And Hollywood A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, they are now saying that Weinstein sexually harassed them also.  Now as the shocking details as they continue to come out. Hollywood liberals, Democrats are only slowly starting to condemn Weinstein, it's five days later. Hillary Clinton who accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Weinstein is finally now denouncing him after a deafening silence. And late tonight, the Obamas, they are finally condemning the Hollywood mogul.  Tonight, we have Newt Gingrich, Monica Crowley -- who knew Harvey Weinstein -- Geraldo Rivera, Larry Elder will all join us. But first, we will do what the mainstream media never will do. We are going to expose tonight how this is much bigger and far more pervasive than the media will ever tell you. And that is tonight's breaking news, opening monologue.  All right. So, the massive Harvey Weinstein scandal is getting more disturbing hour by hour. Now according to an absolutely stunning report from The New Yorker, three women are now accusing Weinstein of rape and four others are saying the media mogul sexually harassed them. Now, the New Yorker also obtained what it says is New York Police Department -- an audio recording of a 2015 sting operation involving Weinstein and a model. On this recording, Weinstein, you can hear him admitting to groping her. And we've got to warn you, if you have kids in the room, this is graphic. Listen to this.",

      "sentences": "That poor woman, so disturbing. And according to The New York Post, the Manhattan District Attorney's office, they are somehow defending their decision to not prosecute Weinstein back in 2015? That is repulsive.  But unfortunately, it's only one of the many troubling revelations coming out about Harvey Weinstein. Hollywood A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, they told The New York Times earlier today that Weinstein sexually harassed them. Also other actresses are telling The New York Times that Weinstein was making unwanted advances. Heather Graham is also speaking out. She told Variety that Weinstein implied that if she had sex with him, he would get a movie deal and a movie role.  And also tonight, Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, she told People magazine she is now finally leaving her husband. And according to the Daily Mail, Weinstein is taking a page out of the Clinton playbook. He's now hiring a top Hollywood lawyer in an attempt -- if you read it -- to discredit his victims. At this rate, the way it's going, it looks like this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to allegations against Harvey Weinstein.  Now what is even more disturbing is the fact that people, many of them in Hollywood knew what Weinstein was doing and they knew it for decades and they did nothing about it. And some in Hollywood are even being accused of helping to cover this up. Now according to a former New York Times reporter, there was a 2004 story that she was working on about Weinstein allegedly paying a woman to keep her silent after he sexually harassed her. Well, that was eventually killed with the help she says from actors Matt Damon and Russell Crowe. Now, Damon is denying that he played any role and says the conversation that he had with the reporter was not about Weinstein.  There's also a fashion designer -- want to be outraged? Donna Karan, she has to apologize today after saying on Sunday that Weinstein's accusers were, quote, \"asking for it.\" And there's also the fact that as we highlighted last night, Weinstein is a huge, massive, major Democratic donor.  Now, the Center for Responsive Politics, their estimate is that Weinstein contributed over $2 million to Democrats and that just since the year 2000. Now, it includes individual donations to key, very key top Democratic names and players, including an estimated $44,000 to Hillary Clinton. And that's in addition to the $15,000 that Weinstein gave to her Super Pac or a Super Pac tied to Hillary. And Weinstein also donated over $56,000 to the Obama Victory Fund. Maybe that's why it took Clinton and the Obamas five days to begin to speak out. And that's not all. The Hollywood executive dished out over $97,000 to the Democratic National Committee. He wrote checks for over $76,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Some Democrats, to their credit, are giving the money back. Others are donating to various liberal groups. Really? However, not every single Democrat is even doing that, even though they should be.  Remember back during the campaign? I made such a big deal about all of the money that Hillary Clinton, her foundation, was taking in from countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait. The UAE. These are countries that treat women horribly. Remember, in some of these countries gays and lesbians are put to death. Christians and Jews are also persecuted under Sharia Law in these countries. Now before we tell you what Hillary Clinton said about Weinstein today, along five days after the scandal broke, we want to remind you what the women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct said. I don't remember many Hollywood stars speaking out against Bill Clinton or talking about his issues that he had to deal with or how Hillary defended him. You may remember this.

The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.\" Really, Hillary, really? Three generic sentences and your utter silence over the years? Now, here's the truth about the Clintons and Weinstein. Take a look at these pictures. They've known Weinstein for years and they have been more than happy to take all of his money and run campaigns. FoxNews.com is also reporting that Weinstein donated between $100 to 250,000 to that Clinton Foundation. Maybe that's why Hillary waited to condemn Weinstein. Countries that supports Sharia, maybe they bought her silence, remember? She never criticized those countries that treat women, gays and lesbians, Christians and Jews horribly. Did Weinstein by her silence also?  And also today, finally at this late hour, the Obamas, they finally put out a statement about Weinstein that reads this. Quote, \"Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports of Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans, degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories and we all need to build a culture including by empowering our girls in teaching our boys decency and respect so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\" Oh, OK, Obama loves to opine about cultural controversies. What took him so long to denounce Weinstein? Did it have to do with the fact that he's taken all that money from Weinstein and invited Weinstein to the White House? Maybe Barack Obama was too embarrassed because back in 2013, the former first lady Michelle Obama praised Harvey Weinstein during a White House event. Watch this.",

These rumors have been out there for years. And it's not surprising when it comes to the left. As I have explained over and over on this show, liberals love to be so sanctimonious, holier-than-thou. But they are really hypocrites. They claim moral authority over Republicans and conservatives over issues like women's rights, gay rights, freedom of speech, religious freedom. We conservatives on this program have spoken out about the treatment of women, gays and lesbians, Christians and Jews under Sharia. Hollywood is a perfect example of this hypocrisy. For decades, we've been hearing about this type of behavior, that Weinstein is being accused of. Now, he's definitely not alone. It's bigger than anyone is going to tell you. We will be investigating. People have been talking for years. Ever hear the phrase, the casting couch in Hollywood? We've all heard that phrase. And guess what? Hollywood has turned a blind eye to what is systemic abuse. They just accepted it all while attacking conservatives as being anti-women, feeding moral outrage, selective moral outrage, any time a conservative is actually caught up in a scandal or an alleged scandal. Hollywood does not care about the issue that they talked about because if they did, someone would have spoken out sooner about Weinstein. People have known for years and they did not do it. Hollywood, what do they do in the movies? They romanticize violence and sex. That is their bread and butter. And of course, cartoon characters , we all know their values system, we all know they slant left. This is why it's bigger than anyone will tell you and I want to prove it to you. I have a video, it's from 2003. Remember? A guy accused of rape and even admitted to part of it? Roman Polanski? OK. That year he won an Oscar for best director. And then the Hollywood leftist audience, how did they respond? Remember, he was in his 40s when the accusation took place. The girl we're talking about was 13. The same Polanski accused of raping a 13-year-old girl after giving her champagne and Quaaludes. He is 43 at the time of the alleged attack. Polanski charged with six felonies counts, fled to Europe before he got the full sentence he deserved. Which is why he was absent from this award ceremony. Now that you know this, take close attention. How did the Hollywood Oscars crowd, which included Harvey Weinstein and Meryl Streep and others, how did they cheer for this accused child rapist? Watch this. It speaks volumes.",

We also have to point out that some in Hollywood, they still support Polanski. Back in 2009, after Roman Polanski --he was arrested in Switzerland. People wanted him extradited to California on this 1977 case. But over 100 leftist Hollywood celebrities -- and we're showing you some of the notable ones right there -- they all signed a petition demanding the guy that did this to a 13-year-old girl be released. Now, there are also reports that Harrison Ford and Harvey Weinstein himself signed that petition. This hypocrisy is stunning, it's shameful, it's beyond disgusting. Here's my prediction tonight: This Harvey Weinstein scandal is only the tip of the iceberg. For example tonight, after Terry Crews, he announced he was sexually assaulted by a, quote, \"high-ranking Hollywood executive.\" We will have a lot more on the days and weeks ahead and more coming up later on the program.

When Harvey Weinstein paid off these people, I have no doubt but that he and his privately held company of which he and his brother own 42 percent.

What has to happen now, the frustration that the New York County D.A. voiced about the inability to prosecute him for the groping of the actress, because she may have been unreliable or whatever it was, the lawyers came down to -- whatever it was.  Now the tax man can I think unpeel a lot of this nonsense and hold people accountable for clear violations of the IRS tax code. A felony, by the way. This is not a minor claim. And I think that's the way to go. Now, as these -- the other thing is, many of the complainants, many of the women coming forward, in the Bill Cosby case, many of the allegations were 20-30- even 40 years old.

The left's massive inexcusable hypocrisy continues to be exposed as new deeply disturbing accusations emerged against the now disgraced Hollywood executive, major Democratic political donor, Harvey Weinstein. In an explosive report from The New Yorker, three women are now accusing Weinstein of rape. And Hollywood A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, they are now saying that Weinstein sexually harassed them also. Now as the shocking details as they continue to come out. Hollywood liberals, Democrats are only slowly starting to condemn Weinstein, it's five days later. Hillary Clinton who accepted tens of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Weinstein is finally now denouncing him after a deafening silence. And late tonight, the Obamas, they are finally condemning the Hollywood mogul. Tonight, we have Newt Gingrich, Monica Crowley -- who knew Harvey Weinstein -- Geraldo Rivera, Larry Elder will all join us. But first, we will do what the mainstream media never will do. We are going to expose tonight how this is much bigger and far more pervasive than the media will ever tell you. And that is tonight's breaking news, opening monologue. All right. So, the massive Harvey Weinstein scandal is getting more disturbing hour by hour. Now according to an absolutely stunning report from The New Yorker, three women are now accusing Weinstein of rape and four others are saying the media mogul sexually harassed them. Now, the New Yorker also obtained what it says is New York Police Department -- an audio recording of a 2015 sting operation involving Weinstein and a model. On this recording, Weinstein, you can hear him admitting to groping her. And we've got to warn you, if you have kids in the room, this is graphic. Listen to this."

      "utterance": "That poor woman, so disturbing. And according to The New York Post, the Manhattan District Attorney's office, they are somehow defending their decision to not prosecute Weinstein back in 2015? That is repulsive. But unfortunately, it's only one of the many troubling revelations coming out about Harvey Weinstein. Hollywood A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, they told The New York Times earlier today that Weinstein sexually harassed them. Also other actresses are telling The New York Times that Weinstein was making unwanted advances. Heather Graham is also speaking out. She told Variety that Weinstein implied that if she had sex with him, he would get a movie deal and a movie role. And also tonight, Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman, she told People magazine she is now finally leaving her husband. And according to the Daily Mail, Weinstein is taking a page out of the Clinton playbook. He's now hiring a top Hollywood lawyer in an attempt -- if you read it -- to discredit his victims. At this rate, the way it's going, it looks like this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Now what is even more disturbing is the fact that people, many of them in Hollywood knew what Weinstein was doing and they knew it for decades and they did nothing about it. And some in Hollywood are even being accused of helping to cover this up. Now according to a former New York Times reporter, there was a 2004 story that she was working on about Weinstein allegedly paying a woman to keep her silent after he sexually harassed her. Well, that was eventually killed with the help she says from actors Matt Damon and Russell Crowe. Now, Damon is denying that he played any role and says the conversation that he had with the reporter was not about Weinstein. There's also a fashion designer -- want to be outraged? Donna Karan, she has to apologize today after saying on Sunday that Weinstein's accusers were, quote, \"asking for it.\" And there's also the fact that as we highlighted last night, Weinstein is a huge, massive, major Democratic donor. Now, the Center for Responsive Politics, their estimate is that Weinstein contributed over $2 million to Democrats and that just since the year 2000. Now, it includes individual donations to key, very key top Democratic names and players, including an estimated $44,000 to Hillary Clinton. And that's in addition to the $15,000 that Weinstein gave to her Super Pac or a Super Pac tied to Hillary. And Weinstein also donated over $56,000 to the Obama Victory Fund. Maybe that's why it took Clinton and the Obamas five days to begin to speak out. And that's not all. The Hollywood executive dished out over $97,000 to the Democratic National Committee. He wrote checks for over $76,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Some Democrats, to their credit, are giving the money back. Others are donating to various liberal groups. Really? However, not every single Democrat is even doing that, even though they should be. Remember back during the campaign? I made such a big deal about all of the money that Hillary Clinton, her foundation, was taking in from countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait. The UAE. These are countries that treat women horribly. Remember, in some of these countries gays and lesbians are put to death. Christians and Jews are also persecuted under Sharia Law in these countries. Now before we tell you what Hillary Clinton said about Weinstein today, along five days after the scandal broke, we want to remind you what the women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct said. I don't remember many Hollywood stars speaking out against Bill Clinton or talking about his issues that he had to deal with or how Hillary defended him. You may remember this. HANNITY, JUNE 10, 2003: You described the scene where he was biting on your lip and then when it was all over, he was leaving. He said, you better put some ice on that."

So, keep that in mind while I read you the statement, the ever so eloquent statement that she put out about Weinstein today. \"I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein. The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.\" Really, Hillary, really? Three generic sentences and your utter silence over the years? Now, here's the truth about the Clintons and Weinstein. Take a look at these pictures. They've known Weinstein for years and they have been more than happy to take all of his money and run campaigns. FoxNews.com is also reporting that Weinstein donated between $100 to 250,000 to that Clinton Foundation. Maybe that's why Hillary waited to condemn Weinstein. Countries that supports Sharia, maybe they bought her silence, remember? She never criticized those countries that treat women, gays and lesbians, Christians and Jews horribly. Did Weinstein by her silence also? And also today, finally at this late hour, the Obamas, they finally put out a statement about Weinstein that reads this. Quote, \"Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports of Harvey Weinstein. Any man who demeans, degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable regardless of wealth or status. We should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward to tell these painful stories and we all need to build a culture including by empowering our girls in teaching our boys decency and respect so we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future.\" Oh, OK, Obama loves to opine about cultural controversies. What took him so long to denounce Weinstein? Did it have to do with the fact that he's taken all that money from Weinstein and invited Weinstein to the White House? Maybe Barack Obama was too embarrassed because back in 2013, the former first lady Michelle Obama praised Harvey Weinstein during a White House event. Watch this."

These rumors have been out there for years. And it's not surprising when it comes to the left. As I have explained over and over on this show, liberals love to be so sanctimonious, holier-than-thou. But they are really hypocrites. They claim moral authority over Republicans and conservatives over issues like women's rights, gay rights, freedom of speech, religious freedom. We conservatives on this program have spoken out about the treatment of women, gays and lesbians, Christians and Jews under Sharia. Hollywood is a perfect example of this hypocrisy. For decades, we've been hearing about this type of behavior, that Weinstein is being accused of. Now, he's definitely not alone. It's bigger than anyone is going to tell you. We will be investigating. People have been talking for years. Ever hear the phrase, the casting couch in Hollywood? We've all heard that phrase. And guess what? Hollywood has turned a blind eye to what is systemic abuse. They just accepted it all while attacking conservatives as being anti-women, feeding moral outrage, selective moral outrage, any time a conservative is actually caught up in a scandal or an alleged scandal. Hollywood does not care about the issue that they talked about because if they did, someone would have spoken out sooner about Weinstein. People have known for years and they did not do it. Hollywood, what do they do in the movies? They romanticize violence and sex. That is their bread and butter. And of course, cartoon characters , we all know their values system, we all know they slant left. This is why it's bigger than anyone will tell you and I want to prove it to you. I have a video, it's from 2003. Remember? A guy accused of rape and even admitted to part of it? Roman Polanski? OK. That year he won an Oscar for best director. And then the Hollywood leftist audience, how did they respond? Remember, he was in his 40s when the accusation took place. The girl we're talking about was 13. The same Polanski accused of raping a 13-year-old girl after giving her champagne and Quaaludes. He is 43 at the time of the alleged attack. Polanski charged with six felonies counts, fled to Europe before he got the full sentence he deserved. Which is why he was absent from this award ceremony. Now that you know this, take close attention. How did the Hollywood Oscars crowd, which included Harvey Weinstein and Meryl Streep and others, how did they cheer for this accused child rapist? Watch this. It speaks volumes."

People wanted him extradited to California on this 1977 case. But over 100 leftist Hollywood celebrities -- and we're showing you some of the notable ones right there -- they all signed a petition demanding the guy that did this to a 13-year-old girl be released. Now, there are also reports that Harrison Ford and Harvey Weinstein himself signed that petition. This hypocrisy is stunning, it's shameful, it's beyond disgusting."

When Harvey Weinstein paid off these people, I have no doubt but that he and his privately held company of which he and his brother own 42 percent. That they deducted those payoffs, the silence money from their income tax. As a legitimate business aspect. That's a violation of tax law. What has to happen now, the frustration that the New York County D.A. voiced about the inability to prosecute him for the groping of the actress, because she may have been unreliable or whatever it was, the lawyers came down to -- whatever it was. Now the tax man can I think unpeel a lot of this nonsense and hold people accountable for clear violations of the IRS tax code. A felony, by the way. This is not a minor claim. And I think that's the way to go. Now, as these -- the other thing is, many of the complainants, many of the women coming forward, in the Bill Cosby case, many of the allegations were 20-30- even 40 years old. I suspect that in the Weinstein case, there are fresher allegations in which the statute of limitations has not so old."

Poor Mitt Romney had resumes of women and was accused of misogyny. You couldn't meet a nicer guy in your life, right? Now, all the hypocrisy - Hilary takes money from countries that practice sharia. They take money from Weinstein. Everybody I know in Hollywood says this was an open secret, how abusive and horrible this man was. The casting couch is not a new concept. It did not matter that Bill Clinton treated women horribly. They still voted for Bill and Hillary. Why the double standard?"

One, if Hillary had won, this would still not be a story because they would have smothered it because it's so directly brings back Bill and Hillary. And so in that sense, this is a story that could only emerge when you had somebody new in the White House. Two, in the old days, people like Weinstein, and this would make an amazing movie or an amazing novel, people like Weinstein -- it's not just him. There were people who had the power that they could go to the various publications and the various women's publications and say I can get a star to be the cover of your next magazine. Now, you really want to pick a fight with me?"

Not just you disagree in your conservative, you're a bad person. And as you said, they then come up with all these nasty big terms. And I just saw a study that the next generations of college professors, people under 35 today are 12 to 1 Democrat, 12-1.

And then of course, he can buy carbon offset which is the equivalent of buying, you know, a diamond watch, ring, and necklace if you're unfaithful to your wife and say, it's just an offset, honey. No problem. That'll work. What's a carbon offset is? Oh, I can send all I want. I can put out all the admissions I want but you've got to get rid of your caravan and drive a bicycle."

Repeal and replace, seven and a half years. Do you know how aggravated I am that they weren't ready for that moment? Now it appears they may not be ready for this moment in terms of the tax bill, which the forgotten men and women need and Bob Corker is in a war with Donald Trump and I'm thinking this isn't going to help the country.
