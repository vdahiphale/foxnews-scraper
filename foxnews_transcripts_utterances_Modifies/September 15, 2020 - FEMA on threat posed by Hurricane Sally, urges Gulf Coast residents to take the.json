And we are flashing all around, Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana right now, where they're worried about flooding conditions and water surges in excess of 11 feet as a result of Sally. It could come in as a Category 2 hurricane when it makes landfall perhaps later tonight, early tomorrow morning.  Also looking around right now at Mobile, Alabama, the track of Sally is hard to gauge. And the other part that's making it very difficult to forecast is, it's so slow-moving, at about two miles an hour. That can do a lot of damage, especially since Sally is packing a lot of rain.  Back to the flooding issue that is now front and center, as are we with the latest from Jonathan Hunt right now in Biloxi, Mississippi -- Jonathan.",

And, as you look at it the famous Lighthouse Pier behind me, Hurricane Sally is out there, but, my word, she is taking her time in getting here. Two miles per hour, she's moving out. That's about the speed I'm walking right now, slower than most humans normally walk, slower, Neil, you might be interested to know, than a sea turtle actually moves. But when she comes, she is bringing with her so much rain. It is raining pretty heavily now. It's going to keep doing this and get more and more heavy over the next 24 hours. And they're talking about historic flooding, when you combine that amount of rain with the storm surge we're going to get.  And here in Biloxi and right along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, into Alabama, onto the Florida Panhandle, they know all too well what historic flooding can mean.   You remember, Neil, back in 2005, Hurricane Katrina, we talked so much when we talk about Katrina, about New Orleans, with good reason. But this entire section of the Mississippi coastline got slammed too, billions of dollars in damage, hundreds of lives lost. And as you look in the distance there, that is the famous Beau Rivage Casino. That was flooded three floors up during Katrina. It has been shut down completely right now because of the fears of some sort of repeat of that and similar levels of flooding, Neil. So, while there aren't any more mandatory evacuations here in Mississippi, there are in other -- here in Biloxi, Mississippi -- there are in other areas of the state and into Alabama, where the governor is warning anyone not to take this lightly.

And it's not something that my critics thought was possible. And now they say, wow, that was a good idea. I will say, it's gotten rave reviews, even from The New York Times and Tom Friedman and a lot of people that don't like Donald Trump too much. They have given it literally rave reviews. So this is one deal. But we have many others like this. Look, our country's been stagnant for many years. We did nothing but give our money away, give our wealth away and give our jobs away.

The governor made it impossible for the people that do it, our people, the people that do it, and forced us into an indoor rally. We didn't want an indoor rally, but we did an indoor rally. They spaced as much as they could have. But the governor could have solved the problem. All he had to do is let us use one of the outdoor venues. Plus, they had 25,000 people outside of the venue that couldn't get in. But it's very interesting. When they have protests, that's OK. When they have violence, where they have anarchists and they have agitators, that's OK. The governor of Nevada should not be in charge of ballots.

The president also referring to that peace agreement today, where the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain hope to do business with Israel and vice versa. But the business relations or the normal relations between all of them has already sparked calls that other countries could follow suit in the region. The president intimated that earlier today at the White House ceremony that had a Camp David sort of a feel for it. That's when Jimmy Carter, of course, brought together Menachem Begin of Israel, and, of course, Anwar Sadat of Egypt, to set the way for peace accords that are hammered out at the White House. When all is said and done, the president optimistic that more are on the way, and this is the backdrop for him as he gets ready to go to Pennsylvania. Of course, the vice president, the former Vice President Joe Biden, in Florida today. We will have much more on their campaign plans.

But the real story is just going to be the slow movement of this. So, it's not really the wind that's going to make a big deal. It's how that rain is going to linger around, that wall of water ultimately getting the storm surge to very high numbers, winds at 80 miles currently, still just moving at two miles an hour. And you're getting some of the outer bands of rain beginning to beat up areas from the Florida Big Bend, all the way across the Panhandle, getting into Mississippi and Alabama. Those are going to be the spots that will see the worst of this, see the rain that is just going to linger on and on winds. Currently fairly widespread in the 30-to-40 mile-an-hour range. You see a couple of spots where you're jumping up closer to 60 or 70 miles an hour. That's going to be right at closer to the center of the storm, now, ultimately, probably making landfall sometime tomorrow mid-morning as a Category 1, as we said, strong Category 1 hurricane, weak Category 2.  And then it begins it's very slow march across the Southeast. The story is going to be all the rain it brings with it. When you talk about two miles an hour, that's a lot of time for a shower or a thunderstorm to just sit over top of you. All of that rain falling begins to really pile up. This is the motion of it. Again, this is just tomorrow morning, so not a lot of movement between now and then. A lot of time for that rain to build up. So, no surprise here, we have some really impressive numbers. You get down into those white colors, I think widespread, anywhere from 10 to 20 inches. There's going to be isolated areas with 30 inches of rain, and then taking 10 inches of rain or so all the way up into Atlanta, across the Carolinas. This is going to be a large rain event for a whole lot of people, so no surprise when we see the watches and the warnings for flooding.

And this money will help bring him some say. And my guess is that he does want some say or even a role in the Biden administration. He's not alone, though. There's a lot of Wall Street types like Mike Bloomberg. Remember, Mike Bloomberg started as a Wall Street trader. He built an amazing company. He's worth $50 billion. I will say this, though, if you're comparing Republican mega-donors to Mike Bloomberg. Could you imagine if the Koch set up $100 million, the Koch brothers, or the Koch Enterprises, set up $100 million to buy a state for Donald Trump? I mean, could you imagine what type of front-page outrage would be out there? So, let's not make any bones about this. This is a ton of money. This isn't like some guy donating a few bucks here or there and raising and bundling cash. He's throwing $100 million into a race in a key state. And it could really tip the election Biden's way. I will say this. When you're talking about Hispanic voters, and problem that Biden has with Hispanic voters is this. The Hispanic voters, particularly Puerto Ricans, that have come to Florida, if you know anything about the state's demographics, they're much more conservative than you would think. They left a poverty-stricken island. They're the middle-class that left the island. Trump does have -- built -- some built-in advantages addressing that demographic.",

All of this comes at a time where the Biden proposal to hike taxes on the rich has come to center-focus here. It's an issue I want to raise with you, Frances, because Governor Murphy is among those Democratic governors who have been proposing surtaxes on the rich, much as Joe Biden is looking at doing across the country, or at least have them go back up to a top rate of 39.6 percent. But the truth of matter is, it's going to go beyond just that. And I'm just wondering now how Republicans are countering that, because if it looks like they are, hey, we're for the rich, and they're getting hosed here, that might fall on deaf ears.

So, I think the Republican narrative needs to stay on the fact that we can handle the wealth gap, but we don't want to overtax the people that we're expecting to participate meaningfully in the recovery. And the Democratic narrative is, the only way to handle the wealth gap is to tax the rich and give it to the poor. So, the Republicans need to come back with an education and awareness about supply-side economics, which is, of course, their mantra, and how important it is to support the recovery, first and foremost, and how these tax hikes are going to undermine really not just the rich, the middle class, corporations, et cetera, in the midst of trying to recover from the pandemic.",

This is the Mobile River, which feeds into the bay, and this is potentially right where Sally is going to make landfall tomorrow -- tonight into tomorrow. You can see, the river here is all lined with businesses. But if you go south from here, in the bay, when it opens up, there are many houses along there as well. In one area where we were earlier, the water was already starting to splash over the seawall. And the concern is that, along with the storm surge, there's also this slow-moving storm that could dump up to two feet of rain in some areas. And that could make for a dangerous combination, many rivers expecting life- threatening, historic flooding just east of here. And so it's certainly something that people in this area are taking seriously, despite the relatively calm conditions right now -- Neil.",

It could come in as a Category 2 hurricane when it makes landfall perhaps later tonight, early tomorrow morning. Also looking around right now at Mobile, Alabama, the track of Sally is hard to gauge. And the other part that's making it very difficult to forecast is, it's so slow-moving, at about two miles an hour. That can do a lot of damage, especially since Sally is packing a lot of rain.

That's about the speed I'm walking right now, slower than most humans normally walk, slower, Neil, you might be interested to know, than a sea turtle actually moves. But when she comes, she is bringing with her so much rain. It is raining pretty heavily now. It's going to keep doing this and get more and more heavy over the next 24 hours. And they're talking about historic flooding, when you combine that amount of rain with the storm surge we're going to get. And here in Biloxi and right along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, into Alabama, onto the Florida Panhandle, they know all too well what historic flooding can mean. You remember, Neil, back in 2005, Hurricane Katrina, we talked so much when we talk about Katrina, about New Orleans, with good reason. But this entire section of the Mississippi coastline got slammed too, billions of dollars in damage, hundreds of lives lost. And as you look in the distance there, that is the famous Beau Rivage Casino. That was flooded three floors up during Katrina. It has been shut down completely right now because of the fears of some sort of repeat of that and similar levels of flooding, Neil. So, while there aren't any more mandatory evacuations here in Mississippi, there are in other -- here in Biloxi, Mississippi -- there are in other areas of the state and into Alabama, where the governor is warning anyone not to take this lightly.

Of course, the vice president, the former Vice President Joe Biden, in Florida today. We will have much more on their campaign plans. Right now, back to the hurricane that is getting everyone's attention in the Gulf of Mexico right now. Right now, Sally is a Category 1 storm, but she could hit land as a Category 2. Adam Klotz class has been following it very, very closely. Adam, what can you tell us so far?"

      "speaker": "ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, as you said, this is a big, powerful storm, either a strong Category 1 or a weak Category 2 hurricane. But the real story is just going to be the slow movement of this. So, it's not really the wind that's going to make a big deal. It's how that rain is going to linger around, that wall of water ultimately getting the storm surge to very high numbers, winds at 80 miles currently, still just moving at two miles an hour. And you're getting some of the outer bands of rain beginning to beat up areas from the Florida Big Bend, all the way across the Panhandle, getting into Mississippi and Alabama. Those are going to be the spots that will see the worst of this, see the rain that is just going to linger on and on winds. Currently fairly widespread in the 30-to-40 mile-an-hour range. You see a couple of spots where you're jumping up closer to 60 or 70 miles an hour. That's going to be right at closer to the center of the storm, now, ultimately, probably making landfall sometime tomorrow mid-morning as a Category 1, as we said, strong Category 1 hurricane, weak Category 2. And then it begins it's very slow march across the Southeast. The story is going to be all the rain it brings with it. When you talk about two miles an hour, that's a lot of time for a shower or a thunderstorm to just sit over top of you. All of that rain falling begins to really pile up. This is the motion of it. Again, this is just tomorrow morning, so not a lot of movement between now and then. A lot of time for that rain to build up. So, no surprise here, we have some really impressive numbers. You get down into those white colors, I think widespread, anywhere from 10 to 20 inches. There's going to be isolated areas with 30 inches of rain, and then taking 10 inches of rain or so all the way up into Atlanta, across the Carolinas. This is going to be a large rain event for a whole lot of people, so no surprise when we see the watches and the warnings for flooding. And, again, Neil, I really think the rain isn't too bad right now, but it's going to deteriorate tonight. And then tomorrow is going to be a long day for a lot of folks -- back out to you."

Polling shows recently that Biden is weaker than Hillary Clinton was with Latino voters in Florida and across the country, but particularly in Florida, where Latino voters make up one-fifth of the population. And in a state like Florida, we heard the president talking about this, a lot of the Latinos come from places like Cuba and Venezuela, where the argument about socialism, and communism might resonate more than, say -- I'm here in Arizona right now. A lot of those Latinos are from places like Mexico. So the president is showing signs of strength in Florida.

That's a lot of money. And whether you think it's going to do or close the deal in Florida, it does allow the campaign to utilize these other resources in other states. Let's get the read on that from our own Charlie Gasparino. We have got Nicole Brener-Schmitz, the Democratic strategist, and Frances Newton Stacy, Optimal Capital director of strategy. Nicole, as a Democratic strategist here, that's a big favor Joe Biden is getting from Michael Bloomberg. And I thought, in the back of my mind, I mean, how does he utilize that?"

And I don't think the Republicans are short on donors who are spending big money. It's not $100 million against nothing for the Republicans in Florida. They have got plenty of mega-donors that are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the state as well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, you're totally cynical. You have been covering this way too long. Yes, of course it is. I mean, but we have reported -- my producer Lydia Moynihan has done some good reporting on this. Bloomberg has been feeling shut out of the Biden campaign, that he hasn't had any say in it. And this money will help bring him some say. And my guess is that he does want some say or even a role in the Biden administration. He's not alone, though. There's a lot of Wall Street types like Mike Bloomberg. Remember, Mike Bloomberg started as a Wall Street trader. He built an amazing company. He's worth $50 billion. I will say this, though, if you're comparing Republican mega-donors to Mike Bloomberg. Could you imagine if the Koch set up $100 million, the Koch brothers, or the Koch Enterprises, set up $100 million to buy a state for Donald Trump? I mean, could you imagine what type of front-page outrage would be out there? So, let's not make any bones about this. This is a ton of money. This isn't like some guy donating a few bucks here or there and raising and bundling cash. He's throwing $100 million into a race in a key state. And it could really tip the election Biden's way. I will say this. When you're talking about Hispanic voters, and problem that Biden has with Hispanic voters is this. The Hispanic voters, particularly Puerto Ricans, that have come to Florida, if you know anything about the state's demographics, they're much more conservative than you would think. They left a poverty-stricken island. They're the middle-class that left the island. Trump does have -- built -- some built-in advantages addressing that demographic."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, he is pulling one out of three of them. We were showing as you were speaking -- and it might have confused some years back home. We have got Phil Murphy, the New Jersey governor. The only reason why we're doing the backdrop of that -- it was my bad for not putting that backdrop in context here. All of this comes at a time where the Biden proposal to hike taxes on the rich has come to center-focus here. It's an issue I want to raise with you, Frances, because Governor Murphy is among those Democratic governors who have been proposing surtaxes on the rich, much as Joe Biden is looking at doing across the country, or at least have them go back up to a top rate of 39.6 percent. But the truth of matter is, it's going to go beyond just that. And I'm just wondering now how Republicans are countering that, because if it looks like they are, hey, we're for the rich, and they're getting hosed here, that might fall on deaf ears. How do they strategize that in a state like Florida, for example?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANCES NEWTON STACY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's focused on the recovery. We're not out of the weeds yet. The Fed came out with a statistic that one-third of firms or companies in the U.S. is at risk for insolvency. And we know that the pandemic has really brought to light the wealth gap. So, I think the Republican narrative needs to stay on the fact that we can handle the wealth gap, but we don't want to overtax the people that we're expecting to participate meaningfully in the recovery. And the Democratic narrative is, the only way to handle the wealth gap is to tax the rich and give it to the poor. So, the Republicans need to come back with an education and awareness about supply-side economics, which is, of course, their mantra, and how important it is to support the recovery, first and foremost, and how these tax hikes are going to undermine really not just the rich, the middle class, corporations, et cetera, in the midst of trying to recover from the pandemic."

Now, we're not there yet. So we will see what happens. But do you fear that, because he's laid it out there -- and he hasn't denied it -- he wants to -- he's looking at it for $4 trillion taxes over the next 10 years, a lot of that largely borne by the well-to-do, and corporations will see their rate go up from 21 to 28 percent, but that this could finger him as someone, much like some of these governors in these states where they're hard-pressed to come up with cash, also targeting the rich, that this -- that looks like the AMT thing all over again, a tax that was meant to ensnare those few millionaires and billionaires like Charlie, who are dodging taxes..."

The economy was doing pretty damn good. We went through eight years of the Obama recovery, where you had the gap between the rich and poor grow -- grow even greater. I mean, for all Donald Trump's rhetorical access, his economic policies worked. And I think that's the problem that Joe Biden right now is having with Hispanic voters, who are solidly middle and working class. I mean, they were doing better. The question is, does it -- under Trump. The question is, do they want to take a chance? And a lot of them don't want to. We should point out one other thing. The reason why you flashed Phil Murphy is because he's raising taxes. He's raising so many taxes, the New York Stock Exchange wants to move its servers that -- out of New Jersey back to maybe Florida. People are leaving Democratic states. You just don't have higher taxes from Joe Biden. You have potentially higher taxes from every blue state, Cuomo in New York, Phil Murphy in New Jersey, Ned Lamont in Connecticut.

You can either get stuck in the old paradigm of the past, with animosity toward Israel, hostility toward Israel, or you can chart a path for a new future.

Six people were injured at this site, four them from shock, two of them taking pieces of glass from shrapnel. This rocket exploded on a very busy commercial street. The factions inside Gaza spoke with FOX News tonight. A senior Hamas official telling me that there will be no peace or stability in the region unless the Palestinians are brought to the table and their needs are addressed. While this larger peace deal between the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel is seen as a very positive first step for the region, the Palestinian say there were promises made to them by Gulf countries about normalizing a Palestinian state before brokering ties with the Jewish state.

This is the Mobile River, which feeds into the bay, and this is potentially right where Sally is going to make landfall tomorrow -- tonight into tomorrow. You can see, the river here is all lined with businesses. But if you go south from here, in the bay, when it opens up, there are many houses along there as well. In one area where we were earlier, the water was already starting to splash over the seawall. And the concern is that, along with the storm surge, there's also this slow-moving storm that could dump up to two feet of rain in some areas. And that could make for a dangerous combination, many rivers expecting life- threatening, historic flooding just east of here. And so it's certainly something that people in this area are taking seriously, despite the relatively calm conditions right now -- Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I think -- I think, Pete, we're down to only one more named storm before we have to move on to the Greek alphabet. But what the heck?"
    },

      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "We are."

      "utterance": "How is this one looking, from your vantage point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "So, Sally is -- it's moving at extremely slow speed. There's a -- there's going to be a surge threat along the coast, all the way from the -- Mississippi -- the mouth of Mississippi, all the way to Okaloosa, Walton County in Florida along the Panhandle. Then it's going to just move inland. And it's just going to dump a ton of rain, 10 to 20 inches, some isolated 30 inches. And so those residents of Mississippi, Alabama, Florida that live along the coast that think, hey, I'm just going to get this surge, and I'm out of it, those that live farther inland really have to be careful about flooding, flash flooding. Don't take the storm for granted. You have some time to make final preparations. Heed the directions of your local and state emergency managers, and keep your family safe."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, we were talking a little bit about probably that -- so many in that region feeling a little bit of storm, hurricane fatigue. I was mentioning earlier these other storms that are in the greater neighborhood, from Hurricane Paulette, Tropical Storm Teddy, Tropical Storm Vicky, Rene, and on and on, we go. Have you ever seen anything like this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "We have not. NOAA had forecast that this was going to be an above-average season. And it has lived up to that forecast. We're actually right at the top of the historical peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic. So, we expected to see a lot of action. And we are getting a lot of action here over the past couple days and weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, I have noticed, Administrator, that, when a lot of people are told, you have to evacuate, or you have to go to a shelter, as soon as you mention shelter -- and I have mentioned it with so many guests, probably you in the past -- they get very leery about that, maybe owing to the virus and everything else and being too close to people and all. How are states or how do you recommend states' regions handle that? I know, in some cases, they will open up hotels, motels in the area to mitigate that. But people are leery."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. And no one wants to leave their home, right? So -- but, when told to do so by officials..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "... you got to do it. And we have been working on this for a while now. Right when COVID started, we knew we're going to walk into hurricane season. We put out some planning guidance for states to adapt their plans. I was just down in Louisiana a couple weeks ago with Laura. States have done a tremendous job with the considerations of COVID-19, very few people in the normal sheltering conditions that you have seen, like gymnasiums. The majority of people are in hotels. And that's a credit to good planning on the states. And so, whether you're in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, those state emergency managers -- I talked to many of them today -- have a plan to put those at risk into non-congregate care shelters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, there's so much we don't know about this slow-moving storm itself, as you pointed out at the outset here, but we do know it would be the first serious test, if it were even to brush by New Orleans, of those levees and the strengthened conditions since Katrina, what, 15 years ago. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "I was actually down in New Orleans probably a month ago now, did a great tour with Mayor Cantrell, looking at all the things that have improved down there, from the levees, to mitigation, to make sure that water stays out of neighborhood -- neighborhoods, maintenance on pumps. She's hard at it down there making -- making sure she's keeping her city safe. This is going to -- this will impact New Orleans a little bit. They're not out of it yet. A little more fortunate that it goes east, especially if you think about those that are in Lake Charles trying to recover from Laura. This is -- this is probably a better track for them, but, again, not over yet. Take it seriously. Again, heed those instructions from your state and local emergency managers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, after this, when we have one more name, I guess, English name that could apply to a storm, I guess that's already been preordained to be Wilfred, right? OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And then, after that, it's the Greek alphabet, right? And that hasn't been utilized, again, since 2005, the year Katrina and those 27 other storms. So, how is that decided, by the way?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "I think it's decided by NOAA. They have an international committee that picks names. And they do like four or five years at a shot in picking names. So, you're right. Historically, we haven't done this in 15 years. And, again, being about halfway through the hurricane season, I would plan to go through a few more names into the Greek alphabet here over the next weeks and months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, I have to brush up on my Greek, I guess, then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAYNOR",
      "utterance": "We all do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Pete Gaynor, thank you very much. You're a real pro, and keep your calm through all of this. Pete Gaynor, the FEMA administrator. Right now, the latest, as he was saying here, is that this slow-moving storm, all of two miles an hour -- I think most people can walk faster than that -- but it is a problem with storm surges and flooding, because it is so slow-moving. They expect upwards of 11-foot surges. And that is something that, if you are in the way of that, there's no way you can survive that. So, heed the local warnings. In the meantime, that will do it for us. We will be monitoring this. Here comes \"THE FIVE.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
