So, I think there's an unfairness within the corporate tax, not to mention that about 25 percent of the corporate tax is paid for by the workers. That's the Congressional Budget Office saying that.  So, they actually -- the worker actually pays some of that corporate tax, too, which I have concerns about. So, again, we're borrowing this money, Neil.

We have do research to keep up with China on additive manufacturing, on renewable energy. We have got to lay broadband all over the country. We need a new energy grid.   We should be doing -- using money to have public-private partnerships with the telecommunications companies, with the power companies to take care of our public infrastructure, if we're going to be competitive in the 21st century.

My main goal is try to get the Democratic Party back on track, talking about economics, getting wages up, pensions, back to an economic message which I think allows us to be competitive in every corner of the country. That's been my main goal. And I'm going to continue to do that and try to help..."
