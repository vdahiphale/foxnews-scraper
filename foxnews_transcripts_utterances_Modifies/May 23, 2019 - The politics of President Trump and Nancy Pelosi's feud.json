When the Democrats refinish for the fifth time their fake work on their very disappointing Mueller finding, they will have real time to get the real work of people done.

But I do think that there are forces that could be driving them toward impeachment. The Democrats seem to have settled on this idea that the president is involved in a cover-up, they have subpoenas out there. If this goes on and goes to court, somebody is going to have to give. If you look back to the Nixon case in 1974, indictments of Watergate conspirators, the prosecutors said to Nixon turn over the tapes. He said no, executive privilege. It went to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said the privilege has to yield to the needs of this inquiry.

This is an unpopular objective among the wide variety of Americans, and Pelosi knows that.

      "utterance": "It does not, although I think the fact that the president said that today was a clear signal that he's trying to say to President Xi that I'm still able to negotiate. I want to help if you can come somewhere along the lines of where we're asking you to on trade. But China hasn't been, and that's the reason that they're pretty much at a standstill."

      "utterance": "Finally tonight, some heroes go beyond the call of duty. A group of firefighters in Concord, North Carolina, dropped what they were doing, started mowing 78-year-old Pat Lee's lawn after they noticed her struggling in the heat. These firefighters were conducting a routine check on hydrants nearby at the time. In an hour, they mowed Lee's entire lawn, they trimmed the bushes and even stopped to have a nice chat with her. Firefighters helping out, great story. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
