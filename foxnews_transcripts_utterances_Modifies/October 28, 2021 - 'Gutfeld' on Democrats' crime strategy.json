Comedian Kathy Griffin posted a video of her shaking her breasts from a balcony in Los Angeles. Authorities report it's the first time they've seen migrants turn around at the border and head home. We don't need a wall. California Governor Gavin Newsom has mandated COVID vaccines for all state employees, but less than two-thirds have complied. Can't fault them in San Francisco for some reason there's a shortage of needles. Sportscaster Joe Buck claims he once peed in a bottle while calling an NFL touchdown. Big deal. I once peed in a bottle on \"THE FIVE\" while doing an Animals are great segment. Then I told Kilmeade it was Gatorade. He didn't mind at all. A Minnesota surgeon was fired for telling a school board to let parents make decisions about masking kids, which makes total sense. I mean, what does a surgeon know about masks?",

      "sentences": "A sexist would say. That didn't even get a laugh, Tyrus. What's with this crowd? Some New York schools are banning any Halloween costumes based on the Netflix show Squid Game, which depicts mass murder. In a related story, stores are pulling all their witches costumes because the host on The View considered it cultural appropriation. Note to self, make all jokes about The View. A hiker lost for 24 hours ignored calls from rescuers because they came from an unknown number. Even worse, he was in a Bed Bath and Beyond. And that was my seven jokes. All right. So America, get ready for more crime. I'm so excited. We should all stand up and do the wave. Except this is a crime wave. So when we sit back down our wallets will be gone. Last night I went to dinner and you know what I didn't get murder? That's quite a feat when you consider I had the jalapeno poppers at the Time Square Applebee's. So as you can tell, I'm not dead. But for how long? Last night we told you about Biden's 42-Page plan to promote gender equity. That's one page for every gender. Inside the plan is a proposal to eliminate cash bail for suspects, and not just the ones with the initials H.B. Now, this happens as freed repeat offenders have been killing and injuring people. Thanks to this new policy. It's turning repeat offenders into repeat, repeat, repeat offenders. It's like binge watching Will and Grace. We've heard the examples. In Virginia, a man beats up his spouse, gets released on no cash bail. And then he kills her. The many attacks here on women some resulting in death, all done by thugs who've been arrested and then released. Some of that effect on women wasn't in the 42-page plan on gender equity. The radical D.A.s behind this don't seem to mind, maybe because it's working out the way that they want it to. Nothing shall slow the revolution, including murder. You got to break a few eggs to make an omelet and instead of egg shells, ah, it's gun shells. And the media is there to help out. Every time we mentioned the homicide rates, what do you hear? That other violent crime has gone down. Take the L.A. Times reporting that California had a 31 percent jump in homicides. But they point out that the state's faring better on other violent crime. Well, that's good to know. It's good to know that when someone attacks you, they're going to finish the job. Meanwhile, San Francisco families are hiring private security to keep them safe. So I'm curious how wealthy are these families since they can afford this? And more importantly did they vote Democrat because clearly they can afford that too. If you're living in S.F. and instead of moving, you just hire private guards, you must be doing all right. And you're doing so well. You can avoid the hell that harms other people. That's the kind of privatization wealthy liberals love. Vote to defund the police for you than hire private police to protect themselves. Maybe it's time to introduce bills that ban private security by Democrats. I mean, if they can throw no cash bail at us, can't we throw that right back at them? If you support no cash bail why should you live in safety if the rest of us can't? It's a direct result of your stupid destructive decisions, like slashing police budgets or putting Pop Rocks and Kat's vape pen. But you see the pattern, Dems get into power to exempt themselves from the laws they force on others. As long as they're in power, they can dance maskless in public and eat in a fancy restaurant while you're under house arrest (BLEEP) some can even marry their brother. That must have been a cozy wedding. When they asked guests if they were relatives of the bride or groom they all just said yes. Talk about dysfunctional as Minneapolis gets worse and worse mentally ill Han calls the cops dysfunctional. But Omar calling anyone dysfunctional is like me calling anyone drop dead gorgeous. I mean talking about the pot calling the kettle black. You know what I'm saying? Or in this case the wife calling the brother husband. But these lives are all safe and secure. Meanwhile, a grandmother must take two extra buses to find a Walgreens since they all closed in her neighborhood due to the retail theft sanction by liberal leaders. Now we wish the Democrat party might rediscover common sense, but they won't. They won. Now they see their experiment in action. Burnt out cities, record homicide rates, looting as recreational behavior, rapes in schools covered up by flax. It's not exactly a brochure for Sandals Resorts and those pushing it demand even more. You know, you could say they're a glutton for punishment, except they're not getting punished. You are.",

      "utterance": "A sexist would say. That didn't even get a laugh, Tyrus. What's with this crowd? Some New York schools are banning any Halloween costumes based on the Netflix show Squid Game, which depicts mass murder. In a related story, stores are pulling all their witches costumes because the host on The View considered it cultural appropriation. Note to self, make all jokes about The View. A hiker lost for 24 hours ignored calls from rescuers because they came from an unknown number. Even worse, he was in a Bed Bath and Beyond. And that was my seven jokes. All right. So America, get ready for more crime. I'm so excited. We should all stand up and do the wave. Except this is a crime wave. So when we sit back down our wallets will be gone. Last night I went to dinner and you know what I didn't get murder? That's quite a feat when you consider I had the jalapeno poppers at the Time Square Applebee's. So as you can tell, I'm not dead. But for how long? Last night we told you about Biden's 42-Page plan to promote gender equity. That's one page for every gender. Inside the plan is a proposal to eliminate cash bail for suspects, and not just the ones with the initials H.B. Now, this happens as freed repeat offenders have been killing and injuring people. Thanks to this new policy. It's turning repeat offenders into repeat, repeat, repeat offenders. It's like binge watching Will and Grace. We've heard the examples. In Virginia, a man beats up his spouse, gets released on no cash bail. And then he kills her. The many attacks here on women some resulting in death, all done by thugs who've been arrested and then released. Some of that effect on women wasn't in the 42-page plan on gender equity. The radical D.A.s behind this don't seem to mind, maybe because it's working out the way that they want it to. Nothing shall slow the revolution, including murder. You got to break a few eggs to make an omelet and instead of egg shells, ah, it's gun shells. And the media is there to help out. Every time we mentioned the homicide rates, what do you hear? That other violent crime has gone down. Take the L.A. Times reporting that California had a 31 percent jump in homicides. But they point out that the state's faring better on other violent crime. Well, that's good to know. It's good to know that when someone attacks you, they're going to finish the job. Meanwhile, San Francisco families are hiring private security to keep them safe. So I'm curious how wealthy are these families since they can afford this? And more importantly did they vote Democrat because clearly they can afford that too. If you're living in S.F. and instead of moving, you just hire private guards, you must be doing all right. And you're doing so well. You can avoid the hell that harms other people. That's the kind of privatization wealthy liberals love. Vote to defund the police for you than hire private police to protect themselves. Maybe it's time to introduce bills that ban private security by Democrats. I mean, if they can throw no cash bail at us, can't we throw that right back at them? If you support no cash bail why should you live in safety if the rest of us can't? It's a direct result of your stupid destructive decisions, like slashing police budgets or putting Pop Rocks and Kat's vape pen. But you see the pattern, Dems get into power to exempt themselves from the laws they force on others. As long as they're in power, they can dance maskless in public and eat in a fancy restaurant while you're under house arrest (BLEEP) some can even marry their brother. That must have been a cozy wedding. When they asked guests if they were relatives of the bride or groom they all just said yes. Talk about dysfunctional as Minneapolis gets worse and worse mentally ill Han calls the cops dysfunctional. But Omar calling anyone dysfunctional is like me calling anyone drop dead gorgeous. I mean talking about the pot calling the kettle black. You know what I'm saying? Or in this case the wife calling the brother husband. But these lives are all safe and secure. Meanwhile, a grandmother must take two extra buses to find a Walgreens since they all closed in her neighborhood due to the retail theft sanction by liberal leaders. Now we wish the Democrat party might rediscover common sense, but they won't. They won. Now they see their experiment in action. Burnt out cities, record homicide rates, looting as recreational behavior, rapes in schools covered up by flax. It's not exactly a brochure for Sandals Resorts and those pushing it demand even more. You know, you could say they're a glutton for punishment, except they're not getting punished. You are."

A universe -- University of Michigan study bucks long standing gender stereotypes, concluding that men are just as emotional as women. It boiled down to what they define as emotional. For example, men getting passionate while watching sports counts. I suppose it counts as emotional too when my dad hollered, get away from the T.V. General Hospital is on. Same goes for enthusiasm and nervousness, two emotions I get when Stuart Varney shows up at my house unexpected with a bottle of red and a bearskin rug. We go now to our sensitivity and emotions correspondent to see if this is all true."

You know what I'm saying? Or we dated really an attractive woman because she doesn't remind us of what walked out on us. So, that's not dealing with your emotions. Well, I'm lying. OK? I'm lying. Right? OK, guys, sure. If we were able to express ourselves, we wouldn't be in those situations. We wouldn't make bad decisions. We wouldn't buy cars when we're 50 that we don't fit in. You know I'm saying? We wouldn't do things like that to feel better or get hair plugs and all this other kind of stuff. That's what guys do because they can't just say, my feeling, I'm hurt."

One way you can really get some emotion out of a man is to -- I -- I'm very emotional, I have feelings. Once you realize that as a human, that's OK to have feelings and let them out. It's good to cry. It's good to release. If you want to see an emotional man, show him that you're crying. They don't know how to handle that. If there's tears, there's a tear. What would I do? What's wrong? That really brings out emotion. And honestly, I'm actually a little bit upset. I don't think they needed to spend so much money and time on this study. I think they could have just maybe opened up C-SPAN and studied at the Institute of John Boehner's of, you know, grand emotions. I mean, that guy was a rollercoaster."
