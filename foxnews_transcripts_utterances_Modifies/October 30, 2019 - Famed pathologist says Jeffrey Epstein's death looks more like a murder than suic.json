      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” By the fourth or fifth decade of Soviet communism, it was clear that the experiment wasn't really working. Almost nothing the Soviet State said was going to happen ever did. People were restless and they were frustrated, but they couldn't say so. As the authorities lost their credibility, they became hysterical in the hunt for deviationists. Anyone who complained or asked questions was punished.  Ultimately, the authorities decided that any disagreement with official orthodoxy wasn't simply forbidden, it was a form of mental illness. It had to be.  Soviet medical literature from the 1960s described schizophrenics as anyone who exhibited skepticism of the party line or displayed undue interest in quote, \"truth and justice.\" In other words, in the Soviet Union, anyone who refused to lie was by definition, crazy.  All of which brings to mind the increasingly remarkable case of entertainer Kanye West. For a couple of decades, West enjoyed a pretty conventional, if highly successful career as a producer and musician. Then in the last few years, something changed profoundly West jumped into the business of social commentary, but not in the way that many of his fans expected. In place of the usual industry-approved banalities about identity politics and sexual liberation, West started saying things like this.",

Lots of the stuff that happened with him in 2018 when he first came out and had some positive things to say about Trump or about conservative values or anything like that.

      "sentences": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest Member of Congress. She turned 30 just a couple of weeks ago. She is barely old enough to rent a car. And yet already, she is one of the most powerful politicians in America. Eighteen months ago, nobody in Washington had heard of the Green New Deal. Today, it is at the very center of the Democratic agenda. Ocasio-Cortez did that. So there's a reason she is famous. It's not just hype. She's impressive in a lot of ways and even if you disagree with her, you ought to admit that. She is legitimately tough for one thing. Strength is a prerequisite for success in politics as in life. Ocasio-Cortez is. She is one of the only Democrats in the House, who is totally unintimidated by Nancy Pelosi. When she got to Washington, party bosses tried to make her moderator views for public consumption, but she refused. Unlike most Members of Congress, Ocasio-Cortez actually believes most of what she says. She understands that something profound has gone wrong in America. The country is dangerously unequal. Fixing that will require going to war with the entrenched establishment, which is currently profiting from the status quo. Ocasio-Cortez is happy to do that. When Amazon decided to demand subsidies in order to come to New York, she was one of the very few who asked why we would send tax dollars to the world's richest man. When all the fashionable people in her party decided that Elizabeth Warren should be the nominee, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bernie. She is an independent spirit, one of the very few in Washington. And it's easy to see why young people listen to her. And in the end, that is the problem with Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. It is not her economic views the ones that get all the attention. Yes, she's a wild eyed left winger who's pushing socialism on the country. Her ideas may be stupid and wrong. We think they are. But they are still undeniably ideas. You could debate them, we often do. The problem is the rest of what she says. There's a darker side to it Ocasio-Cortez and it has nothing to do with the Green New Deal. She is an unapologetic bigot, someone who attacks others for the way they were born. There's nothing legitimate about that. You can't debate bigotry, it's pure poison. It's terrifying to think that someone who spews open racism has become a role model for our young people. But that is exactly what has happened, and it has been happening since Ocasio-Cortez arrived on the public stage. During her first run for Congress last year, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the incumbent who held the seat didn't deserve to be in Congress because he was the wrong race. By Election Day her opponent was literally apologizing for his own skin color. When he accused Ocasio-Cortez for making the election about race, she didn't run from it, quote, \"It is about race,\" end quote. Not so long ago, a campaign like that would have been considered deeply immoral. The press would have hounded Ocasio-Cortez until she apologized or dropped out. But not anymore. A ruling class no longer recognizes universal standards of any kind. Racism, they have decided cuts only one way. So they ignored Ocasio- Cortez's race baiting and she got elected. Over time, like any untreated virus, her bigotry grew more inflamed. Here was Ocasio-Cortez just last week in a public hearing, explaining that actually, global climate change is the fault of a specific racial group. Watch.",

Ever notice how all those people look alike? They've got something in common, don't they? That's right, they are the same color. That's what she is saying. Standards have changed so much that it's hard to say something genuinely shocking in this country anymore. But that qualifies. For all the hysteria that you hear about how the President is a racist, Donald Trump has never said anything close to that. Nothing close to it as bigoted and vicious as that. The people wrecking the world are all of one race. Who talks like that? In fact, it's hard to think of anyone in American life saying anything that disgusting and foolish and dangerous. So exactly what would it be? And yet -- and here's the amazing part. Nobody seemed to even notice when Ocasio-Cortez said that in the middle of the congressional hearing. Our rulers acted like it was all totally normal because increasingly for them, it is normal. This is an ominous development for this country. Talk like this will destroy us. It has come close before, as you know. It is possible that Ocasio-Cortez doesn't really know what she's saying. You'd like to think that she doesn't. Maybe she's just young and lacking wisdom and can't hear herself. The problem is that others can hear her clearly. Every time she encourages her followers to hate and distrust other people based on their race. Some of them will, and over time, this is how countries fall apart. So going forward, here's a plea to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, keep saying what you think is true. Keep taking jabs at the establishment in Washington, even those of us who disagree with you will cheer you on. But my gosh, please, for the sake of the country and the children you don't yet have, please stop attacking people for the color of their skin. They can't change who they are and neither can you. We all have to live here together anyway, and we won't be able to if you keep this up.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” By the fourth or fifth decade of Soviet communism, it was clear that the experiment wasn't really working. Almost nothing the Soviet State said was going to happen ever did. People were restless and they were frustrated, but they couldn't say so. As the authorities lost their credibility, they became hysterical in the hunt for deviationists. Anyone who complained or asked questions was punished. Ultimately, the authorities decided that any disagreement with official orthodoxy wasn't simply forbidden, it was a form of mental illness. It had to be. Soviet medical literature from the 1960s described schizophrenics as anyone who exhibited skepticism of the party line or displayed undue interest in quote, \"truth and justice.\" In other words, in the Soviet Union, anyone who refused to lie was by definition, crazy. All of which brings to mind the increasingly remarkable case of entertainer Kanye West. For a couple of decades, West enjoyed a pretty conventional, if highly successful career as a producer and musician. Then in the last few years, something changed profoundly West jumped into the business of social commentary, but not in the way that many of his fans expected. In place of the usual industry-approved banalities about identity politics and sexual liberation, West started saying things like this."

For a while, it wasn't clear which it was -- ironic or demented. But when West kept saying things like this, it became obvious, he must be insane."

But again, I think the core message both in what I put out there and what I think Kanye West and similar people are putting out there is not saying look, you need to become conservative, you must vote Trump. You must vote Republican or anything like that. I think it's just saying like, look, there are alternate perspectives here and firstly, it's okay to voice an alternate perspective without being demonized and attacked. I mean, we're seeing what's happening. Lots of the stuff that happened with him in 2018 when he first came out and had some positive things to say about Trump or about conservative values or anything like that. I mean, he got mobbed, and that's because he's such a huge cultural figure, both within and outside of music. So if someone with his gravitas is saying that and then going out there and getting Jesus as King trending on Twitter and becoming the biggest album in the world. That's a threat to a lot of people.

It's just her failure as a candidate. And she actually sent a memo out today to staff and donors telling them that she's laying people off and that she's reshaping her campaign. She' is going to be sending additional staff to Iowa, and laying off those staffers at her Baltimore headquarters, because she's only at about 2.7 percent of the RealClearPolitics average in Iowa, so she is clearly struggling there. Even in her own home state of California, she is at eight percent. And I also want to get to real quick, there's this quote from David Axelrod, who has repeatedly just needle Joe Biden, if we can pull it up. He says, \"They have him in the candidate protection program. I don't know if you can do that. I don't know if you can get through a whole campaign that way. Either he can hack it or he can't hack it. If you're worried the candidate can hurt himself talking to a reporter, that's a bad sign.\" So clearly, we know the Obama team tried to push them out in 2016 and 2020 and David Axelrod who knows what kind of caliber of a candidate Joe Biden is clearly just taking shot after shot."

The only person that has actually moved up a little bit has been Elizabeth Warren.

There hasn't been a suicide in this prison, only one in 40 years before this. Cameras are broken. Guards falling asleep simultaneously and he is left on observed for hours. This doesn't pass the sniff test. So Dr. Baden and our viewers are right to be saying, wait a minute, what don't we know? Was there were more DNA evidence? He brought up this morning, you know, where's the DNA evidence on the sheets that were there? Under Epstein's fingernails? These are questions. But I want to add one other thing. The pathologist that's ruling on this, the medical examiner, the Chief Medical Examiner in New York is quite reputable and she came back and said, this is a suicide. She better be right, because she is putting her entire career on the line here. And the determination, Tucker is made by putting a lot of facts together.

      "utterance": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest Member of Congress. She turned 30 just a couple of weeks ago. She is barely old enough to rent a car. And yet already, she is one of the most powerful politicians in America. Eighteen months ago, nobody in Washington had heard of the Green New Deal. Today, it is at the very center of the Democratic agenda. Ocasio-Cortez did that. So there's a reason she is famous. It's not just hype. She's impressive in a lot of ways and even if you disagree with her, you ought to admit that. She is legitimately tough for one thing. Strength is a prerequisite for success in politics as in life. Ocasio-Cortez is. She is one of the only Democrats in the House, who is totally unintimidated by Nancy Pelosi. When she got to Washington, party bosses tried to make her moderator views for public consumption, but she refused. Unlike most Members of Congress, Ocasio-Cortez actually believes most of what she says. She understands that something profound has gone wrong in America. The country is dangerously unequal. Fixing that will require going to war with the entrenched establishment, which is currently profiting from the status quo. Ocasio-Cortez is happy to do that. When Amazon decided to demand subsidies in order to come to New York, she was one of the very few who asked why we would send tax dollars to the world's richest man. When all the fashionable people in her party decided that Elizabeth Warren should be the nominee, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bernie. She is an independent spirit, one of the very few in Washington. And it's easy to see why young people listen to her. And in the end, that is the problem with Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. It is not her economic views the ones that get all the attention. Yes, she's a wild eyed left winger who's pushing socialism on the country. Her ideas may be stupid and wrong. We think they are. But they are still undeniably ideas. You could debate them, we often do. The problem is the rest of what she says. There's a darker side to it Ocasio-Cortez and it has nothing to do with the Green New Deal. She is an unapologetic bigot, someone who attacks others for the way they were born. There's nothing legitimate about that. You can't debate bigotry, it's pure poison. It's terrifying to think that someone who spews open racism has become a role model for our young people. But that is exactly what has happened, and it has been happening since Ocasio-Cortez arrived on the public stage. During her first run for Congress last year, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that the incumbent who held the seat didn't deserve to be in Congress because he was the wrong race. By Election Day her opponent was literally apologizing for his own skin color. When he accused Ocasio-Cortez for making the election about race, she didn't run from it, quote, \"It is about race,\" end quote. Not so long ago, a campaign like that would have been considered deeply immoral. The press would have hounded Ocasio-Cortez until she apologized or dropped out. But not anymore. A ruling class no longer recognizes universal standards of any kind. Racism, they have decided cuts only one way. So they ignored Ocasio- Cortez's race baiting and she got elected. Over time, like any untreated virus, her bigotry grew more inflamed. Here was Ocasio-Cortez just last week in a public hearing, explaining that actually, global climate change is the fault of a specific racial group. Watch."

      "utterance": "\"The people that are producing climate change,\" end quote. That's right, those people, the ones destroying the Earth, driving entire species to extinction, killing children. Ever notice how all those people look alike? They've got something in common, don't they? That's right, they are the same color. That's what she is saying. Standards have changed so much that it's hard to say something genuinely shocking in this country anymore. But that qualifies. For all the hysteria that you hear about how the President is a racist, Donald Trump has never said anything close to that. Nothing close to it as bigoted and vicious as that. The people wrecking the world are all of one race. Who talks like that? In fact, it's hard to think of anyone in American life saying anything that disgusting and foolish and dangerous. So exactly what would it be? And yet -- and here's the amazing part. Nobody seemed to even notice when Ocasio-Cortez said that in the middle of the congressional hearing. Our rulers acted like it was all totally normal because increasingly for them, it is normal. This is an ominous development for this country. Talk like this will destroy us. It has come close before, as you know. It is possible that Ocasio-Cortez doesn't really know what she's saying. You'd like to think that she doesn't. Maybe she's just young and lacking wisdom and can't hear herself. The problem is that others can hear her clearly. Every time she encourages her followers to hate and distrust other people based on their race. Some of them will, and over time, this is how countries fall apart. So going forward, here's a plea to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, keep saying what you think is true. Keep taking jabs at the establishment in Washington, even those of us who disagree with you will cheer you on. But my gosh, please, for the sake of the country and the children you don't yet have, please stop attacking people for the color of their skin. They can't change who they are and neither can you. We all have to live here together anyway, and we won't be able to if you keep this up. Members of Congress routinely abuse their offices to enrich themselves and their friends, Ilhan Omar even used campaign funds to pay someone she was having an affair with. How often does this happen exactly in Washington? An eye opening report, next?"

      "utterance": "Congresswoman Ilhan Omar recently provided a high profile example of the corruption that flourishes in Washington. She's not the only one, but she is the most recent example. Omar diverted thousands of dollars in campaign funds to a company owned by someone she was apparently having an affair with. She's not alone in this as we just said. Adam Andrzejewski is CEO of Open the Books which recently released a report on corruption in Congress. We had this conversation about it."

So here's how it works. Federal contractors are giving up to, you know, there can be hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign cash, and they're getting millions, if not billions of dollars out of the Federal checkbook on contracts and grants."

      "utterance": "So here's a specific example. Out in Connecticut, you've got the powerful Ranking Democratic Member on House Ways and Means, John Larson, and his number one campaign contributor is United Technologies, a Fortune 100 company, a defense contractor, based in his district and the affiliates of United Technology have given Larson over the course of his career $377,000.00 worth of campaign donations. That's his number one campaign donor. Just a couple of months ago, Larson was bragging that he brought 90 of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter military jets in the latest budget proposal back to United Technology, an affiliate of theirs that makes their engine the President only wanted 78 of those jets. Each one of those F-35s costs the American taxpayer $100 million. So an extra 12 jets, that's $1.2 billion. And guess what, Tucker? John Larson owns the stock of United Technologies."

His name is Tom Cole and the number one campaign contributor of Tom Cole is actually the Chickasaw Nation. Through their affiliates and through the Nation directly and their executives and their employees, they have put in $258,000.00 into Cole's Campaign Committee, the number one contributor all-time to him. They have reaped in the past five years $700 million worth of Federal grants. These are taxpayer subsidies into the nation. They've also received a half million dollars' worth of surplus military equipment to the Pentagon. They've received military rifles, thermal sites. They've also received mine detecting sets and mine resistant vehicles, Tucker."

He has, in the last nine election cycles, in four of those cycles, his opponents have raised no money. The Chickasaw Nation put in $258,000.00 into his campaign fund. And Cole has been able to through his campaign fund hire his own private company who runs campaigns. Cole's campaign fund paid his own firm $224,000.00 and then Cole's private company has paid Cole, the sitting Congressman, in his individual capacity over $320,000.00."
