Fay made landfall this afternoon near Atlantic City New Jersey and is expected to bring two to four inches of rain with the possibility of flash flooding in parts of the mid-Atlantic and southern New England. Fox 26 in Bismarck, as a federal judge rejects a request from the operator of the Dakota Access Pipeline to halt an order to shut down during a lengthy environmental review. The decision effectively sends the case to a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And this is a live look at Chicago from Fox 32, the big story there tonight.

You heard him talking today about the border fence and about how the progress he's making there in extending the barrier and fixing broken parts of the barrier, it's decreased illegal immigration over the southern border.

I think if President Trump's best answer on the first day of this Joe Biden plan is to accuse him of plagiarism and to engage in name-calling, I have to think if you are in the Biden campaign this evening, you feel pretty good about where you are and how you have been able to reset and re-shift this conversation."

So I agree with Harold, for the president to just simply whine about plagiarism is not going to help his cause. What he can do is promote himself as the originator of the make it in America, buy American idea, and prove himself to be the one who can best execute it, because he's been doing it for the past several years. That's his best option. I think it's making the case that the left is part of Biden's agenda is something that voters won't like in the end. It's also a good route for the president to take, because that does resonate with voters. What doesn't resonate with voters is arguing over who came up with the idea first."

He didn't get the names of everything he wanted, Medicare for all, but what he did get is the essence of Bernie. Joe Biden is now campaigning further to the left then Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And Mr. Sanders is very, very happy. \"The New York Times\" even points out that this is a broader and much more costly agenda than Joe Biden has been campaigning on thus far.

And President Trump to his credit has acknowledged and recognizes that. And I think Joe Biden has a similar take but has a different way he would prioritize. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Lindsey Graham, I know two of them, they now support President Trump. During the 2016 campaign they didn't at all, in fact there was a lot of acrimony among the four of those guys. They seem to get along a lot better now. It's no secret and certainly nothing new in politics for people who ran against one another to find their way back to being supportive of one another if it means that their party can be in the White House. For anyone to believe that a guy from Scranton, Pennsylvania, a guy with the record that Joe Biden has had over the last 40 years in politics is somehow going to become a flaming liberal I think is just wrong, and it's going to be hard, I think, to sell that bill of goods to everyday voters."

      "utterance": "I think it's fine, because I think most Republicans and the president have long supported the idea of Dreamers staying in this country. It's very hard to find the Republicans on Capitol Hill who think Dreamers should be sent home. That's always buried in the whole argument about immigration reform. What they wanted was to use the Dreamer pathway as a component of a broader immigration reform that would strengthen border security. But the president is making that headway. You heard him talking today about the border fence and about how the progress he's making there in extending the barrier and fixing broken parts of the barrier, it's decreased illegal immigration over the southern border. He has succeeded in many of those places. And I think that eases pressure on him and it lets him steal one away from the Democrats. It's a big talking point for them about the Dreamers. It's a very popular issue with the Hispanic base and Hispanic voters. So I think it's a smart move for the president because he seizes the issue and he takes it away from Congress."

Harold Ford, let's start with you. Goya does a lot of good work around the world in terms of donating food. It employs 4,000 people here in the United States, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Spain. And yet people on the left are taking aim at this company, saying this CEO has to go and don't buy Goya goods. Is not the right way to handle this?"

      "utterance": "I'm a believer that one of the most basic and fundamental and most important principles in our country and our democracy is to allow dissent. And we need to reaffirm that. It bothers me and concerns me when we have students at universities working to cancel the voices of outside speakers who may have a different political opinion. That's the beauty of living in America. That's the beauty of living in a democracy. If you can't come up with a better argument other than trying to cancel that person out or end that person's right to present or express his or herself, that's not what America is about. So I hope some of these folks will holster these rhetorical sidearms of theirs and focus more on issues and substance and understand what America is all about, which is a little bit of dissent."

Not only did he introduce the president as, I think he called him an incredible builder yesterday at the White House, but he pointed out today that he did the same thing when he was invited by President Obama to an event. So he's not a partisan -- being partisan at all with this. And never mind the fact that their products are incredibly popular and in the pantries of just about every American. It's going to backfire in my view."

      "utterance": "I don't think so. But again, my advice for people advising the White House is that, in a role especially like his, if it's not necessary to say, it's necessary not to say. The truth is we don't have the measures yet to know the full impact and how we're doing, because those would include economic impact, it would include people that died, say, for not wanting to go to the hospital. So we don't even know that. And on the other hand, it's the classic story. Doctors focus on health. If you listen to your dentist you would be flossing for 22 hours a day, OK? Most people have other things they have to balance, like a president. So it's not unusual for a doctor to be taking a stricter view than a politician."
