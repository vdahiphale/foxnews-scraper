They want to abolish an agency that rescued hundreds of women from sex trafficking. They want to abolish the agency that saved thousands of children from child predators and sex traffickers. They want to abolish an agency that seized enough opioids in this country in one year to kill every man, woman, and child in this country twice -- not once, twice.  They want to abolish an agency that's the number one participant with the F.B.I. and Joint Terrorism Task Force who do a lot of terrorism investigations. They want to abolish the agency that does gun trafficking investigations, narcotics investigations, doing investigation where our technology is smuggled overseas, such as missile technology that can be used in our war fighters.  They want to abolish an agency that has a Civil Rights division, we have removed hundreds of Nazis from the United States over the years and sending them back to face trial. We remove Civil Rights violators that are wanted by their countries all over the world -- we do this every year. They want to abolish an agency that arrested 127,000 criminal aliens last year. Not just illegal aliens, these are illegal aliens that committed a bad act for getting here, a criminal violation.  They want to abolish an agency that 90 percent of every alien they arrest either has a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges that means, it's filed in a county jail.   They want to abolish an agency that helps keep this country safe, and that enforces laws they enact. So they'd rather abolish entire Federal law enforcement agency and abolish everything I just talked about than to do their job. ICE isn't making this up. ICE enforcing the laws they enacted. If they don't like it, then stand up and legislate. Do your job. But don't vilify the men and women that leave the safety of their home every day to defend this nation.",

I can talk about that later, but it's not about getting to the truth, Mark, it's about making speeches, attacking myself and the President, the men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol, and not letting you respond.

But a lot of times, the Democrats inside of the House, they want a different set of rules for those who are here illegally.  So it's okay for them to violate the laws? Don't detain them.

They say sanctuary cities are important because they want victims and witnesses of crime to be not be afraid to approach law enforcement. But the truth is, all we want is access to the jail.

And they say, well, we want the victim and witnesses to come forward. I just explained that and what they are going to say is, you know, we're protecting the immigrant community. Wrong. When you release a criminal inmate from a county jail, they're going to go back into the very community in which they live and reoffend in that community. And we can see that just recently in Montgomery County, Maryland. Eight victims of rape, seven in the immigrant community. Tell me how you protected that immigrant community?  So when you release them back in the immigrant community, you put the immigrant community at greater risk of crime. And frankly, you put them at greater risk of ICE arrest, because we could get the bad guy into jail, we get the bad guy. But when you release them in the community, ICE has to go to the community and find them. And they're probably going to find others that weren't even on our radar. So tell me, one of these politician needs to explain to me how exactly you're protecting the immigrant community? And finally, I'll say this, I dare any politician to go to the immigrant community and ask them this one question. Would you rather have ICE in your community or a county jail? What do you think they're going to say? They're going to say, the county jail. In sanctuary cities, they put our officers at great risk. Rather than arresting a bad guy in the county jail where he is behind the bars. We know he doesn't have weapons, you're surrounded by law enforcement. Now, we've got to go knock on the door.

Well, if you're nullifying Federal law, who used to do that? The Confederacy used to nullify Federal law. They said, \"Look, we're a state. we can do what we want to.\" And they used to camouflage the States rights, so they said, \"We can nullify Federal law, too.\"  This has gone full circle, and so what the left has said is, \"We can nullify Federal law.\" And now, the left likes lots of Federal laws. They like centralized government and so forth. They don't really have their logic figured out. But this nullification is a huge issue from a constitutional perspective, as far as I'm concerned. And also, the President tried early on and the Department of Justice tried early on, to enforce Federal law in these sanctuary areas by withholding grant monies. And the Courts stepped in and said you couldn't do it, which was shocking. So now you're able to subsidize sanctuary cities.

How is it different when we get fingerprints back -- because when you get arrested, you get -- your fingerprints get run to NCIC, they bounce off against our database, so we get information -- okay, this persons in that jail, we've deported him before.

I said, I want D.O.J. to look at it -- is it a criminal violation to harbor and conceal? Why is it okay for a Sheriff to do it? Or a Mayor to do it? Or a Governor to do it?

For the last several years since Donald Trump has been President, all we've gotten on this immigration issue is propaganda from the media and the left. Propaganda horror stories. No matter how much you and others, not Mark Morgan, the President of the United States, are trying to press the facts and get it out to the American people, you are met with a narrative. You are were met with an ideological effort to shut you down. And the American people need to understand this is one of the important reasons that have you on this program. If the Democratic Party, and the so-called journalists, the left have their way, there'll be no border. There'll be no new wall, ICE will be abolished or transitioned into something that is useless. The Border Patrol will be up to its highs in baby formula and diapers, and this society, and this country will be gravely endangered. This is a hugely important issue. And the media are part of the problem. The media are pushing this propaganda. This is why what you're doing is so important with the President of the United States who is really up against it. This is why Congress won't give him the funding flat out to do a wall when Congress supported it 10 to 12 years ago, the same Congress, the same Democrats supported it 10 or 12 years ago; they're denying it here. They denied there were caravans coming up to the border when the President of the United States said there was. They denied it was he human crisis, remember, it's a manufactured crisis. They never have to eat those words apparently, when the President said it's not a manufactured crisis. The President said, \"I'm going to move funds out of these other budgets, I have the statutory legal authority do it as other Presidents have.\" Then they call him an unconstitutional dictator who is out to get minorities and who is a racist. I just hope the American people, with your help and the help of others and the help of the President understand exactly what's going on in this country.

There's three major branches within ICE You have HSI -- Homeland Security Investigations that do criminal investigations enforcing to work 400 criminal statutes.

They want to abolish an agency that rescued hundreds of women from sex trafficking. They want to abolish the agency that saved thousands of children from child predators and sex traffickers. They want to abolish an agency that seized enough opioids in this country in one year to kill every man, woman, and child in this country twice -- not once, twice. They want to abolish an agency that's the number one participant with the F.B.I. and Joint Terrorism Task Force who do a lot of terrorism investigations. They want to abolish the agency that does gun trafficking investigations, narcotics investigations, doing investigation where our technology is smuggled overseas, such as missile technology that can be used in our war fighters. They want to abolish an agency that has a Civil Rights division, we have removed hundreds of Nazis from the United States over the years and sending them back to face trial. We remove Civil Rights violators that are wanted by their countries all over the world -- we do this every year. They want to abolish an agency that arrested 127,000 criminal aliens last year. Not just illegal aliens, these are illegal aliens that committed a bad act for getting here, a criminal violation. They want to abolish an agency that 90 percent of every alien they arrest either has a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges that means, it's filed in a county jail. They want to abolish an agency that helps keep this country safe, and that enforces laws they enact. So they'd rather abolish entire Federal law enforcement agency and abolish everything I just talked about than to do their job. ICE isn't making this up. ICE enforcing the laws they enacted.

I can talk about that later, but it's not about getting to the truth, Mark, it's about making speeches, attacking myself and the President, the men and women of ICE and the Border Patrol, and not letting you respond. They attack you for five minutes, then I want to respond, they won't let me respond because they got their soundbite. That's what it's all about. It's not about transparency. It's not about truth.

It is a crime to enter the United States illegally and it's not okay. So when I first became ICE Director, I testified and I said -- they said, \"Well, you're stalking fear in the immigrant community.\" I said, \"If you're in this country illegally, if you chose to violate the laws of this country and enter this country illegally, you're not supposed to be comfortable. It is not okay. So you should be worried that someone is looking for you.\" That's the way it's supposed to be. I thought that's why Congress enact the laws, so there's consequences to deter this, to violating these laws. But a lot of times, the Democrats inside of the House, they want a different set of rules for those who are here illegally. So it's okay for them to violate the laws? Don't detain them. It's okay then to smuggle children, don't arrest them. And you've got governors and mayors now, especially Gavin Newsom of California, who got someone convicted of a crime and they're parking them because they are a resident and when they get a serious criminal conviction, they can be deported.

It is not even a sanctuary for illegal aliens who are in that city that has committed a crime. And let me explain why. They say sanctuary cities are important because they want victims and witnesses of crime to be not be afraid to approach law enforcement. But the truth is, all we want is access to the jail.

And they say, well, we want the victim and witnesses to come forward. I just explained that and what they are going to say is, you know, we're protecting the immigrant community. Wrong. When you release a criminal inmate from a county jail, they're going to go back into the very community in which they live and reoffend in that community. And we can see that just recently in Montgomery County, Maryland. Eight victims of rape, seven in the immigrant community. Tell me how you protected that immigrant community? So when you release them back in the immigrant community, you put the immigrant community at greater risk of crime. And frankly, you put them at greater risk of ICE arrest, because we could get the bad guy into jail, we get the bad guy. But when you release them in the community, ICE has to go to the community and find them. And they're probably going to find others that weren't even on our radar. So tell me, one of these politician needs to explain to me how exactly you're protecting the immigrant community? And finally, I'll say this, I dare any politician to go to the immigrant community and ask them this one question. Would you rather have ICE in your community or a county jail? What do you think they're going to say? They're going to say, the county jail. In sanctuary cities, they put our officers at great risk. Rather than arresting a bad guy in the county jail where he is behind the bars. We know he doesn't have weapons, you're surrounded by law enforcement. Now, we've got to go knock on the door. I'm telling you, it's a matter of time for one of the men and women of ICE do not go home, because they were put in a position they shouldn't have to be put in."

The left promotes them. That's odd -- sanctuary cities. Sanctuary cities, if you believe in that, you're basically nullifying Federal law, right? Well, if you're nullifying Federal law, who used to do that? The Confederacy used to nullify Federal law. They said, \"Look, we're a state. we can do what we want to.\" And they used to camouflage the States rights, so they said, \"We can nullify Federal law, too.\" This has gone full circle, and so what the left has said is, \"We can nullify Federal law.\" And now, the left likes lots of Federal laws. They like centralized government and so forth. They don't really have their logic figured out. But this nullification is a huge issue from a constitutional perspective, as far as I'm concerned. And also, the President tried early on and the Department of Justice tried early on, to enforce Federal law in these sanctuary areas by withholding grant monies. And the Courts stepped in and said you couldn't do it, which was shocking. So now you're able to subsidize sanctuary cities. The Federal government should be able to withhold funds from communities that are run by these leftists who are harming their communities, who are violating Federal law. They should be able to withhold Federal funds like they would from a contract or anybody else."

It's just not nullifying. I think they're violating law. Let me explain why. When I was a Special Agent, I arrested U.S. citizens for harboring and concealing an illegal alien in their home. I've arrested business owners for harboring and concealing an illegal alien in their place of business. How is it different when we get fingerprints back -- because when you get arrested, you get -- your fingerprints get run to NCIC, they bounce off against our database, so we get information -- okay, this persons in that jail, we've deported him before. So we send a detainer. If we don't get access to the jail when we have probable cause somebody who is here in violation of Federal laws there, how is that not harboring and concealing? So I think D.O.J. needs look at that. When I first mentioned this, people said, \"Oh, HOMAN: wants to arrest politicians for sanctuary cities.\" That's not what I said. I said, I want D.O.J. to look at it -- is it a criminal violation to harbor and conceal? Why is it okay for a Sheriff to do it? Or a Mayor to do it? Or a Governor to do it? But not okay for you and I to do it? That's what I want D.O.J. to look at."

But I tried to say what's inhumane is -- it's not what the government did. The government takes pretty good care of these children in licensed facilities. What he didn't want to talk about was the 14,000 children that were in the custody of the government that were smuggled by criminal organizations because their parents chose to hire a criminal organization to put them in a truck or a tractor or at the back of a tractor trailer.

And let's go toe-to-toe, but she won't. I'll tell you why. For the last several years since Donald Trump has been President, all we've gotten on this immigration issue is propaganda from the media and the left. Propaganda horror stories. No matter how much you and others, not Mark Morgan, the President of the United States, are trying to press the facts and get it out to the American people, you are met with a narrative. You are were met with an ideological effort to shut you down. And the American people need to understand this is one of the important reasons that have you on this program. If the Democratic Party, and the so-called journalists, the left have their way, there'll be no border. There'll be no new wall, ICE will be abolished or transitioned into something that is useless. The Border Patrol will be up to its highs in baby formula and diapers, and this society, and this country will be gravely endangered. This is a hugely important issue. And the media are part of the problem. The media are pushing this propaganda. This is why what you're doing is so important with the President of the United States who is really up against it. This is why Congress won't give him the funding flat out to do a wall when Congress supported it 10 to 12 years ago, the same Congress, the same Democrats supported it 10 or 12 years ago; they're denying it here. They denied there were caravans coming up to the border when the President of the United States said there was. They denied it was he human crisis, remember, it's a manufactured crisis. They never have to eat those words apparently, when the President said it's not a manufactured crisis. The President said, \"I'm going to move funds out of these other budgets, I have the statutory legal authority do it as other Presidents have.\" Then they call him an unconstitutional dictator who is out to get minorities and who is a racist. I just hope the American people, with your help and the help of others and the help of the President understand exactly what's going on in this country.

But I've got to tell you, no President has done more in my lifetime than this President on trying to secure this border and protecting America. He supports law enforcement. I know he wrote a series of executive actions when he became President. He could have done it in one simple sentence, \"You will now enforce the laws on the books.\" Which we weren't allowed to do in the past eight years. I came back from retirement to work for this President because I heard his speech in Arizona on immigration. I listened to it for 45 minutes and he was right on every point he made. He gets it. He understands it. You know why? Because this President takes the time to talk to the experts on the border, people like myself, who has done this for decades. He listened to us. He's built -- you know, and he is delivering on those promises. Again, 56 percent drop in most recent illegal border crossings because of this President, and only this President. He has got one -- Democrat leadership has not offered up one stick of help other than throw out more enticements to try and undermine what he is doing, and he is still succeeding.
