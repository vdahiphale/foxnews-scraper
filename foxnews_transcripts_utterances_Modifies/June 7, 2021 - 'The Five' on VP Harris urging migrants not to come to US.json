Because how could her saying what she said to Guatemala be construed any differently because if anybody had said that six months ago or eight months ago, because she viewed it through the filter of race, they would be racist. If you had a strong, forceful position on the border which most Republicans do, then you were a bad person, you were racist. So now she gets into power and she sounds like a Republican. She should actually be denouncing herself for her cold, cold stance towards the people down south. And it shows you how -- it also shows you how the media response. And so now if you criticize Kamala about her job, she says she's not up to the job then you are again, racist or you're sexist.

In terms of what's going on now, the disorder and the dysfunction at the border I think that is lamentable and I do put the responsibility for that on the Biden administration. I think that President Trump was harsh, he was a bully, he took the Mexican president Lopez Obrador, and kind of slapped them around and said we're going to put tariffs on you if you don't use the Mexican army to intervene and intercede and stop these folks from taking the 2,000-mile trek across Mexico to get to our southern border. Biden's message was much more bushy. You know, come, come, it's great. You know, immigration. You know, what I said to start my little segment here, immigration is good.

If you had a strong, forceful position on the border which most Republicans do, then you were a bad person, you were racist. So now she gets into power and she sounds like a Republican. She should actually be denouncing herself for her cold, cold stance towards the people down south. And it shows you how -- it also shows you how the media response. And so now if you criticize Kamala about her job, she says she's not up to the job then you are again, racist or you're sexist.

Look at all the help wanted signs, there's an unmistakable poll or you stay there you get two bucks a day, come here you get 20 bucks an hour. You know, so. In terms of what's going on now, the disorder and the dysfunction at the border I think that is lamentable and I do put the responsibility for that on the Biden administration. I think that President Trump was harsh, he was a bully, he took the Mexican president Lopez Obrador, and kind of slapped them around and said we're going to put tariffs on you if you don't use the Mexican army to intervene and intercede and stop these folks from taking the 2,000-mile trek across Mexico to get to our southern border. Biden's message was much more bushy. You know, come, come, it's great. You know, immigration. You know, what I said to start my little segment here, immigration is good.

So, visiting the border where there are a number of American citizens affected by this crisis is now some kind of grand gesture, it's nice that the vice president is in Guatemala to figure out what the root causes of this, whatever they want to come up with to make an excuse for their own policy positions. You can talk a lot but if you don't have policy positions to back up and stop the flow coming north, nothing is going to change. And she talks about Republican criticism. It's not just Republicans, it's border state Democrats, like Henry Cuellar, for example, who's the one who first gave us all those photos in at crowded facilities, the ICE facilities, saying you need to do something about this. Just had the mayor of McAllen, Texas, a Republican win in that city when Hillary Clinton won that city by 40 percent. It's an 85 percent Hispanic population there. And this idea that they keep staying, well, on one hand we don't want you to come but on the other hand, as the president of Mexico -- of Guatemala said, you know, your policy is saying if you let kids stay and families and parents stay, then people are going to continue, the coyotes are going to benefit from that. That's a square peg in a round hole. On one hand you can't say don't come but then our policies enable that.

I think it's very, very troubling. I was a fellow at Yale, Calhoun College named after Senator John C. Calhoun from, you know, the early 19th century who was a racist, apparently. John Kennedy said he was one of the great senators ever. But they rediscovered that he was a racist a few years ago. And so, they changed the name of Calhoun College where I was a Calhoun fellow. And you know, I quit. I quit because it was so gratuitous. It was so -- they were so politically correct. And to launch this person, and then attempt to cover it up -- it's never the crime. It's always the cover-up. They got -- they got -- and I say that I have a beautiful third-year law student at Yale, my daughter. I'm very proud of the association, but this woman is nuts."

And the goal, without question, is to create a race war. This language isn't about uniting a country, it's about splitting it and making sure that it ends violently. Can you imagine having her as -- you know, she has patients. She actually has. Could you imagine if she was your analyst, because she's actually talking about her white patients publicly. And she was not using their names, but lumping them in and describing them as guilt-ridden, bred rejecting freaks, which is when you -- when you generically apply like a certain kind of identity to a group that's negative, that's racist. She was basically demeaning all of her white patients. Imagine how quickly a white MD would be disbarred if he had politically -- publicly, I'm sorry, smeared his Black patients. If he got up there and says, you know, the problem with my Black patients, A, B, C, and D, that person would be a net would be naturally scorned. This backlash that she's experienced experiencing now isn't even a backlash. It's us talking about it while Yale covers it up. She confessed - - by the way, in this -- her defense about it being out of context. What she's trying to say is that she once I believe was a person so consumed with anger, and that she's confessing it now, she's (AUDIO GAP) people so much. The context, the problem is she identifies a problem, but not the source. And her source is the obsession with race. The more people become obsessed with race, the more of this delusion and antipathy and hatred will spread and it's demonic. It's actually when you hear that, you feel the presence (AUDIO GAP) it's demonic."

It's called a field but it is obviously not a field. I am going to say, I think this is wrong. I think that the PGA could have updated its rules as long as all these other places have updated rules. In fact, even here in New York, the mask rules, all the rules in terms of being open, everything is 100 percent capacity, everything can be back. So, it doesn't make sense to me. Now, if that's the rule and he knew that that was the rule, and that was the risk, OK, I guess that is something. But they hit --- they hadn't had the test before. So, not only did he lose out on this tournament, but I think an additional one that's -- that he was potentially going to play in soon. So, he'll not be able to do that. Now, his statement was very mild. You know, he's -- he was very disappointed. I have to withdraw. I'm very thankful for my family. Thank you for the fans. Now, that's what he said publicly.
