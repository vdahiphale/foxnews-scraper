      "sentences": "Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is \"The Story.\" Great crises in the past have united our country. In World War II, the nation's most selfless generation gave up literally everything. To cross the oceans and fight for freedom against tyranny. After 9/11, we saw our flag and united with tears streaming down our faces while standing strong in the face of the attack, bonded in grief and swearing in the words of President Bush that the people who knock the buildings down will hear from all of us.  But today, there is a resistance to pulling together. The nation we are told is deeply divided so under attack by the virus as are so many nations right now. Why is the enemy each other? Or is it? Perhaps, we are still actually more united then we realize. Perhaps we are not small groups burning buildings and tearing down fences nor are we Derek or others who like who don't represent our values.  Let's go and take a look at some of the recent polls. A Gallup poll of adults in the country shows that just 15 percent support abolishing police and this one from Reuters shows only 18 percent strongly support defunding them. There are some supports in the other groups as well.  And as monuments and statues continue to be targeted, 73 percent of Americans say that Washington and Jefferson Memorial should absolutely stay up. That's same point shows that a strong majority of Americans see our nation's founders as heroes not villains. Another fierce battle in this country right now whether to go back to the clash on the September as students have done through every major crisis since our inception and it turns out that that is still what most people want. According to Fox News polling only 25 percent of Americans feel that school should be fully remote in September.  And a national AP poll shows 68 percent want schools open in September with adjustment for safety. In this regard there is also agreement in the middle of the COVID-19 virus as the numbers rise in new states only 20 percent of Americans say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the United States according to Gallup and who complain them in the current moment. So on the day of John Lewis's funeral he left this message to the nation not about division, but about what unites us as people. Saying this as he left the world with more hope about the next chapter.  \"Millions of people motivated simply by human compassion lay down the burdens of division around the country and the world as you set aside race, class, age, language and nationality to demand respect for human dignity\".   So with 95 days to go, America gets ready to choose its leader for the next four years, the language of politics continues to be harsh. What drive us most Americans are day to day are more simple fairness, justice and education. Tonight, we're joined by Former Congressman and Fox News Contributor Trey Gowdy, Susan Eisenhower CEO of the Eisenhower Group and Grand Daughter of President Dwight Eisenhower she is also the author of the new book \"How Ike Led\" and Juan Williams Fox News Analyst and Co-Host of the Five. Good to have all of you with us tonight. So Juan let me start with you when you peel back some of these numbers and you dig into these polls, we all get sort of I think inundated with this message that we are so far apart and yet there are a lot of indicators that on a lot of big issues we are close together.",

So that doesn't help us to see how much we do have in common as Americans? I think also, it's demographic and we have a large cohort of now older Americans over 65 and we have a large cohort who is even under 18. About 35 under, those are the two biggest groups now in American society and they are very different in terms of makeup. So that also can contribute to people pointing fingers and then I would add I think at the moment when I look to Washington and when I look to the President I think he practices politics, based politics he plays to is base it's not about reaching out to the middle or certainly not across the aisle.",

So even when their best intentions they're not going to be able to go back to a job because it disappeared and they listen to what they're hearing from politicians and I think many of the things - let me out there and I can figure out a quick a compromise on this thing and it's not that hard to give people little bit to get through the next month but not something that's not - that has no ending.",

So I do think people are willing to compromise and find commonality but not in the politics and in part of that is redistricting and part of that is the fact that politics in fact it's just government now but it is also sporting events and you mentioned when to start school whether or not to have in person school it's award shows.

Do you think China is a major threat, minor threat or not a threat to the United States? If you combine major and minor you've got 91 percent of Americans who think that this is a big threat that faces us.   And I wonder if historians will look back at this moment when we are so consumed with the virus and say that oh, that was a moment when a lot of things were happening and the game was changing when it came to China and we took our eye off the ball.",

So, to me, I like that poll that you had at the end there Martha where you're talking about the number of Americans who think you know things are not going in the right direction. There's another point where across the aisle people agree.  It's just troubling to me that with more people don't say hey, let's talk. Let's have conversation. I don't agree with you, but I would like to hear what you are saying. I think compromise is now been put down by a lot of people and compromise used to be the art of politics.

I watched today he was at the Red Cross talking with Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and they were talking about a nationwide push. There are 2 million people in this country who have recovered from COVID to collect plasma that can be used for treatment.   It was a tone that I think that we have seen over the past ten days or so that signals that I think the President is trying to change the way that he is perceived in this.

What it sounds to me is that the teacher's union, which, let's face it is filled with activists who have invested interest in kids not getting back to school because then the economy can't get going because the parents can't go to work. They are hyping the fear instead of helping find solutions. We know that they are adding more to the demands, it's not just that they're asking for safety measures, now they're saying we're not going back unless you solve gun control, unless you give welfare to illegal immigrants. There's all kinds of things they're adding to this, the universal healthcare. These are things that don't have anything to do with whether our kids can go back to school. And I might add, our children are four times more likely to be at risk of getting the flu than they are of COVID. So, the risk is for the teachers, that's the real fear, that's a real concern.

There will never be an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C. as long as I'm your president. If they try, they will be met with serious force. Twitter safety message on that. We've placed a public interest notice on this tweet for violating our policy against abusive behavior specifically the presence of a threat of harm against an identifiable group.

And so, what happen, what Twitter is doing is that they're insulting everybody who uses their products by saying, you know what, you can't handle this. This could hurt you forever. I will say this. That if genocide -- if advocating genocide is political commentary, then what about a single murder? What about a murderous threat on Twitter? If I had threatened to murder somebody, is that political commentary because genocide is advocating mass multiple murders. I will add though, I credit Trump and Ayatollah r because at least their names are on the tweets. The biggest problem with Twitter is that it's the world's biggest bathroom wall.",

      "utterance": "Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum in New York and this is \"The Story.\" Great crises in the past have united our country. In World War II, the nation's most selfless generation gave up literally everything. To cross the oceans and fight for freedom against tyranny. After 9/11, we saw our flag and united with tears streaming down our faces while standing strong in the face of the attack, bonded in grief and swearing in the words of President Bush that the people who knock the buildings down will hear from all of us. But today, there is a resistance to pulling together. The nation we are told is deeply divided so under attack by the virus as are so many nations right now. Why is the enemy each other? Or is it? Perhaps, we are still actually more united then we realize. Perhaps we are not small groups burning buildings and tearing down fences nor are we Derek or others who like who don't represent our values. Let's go and take a look at some of the recent polls. A Gallup poll of adults in the country shows that just 15 percent support abolishing police and this one from Reuters shows only 18 percent strongly support defunding them. There are some supports in the other groups as well. And as monuments and statues continue to be targeted, 73 percent of Americans say that Washington and Jefferson Memorial should absolutely stay up. That's same point shows that a strong majority of Americans see our nation's founders as heroes not villains. Another fierce battle in this country right now whether to go back to the clash on the September as students have done through every major crisis since our inception and it turns out that that is still what most people want. According to Fox News polling only 25 percent of Americans feel that school should be fully remote in September. And a national AP poll shows 68 percent want schools open in September with adjustment for safety. In this regard there is also agreement in the middle of the COVID-19 virus as the numbers rise in new states only 20 percent of Americans say they are satisfied with the way things are going in the United States according to Gallup and who complain them in the current moment. So on the day of John Lewis's funeral he left this message to the nation not about division, but about what unites us as people. Saying this as he left the world with more hope about the next chapter. \"Millions of people motivated simply by human compassion lay down the burdens of division around the country and the world as you set aside race, class, age, language and nationality to demand respect for human dignity\". So with 95 days to go, America gets ready to choose its leader for the next four years, the language of politics continues to be harsh. What drive us most Americans are day to day are more simple fairness, justice and education. Tonight, we're joined by Former Congressman and Fox News Contributor Trey Gowdy, Susan Eisenhower CEO of the Eisenhower Group and Grand Daughter of President Dwight Eisenhower she is also the author of the new book \"How Ike Led\" and Juan Williams Fox News Analyst and Co-Host of the Five. Good to have all of you with us tonight. So Juan let me start with you when you peel back some of these numbers and you dig into these polls, we all get sort of I think inundated with this message that we are so far apart and yet there are a lot of indicators that on a lot of big issues we are close together."

So that doesn't help us to see how much we do have in common as Americans? I think also, it's demographic and we have a large cohort of now older Americans over 65 and we have a large cohort who is even under 18. About 35 under, those are the two biggest groups now in American society and they are very different in terms of makeup. So that also can contribute to people pointing fingers and then I would add I think at the moment when I look to Washington and when I look to the President I think he practices politics, based politics he plays to is base it's not about reaching out to the middle or certainly not across the aisle."

The large majority of Americans who agree on the goals could probably be brought into the debate to a much further extent. I think that big middle is wondering what is the plan and how are we going to meet these goals and I think both sides have probably not in any way satisfied that group."

And I think most people look at this situation and say well, you know you've got more than 30 million people at work in the country and some of the businesses that they work for are just not there anymore. So even when their best intentions they're not going to be able to go back to a job because it disappeared and they listen to what they're hearing from politicians and I think many of the things - let me out there and I can figure out a quick a compromise on this thing and it's not that hard to give people little bit to get through the next month but not something that's not - that has no ending."

Because of the redistricting so if you're the nominee you're going to win in the overwhelming majority in the House District 41 out of 50, 41 out of 50 states have either two Republican Senators or two Democrat Senators. So I do think people are willing to compromise and find commonality but not in the politics and in part of that is redistricting and part of that is the fact that politics in fact it's just government now but it is also sporting events and you mentioned when to start school whether or not to have in person school it's award shows.

Let's roll up our sleeves and come on, America, you're stronger than this. Let's do the things that make us American. And I wonder where that sort of rational voice is right now.

Do you think China is a major threat, minor threat or not a threat to the United States? If you combine major and minor you've got 91 percent of Americans who think that this is a big threat that faces us. And I wonder if historians will look back at this moment when we are so consumed with the virus and say that oh, that was a moment when a lot of things were happening and the game was changing when it came to China and we took our eye off the ball."

So, to me, I like that poll that you had at the end there Martha where you're talking about the number of Americans who think you know things are not going in the right direction. There's another point where across the aisle people agree. It's just troubling to me that with more people don't say hey, let's talk. Let's have conversation. I don't agree with you, but I would like to hear what you are saying. I think compromise is now been put down by a lot of people and compromise used to be the art of politics.

I watched today he was at the Red Cross talking with Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx and they were talking about a nationwide push. There are 2 million people in this country who have recovered from COVID to collect plasma that can be used for treatment. It was a tone that I think that we have seen over the past ten days or so that signals that I think the President is trying to change the way that he is perceived in this. Of course, he would say that he's done a fantastic job on all of this and we know that we hear them say that all the time. But with regard to the tone recently, do you think it's changing?"

There are a lot of people hurting out there and I would just say on the point about getting to know Democrats or Republicans, frankly, it is so much more interesting to engage people in different views. It's kind of boring to hang out with the same people all the time. So, I think there is really a challenge that we can make and I'm up here at the moment in Maine and I can tell you this.

League officials heard complaints from American coaches that Chinese coaches at the facility were physically abusing young players and denying them the education that they were promised. One employee described the situation as \"World War II Germany\". Another former coach described watching a Chinese coach fire a ball into young players face at point-blank range and then kick him in the gut. Others said they were basically working for the Chinese government. So far no comment from Lebron James one of the most unspoken athletes on social justice issues and that has not gone unnoticed on social media where people are asking what his thoughts are? But the NBA which has been scrambling to justify their deep business alliances in China where they make upwards to $500 million a year now says that it is reevaluating and considering other opportunities for the academy program as typical forward social justice pastor appears to fall short where China is involved.

I understand that NBA has deep financial ties to China, but you have to ask at some point, what's wrong with the NBA? I mean, how many crimes will they turn a blind eye to whether it is child abuse or ethnic cleansing or cracking down on Hong Kong? I mean, for those of us who grew up watching the epic battles of Michael Jordan and Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and then watch them put on the red, white, and blue for the dream team in 1992.

The NBA is probably a unique among American businesses and the leverage it has over the Chinese Communist Party. They are not like our farmers or oil producers whose products can be bought from other countries. There's only one NBA and hundreds of millions of Chinese are rabid fans. The NBA could take a strong stance here and called the Chinese Communist Party's bluff. And ask them to stop these horrific practices yet unfortunately too many of its stars and executives seem to be more concerned about making a few more bucks in a communist country then standing up for a basic human liberty and dignity."

Unfortunately, China is changing capitalism and not only in China as we see from the NBA's behavior - the NBA portrays itself as the most politically and socially progressive of our professional sports leagues and you can wear slogans on your jerseys that are approved by the NBA but you can't wear free Hong Kong.

What it sounds to me is that the teacher's union, which, let's face it is filled with activists who have invested interest in kids not getting back to school because then the economy can't get going because the parents can't go to work. They are hyping the fear instead of helping find solutions. We know that they are adding more to the demands, it's not just that they're asking for safety measures, now they're saying we're not going back unless you solve gun control, unless you give welfare to illegal immigrants. There's all kinds of things they're adding to this, the universal healthcare. These are things that don't have anything to do with whether our kids can go back to school. And I might add, our children are four times more likely to be at risk of getting the flu than they are of COVID. So, the risk is for the teachers, that's the real fear, that's a real concern. We can solve that. We can innovate around that.

Greg, thank you for being here this evening. I just want to put up an example of Twitter safety. This is what they did to Trump's tweet. He tweeted -- this is just one example. There will never be an autonomous zone in Washington, D.C. as long as I'm your president. If they try, they will be met with serious force. Twitter safety message on that. We've placed a public interest notice on this tweet for violating our policy against abusive behavior specifically the presence of a threat of harm against an identifiable group.

So that it's left the physical realm, it's actually even left the kind of like the psychological torture realm into just something that you may or may not agree with. And so, what happen, what Twitter is doing is that they're insulting everybody who uses their products by saying, you know what, you can't handle this. This could hurt you forever. I will say this. That if genocide -- if advocating genocide is political commentary, then what about a single murder? What about a murderous threat on Twitter? If I had threatened to murder somebody, is that political commentary because genocide is advocating mass multiple murders. I will add though, I credit Trump and Ayatollah r because at least their names are on the tweets. The biggest problem with Twitter is that it's the world's biggest bathroom wall."

Joining me now, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine. Jim, great to have you back on the program. This is very exciting. Tell us what you're looking for up there and what everybody should know about the potential of this mission."

      "speaker": "JIM BRIDENSTINE, ADMINISTRATOR, NASA",

We are in fact looking for ancient life on Mars and we're doing it in a location where we know three billion years ago there used to be a river and a big lake bed in a crater. The crater is about the size of lake Tahoe, for example, and yes, we're looking for signs of ancient life but we're doing two other things that I think are also stunning. Number one, we're going to fly a helicopter on Mars for the first time in human history and we're going to prove that we can turn the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Mars into, no kidding, oxygen for life support, air to breathe. President Trump has given us agenda. Our agenda is to take humans to Mars and to put an American flag on Mars. And in order to do that we have to be able to breathe. So, we're turning the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Mars into oxygen."

And of course, the entire rover is robotic. So, we send it signals. Those signals get downloaded. The computer then autonomously has the robot do various things but as far as finding life, we use something called spectroscopy. We're going to be sending light signals into the soil, the sediment and then when that light reflects back, some of it gets reflected, some of it gets absorbed and based on what gets reflected we're able to tell what the chemical composition of the soil is. And based upon that chemical composition we'll be able to determine whether or not there was a past life there."

So, we have to do some retro firing of the rockets then we have to use the atmosphere of Mars with a heat shield to ultimately arrow break, if you will, then we have supersonic parachutes. We have some more rockets as it descends to the surface of Mars and then a sky crane lowers it. It's all autonomous, it's very difficult, the atmosphere of Mars is very thin, it's 1/100th of the atmosphere of earth. But look, we can do it. This is the United States of America.
