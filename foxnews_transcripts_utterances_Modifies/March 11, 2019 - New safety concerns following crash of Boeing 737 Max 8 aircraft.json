Killing everyone on board. Good evening, everybody. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" Tonight, devastated loved ones mourning the loss of 157 lives on board Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which crashed shortly after takeoff on Sunday the circumstances of that crash eerily similar to the crash of Lion Air 610 which happened last October in Indonesia.  Both planes, brand-new models of the 737 MAX 8 which features larger engines than their predecessor aimed at increasing fuel efficiency. But with that change came controversy, over other changes made to accommodate those larger engines and whether Boeing was transparent enough with the pilots and the airlines who fly those planes.  Tonight, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has called in the FAA to ground all 737 MAX 8, despite Boeing's insistence that they are still safe in the skies. Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast newsroom with what we know tonight. Trace.",

      "sentences": "And Sandra, investigators say it's too early to make any connection between yesterday's Ethiopian Air crash and the Lion Air crash back in October that killed 189 people, but there are certainly parallels. Both aircraft were identical. The pilots of both flights tried to make it back to the airport but were unable, and both had drastic speed fluctuations during the same phase of their flights which was the initial ascent. The Lion Air crash investigation is ongoing, but a primary focus is the plane's automatic system to make sure it does not stall. And here is the deal. When Boeing redesigned the 737 to create the MAX 8, it changed the position of the engines. Therefore, changing the balance of the airplane.  So, to make sure the nose of the plane never got too high which could lead to a stall, engineers added a system that automatically brings down the nose. But during a faulty sensor reading which apparently happened aboard Lion Air, the automatic system can bring the nose down too much and put the plane into a dive. To pull the plane back up, pilots would have to disable the system. But Boeing didn't include the fix in its operating manual. So, the pilots were likely unfamiliar with it. The FAA and Boeing later issued a directive saying, \"This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane.\"  And in yesterday's Ethiopian crash, several witnesses say, before the plane hit the ground, the pilot appeared to be struggling. Watch.   GADISA BENT, EYEWITNESS, ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PLANE CRASH (through translator): When it was hovering, the fire was coming from its tail, then it tried to lift its nose. But when it couldn't, it was leaning side to side. Finally, when it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up.",

But in this country, the FAA is allowing the planes to fly, and both Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, the biggest operators of the MAX 8, say they have full confidence in the 737 MAX 8s. The airlines are even responding on Twitter too nervous flyers, quoting here, \"Southwest has operated approximately 31,000 flights utilizing the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and we plan on operating those aircraft going forward. Even United Airlines which doesn't fly the MAX 8s, told its customers, if they don't want to fly the MAX 9, United will make alternate travel plans.  The Airline Pilots Association is also warning against jumping to any conclusions about the cause of yesterday's crash. But the American Airlines flight attendants' union issued a bulletin today, telling members they will not be forced to work on the 737 MAX 8.  We should note, the copilot of the Ethiopian Air flight that crashed yesterday was relatively inexperienced just a few hundred hours. But the captain had more than 8,000 flight hours.

I owned a helicopter for 14 years, and one of the rules we told our pilots if something is wrong with the aircraft in the air, you put the thing on the ground. I asked our audience right now. What are the odds that the same exact aircraft, five months apart, took off, went through this oscillating business, and then nosedive, killing everybody on board? 189 in October, 157 on Sunday. What's going on? I mean, you don't -- you don't experiment -- China has grounded all of these aircraft. India is about to. All these other nations are grounding their aircrafts. I understand that this is a big economic blow. I understand the 737 MAX 8 is the fastest selling aircraft in history. And as your expert just related, there over 5,000 orders pending. Lots of jobs. I get that.  But for God's sakes, this -- the odds on this occurring by chance -- random chance. The same exact thing to the same exact aircraft, I think it's so astronomical. I have high regard for the FAA, I think that among our -- among our federal agencies, they are amongst the most professional. I think they're very sound. I cannot for the life of me understand why everybody else outside the United States or most of them are grounding these aircraft until they find out what the hell is going on. And our FAA is saying, \"Wait, wait.  Let's see if something turns up, we'll let you know.\"   I don't -- I don't, Homie don't play that.

Killing everyone on board. Good evening, everybody. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" Tonight, devastated loved ones mourning the loss of 157 lives on board Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, which crashed shortly after takeoff on Sunday the circumstances of that crash eerily similar to the crash of Lion Air 610 which happened last October in Indonesia. Both planes, brand-new models of the 737 MAX 8 which features larger engines than their predecessor aimed at increasing fuel efficiency. But with that change came controversy, over other changes made to accommodate those larger engines and whether Boeing was transparent enough with the pilots and the airlines who fly those planes. Tonight, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has called in the FAA to ground all 737 MAX 8, despite Boeing's insistence that they are still safe in the skies. Trace Gallagher is live in our West Coast newsroom with what we know tonight. Trace."

      "utterance": "And Sandra, investigators say it's too early to make any connection between yesterday's Ethiopian Air crash and the Lion Air crash back in October that killed 189 people, but there are certainly parallels. Both aircraft were identical. The pilots of both flights tried to make it back to the airport but were unable, and both had drastic speed fluctuations during the same phase of their flights which was the initial ascent. The Lion Air crash investigation is ongoing, but a primary focus is the plane's automatic system to make sure it does not stall. And here is the deal. When Boeing redesigned the 737 to create the MAX 8, it changed the position of the engines. Therefore, changing the balance of the airplane. So, to make sure the nose of the plane never got too high which could lead to a stall, engineers added a system that automatically brings down the nose. But during a faulty sensor reading which apparently happened aboard Lion Air, the automatic system can bring the nose down too much and put the plane into a dive. To pull the plane back up, pilots would have to disable the system. But Boeing didn't include the fix in its operating manual. So, the pilots were likely unfamiliar with it. The FAA and Boeing later issued a directive saying, \"This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane.\" And in yesterday's Ethiopian crash, several witnesses say, before the plane hit the ground, the pilot appeared to be struggling. Watch."

The airlines are even responding on Twitter too nervous flyers, quoting here, \"Southwest has operated approximately 31,000 flights utilizing the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and we plan on operating those aircraft going forward. Even United Airlines which doesn't fly the MAX 8s, told its customers, if they don't want to fly the MAX 9, United will make alternate travel plans.  The Airline Pilots Association is also warning against jumping to any conclusions about the cause of yesterday's crash. But the American Airlines flight attendants' union issued a bulletin today, telling members they will not be forced to work on the 737 MAX 8. We should note, the copilot of the Ethiopian Air flight that crashed yesterday was relatively inexperienced just a few hundred hours. But the captain had more than 8,000 flight hours.

Now, the FAA has engineers on staff, the NTSB engineers on staff, Boeing's engineers.

What we did learn is that -- and this is according to New York Times were reporting that Boeing and the FAA decided pilots did not need to be informed about the change to the flight control system. If this was the problem, had they known they could have operated these planes differently?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, more training is always better than less training for pilots.  We have to understand how those systems work, and how to override those systems, and recognize that a system either may have failed or is behaving improperly. So, there can be a period of confusion if you have not received the proper training in that particular system. But really, the solution, if that occurs for a pilot, is to simply disconnect the system. Shut it down."

So, yes, I would watch for that airplane.\" So, based on what we are hearing tonight, do you foresee more airlines who are currently flying this aircraft in the United States to pull them down, at least, for now, while this investigation continues? Do you think they should go that route?"

I, personally, with my business staff have advised them, it is their choice if they choose not to fly on them for business travel, don't. But we left it as a personal choice. We really need the data, but thank goodness, they have recovered the flight data recorder, and even more importantly in this instance, the cockpit voice recorder.

I owned a helicopter for 14 years, and one of the rules we told our pilots if something is wrong with the aircraft in the air, you put the thing on the ground. I asked our audience right now. What are the odds that the same exact aircraft, five months apart, took off, went through this oscillating business, and then nosedive, killing everybody on board? 189 in October, 157 on Sunday. What's going on? I mean, you don't -- you don't experiment -- China has grounded all of these aircraft. India is about to. All these other nations are grounding their aircrafts. I understand that this is a big economic blow. I understand the 737 MAX 8 is the fastest selling aircraft in history. And as your expert just related, there over 5,000 orders pending. Lots of jobs. I get that. But for God's sakes, this -- the odds on this occurring by chance -- random chance. The same exact thing to the same exact aircraft, I think it's so astronomical. I have high regard for the FAA, I think that among our -- among our federal agencies, they are amongst the most professional. I think they're very sound. I cannot for the life of me understand why everybody else outside the United States or most of them are grounding these aircraft until they find out what the hell is going on. And our FAA is saying, \"Wait, wait.  Let's see if something turns up, we'll let you know.\" I don't -- I don't, Homie don't play that. I mean, that is not the way it seems to me a life-and-death issue like this, Sandra, should be decided."

That is absolutely bogus, that is worthless. It is so difficult to get a reservation and to get where you go. I live in Cleveland, there are limited flights out of Cleveland, you know, what am -- what am I going to do, how am I going to schedule if there's only this one 737 MAX 8 available on a Southwest flight going to Nashville, how am I going to reschedule? Am I going to go through Chicago, or go through New York? These airliners have to take responsibility, the FAA has to take responsibility, ground the damn plane until they figure out what's happening. This is not an ice cream cone, this is not a recall of -- you know, Swiss cheese. This is life and death. A same exact thing happens five months apart, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out that these events are related."

And her -- the idea with automation is that it could enable businesses to create even more jobs much like the tractor increased farming so we have more food and more people. Were able to do other things. With automation, you could have more jobs. That's -- I would hope that's what she would be thinking. But apparently, her thoughts go to people doing less. I think we had -- Harry Reid once talked about people doing cowboy poetry and those kinds of things by not having jobs, that it might be a good thing. It's not a good thing you.

They can't define either one. What we're talking about with capitalism is your ability to improve your life, to profit, to improve your life by reaching out and satisfying the needs of other people. When you run a business, you're trying to satisfy other people's needs.  When you're on this show, you're trying to satisfy the needs of viewers.  If you don't, they won't watch it's the same with Amazon that the Bezos created this incredible distribution system, better than any system in the world. Well, if we don't like it, we won't use it and it won't be this great system and he would have failed. So with capitalism, you succeed by reaching out to others. With socialism, you know, you reach inward. You're trying to get the most you can from a limited supply of goods or services the government makes available. You're in a food line. You're not thinking about the people in front of you or behind you, you're trying to get the most for yourself."

It also shows that voters who -- those voters would account for almost 40 percent of the 2020 electorate. This is Pew Research.

If you're not a Conservative when you're 40, you have no brain.  And you do see those numbers in that poll come down. They come down from about 61 percent approval down to about 27 percent when people are 65. The second thing is people -- kids have -- the kids -- Millennials have not -- they haven't gotten economics in high school. They haven't gotten civics, they haven't gotten American history, they haven't gotten anti- American history. They've gotten history from books that really teach America's history as a history of oppression not as a history of economic freedom and personal liberty.

Look, Ronald Reagan did more for working-class people than almost any president in our history. He got us out of a terrible, terrible recession. You got her -- and this is -- this is that this is a man who ended the Cold War. Now, somebody like AOC may not remember the Cold War but I grew up in it.  It was a terrible, terrible experience. Everybody thought that we would lose it. There'd be some you know, terrible devastation across the planet.  He put an end to that. He -- the economy recovered, working-class people recovered, our nation was never freer and our nation was never stronger.  And then when he left office with a 63 percent approval rating. So she's -- again, she's very -- you know, there's this video of her dancing. She's very good at that. I felt good after I saw the video. You felt uplifted after you saw it.

And new status reports in the cases against Rick Gates and Michael Flynn. Joining us now is Judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst. Let me start first with the Mueller report because it seems like we've been in this wait-and-see for a long time now. It could be any day.  It could it be in a week, month. What is the endgame here?"

Rick Gates who is Paul Manafort's former partner and turned evidence against him and was the principal witness against him as well as against many others, has yet to be sentenced. General Flynn was going to be sentenced back in December and the judge said, did the general commit treason? Of course, all hell broke loose, and he said I'll see you in March, bring a toothbrush. That's judge speaking for you might not be going home --"

Robert Stone will not only get a trial date, but the judge will decide whether or not by publish -- in my view, this gag order is profoundly unconstitutional but she impost it on him. Did he violated by writing a book, a book that he wrote and agreed to published before she imposed a gag order. So, she got a rule on that as well."

      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Well, he gets sentenced by the other judge in this case. This is the judge before whom he pleaded guilty. The judge who sentenced him last week, it was a jury conviction in Virginia. This is a judge Amy Berman Jackson before whom he pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Bob Mueller. Two-thirds of the way through the cooperation. Mueller's people came to court said he's not only not cooperating, he's lying. She said, how do I know he's lying. We'll prove it. She held a secret trial at the conclusion of which when they said there were five lies, three he lied and two he didn't. Therefore, any agreement he made with you is off. So, he is probably going to get the full 10 years from Judge Jackson. The question is will it be concurrent while he's serving the 47 months from the judge in Virginia, or consecutive? Will it not start until he finishes that? He's in very bad health. Ten years for Paul Manafort effectively a life sentence."

When you ask questions of a lawyer everybody knows of a defendant, everybody knows lawyers wrote the answer. But Bob Mueller obviously knows the case better than Congressman Schiff does and Bob Mueller has been a model prosecutor, and model decorum of the manner in which he has conducted himself in his office and this case. On the aggressive side the American public wants prosecutors to do their job. I'm going to suggest that he knows what he's doing."

There's such bitterness and divisiveness. Everybody wants it to be over. But her problem is not with people like me, her problem is with Democrats in her own party, the type of people you were discussing with Andy Puzder (Ph) a few minutes ago. They are furious that she said that, because they're hoping that something impeachable if it doesn't come out of the Mueller report will come out of the House oversight committee investigation or the House intelligence committee investigation or the House judiciary committee investigation. Those investigations can be public, whereas Mueller has things he cannot reveal."

Hillary Clinton didn't as well as the Democratic nominee in 20167. But you are seeing a more lively discussion around the issue which I think is an important thoughtful conversation to have. Julian Castro made a great point that we do compensate those who had their property taken away, and we should do something to address the systemic challenges facing people in this country who are descendants of slaves. I was reading Ta-Nehisi Coates case for reparations, and he makes the point that according to Pew Research, white households in this country are 20 percent richer than black households at the same income level. And the issue there is generational wealth. There is no backup system for African-American families in this country. They do not have homes passed down, they're facing far greater challenges. And that's why this is a conversation to be had and I think a task force is a wonderful idea."

We are seeing how well our economy is doing under President Trump with the roll back in taxes, and cuts in regulations is lifting all boats.

Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Julian Castro there, Bernie Sanders. I think that Julian Castro makes a great point, though, going after Bernie Sanders for his proclivity to write checks for everything else except for things focused on racial issues because he has struggled in the past with African-American voters. The argument that it is pandering will absolutely be made but that doesn't mean that it's not a conversation that people in the country want to have. That said, health care will be number one and if there is a litmus test, it's going to be Medicare for all, not your position on reparations."

At one time, you know, at one time I was a mayor and I was on a planning commission. The things that you can put in place now, the policies that you can put in place can save you so much in the future. I learned that and I recognize that. That's what we need to be aware of.

But there will be some cost associated with it and certainly we're not interested in any kind of carbon tax. I mean, make that clear. But at the same time, we can -- and we can actually benefit from this. It could actually end up helping us and helping our economy."

Former NFL player and pro-life advocate Benjamin Watson will join us next. GOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-VA. The infant would be resuscitated. If that's what the mother and the family desire. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Those comments you'll remember from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam setting off a firestorm earlier this year after his state became one of several to introduce bills that would protect abortion up to the point of birth in some cases. Now the state of Georgia is going to be the opposite extreme. Republican House lawmakers they are approving the heartbeat bill, which states, quote, \"No abortion is authorized or shall be performed if the unborn child has been determined to have a human heartbeat.\" Here now, Benjamin Watson, former NFL player and pro-life and human trafficking awareness advocate. He's also a father of five with two more on the way. Congratulations to you on that. You are going to be a busy man if aren't already."

      "utterance": "We knew this -- I mean, Governor Bryant camp he pledged during his campaign that he was -- he was going to put in place the toughest abortion laws in the country. He called himself an apologetic pro-life. Is this the direction that you would like to see states go in?"

    {
      "speaker": "WATSON",
      "utterance": "Well, of course. Of course. I think that what we are seeing now is both sides sort of ramping up in anticipating Supreme Court showdowns possibly in the future. But I think the biggest thing here is understanding that life begins at conception. And so, while we get excited and we should be upset, I was horrified by hearing what the governor of Virginia said about having an abortion while the baby is on the table. but that's the far end of the spectrum. We can't forget or miss that life starts at conception, that we need people to protect personhood that no matter what the stage of development or the environment that a person is in. Their life is worth protecting and we need people that stand for that, especially in a country that professes to be one that stands for liberty, and justice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I want to be clear here about this. That the bill it does make exceptions in the case of rape and incest, only if the woman files a police report, it also allows exceptions if the pregnancy places the mother's life at risk. So, there are those exceptions to this. But it seems to be garnering some support. Where do you think all of this is ultimately going to go? This is, this would be at about six weeks, by the way, that a fetus first will show signs of a heartbeat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATSON",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, the heartbeat actually starts in 18 days. Between 16 and 18 days. Before we can even detect it, these babies have a heartbeat. They have everything that they need in their DNA in their makeup to become humans that we see walking around. And so, again, I applaud this bill, but again, when you look at the 1973 Roe v. Wade, you look at the 60 million children that have been killed since then, this is just part of the issue. And so that decision made at the time was unjust and unconstitutional and we can argue about that. But I think that what is going to happen at some point, something is going to come to the Supreme Court and we are going to have to have a decision. But regardless, I think that right now we need to enter into this conversation with grace, we need to enter into it with compassion. Not simply trying to win and not simply trying to point at the other side and condemned the other side, but with the idea that we want to be people that stand for life and that we also want to have compassion for the man and the women that are going through these tough decisions on a daily basis."
