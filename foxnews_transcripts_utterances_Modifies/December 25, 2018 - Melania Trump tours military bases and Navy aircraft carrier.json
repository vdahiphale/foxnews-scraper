I'm looking forward to spending time with you and your families today.  When preparing for this stop, I learned that this base is more than 100 years old and has a long history of excellence. I also learned that the airmen and soldiers in this room are set up after natural disasters like Hurricane Michael and that many of you have recently returned home from deployment. I'm honored to be able to say welcome home and thank you for answering the call of duty. I have said this before, but it is worth repeating. We know that we are free because you are brave and I speak on behalf of my husband when I tell you, we are forever grateful for your service. I also want to take a moment to recognize the families of those who serve. We know that you often endure time apart, which also comes with a degree of uncertainty, and some of you are here today while your loved ones are far away. Frequent moves and deployments can be hard and that kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of incredible courage. Please know that your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated, and the president and I thank you for all that you do. After we leave here, we will be flying to the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier to visit with the crew on board. That stop will not only allow me to visit with more members of our military, but it will be very meaningful after the recent passing of President Bush. We continue to keep his family and our thoughts and prayers. I'm looking forward to the tour of the F-22 raptor, but before we get started, I want to let you all know that the president and I are so grateful and have unconditional appreciation for all that you do. This administration will always stand with the men and women of the United States armed forces and the families that support them. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of you.

An eight year old immigrant child died in US custody early Christmas morning. Felipe Gomez Alonso, a Guatemalan national was in New Mexico, having been apprehended with his family by Customs and Border Protection agents. Officials say the boy showed signs of illness on Christmas Eve and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a cold and fever. He was prescribed antibiotics and ibuprofen, then released. His symptoms worsened later in the evening and he was sent back to the hospital where he died shortly after midnight. This is the second time in the last month that an immigrant child has died in U.S. detention. Just yesterday, the body of the Guatemalan child who died in US custody earlier in the month was returned to her family members in Guatemala. Seven-year-old Jacqueline call died in early December following a high fever. An impromptu funeral was held at her grandmother's house, her father still in US custody, awaiting a January 3rd court date to determine his immigration status. Guatemala has asked the U.S. State Department to determine the cause of her death. President Donald Trump digging his heels in on Christmas Day, refusing to end the partial government shutdown. But a quarter of the federal government is currently unfunded, because Democrats refuse to include funding for the President's border wall in the stalled Appropriations Bill.

It was formed after the cataclysmic eruption in 1883, one of the most powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history. The volcano sits in the Sunda Strait, which separates the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. The death toll from a brutal attack in Kabul, Afghanistan rising now to at least 40 people on Monday.

I'm looking forward to spending time with you and your families today. When preparing for this stop, I learned that this base is more than 100 years old and has a long history of excellence. I also learned that the airmen and soldiers in this room are set up after natural disasters like Hurricane Michael and that many of you have recently returned home from deployment. I'm honored to be able to say welcome home and thank you for answering the call of duty. I have said this before, but it is worth repeating. We know that we are free because you are brave and I speak on behalf of my husband when I tell you, we are forever grateful for your service. I also want to take a moment to recognize the families of those who serve. We know that you often endure time apart, which also comes with a degree of uncertainty, and some of you are here today while your loved ones are far away. Frequent moves and deployments can be hard and that kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of incredible courage. Please know that your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated, and the president and I thank you for all that you do. After we leave here, we will be flying to the USS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier to visit with the crew on board. That stop will not only allow me to visit with more members of our military, but it will be very meaningful after the recent passing of President Bush. We continue to keep his family and our thoughts and prayers. I'm looking forward to the tour of the F-22 raptor, but before we get started, I want to let you all know that the president and I are so grateful and have unconditional appreciation for all that you do. This administration will always stand with the men and women of the United States armed forces and the families that support them. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all of you.

An eight year old immigrant child died in US custody early Christmas morning. Felipe Gomez Alonso, a Guatemalan national was in New Mexico, having been apprehended with his family by Customs and Border Protection agents. Officials say the boy showed signs of illness on Christmas Eve and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a cold and fever. He was prescribed antibiotics and ibuprofen, then released. His symptoms worsened later in the evening and he was sent back to the hospital where he died shortly after midnight. This is the second time in the last month that an immigrant child has died in U.S. detention. Just yesterday, the body of the Guatemalan child who died in US custody earlier in the month was returned to her family members in Guatemala. Seven-year-old Jacqueline call died in early December following a high fever. An impromptu funeral was held at her grandmother's house, her father still in US custody, awaiting a January 3rd court date to determine his immigration status. Guatemala has asked the U.S. State Department to determine the cause of her death. President Donald Trump digging his heels in on Christmas Day, refusing to end the partial government shutdown. But a quarter of the federal government is currently unfunded, because Democrats refuse to include funding for the President's border wall in the stalled Appropriations Bill.
