These are the additions to guns used in the Las Vegas shooting, not in the Florida shooting, to make it essentially, as the president said, a machine gun, an automatic weapon. The Justice Department -- there you see a picture of that. The Justice Department releasing a statement, \"The department understands this is a priority for the president and has acted quickly to move through the rule making process. We look forward to the results of that process as soon as its duly completed.\" We're understanding it's coming to an end.  This as the Washington Post and ABC has a new poll out after the school shooting in Florida that says doing enough to prevent mass shootings, Congress at 19 percent, the president avenue 29 percent. Clearly at least in the polls there is a lot of momentum to do more. Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief for The Weekly Standard; Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post; and Charles Hurt, opinion editor for The Washington Times. OK, it came as a bit of surprise today, didn't see it coming, the bump stock announcement. This rule, what do you think it means and what does it portend to the meetings ahead for this week?",

      "sentences": "I think it's hard to tell exactly what it means and where this broader debate is going. If you look back before the new year, Republicans in Congress had considered taking some measures like this legislatively and then opted not to. So I think the fact that the president stepped up suggests that there is consensus on the Republican side or at least strong agreement on the Republican side that this is something that ought to be looked at.   I think in terms of the broader debate, Democrats are, as they often do, complain about the NRA, complain about Republicans. The media is obsessed with the argument that Republicans are controlled by the NRA. But really the problem I think suggests if you're talking about an assault weapon ban or some of the more far-reaching efforts being discussed, the problem is really on the Democratic side. If you look back at the 2013 vote on the assault weapons ban, you had 15 Democrats who voted, including some blue state Democrats, who voted against the assault weapons ban. It was a 60-40 vote in a Senate that was controlled by Democrats. So Democrats at this point are the ones who are going to have to -- if they want to start to win politically on this issue, they're going to have to start primarying Democrats who are voting with Republicans.",

      "speaker": "CHARLES LANE, WASHINGTON POST",
      "sentences": "Yes, and I think to your original question, what does it mean, it raises the question of how substantial a rule it's really going to end up being because under the Obama administration it was thought within the ATF that there wasn't enough statutory authority to enact it by regulation which now President Trump is going to attempt to do. And that tells me that somewhere down the line somebody is going to sue over this if it's not actually enacted into law. So Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is calling for a statute, and I frankly don't understand why there shouldn't be a statute, unless maybe the only thing that's going on here is President Trump is feeling under pressure under gun control and he's got to do something really quickly. I think Steve makes a very astute point, though, about the Democrats. There is a dilemma for them politically. Right now there is a special election going on in western Pennsylvania, Trump country. And the Democratic candidate for that seat is running as a pro-gun western Pennsylvania Democrat. And in some of these red states, the Senate candidates on the Democratic side are torn as well. That is one of the reasons I'm very skeptical substantial gun-control will come out of this.",

Of course what is going on right now, any bump stocks that were on shelves after the Las Vegas shooting are flying off the shelves right now.
