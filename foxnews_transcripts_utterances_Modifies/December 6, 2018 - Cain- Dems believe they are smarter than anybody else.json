      "sentences": "I am Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington. With disgraced FBI director Jim Comey set to testify on the Hill tomorrow, there are specific questions that need to be asked and answered, namely why did Hillary aides Cheryl Mills and who Huma Abedin likely get away with lying to the FBI while Trump associates are prosecuted. Byron York has some answers. And while the resistance cheers, the Mueller probe may have inadvertently ensnared former Clinton and Obama aides. Professor Jonathan Turley will tell us why this is another sign that Mueller has overstepped his bounds.  Plus, we were led to believe that everything the government tells us about climate science is true, but what if those reports are being funded by billionaire activists? The man who investigated the latest climate report is here to tell us what's going on. Herman Cain and Raymond Arroyo are here as well. But first, the attack of the liberal killjoy's. That is the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Liberals are trying to tell us how to feel, how to celebrate, and if you can believe it, even how to pray during the holidays. A few decades back, they fought really hard against a campaign by Tipper Gore. Remember when she was lobbying for warning labels on music that had explicit content in the lyrics?  And let's face it. Whenever parents for instance raise concerns about the music industry's gross, explicit lyrics or over-sexualized scenes on T.V., well, liberals responded with, oh, just change the channel. But today, they have a current case of amnesia because they are now the new censors, and the offending content, Christmas songs.",

They are trying to disrupt and destroy traditions and replace them with their own version of some transitory nonsense. By seeing dark forces and even an innocent Christmas special, they divide us with the goal of ripping away yet another little innocuous thing that families have enjoyed for more than half a century.

Sally Quinn, who is a journalist, who in her memoir described hexing three people, two of whom died, and she's going to demand that Trump recite a religious creed at a public ceremony or judge him? Let there no judgment. But again, this is the problem with the left, depending on the politics of the moment they go from being libertines to puritans. The once aggressive seculars suddenly become religious enforcers. And these are the same people who by the way applauded when prayer was driven out of public schools and who cheered when manger scenes were pulled from the public square. For ever crowing about how we need separation of church and state, a phrase found nowhere in any of our founding documents. My friend, today's left is blissfully unaware of how much they become caricatures of what they accuse conservatives of being. They claim to be tolerant.   They are among the most rigid, intolerant people on the planet. They claim to be pro-choice. That only applies to abortion, maybe or gender. They claim to be for creative expression, but they are control freaks and monoliths. They really want to do is stifle and marginalize conservative voices whether they are on college campuses, in the workplace, in the U.S. military or yes, right here on cable T.V. And while they point the finger at Trump for being divisive, they are the ones working overtime to divide the country along lines of race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, just to name a few. But above all, liberals have become aggressively boring and no fun at all. And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now for reaction is attorney and RNC committeewoman from California, Harmeet Dhillon, Fox news contributor Raymond Arroyo, and CRO of DSPolitical Jennifer Holdsworth. First of all, I want everyone to know that this is a safe space here. You can -- we won't censor you like some of the liberals.   Raymond, I want to start with you.

With disgraced FBI director Jim Comey set to testify on the Hill tomorrow, there are specific questions that need to be asked and answered, namely why did Hillary aides Cheryl Mills and who Huma Abedin likely get away with lying to the FBI while Trump associates are prosecuted. Byron York has some answers. And while the resistance cheers, the Mueller probe may have inadvertently ensnared former Clinton and Obama aides. Professor Jonathan Turley will tell us why this is another sign that Mueller has overstepped his bounds. Plus, we were led to believe that everything the government tells us about climate science is true, but what if those reports are being funded by billionaire activists? The man who investigated the latest climate report is here to tell us what's going on. Herman Cain and Raymond Arroyo are here as well. But first, the attack of the liberal killjoy's. That is the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Liberals are trying to tell us how to feel, how to celebrate, and if you can believe it, even how to pray during the holidays. A few decades back, they fought really hard against a campaign by Tipper Gore. Remember when she was lobbying for warning labels on music that had explicit content in the lyrics? And let's face it. Whenever parents for instance raise concerns about the music industry's gross, explicit lyrics or over-sexualized scenes on T.V., well, liberals responded with, oh, just change the channel. But today, they have a current case of amnesia because they are now the new censors, and the offending content, Christmas songs."

By seeing dark forces and even an innocent Christmas special, they divide us with the goal of ripping away yet another little innocuous thing that families have enjoyed for more than half a century.

Sally Quinn, who is a journalist, who in her memoir described hexing three people, two of whom died, and she's going to demand that Trump recite a religious creed at a public ceremony or judge him? Let there no judgment. But again, this is the problem with the left, depending on the politics of the moment they go from being libertines to puritans. The once aggressive seculars suddenly become religious enforcers. And these are the same people who by the way applauded when prayer was driven out of public schools and who cheered when manger scenes were pulled from the public square. For ever crowing about how we need separation of church and state, a phrase found nowhere in any of our founding documents. My friend, today's left is blissfully unaware of how much they become caricatures of what they accuse conservatives of being. They claim to be tolerant. They are among the most rigid, intolerant people on the planet. They claim to be pro-choice. That only applies to abortion, maybe or gender. They claim to be for creative expression, but they are control freaks and monoliths. They really want to do is stifle and marginalize conservative voices whether they are on college campuses, in the workplace, in the U.S. military or yes, right here on cable T.V. And while they point the finger at Trump for being divisive, they are the ones working overtime to divide the country along lines of race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, just to name a few. But above all, liberals have become aggressively boring and no fun at all. And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now for reaction is attorney and RNC committeewoman from California, Harmeet Dhillon, Fox news contributor Raymond Arroyo, and CRO of DSPolitical Jennifer Holdsworth. First of all, I want everyone to know that this is a safe space here. You can -- we won't censor you like some of the liberals. Raymond, I want to start with you.

Now, the liberals want to make a big deal out of that that the man didn't read. Freedom of religion means, excuse me for getting a little passionate about this, also means freedom to not read if you don't want to. Now, Laura, the compilation that you put together last night was so impressive to me and my folk that I wanted to reproduce that clip on my website, hermancain.com. It demonstrates without a question of a doubt how hypocritical that the Democrats are, and it demonstrates clearly, better than anything that I have ever seen, that they do believe that they are smarter than everybody else. This is why they are trying to destroy and change our culture from top to bottom. That's what they are trying to do.

On his blog, he talks about quote, eliminating the president. On his blog, he talked about how he's concerned about the rise of religious extremism in the United States and in the Middle East, I guess equating guys like me with Al Qaeda and ISIS, which is, I don't know, a little kooky if you asked me.

I am a conservationist, so I want to conserve the beauty that we have. And we have to have business. That's where I come down. I'm not a scientist. I don't pretend to be one on TV. But it is interesting, going back to judging. In retrospect, we can see who is a pretty good prognosticator and who wasn't such a good prognosticator. So let's try this one. This is back in 1977. The was Barack Obama's future science czar John Holdren predicting that global warming could lead to the deaths of about 1 billion starving people by 2020. We have about 13 months left, so what happened? There is another recent prediction, by the way, that I have to get to. Al Gore, he proclaimed in 2006 in that \"Inconvenient Truth\" film that sea level would rise 20 feet, quote, in the near future. Was that just when he stepped into the Atlantic? Sorry. But according to scientists, sea level rose about three inches between 93 and 2017. Up next, we lost Chris on the satellite. This is live TV, it's what happens. Chris, we didn't do it on purpose. It was the climate. Lawsuit madness. A new federal complaint accusing the state of Rhode Island for failing to provide students with the skills they need. I'm going to talk to the lead lawyer in the case next."

Right now, CNN is airing taped programming due to the disruption. And, my friends, we are going to keep following this in this segment, and Raymond Arroyo will join us. Again, the temperature is got to be brought down in these conversations. And politics should be debated and aggressively so, but not violence. And our thoughts are with our friends over at CNN. We are competitors in cable, but we are thinking of you and hoping everyone is OK. We will continue to monitor this and bring you the updates throughout this hour. Now, another topic, have lawsuits gone too far in the United States? It's a question was asked before, and it's when we keep debating this. We need lawsuit reform. We have too many people suing too many people. It's killing business, killing initiative, loser should pay. But maybe we need a fresh look at all this. Check this out. Public school students and parents are suing Rhode Island's governor and other educational officials in federal court, saying that the state failed to prepare young people to fully participate in civic life. That's interesting. Here now, lead counsel in the case, Michael Rebell of Columbia's Teachers College in New York. Michael, thanks much for being here tonight. You recently remarked that, quote, we are living in troubled times. Our democratic institutions are being challenged like never before. It's a provocative statement, but what makes these times more troubled than five years ago, we had all these riots in St. Louis and we had Baltimore. We had the Freddie Gray, we had Michael Brown, we had Trayvon Martin. So is it all Trump?"

      "utterance": "I'd like to look back to the era of George H. W. Bush that we were thinking about yesterday. It seemed like a century ago when people could engage in civic conversation, people from different political perspectives, and try to work things out. Now our whole situation is totally polarized. People scream at each other. They don't think. They don't talk. I think it is a very troubled time, and it is different from I think virtually any other era in American history. But another problem we have got here, Laura, our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, Sam Adams, you go back to any of them, they said that this experiment in mass democracy that they were implementing, first time in human history, could only survive if we had an educated citizenry. And that's been a theme throughout American history."

But the culture has been corroding for decades. And every time conservatives say we've got to look at this cultural equation, both in politics and entertainment industry, everything is coarsened, they are always laughed at and they're called a bunch of rubes. And you want to circumscribe creative expression. So the idea that Trump brought in the era of coarseness which is what many on the left are trying to bamboozle us with is patently ridiculous."

I have two educators in my family, one at a public school, one at a private school, different political backgrounds, both of them. But what I hear and have heard over the years is this is really tough. We have in some cases 17 languages spoken in public schools over northern Virginia. Teachers are trying to do their best, but teachers aren't parents. We have a fundamental problem with a breakdown across societal lines. And it's not racial and it's not ethnic. It's in the home."

But the point is, only one-third of the American population even knows what the separation of powers is. Only 23 percent of our students on the latest national tests were proficient in civics. I mean, our democracy cannot survive if two-thirds of the people can't name the three branches of government. The schools do have a responsibility for this."

Sorry, we have to cut that short. We will be right back. The very latest on this apparent bomb threat outside of CNN. Again, our thoughts are with our friends over the other network. We'll bring you the latest. Stay there."
