What probably should be even more clarified is that the capability of North Korea now to target U.S. citizens with nuclear warheads was facilitated at least by the deals that Bill Clinton and Barack Obama made with the North Koreans. And yet I hear a lot of my friends on the left attacking President Trump, almost more than they do the North Korean leaders. And the reality is that President Trump is doing something that is very important right now. And that is making it absolutely clear to the North Koreans that it's in their best interests not to attack United States citizens or any United States territory.   And the reason that is so important, Trish, is because our war fighters have to game this out. And now that North Korea has become this -- has this capability of nuclear weapons, and they have this rhetoric that they have had -- we don't know whether it's rhetoric or what it is -- they have to game this out and assume that it will escalate into some type of nuclear attack by North Korea if a war of some kind starts. That means we will have to move quickly to -- to neutralize that.",

Do you think there are some fundamental differences in terms of Susan Rice and how she thinks about this and how the previous administration thought about North Korea, in that she just had a New York Times op-ed the other day in which she effectively said, yes, we can live with a nuclear North Korea. We can, mutually assured destruction, much as we did with the Soviets, to which I would say, and I think most would say, no, we can't and why shouldn't have to. But, nonetheless, Congressman, here we are now. So, do you think many of those members of the left that are taking aim at the president right now for a variety of political reasons also have a fundamental difference in terms of how they view North Korea?",

But, recently, under Bill -- I'm sorry -- under Barack Obama, they tested nuclear warheads four times, and they tested missiles 11 times. So their capability has dramatically progressed.
