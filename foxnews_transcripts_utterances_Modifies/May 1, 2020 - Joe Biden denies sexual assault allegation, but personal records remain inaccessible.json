President Trump, says the Food and Drug Administration has granted authorization for the maker of an experimental drug to begin treating patients with COVID-19.  Gilead Sciences has reported success with the antiviral therapy, remdesivir. The news comes as the president takes his first break from the White House since the pandemic took the world's attention.

Now, that report says, Kim attended the ceremony marking the completion of a fertilizer factory near Pyongyang. That report, however, according to U.S. officials is unconfirmed and no pictures of that event have been released by the North Koreans. President Trump would not comment on the report.

One, if she didn't ask about the campaign's talking points, telling people to use a New York Times story on the allegations as having concluded that the event didn't happen. The Times itself said that's not true. But the biggest whopper is that when she was -- she asked a good question, she asked, you know, how you explain the one standard for Christine Blasey Ford and another standard for Tara Reade? And he said -- he said explain that believed the women, means that you give them the presumption, then you vet their statements, and what really matters is the truth. What that is that he never said anything like that. You go back into his believe the woman's statements. There's no mention of vetting, no mention of getting to the truth, none of those qualifiers.

You know what? They're kind of -- each one is flawed. And it kind of takes away some of the shine off of Biden as a candidate who would serve that purpose for the party.

The Cabinet order does not forbid owning any of the military-style weapons and their variants. But it does ban the use and trade of them.

Earlier, a local Syrian official, said the cause of the explosion was not immediately clear, while a human rights group blamed an Israeli rocket attack. No word on casualties.

I don't know if we can fully trust WHO based on how they've behaved thus far in dealing with this pandemic. But this is a really critical part of this, and it's going to be so tough for the United States. What do we do? This virus brought the country to its knees.

It depends, you know, if you went to the Senate employment office, which existed back in those days, that office has evolved three times since 1993. So, it's unclear where those records could be whether she complained to the chief of staff or the committee. You might remember, he was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. Now, just before we came on the air, we got a statement here from Joe Biden. He has directed and asked the Secretary of the Senate Julie Adams, to release any documents pertaining to this. And he says, \"I request that you take or direct whatever steps are necessary to establish the location of the records of this office. And once they've been located, to direct the search for the alleged complaint to make public the results of this search. I would ask that the public release include not only a complaint if one exists, but any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation.\" You know, Bret, it's kind of like looking for a needle in a haystack but you have to find the right haystack.

He's run for president multiple times, he's been vetted for vice president. There are opposition researchers out there and they leave no stone unturned. They go through everything. So, one thinks that it's possible if it exists, that this document exists, we would have heard about it a long time ago.

Susan Ferruccio, chief congressional correspondent for the Washington Examiner. And Bill McGurn, columnist for The Wall Street Journal. Susan, your thoughts on how the former vice president did today and where this story goes from here. SUSAN FERRUCCIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Well, I thought he sounded pretty firm when he said this never happened. And that will help him. But I also think what Chad said is really true here, how does he prove a negative. And how do Democrats, overall, navigate this when they are so adamant about investigating accusations against Republicans. So, those two things together will be problematic for Biden going forward. But he has the advantage of time. The election is months away, this will have time to kind of get baked-in for voters. We'll get a sense of what they think about it in polling as time goes on. And it may be, as a terrible way to put it, this may be -- may be kind of old news by the time the election rolls around, unless, unless some new information is uncovered when people start digging into these records."

You know, I don't think the public has seen a whole lot of her affect or demeanor, how persuasive, her body language, all the rest, and that, you know, could make all the difference. Because right now, she has some contemporaneous witnesses, she had the phenomenon of her mother, calling into Larry King, and about the same time, this allegedly happened. And so that's circumstantial evidence that had occurred. But again, there's no smoking gun. And of course, the smoking gun is kind of what Joe Biden is offering or insisting be produced. Seemingly very confident that no such smoking gun exists. He was very firm and low-key this morning under pretty tough pressure from Mika Brzezinski at MSNBC, but the obvious implication of what he was saying was, look, she's got -- she's not to be believed because she can't produce the document that she's supposedly file."

Business Insider says that the archives told it that they don't keep the records that Joe Biden says is there. So, I think they should do it. I was struck more by two things, I wish, Mika Brzezinski had asked. Once she did those -- that speak to his credibility. One, if she didn't ask about the campaign's talking points, telling people to use a New York Times story on the allegations as having concluded that the event didn't happen. The Times itself said that's not true. But the biggest whopper is that when she was -- she asked a good question, she asked, you know, how you explain the one standard for Christine Blasey Ford and another standard for Tara Reade? And he said -- he said explain that believed the women, means that you give them the presumption, then you vet their statements, and what really matters is the truth. What that is that he never said anything like that. You go back into his believe the woman's statements. There's no mention of vetting, no mention of getting to the truth, none of those qualifiers. So, I'm so -- you know, I think he got away with a little bit of a switcheroo there."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And I guess, Susan, that's the rub here is the last public figure who was facing a serious allegation during the spotlight was Brett Kavanaugh, and that's why we keep on going back to that and how people talked about it, and how people covered it. The White House press secretary today was asked about President Trump and the allegations against him from some 25 women, she said that he denied all of those, and then, the voters -- the American voters had a choice. What about that, you know, back and forth between the Biden and Trump and where this play is going forward?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRUCCIO",
      "utterance": "And the difference with Kavanaugh is, he was before the Senate as a nominee. So, he had to basically sit there and be grilled by the Senate about this, and be subjected to additional FBI inquiries. Now, neither Trump nor Biden is in that position. And I think going forward, what this does is, I think this could hurt Biden in some sense, and that voters who are looking for an alternative to Trump based on personality flaws they see in the president, will now look at Biden, and perhaps say, well, hey, they're all like this. You know what? They're kind of -- each one is flawed. And it kind of takes away some of the shine off of Biden as a candidate who would serve that purpose for the party. And I think that's one of his biggest problems. But again, it's -- you know, he's got months before the election at this point. And he's got -- there's more time for him to talk about this and defend himself. However, there's also more time for other people to come out with corroborating statements, other stories that may come out about Biden during his time in the Senate or otherwise. The 1990s were a different time in the Senate. I work there in the 90s. So, anything could pop-up. But again, this is -- you know, certainly not helpful to Biden. I don't think it's a fatal blow at this point."

We're back with the panel, Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Bill McGurn, columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal.\" charles, Bill, this is a step. Obviously, they are really trying to do this at warp speed to getting a vaccine, and millions and millions of vaccines out by the beginning of next year."

CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Big picture, I'd guess you'd have to say it's the first scientifically documented treatment, really of any kind to come forward, which is, of course, something that everybody has got to be happy about. One thing that would really affect the rate at which people reopen would be the confidence people would have that there would be something that would make them feel better if they did get infected, if they did go to the hospital. And so that could have an impact on the psychology regarding the reopening, too."

      "utterance": "Susan, we've been hearing more and more about China, what the U.S. may or may not do in retaliation for how China handled the beginning of this virus. The president speaking out about it again. Thoughts about the possibilities here, talking to lawmakers and the administration. SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": As you said earlier, the stock market took a complete swan dive when the president talked about bringing tariffs into the picture again. Clearly China needs to be held accountable, and not just for some form of punishment for what this has brought upon the world and to the United States, but to make sure it doesn't happen again. And part of it is determining where this came from. I see the World Health Organization declaring it was a nationally occurring virus from animals. I don't know if we can fully trust WHO based on how they've behaved thus far in dealing with this pandemic. But this is a really critical part of this, and it's going to be so tough for the United States. What do we do? This virus brought the country to its knees. It's caused terrible damage to our economy. Some of it will be irreparable. So many people hurt by this, so many people killed by this. How do we respond to China in a way that both holds them accountable and helps make sure we don't just sit back and let this happen again? And you see the president trying to navigate this here. I don't think anybody has an answer yet."

And less than Joe Biden, I think it was more egregious that the press various agencies let him appear on TV and not a single one asked him a question about Tara Reade. I think it's an embarrassment."

His explanation for that that he wanted to look people in the eyes was not convincing."

After two-and-a-half years and $5 million of his own money, it looks like he may finally be exonerated for lying about his phone call with Russian Ambassador Kislyak. It now sounds like he was set up by the FBI with more potential information coming out on this. My loser is the Me Too movement and the feminist movement who say believe all women, but this week we found out that that may be only applied to people who are politically affiliated with them."
