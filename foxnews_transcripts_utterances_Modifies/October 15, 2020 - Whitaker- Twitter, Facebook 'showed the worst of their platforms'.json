And if the date and timing seems odd, it should. This was to be the night there was going to be a town hall forum featuring the president of the United States and Joe Biden, and Steve Scully C-SPAN was going to be moderating it. Here's the thing. The debate is off. Steve Scully is out.  And a lot of people are wondering what comes next.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" First to John Roberts on these fast-moving developments on a busy night of campaigning and selling the message -- John.",

Maybe it is a good thing that the presidential debate for tonight was canceled by the Commission on Presidential Debates, because if this news had broken at 4:00, when there was about to be a debate in five hours, it would have thrown everything up in the air.  I had checked with Steve Scully myself -- I have known Steve for a long, long time -- last week, just to say, hey, just wanted to check to make sure that these reports you were hacked are indeed accurate. And he said, yes, that's correct. So he was not truthful to me either.   So what we're going to have tonight is two competing town halls, instead of the single town hall debate, under the auspices of the Commission on Presidential Debates. And who knows, by the way, what the future of that entire organization and the next debate on the 22nd is going to be. Donald Trump will be in Miami, and he will be on NBC. And Joe Biden will be in Philadelphia. He will be on ABC. Both of these are at 8:00 tonight, which is interesting that they will be competing with each other, which means that voters won't get a chance to see them, obviously, not side by side, but they won't even be able to watch one and then the other. And the ultimate tale may be told, Neil, in the ratings that come from this.   President Trump continuing earlier today to go after Joe Biden and Hunter Biden over the reports of the e-mails that suggested that Hunter Biden had arranged or was in the process of arranging some sort of meeting between a Ukrainian energy executive and his father. President Trump saying that, despite attempts by Twitter and Facebook to limit access or outright censor these reports, that he's going to go ahead and keep saying what he's saying. Listen to what he said in Greenville earlier today.",

They made it very difficult, if not impossible, for people to retweet or resend that to others.  And therein lies the rub. Who are they to decide what is worthy for people to read and follow?

And Trump has got some of those -- not exactly the same issues, obviously, but some major issues to deal with, the pandemic, his handling of it, which has been -- people have been very critical of, the economy right now, although I think he's done net-net well on the economy, and his personal attributes. People are just -- suburban women are just turned off by his tweeting and his personality. Put all that together, and donors, particularly big money donors -- and this is Wall Street -- they're just throwing money at Biden right now. I found a fascinating statistic. Goldman Sachs -- this is just individuals, not their PAC money, but it will give you a little idea here -- gave something like $170,000 to Biden. They gave -- they have given about $11,000 to Trump. That's $11,000 -- they gave also $11,000 to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who, by the way, ran against AOC unsuccessfully. It was an uphill battle. Goldman gave her literally the same amount of money that they gave the president, President Trump. So that's where they're betting. And the polls tell it all. The polls are saying that Biden is going to wait. Now, the polls were wrong in the past, as you know, Neil. Wall Street has been wrong the last two election cycles, we should point out. They went heavily for Mitt Romney, because Obama, they believe, backstabbed them, essentially. After supporting him, he passed all that financial regulation, which particularly at Goldman Sachs hurt their bottom line. Last year, last election cycle, they went for Hillary. Again, they bet wrong. So, remember, they're not right, they're not wrong all the time. But this time, they feel they're on pretty strong ground, at least now, that the president is not going to win. And the polls are -- remember, the polls with Hillary towards the end were tightening. They're -- we still haven't seen that tightening yet. It may happen, and he may pull it out. But Wall Street and the big money donors aren't betting on it. They are quite the opposite. They see a Joe Biden presidency. And, obviously, you give money to him because you want to influence him. They don't want him to do all those tax increases he wants, particularly on investors. I think they're crazy, because he's going to do it. That's -- if there's one thing I know Joe Biden is going to do is raise taxes. He's made that clear in meeting after meeting, particularly if he gets a Republican -- a Democratic Senate, and there's going to be some turbulence in the stock market if that happens.",

But I would hope that there would be bipartisan interest in bringing these big companies to account, not only because of the monopoly of power, but also because of the shield against liability that they have with respect to the way that they moderate content. And those issues need to be looked at again. And it's time for Congress to have that conversation.",

And if the date and timing seems odd, it should. This was to be the night there was going to be a town hall forum featuring the president of the United States and Joe Biden, and Steve Scully C-SPAN was going to be moderating it. Here's the thing. The debate is off. Steve Scully is out. And a lot of people are wondering what comes next. Welcome, everybody.

Maybe it is a good thing that the presidential debate for tonight was canceled by the Commission on Presidential Debates, because if this news had broken at 4:00, when there was about to be a debate in five hours, it would have thrown everything up in the air. I had checked with Steve Scully myself -- I have known Steve for a long, long time -- last week, just to say, hey, just wanted to check to make sure that these reports you were hacked are indeed accurate. And he said, yes, that's correct. So he was not truthful to me either. So what we're going to have tonight is two competing town halls, instead of the single town hall debate, under the auspices of the Commission on Presidential Debates. And who knows, by the way, what the future of that entire organization and the next debate on the 22nd is going to be. Donald Trump will be in Miami, and he will be on NBC. And Joe Biden will be in Philadelphia. He will be on ABC. Both of these are at 8:00 tonight, which is interesting that they will be competing with each other, which means that voters won't get a chance to see them, obviously, not side by side, but they won't even be able to watch one and then the other. And the ultimate tale may be told, Neil, in the ratings that come from this. President Trump continuing earlier today to go after Joe Biden and Hunter Biden over the reports of the e-mails that suggested that Hunter Biden had arranged or was in the process of arranging some sort of meeting between a Ukrainian energy executive and his father. President Trump saying that, despite attempts by Twitter and Facebook to limit access or outright censor these reports, that he's going to go ahead and keep saying what he's saying.

Now, the third debate coming up on the 22nd is being moderated by Kristen Welker. I know her well. She's a personal friend of mine. She is a top-rate journalist.

Biden said in a fund-raiser he expects the opposition to throw everything at him but the kitchen sink, including lies and distortion. He also weighed in on the power of technology, saying it leaves people to sort through what is true and untrue, saying that that takes time.

Social media didn't waste any time trying to prevent it getting passed on. That does not mean that Twitter and the likes of Facebook had it on their sites. They made it very difficult, if not impossible, for people to retweet or resend that to others. And therein lies the rub. Who are they to decide what is worthy for people to read and follow? And then who are we in that process? Matthew Whitaker, a former acting attorney general, with us right now, Matthew, I think that's kind of the bigger question here. Whatever you think of the details of this story, these social media giants and others took it upon themselves to say, we don't think this is wise for you to pass on. That's -- that's a little Big Brother-ish there. What do you make of that?"

And I think this is a -- the reason this is -- has so much interest from a lot of folks is because not only of what happened and what this story contained from The New York Post, but, really, it is the best example we have seen to date of the power of Facebook and Twitter to put their thumb on the scale, to change how much can be shared among users on their platforms. And I think it shows the power of their monopoly -- monopoly, Neil. And I think -- I think this is going to get them some regulation attention from Washington, D.C."

Was it, indeed, Hunter Biden's laptop? Why he made it a point to make a couple of copies of these e-mail exchanges, pass one along to Rudy Giuliani. Be that as it may, the social media that generally happily allows all sorts of material, skeptical and otherwise, to pass on, strictly forbid this, and made it next to impossible for anyone to communicate it. Others found ways around that, getting it to colleagues or those they knew. But let's say Facebook and Twitter certainly didn't help. Did they break any laws here doing this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, and that's a good point, is that what Facebook and Twitter did was essentially, instead of answering speech with more speech, or sort of entering a marketplace of ideas, is, they suppressed speech and showed kind of the worst of the power of their platforms. I just -- I just can't see -- we already had Clarence Thomas drop a footnote in a cert petition denial, saying that he would be interested in taking a 230 case. We now have Congress calling these people up for hearings on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And we also have the FCC now talking about this. And I think, ultimately, we may look back at this as the golden age of social media, before Washington, D.C., heavily regulated them."

And what they put out, it seems to me, would have been -- they would have gone through their process to determine if it's fit to print. And it's not just the major media outlets, like The Times and The Post that somehow have a monopoly on what's true. And so I think this whole case is a really sad example of the power of social media, and how, ultimately, they're going to deserve the regulation they get from Congress and from the executive branch."

Now, the former vice president previously had said he never met any of his son's business associates.

But, apparently, Steve Scully is 100 and doesn't know how Twitter works. Therefore, his account should be frozen. I can't stand when people do something dumb, and they don't take responsibility for it. He can say, I'm a ham-fisted grandpa, and I don't know what I'm doing.

It's divided between Republicans and Democrats. But the rap against it is that they have a tin ear and are very biased. I don't know where you stand on this. But, at the very least, it's going to make us revisit how they go about choosing who moderates these things or who's involved in them. What do you think?"

And I think that the commission is there working with a stale duopoly that is the Republican and Democrat parties to ensure that theirs are the only candidates that the nation sees. And that does a great disservice. And it really limits the dialogue. And these candidates don't have to be pressed, if there are areas of agreement. And the one thing that the first debate showed us, it's that presidential debates can really go off the rails quite quickly, and be somewhat entertaining. But, also, maybe we need a different format and a different way of putting these things together. Chris Wallace did an outstanding job. Steve Scully, his reputation is sullied. In fact, they may think up a new adjective. It could be Scullied. Now, that would be a verb."

All right, when we come back here, of course, the judge got a break today. She was not part of this fourth day of hearings going on right now, where they largely had senators listening to witnesses who spoke on her behalf and others who had questions and reservations. But the timetable is on. They think, right now, they can get a committee vote going on October 22 and, the very next day, a full Senate vote on October 23, long before the election -- after this."

So, Senate Republicans are on track to vote on Judge Barrett's nomination out of committee one week from today. But even though Judge Barrett over the past two days endured about 20 hours of cross-examination, some Democrats say they have been left with more questions than answers. And, today, Judge Barrett, while she was not in the hearing room, witnesses testified on her behalf. The American Bar Association told the committee that Barrett was well-qualified, while Democrats called witnesses that put a face on policies that they think are in jeopardy with a potential Justice Barrett on the high court. While Judge Barrett has been very persistent in trying to stay apolitical throughout this process, some Democrats argue that the timing of her nomination, just a few weeks before Election Day, turns this into -- quote -- \"a callous power grab.\""

The Constitution requires that there be a quorum to have the vote. And under the Senate rules, that's a majority. And they have to show up in- person the floor of the Senate to take that vote. There's no voting by proxy in the U.S. senate, like there is in the House. So -- but if everybody shows up, you got a majority of 51 senators who show up to vote, I don't think there's really anything that the Democratic senators can do to stop the floor vote from being a week from today.

They're going to do what Franklin Roosevelt did back in 1937. Now, that boomeranged on FDR, you know better than many, when even Democrats said, no, no, you have gone one step too far.

If Democrats are mad, the natural thing they should do is just say, next time there's a vacancy when our guy is in charge of the White House and we're in charge of the Senate in the last year, we will put that person through in just a few weeks. That would be a fair response. But to say we're just going to make the courts a tool of politics, where we just keep stuffing more and more justices, make it 25, make it 30 justices, Neil, you and I will be on the Supreme Court when we get to 50 justices, we will just keep putting more people on, until you get the results you want? That's not really what the independence of the courts are about. We need to have justices who are not beholden to whatever party just happens to be in power right now. And I find it's -- Democrats particularly should care about this, because they say they want the courts to defend individual rights against the majority.

And on the left of your screen, by the way, the president arriving in Miami. Charlie Gasparino has been keeping tabs on all this. Man, oh, man, I don't think I can ever recall, Charlie, a challenger to an incumbent president eclipsing the money raised by the incumbent president. It's wild. What's going on?"

      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, it reminds me a little bit of Obama in 2008. Of course, Obama wasn't running against an incumbent president. He was running against the incumbent party in John McCain, right? The president back then was George Bush. But George Bush had a lot of problems, as you know, and so did the Republican brand at that point. It was just -- we came out of a very unpopular war. He had the financial crisis. And Trump has got some of those -- not exactly the same issues, obviously, but some major issues to deal with, the pandemic, his handling of it, which has been -- people have been very critical of, the economy right now, although I think he's done net-net well on the economy, and his personal attributes. People are just -- suburban women are just turned off by his tweeting and his personality. Put all that together, and donors, particularly big money donors -- and this is Wall Street -- they're just throwing money at Biden right now. I found a fascinating statistic. Goldman Sachs -- this is just individuals, not their PAC money, but it will give you a little idea here -- gave something like $170,000 to Biden. They gave -- they have given about $11,000 to Trump. That's $11,000 -- they gave also $11,000 to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who, by the way, ran against AOC unsuccessfully. It was an uphill battle. Goldman gave her literally the same amount of money that they gave the president, President Trump. So that's where they're betting. And the polls tell it all. The polls are saying that Biden is going to wait. Now, the polls were wrong in the past, as you know, Neil. Wall Street has been wrong the last two election cycles, we should point out. They went heavily for Mitt Romney, because Obama, they believe, backstabbed them, essentially. After supporting him, he passed all that financial regulation, which particularly at Goldman Sachs hurt their bottom line. Last year, last election cycle, they went for Hillary. Again, they bet wrong. So, remember, they're not right, they're not wrong all the time. But this time, they feel they're on pretty strong ground, at least now, that the president is not going to win. And the polls are -- remember, the polls with Hillary towards the end were tightening. They're -- we still haven't seen that tightening yet. It may happen, and he may pull it out. But Wall Street and the big money donors aren't betting on it. They are quite the opposite. They see a Joe Biden presidency. And, obviously, you give money to him because you want to influence him. They don't want him to do all those tax increases he wants, particularly on investors. I think they're crazy, because he's going to do it. That's -- if there's one thing I know Joe Biden is going to do is raise taxes. He's made that clear in meeting after meeting, particularly if he gets a Republican -- a Democratic Senate, and there's going to be some turbulence in the stock market if that happens."

And I think it's a conversation we need to have, Neil. We need to find out exactly what they are doing in terms of content moderation policies. And when they either suppress or amplify individual users' content, certainly, this example with The New York Post and their users is an example of why not only the entities like The New York Post, but also their users who might link to their Web site, need due process.

And I think there has to be some accountability. Now, the Democrats, up until now, as you pointed out, have been interested in that as well. Currently, it's Republicans who seem and conservative content that seems to be getting censured. But I would hope that there would be bipartisan interest in bringing these big companies to account, not only because of the monopoly of power, but also because of the shield against liability that they have with respect to the way that they moderate content.

Are they now stepping on the content and deciding what is and what isn't seen by the American people? And if they're preventing it from being distributed via Twitter, that, too, is -- that's a way, that's an action that filters the content the American people see. And if we're going to have an open market, we have got to have an open market. If we're not, we need to figure out what the parameters ought to be. And I think this whole issue of content moderation is something that the American people need to have looked at by their elected leaders, by policy-makers in Washington.
