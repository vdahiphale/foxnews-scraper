      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Busy breaking news night again tonight, day four of the mainstream media's Omarosa obsession. Well, the country is now facing so many serious issues, both home and abroad, the destroy Trump press is running wall-to-wall with coverage of a fired White House staffer with an old grudge, a new book and a lifetime of credibility issues.  In moments, we'll expose the extent of the media's blatant Trump bias. We actually have time and numbers and we'll compare it for you.  And also tonight, well, the trial of the century is almost over. After 11 days, the tax and bank fraud case against Paul Manafort from 2005 is now ready for closing arguments. Hours ago, the defense rested in the case. Not a single witness called. We're going to explain why this is not necessarily good news for team Mueller whose sloppy prosecution tactics have frequently earned the ire of the federal judge overseeing this case.  And meanwhile, a vast majority of you, the American people, you are telling Robert Mueller tonight, wrap it up. We'll show you the polls. We also have a new report raising serious questions about real Russia collusion tied exactly to the Clinton campaign. Robert Mueller, you and your team of merry Democratic donors, you may want to listen up tonight.  All right. Buckle up, busy breaking news night. We're also following some election news as we begin with our breaking news opening monologue.",

That's not brought up very often. And none of this seems to matter to the crisis peddlers seven days a week, 24 hours a day, minute-by minute, hour by hour on so-called news networks.

      "sentences": "And tonight, our friends at the Media Research Center, they're backing up what you just heard from Sarah Sanders. Their research shows that during their broadcast last night, the morning shows, today, ABC, CBS, NBC, they dedicated approximately 344 percent more time covering Omarosa than they did covering the firing of FBI agent Peter Strzok. That's more than triple the reporting for salacious rumors over what is serious news about what is a corrupt, high ranking FBI official fired because of his massive bias and corruption, at the heart of everything from Hillary, to General Flynn, to the beginning of the Russia-Trump hoax. And today, as he often does, the president bypassed the partisan press in the country. He took his message right to you, the American people. He tweeted out, quote: Fired FBI agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation that he started. There was no collusion or obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only collusion and obstruction was by crooked Hillary, the Democrats, the DNC. And tonight, a new report is now bolstering the president's claim. Real Clear Investigations, they are shows serious questions now being raised about Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson and the shadowy Russian figures who attended the now infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. By the way, Robert Mueller, if you're looking for potential Russia collusion, we've got more. It's all right here.  Now, we all know Fusion GPS was employed by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. They paid them ultimately to dig up what ended up being Russian dirt on then candidate Donald Trump. Tonight, there are new concerns over another client of Fusion GPS. Well, that's the Russian lawyer who attended that meeting, that everyone has been talking about. She utilized Simpson's services to lobby against Russian sanctions. This plot just keeps thickening and according to testimony, she had dinner with Simpson both before and after the Trump Tower meeting. Sounds like a set-up to me. And because Simpson's relationship with that Kremlin-tied lawyer, Chicago financier named William Browder was, quote, so concerned about Fusion GPS's work on behalf of Russian interest that in July of 2016, he actually lodged a complaint with the DOJ. Let me put it simply. Clinton's op research firm, Fusion GPS, was working on behalf of the DNC, Hillary Clinton and also Russian-backed interests. So, that's right. It's all literally represented by the same person, Glen Simpson. Now, that's exactly as sketchy as it sounds. But, where is the hysteria from the media? This is about stealing a presidential election, lying to the American people with phony Russian information that is paid for by the opposition party candidate and then used for a FISA warrant. Where is the special counsel investigation?   Oh, it's not really an investigation into collusion now, is it? It's a partisan witch-hunt against the president. And, frankly, you, the American people, have seen through this and have had enough. Even fake news CNN has a poll that shows, that's right, two thirds of you, the American people, are now calling for Robert Mueller to wrap this garbage up. And this comes as the trial of the century maybe soon be coming to an end. After 11 days, the defense rested in the bank and tax fraud case of Paul Manafort from 2005. They didn't bother calling a single witness. Manafort's legal time apparently believes that the special counsel did not meet their burden. The burden of proof. And they may be right. According to analysis from a Northern Virginia criminal defense attorney, team Mueller was not ready for prime time in Judge Ellis' courtroom. Quote: No matter how strong their evidence, how righteous their cause, how impressive their resumes may be and actually are, they simply have not done a very good job.  Clearly, Mueller has and was trying to turn the screws on Manafort as Judge Ellis told us, he never wanted to go to trial. He just wanted Manafort to sing or to compose so that Mueller could give up something or make up something, anything, to then prosecute or impeach Donald Trump. And despite team Mueller's poor performance in court, sadly for Manafort, the odds are stacked against him. The vast majority of federal cases result in a guilty verdict, over 90 percent. This case, for the record, and maybe we'll get even as early as Thursday of this week, a verdict. This case has nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with Donald Trump, nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with the election at all. Rod Rosenstein's mandate allowed this. And meanwhile, what do we have? Hillary Clinton committing multiple, serious felonies, crimes? Mishandling top secret information? She obstructed justice when she deleted, of course, subpoenaed emails, watched her hard drives with Bleach Bit, watched them away so they could never be found again, broke up her devices with hammers, fixed and rigged an investigation with Steele's dirty dossier.  Remember, that was full of Russian lies and it was peddled to you, the American people. Why? Because they wanted to misinform you, to steal an election. That's called propaganda, misinformation, outright lying to the American people. And that information was then presented to four separate FISA court judges as, quote, credible evidence. Nobody had ever literally verified any of it, corroborated any of it. Nobody has been indicted, investigated by team Mueller regarding Clinton's dirty Russian dossier. This is a disgrace to America's system of justice. And frankly, if we are going to be blunt and honest here, it is a clear and danger to our -- clear and present danger to our constitutional republic. Now, make no mistake, Manafort is found guilty? Your media will have a brand new obsession. Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Blank hole, blank hole, blank hole, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. And, of course, Omarosa, Omarosa. And, again, we'll be forced to call them out for their shameless, priceless peddling. Yes, journalism in America is dead. But the real fear ought to be whether or not we have a justice system that applies equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. If this is really about Russia, why are we dealing with a 2005 tax case not related to the campaign or Russia or Donald Trump at all? Why aren't we investigating the dirty dossier with Russian lies that were peddled to the American people? Why aren't we investigating FISA court judges that were absolutely, a fraud was perpetrated on their courts with Russian lies? What about Adam Schiff? Shifty Schiff and he is talking to Russians on the phone. We played it for you. What does he want? Dirt on Donald Trump.  And now, we got Fusion GPS, Glen Simpson meeting before and after with the client that met with Don Jr. and company at Trump Tower that the media has made so much of? And also, Russia is a client of his also? You've got to be kidding me. You couldn't put this in a spy novel and have people believe this. Here now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, civil rights criminal defense attorney David Schoen. Let's start with you, Sara, and all these new developments. I think it's a big deal. We now have been -- we have a lot of new information that's been coming out as it relates to Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson. Now, we see he had another client and that was Russia, a Russian client. And now we see the before and after the meeting at Trump Tower, he was meeting before and after with that client, that was paying him.",

In court, prosecutors said the adults at the compound were teaching children how to shoot teachers, cops and students. And the FBI testified that children were forced to attend an exorcism to expel the demons from a 3-year-old boy with epilepsy. Witnesses say the boy's father refused to give his son medication. And when the boy died of a seizure the father said his son would come back as Jesus and tell them who to kill. The defense says this is nothing more than a religious journey and prosecutors are applying a double standard because the defendants are Muslim or black. Judge Backus is a Democrat and former San Francisco public defender said the allegations are troubling but the prosecutors did not prove the suspects had a plan to kill anyone. She then freed the defendants on a signature bond that requires no money upfront.

Well, the country is now facing so many serious issues, both home and abroad, the destroy Trump press is running wall-to-wall with coverage of a fired White House staffer with an old grudge, a new book and a lifetime of credibility issues. In moments, we'll expose the extent of the media's blatant Trump bias. We actually have time and numbers and we'll compare it for you. And also tonight, well, the trial of the century is almost over. After 11 days, the tax and bank fraud case against Paul Manafort from 2005 is now ready for closing arguments. Hours ago, the defense rested in the case. Not a single witness called. We're going to explain why this is not necessarily good news for team Mueller whose sloppy prosecution tactics have frequently earned the ire of the federal judge overseeing this case. And meanwhile, a vast majority of you, the American people, you are telling Robert Mueller tonight, wrap it up. We'll show you the polls. We also have a new report raising serious questions about real Russia collusion tied exactly to the Clinton campaign. Robert Mueller, you and your team of merry Democratic donors, you may want to listen up tonight. All right. Buckle up, busy breaking news night. We're also following some election news as we begin with our breaking news opening monologue."

For now the fourth day across all platforms, your destroy Trump media highlighting what is the salacious claims, untrue accusations, secret recordings from, yes, Omarosa, a person fired three times from a reality show and, by the way, once from the White House where she was hired by Donald Trump, and according to General Kelly, because of serious credibility and character issues. That's not brought up very often. And none of this seems to matter to the crisis peddlers seven days a week, 24 hours a day, minute-by minute, hour by hour on so-called news networks.

That's more than triple the reporting for salacious rumors over what is serious news about what is a corrupt, high ranking FBI official fired because of his massive bias and corruption, at the heart of everything from Hillary, to General Flynn, to the beginning of the Russia-Trump hoax."

      "utterance": "Fired FBI agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation that he started. There was no collusion or obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only collusion and obstruction was by crooked Hillary, the Democrats, the DNC. And tonight, a new report is now bolstering the president's claim. Real Clear Investigations, they are shows serious questions now being raised about Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson and the shadowy Russian figures who attended the now infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. By the way, Robert Mueller, if you're looking for potential Russia collusion, we've got more. It's all right here. Now, we all know Fusion GPS was employed by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. They paid them ultimately to dig up what ended up being Russian dirt on then candidate Donald Trump. Tonight, there are new concerns over another client of Fusion GPS. Well, that's the Russian lawyer who attended that meeting, that everyone has been talking about. She utilized Simpson's services to lobby against Russian sanctions. This plot just keeps thickening and according to testimony, she had dinner with Simpson both before and after the Trump Tower meeting. Sounds like a set-up to me. And because Simpson's relationship with that Kremlin-tied lawyer, Chicago financier named William Browder was, quote, so concerned about Fusion GPS's work on behalf of Russian interest that in July of 2016, he actually lodged a complaint with the DOJ. Let me put it simply. Clinton's op research firm, Fusion GPS, was working on behalf of the DNC, Hillary Clinton and also Russian-backed interests. So, that's right. It's all literally represented by the same person, Glen Simpson. Now, that's exactly as sketchy as it sounds. But, where is the hysteria from the media? This is about stealing a presidential election, lying to the American people with phony Russian information that is paid for by the opposition party candidate and then used for a FISA warrant. Where is the special counsel investigation? Oh, it's not really an investigation into collusion now, is it? It's a partisan witch-hunt against the president. And, frankly, you, the American people, have seen through this and have had enough. Even fake news CNN has a poll that shows, that's right, two thirds of you, the American people, are now calling for Robert Mueller to wrap this garbage up. And this comes as the trial of the century maybe soon be coming to an end. After 11 days, the defense rested in the bank and tax fraud case of Paul Manafort from 2005. They didn't bother calling a single witness. Manafort's legal time apparently believes that the special counsel did not meet their burden. The burden of proof."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And they may be right. According to analysis from a Northern Virginia criminal defense attorney, team Mueller was not ready for prime time in Judge Ellis' courtroom. Quote",
      "utterance": "No matter how strong their evidence, how righteous their cause, how impressive their resumes may be and actually are, they simply have not done a very good job. Clearly, Mueller has and was trying to turn the screws on Manafort as Judge Ellis told us, he never wanted to go to trial. He just wanted Manafort to sing or to compose so that Mueller could give up something or make up something, anything, to then prosecute or impeach Donald Trump. And despite team Mueller's poor performance in court, sadly for Manafort, the odds are stacked against him. The vast majority of federal cases result in a guilty verdict, over 90 percent. This case, for the record, and maybe we'll get even as early as Thursday of this week, a verdict. This case has nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with Donald Trump, nothing to do with Russia, nothing to do with the election at all. Rod Rosenstein's mandate allowed this. And meanwhile, what do we have? Hillary Clinton committing multiple, serious felonies, crimes? Mishandling top secret information? She obstructed justice when she deleted, of course, subpoenaed emails, watched her hard drives with Bleach Bit, watched them away so they could never be found again, broke up her devices with hammers, fixed and rigged an investigation with Steele's dirty dossier. Remember, that was full of Russian lies and it was peddled to you, the American people. Why? Because they wanted to misinform you, to steal an election. That's called propaganda, misinformation, outright lying to the American people. And that information was then presented to four separate FISA court judges as, quote, credible evidence. Nobody had ever literally verified any of it, corroborated any of it. Nobody has been indicted, investigated by team Mueller regarding Clinton's dirty Russian dossier. This is a disgrace to America's system of justice. And frankly, if we are going to be blunt and honest here, it is a clear and danger to our -- clear and present danger to our constitutional republic. Now, make no mistake, Manafort is found guilty? Your media will have a brand new obsession. Stormy, Stormy, Stormy. Blank hole, blank hole, blank hole, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. And, of course, Omarosa, Omarosa. And, again, we'll be forced to call them out for their shameless, priceless peddling. Yes, journalism in America is dead. But the real fear ought to be whether or not we have a justice system that applies equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws. If this is really about Russia, why are we dealing with a 2005 tax case not related to the campaign or Russia or Donald Trump at all? Why aren't we investigating the dirty dossier with Russian lies that were peddled to the American people? Why aren't we investigating FISA court judges that were absolutely, a fraud was perpetrated on their courts with Russian lies? What about Adam Schiff? Shifty Schiff and he is talking to Russians on the phone. We played it for you. What does he want? Dirt on Donald Trump. And now, we got Fusion GPS, Glen Simpson meeting before and after with the client that met with Don Jr. and company at Trump Tower that the media has made so much of? And also, Russia is a client of his also? You've got to be kidding me. You couldn't put this in a spy novel and have people believe this. Here now, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, civil rights criminal defense attorney David Schoen. Let's start with you, Sara, and all these new developments. I think it's a big deal. We now have been -- we have a lot of new information that's been coming out as it relates to Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson. Now, we see he had another client and that was Russia, a Russian client. And now we see the before and after the meeting at Trump Tower, he was meeting before and after with that client, that was paying him."

These things have not been verified, saying that the Russians have information on Trump, that they can blackmail him, putting out this disinformation, not even misinformation, disinformation. And they are aiding Russia in this chaos. But, on the other side, we have insurmountable evidence based on text messages, phone records, documents that, you know, people like in Natalia Veselnitskaya who met at Trump Tower were working for Prevezon Holdings, and guess who they hired? They hired Glen Simpson at Fusion GPS. So, she was connected directly to Glen Simpson. She met with him before and after just as you said. There is direct links to these people. And you know that is where the actual truth is, Sean. This is the evidence that the people are not following and they need to be following. And this is the reason why Congress and why the senators have been so adamant for calling a special counsel to investigate this. It is a complete injustice and if you're looking at it on its face, we can see that there was actually a gain to unseat a duly elected president and, unfortunately."

Sammy \"The Bull\" killed 19 people, but he gets a get out of jail free card if he testifies against person X, Y, or Z, and I'm thinking, OK, if I killed 19 people, I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail. I killed people. It's not exactly like I have a moral compass at all. I'd say whatever you want me to say. Now, the main, the lead prosecution witness in the Manafort case is his partner, Rick Gates. He is an admitted lawyer, embezzler, cheat, involved in everything that supposedly Paul Manafort has done for the most part. He is their star witness who is facing 100 years in jail and everybody else that testified got immunity. That sounds, to me, like -- well, Mueller is basically bribing Rick Gates with a get out of jail free card.

They decide who should be telling the truth in the case and if the story doesn't match from the informant that they would like it to be, they get rid of that person. They deep-six them. If they're willing to play ball and say what Weissmann and Andres and those sort of prosecutors want them to say, then they can play ball. But it's a defense lawyer's job to expose that to the jury.

They are continuing this saga and they haven't shown us any proof that there was any guilt of collusion with the Russians, with the campaign. But, let's just go to Bruce Ohr. We know that Bruce Ohr was in communication with Christopher Steele. A former foreign British spy who was basically peddling Russian disinformation into the FBI. Now, when the FBI realized that Christopher Steele was lying to them, that he had been meeting with the media and actually peddling that information for Glen Simpson, who, remember, also worked for the Russians, to American media, the FBI fired him. But, they wanted to continue propagating these lies. So, Peter Strzok and the others who were in charge of these investigations, went around Christopher Steele. They used Bruce Ohr as a back channel. And his wife, Nellie Ohr, just happened to be working for who? Glen Simpson with Fusion GPS. Sean, there cannot be any more connect the dots than what we are seeing.

But, this was all because of Rod Rosenstein's wide mandate that he gave Robert Mueller and the appointment of his friend and even though he signed the fourth FISA warrant which I believe conflicts him just like, you know, recommending the firing of Comey. But I look at, for example, Hillary's campaign paying for what turned out to be Russian lies. Misinformation peddled to the American people before an election. I look at what happened to Bernie Sanders. I look at FISA court judges, a fraud committed four separate times on a court with unverified, uncorroborated information and purposefully withholding the information that Hillary paid for it. And you're right, these are all facts.

And Comey took it over and he twisted the law and contorted the facts and he cleared her in the face of overwhelming evidence of criminality. I talked today at length to a former top FBI official.

So not only has she come under fire social media. Tonight, authorities in Taos, New Mexico had to evacuate the courthouse because of a credible threat against her. In court, prosecutors said the adults at the compound were teaching children how to shoot teachers, cops and students. And the FBI testified that children were forced to attend an exorcism to expel the demons from a 3-year-old boy with epilepsy. Witnesses say the boy's father refused to give his son medication. And when the boy died of a seizure the father said his son would come back as Jesus and tell them who to kill. The defense says this is nothing more than a religious journey and prosecutors are applying a double standard because the defendants are Muslim or black. Judge Backus is a Democrat and former San Francisco public defender said the allegations are troubling but the prosecutors did not prove the suspects had a plan to kill anyone. She then freed the defendants on a signature bond that requires no money upfront.

Here with reaction tonight to this and more, the author of \"Why We Fight\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Former Secret Service Agent NRATV contributor, Dan Bongino. I look at this the judge ruling that prosecutors in the case, five adults, et cetera, in the compound, 11 malnourished children that they failed to make the case for keeping the defendants in custody while they await trial. Paul Manafort, didn't he spend, Dr. Gorka, 23 hours a day in solitary confinement for a long period of time--"

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "-- over a 2005 tax case? Here we have evidence of these kids, what way the conditions they were living, in what specifically happened here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "It's truly remarkable. This is, perhaps, the most horrific case study of just how politicized the judicial system has become in recent years. You need to listen to what Trace said again. These were children, almost a dozen children and they found the dead body of a 4-year-old on the compound. They found the weapons, they found the training materials. And these people are left to leave the courtroom without paying a bail and I think the best they did is to give them ankle bracelet trackers? This isn't justice. This is where political correctness can get in the way of keeping Americans safe, Sean. It's a travesty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, the judge, you know, saying prosecutors -- prosecutors didn't prove, Dan Bongino, that the terrorists were a danger to the community. It's only really a signature bond. Meaning they only need a signature, they don't even need to post the 20 grand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT",
      "utterance": "Sean, I've never heard anything like this. When I was a Secret Service agent investigating financial crimes, keep in mind, we are talking about white collar crime. Not the allegations here where kids were being trained to shoot law enforcement and teachers on a compound. When I was doing white collar crimes, I remember bond rates in the Eastern District of New York in the Long Island courthouse 10 and 20 times this for people who committed credit card fraud. Check kiting and bank fraud. This case is outrageous. By the way, Sean, the allegations in this, they don't have to prove anything. Prove it in the trial."

      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let me shift gears and let's talk a little bit about the Manafort case. So, the odds are not with Paul Manafort based on, you know, the conviction rate and federal court is 95 plus percent. And none of us know what he did in 2005. But we do know that the lead witness got a get out of jail free card, Dr. Gorka. And that he faced 100 years-plus in jail."

      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Admitted somebody that was an admitted liar, you know, admitted to, you know, all these other crimes. Is that bribery of a witness? Doesn't it seem like it to you? Doesn't it seem like there is something wrong with that system?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "Well, that's an old established system to try and get people who are criminals to give you access and ammunition against the person you really want. And, Sean, there is only one person that Mueller and his team really want. And that's the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "And they think they can get to the president through Manafort and that's why they flipped this individual who has zero credibility and, again, it's about politics. This is in Virginia but Arlington is a very, very Democrat core district."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Dan, 100 years in jail, and get out of jail free card and you know, admitting to embezzling, lying and all sorts of other craps. I'd say anything I would assume that person would say anything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONGINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think it's clear, you know, the crime they are really looking at for Manafort is joining the Trump team. I mean, that seems obvious. Sebastian is right. And you're right. This witness is not credible. He has problems with his family, his finances and everything else. And ultimately it's going to come down to his believability by the jury which I don't believe is very good."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Take a look at this video today. Heartwarming clip circulating online, a very patriotic 10-year-old boy, his name is Avery Price. He's from Tennessee. Now he has a hereditary disease that hinders the use of his legs and stops him from getting up at his wheelchair at other times. But it did not stop him from standing for the national anthem. I'm a college football guy now, so sick of what the NFL is doing. That's my own personal choice. All right. That's unfortunately, that's all the time we have left this evening.
