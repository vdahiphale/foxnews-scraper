SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Not a single Republican senator spoke up in favor of the president's plan. People within his own administration opposed it, were surprised and dismayed when he unveiled these threats. Mexico is trying very hard to get everyone to just take a step back. They're going to be meetings, big meetings here in Washington tomorrow aimed at coming to some kind of deal. And in the face and all this opposition within his own part, you would think the president would seek a way to defuse this situation, not impose these tariffs on June 10th.",

I think that most people looking at this, particularly the president's supporters will say this is great, isn't it? You've got Congress not doing anything to actually sort out the immigration system which everyone agrees is completely broken. They won't change the law. They won't do anything on asylum or anything at all. And then when the president tries to break that logjam by doing something creative, they want to block him from doing that as well.   I think the way we should look at this is to be open-minded. It's a bit of entrepreneurial policymaking as far as I'm concerned. It may have some effect. It doesn’t get the real problem dealt with, which is our laws in our system. But it's got to be Congress that does that, and there's no sign of that happening.",

It will be a great victory for the president.  On the other hand, we are at this very moment, President Trump actually has no trade agreements signed. There's one thing with South Korea, but he has this basically rehashing of NAFTA that is on the books and is supposed to be coming up, and this looks like it could scuttle it.  Meanwhile we are trying to do these trade negotiations with China, which is the other trading partner that makes lots of cheap stuff. And now we are saying we are also going to make stuff from Mexico really expensive, too, which puts a double squeeze on our businesses here at home, which is why this is the first time you've seen Republican senators to a person stand up to the president because it's been terrible for the economy of a lot of these states.",

It's actually what he's bringing to it, the attitude which has been tremendously positive and enthusiastic about this phrase, the special relationship, which under President Obama, I was in Number 10 when his state visit was there, and were told very clearly, he's not going to say the words \"special relationship,\" so don’t ask him to because you don’t want to be rebuffed.

Bush's 2000 run by coasting on name recognition and positive feelings. And one of the few things that can destroy that strategy, which has been working surprisingly well for him, is when he talks, because when Joe Biden talks, you never know what's going to happen next.

OK, Susan, there does seem to be significant pushback. They were holding back there up on Capitol Hill. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Not a single Republican senator spoke up in favor of the president's plan. People within his own administration opposed it, were surprised and dismayed when he unveiled these threats. Mexico is trying very hard to get everyone to just take a step back. They're going to be meetings, big meetings here in Washington tomorrow aimed at coming to some kind of deal. And in the face and all this opposition within his own part, you would think the president would seek a way to defuse this situation, not impose these tariffs on June 10th."

STEVE HILTON, HOST, \"THE NEXT REVOLUTION\": They're certainly moving physically. They're here, so that's a start. I think that most people looking at this, particularly the president's supporters will say this is great, isn't it? You've got Congress not doing anything to actually sort out the immigration system which everyone agrees is completely broken. They won't change the law. They won't do anything on asylum or anything at all. And then when the president tries to break that logjam by doing something creative, they want to block him from doing that as well. I think the way we should look at this is to be open-minded. It's a bit of entrepreneurial policymaking as far as I'm concerned. It may have some effect. It doesn’t get the real problem dealt with, which is our laws in our system. But it's got to be Congress that does that, and there's no sign of that happening."

It will come across as creative and entrepreneurial if by Friday Mexico manages to do something that I don’t think they're all that capable of doing, which is stemming the flow of refugees. It will be a great victory for the president. On the other hand, we are at this very moment, President Trump actually has no trade agreements signed. There's one thing with South Korea, but he has this basically rehashing of NAFTA that is on the books and is supposed to be coming up, and this looks like it could scuttle it. Meanwhile we are trying to do these trade negotiations with China, which is the other trading partner that makes lots of cheap stuff. And now we are saying we are also going to make stuff from Mexico really expensive, too, which puts a double squeeze on our businesses here at home, which is why this is the first time you've seen Republican senators to a person stand up to the president because it's been terrible for the economy of a lot of these states."

It's clear that lots of people in the administration didn't agree, and I believe that he will back off when faced with the opposition among business, among his own Republicans, and when he sees what a dumb move he has made in terms of dealing with both the border, the American economy, and with any kind of trade agreement he might try to get."

They can't even pass the asylum thing that both sides agree on. The president is pushing them to do something even if it means this cudgel of tariffs hanging over their head."
    },

      "speaker": "PAGE",

So that makes it possible for him to define victory in a way that enables him not to impose these tariffs. If he wants to get the new NAFTA confirmed, approved by Congress, he's going to have to not launch this new trade war with Mexico."

And they captured for me what has been the most serious point to take away from what we've seen in the last few days, which is actually not so much the reception he's getting in the U.K., whether that is big crowds as he claimed or protests, which were very small, as he claimed. It's actually what he's bringing to it, the attitude which has been tremendously positive and enthusiastic about this phrase, the special relationship, which under President Obama, I was in Number 10 when his state visit was there, and were told very clearly, he's not going to say the words \"special relationship,\" so don’t ask him to because you don’t want to be rebuffed. And clearly President Obama prioritized the relationship with the E.U., even Germany. President Trump loves the U.K., wants this to be a great relationship. That's good news all round, I think."

Ronald Reagan when he met with Thatcher, the protests were astronomical because they were pushing back against -- they wanted a nuclear freeze at that time. Last word on this. Any time you're standing next to a Queen and you have all the pomp and circumstance, that's a good wrapping message for a president."

Get these scooters you can plug in. Reduce fuel by changing the wing shape of the aircraft. Now, how do you pay for all this? There are $1 trillion, 640 billion in tax loopholes.

At the website there were at least five, maybe more, cut and pasted comments essentially plagiarized from different groups. And the campaign admitted that and then tried to fix it with putting references. That obviously is an issue for Joe Biden in particular. As you harken back to 1988, the last time he ran for president, and he had a big plagiarizing problem that was in part one of the reasons he had to step down in that race. What about all of this. Jonah?"

      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "First of all, if you have a reputation as a plagiarist, and you don’t want to remind people of it, it's not like Joe Biden was sitting there cutting and pasting back and forth, but that staffer should be driven off into the woods and left behind. More broadly, look, I'm actually more bullish than a lot of people about Joe Biden. I think he's in some ways trying to replicate George W. Bush's 2000 run by coasting on name recognition and positive feelings. And one of the few things that can destroy that strategy, which has been working surprisingly well for him, is when he talks, because when Joe Biden talks, you never know what's going to happen next. And it's like that feeling when you're walking down a flight of stairs in the dark, and you miss a step. You just don't know where you are going to land. That's what it's like listening to Joe Biden. And he should just keep his mouth shut for as long as he can."

But if you're worried that it's like walking down a flight of dark stairs and you don’t know where you're going to land, that is not the recipe for a successful presidential campaign, first against 20 Democratic competitors and then against President Trump. And I think we had a second example of this today where there was an incident that was of no importance, except it was Joe Biden where a woman whispered in his ear, he came out and said, she pulled me to her, making light."

I think that was not an impressive performance. I think on the substance it's interesting that the Democratic candidates, including him, feel they need an aggressive climate change policy to get through this primary, but the lesson from around the world is an aggressive climate policy is a loser in general elections. Most recently we saw that in Australia where a Labor Party that was heading for victory is now considered to have lost because of its aggressive climate plan."
