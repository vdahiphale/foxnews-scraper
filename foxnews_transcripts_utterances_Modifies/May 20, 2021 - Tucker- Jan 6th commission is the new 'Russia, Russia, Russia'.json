      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Here's a story for you. A mysterious letter appeared on Capitol Hill this week. It was addressed to every member of the U.S. Congress. The letter arrived on the official letterhead of the United States Capitol Police, but it wasn't from the Chief or from any individual officer. Instead, the letter was signed, \"Proud Members of the United States Capitol Police.\" So, it was anonymous. And that was the first tip this was not your average security bulletin. It definitely was not.  It was instead a political demand. The letter instructed Members of Congress to vote yes to establish a quote \"January 6th Insurrection Commission.\" Police officers anonymously demanding the people they protect to vote a certain way on a specific piece of legislation. Haven't seen that before.  Most people have long assumed the Capitol Hill Police Department was a law enforcement agency. Members of Congress certainly believed that. They trust their lives to the Capitol Hill Police, and that's why Capitol Hill Police don't lobby Congress. That would be a dangerous conflict of interest backed by an implied threat -- do what we say or watch your back.  In this case, that's exactly what they were saying to Republicans. Quote, \"We, members of the United States Capitol Hill Police write this letter to express our profound disappointment with the recent comments from both chambers' Minority Leaders (Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell) expressing no need for a January 6 Commission.\" \"We are expected to remain neutral and do our jobs with honor and integrity,\" the letter continued. \"It is unfortunate that our bosses (Congress) are not held to the same standard that we the U.S.C.P. are.\"  Well, that's a ransom note. Imagine getting it from one of your own bodyguards. It might be enough to make you rethink your position, which is of course the point of it. The Capitol Police are now effectively an armed Political Action Committee. So, you've got to ask, what other partisan demands will they make in the future? Do Capitol Police have strong views on voter ID laws? How about taxpayer- funded abortion? Or our next trade deal with China? If so, they've got the muscle to make their voices heard. You can see why this is setting a very bad precedent, but it didn't bother Democrats. It helped them in the short term.  So, they immediately put that letter to use. Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland passed the letter around, his Chief of Staff sent it to every other Chief of Staff on Capitol Hill along with this note, \"Mr. Raskin is hoping your bosses will read this letter before the vote.\"   Well today, CNN announced it has discovered who wrote this letter? Who was it? They're not going to tell you. Because CNN agrees with the contents of the letter, they have decided to keep that information from the public. Sorry, you can't know. It's not like the Capitol Hill Police are Catholic school kids from Covington, Kentucky. No, they are allies of CNN and CNN has an obligation to protect them. And of course, in this case, the stakes are too high not to. As Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reminded us yesterday, what happened on January 6th at the Capitol is comparable to the American Civil War.",

On January 6th, one person was shot to death and she turned out to be an unarmed Trump voter gunned down without explanation by the Capitol Hill Police, but other than that, basically the same thing.  Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio made a similarly sweeping and overheated point. He didn't mention Gettysburg or Shiloh, but Ryan did point out that anyone who votes against this commission is responsible for climate change.",

      "sentences": "A thug, a screamer, hysterical, but apparently, he made a compelling argument. Thirty-five Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for that Commission yesterday. They joined what Tim Ryan described as the party that's living in reality, the party that wear surgical masks outside, the party that thinks it's possible to change your biological sex -- the reality party.   One of the Republicans who voted with the reality party is Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. \"I support a bipartisan January 6 Commission,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"This should not be about party politics or becoming partisan fight.\" Well, of course not, and you wouldn't expect partisanship or party politics from Democrats in the House of Representatives. Pretty funny. To be fair, Adam Kinzinger is widely understood to be among the slowest members of Congress. Mazie Hirono level slow. So, it's entirely possible he had no idea what he was saying when he wrote it, maybe he didn't even write it. What's harder to explain are that several Republicans in the Senate including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine, who have suggested they too will support this Commission.  Unlike Adam Kinzinger, Collins and Cassidy can read without moving their lips. They know what's in this legislation.  The bill that the House passed yesterday was taken directly from the law that established the 9/11 Commission, almost 20 years ago, that legislation instructed Congress to quote: \"Investigate and report to the President and Congress on its findings, conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent acts of terrorism.\" That was the 9/11 law. The new legislation that will create a January 6th Commission demands the very same. Congress must, quote, \"Investigate and report to the President and Congress on its findings, conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures that could be taken to prevent future acts of targeted violence and domestic terrorism.\"   Virtually identical language. That's not accidental. This is the new war on terror. But this war isn't aimed at Al-Qaeda or ISIS or any foreign power. This war is aimed at you and anyone else who stands in the way of the Democratic Party's agenda. Sean Davis understands this. He is the co-founder of \"The Federalist.\" We're happy to have him join us tonight. Sean, thanks so much for coming on. So, before we get to the things that we would like to know about January 6th, and there are quite a few of them, the two red flags in my mind, are one, the fact that Adam Kinzinger is mindlessly supporting it. So of course, it's probably done.  But two, and more to the point, the hysteria, the overheated rhetoric, the clearly disproportionate almost lunatic descriptions of what happened on January 6th tell you that this isn't really a bipartisan effort to get to the truth, is it?  SEAN DAVIS, CO-FOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": No, in fact, it looks a lot more to me like Mueller 2.0, just as the Mueller probe in 2017 was based on a lie, the lie of Russian collusion which didn't exist. It was based on that because they wanted to be able to get Trump and they wanted to be able to have all the law enforcement powers that come with the Special Counsel to go after his people, go after him, accuse him of collusion and obstruction of justice. This new commission is no different. It's Congress. It wants all the law enforcement powers the D.O.J. usually has to subpoena, to indict, maybe even to imprison if people don't do what Congress wants them to. If they're contemptuous of Congress, heaven forbid. And the whole thing is political nonsense. It's meant to give them something to hang on to for the next two years, heading into 2022 that they can use to demonize their opposition to shut their opposition down and make sure that they have no one challenge them heading into the next election.",

What limits are there to their power to compel testimony? Can they just call in any MAGA grandma who happened to be within 500 miles of the Capitol and harangue her and demand that she sits before their Inquisition? Judging by their rhetoric, I don't think they're acknowledging any limit on their powers. And that's actually really scary and if you care about democracy, and the integrity of it, I don't see how you can possibly allow something like this to happen when we know how Democrats handle things.

There's actually a lot that we should know that we don't that Nancy Pelosi could make public today if she wanted to. For example, Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who was shot and killed -- unarmed -- shot and killed in the Capitol building in January 6th, apparently by a member of law enforcement. When she was killed, she was surrounded, and the video shows this, by law enforcement carrying rifles. Here's what we don't know. We don't know who killed Ashli Babbitt. And we don't know why. No one has ever explained that and that's not enough in a democracy, in a civilized country.   You can't just shoot unarmed women and not explain who did it or why, sorry. Julie Kelly believes that. She is a civilized person. She's looked into these questions. She's a senior contributor to \"American Greatness,\" and we're happy to have her on tonight. So, it's just a little much and I don't want to belabor the point, but maybe it can't be said enough. The people calling for a 9/11 Commission to get to the truth have the truth and are withholding it from the rest of us. JULIE KELLY, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\": That's right, Tucker. So that's only one part of what we don't know, is who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt. The Justice Department closed whatever investigation they had. We don't know anything about it.   But to your point, we also don't know -- and you and I have talked about this -- why the U.S. Capitol Police, the Federal government, and Federal Judges are refusing to release more than 14,000 hours of surveillance footage captured just between noon and eight o'clock on January 8th, what are they hiding there?  Also, Tucker, we still don't know who planted the pipe bombs, which also was a narrative that was planted by the U.S. Capitol Police that day. A lot of this actually is tracking back to the U.S. Capitol Police, as they've sort of been this partisan entity in fostering the narrative about January 6th, and so a lot of unanswered questions, you're right.",

Representative Louie Gohmert gave about a half hour speech on the House floor Friday, starting to raise questions about the shooting of Ashli Babbitt, and also the fact this wasn't an armed insurrection, and raising the very dangerous issue of pretrial detention. The government is seeking to keep people who haven't been charged in jail, in solitary confinement conditions in the D.C. jail for months, possibly up to a year before their trials even begin.  And so, we saw we're seeing a little pushback, Chip Roy and Tom Massie sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland last week asking a bunch of questions, especially about pretrial detention.  So, we are starting to see some Republicans push back, but we need more of it. I mean, this is a constitutional humanitarian crisis, especially for the people who have been charged and held in solitary confinement like they're hardened criminals.  At the same time, the same Justice Department who has made public that they are releasing the same type of rioters, actually people charged with far more dangerous crimes, releasing them, expunging their records, and you know, obviously encouraging more violence because they always get away with it.

In just the first round of PPP funding, Kabbage processed 300,000 applications second only to Bank of America and the company acknowledges that between 75 and 90 percent of applications had zero human interaction because maybe a human being would have noticed that many of the phony businesses were farms in New Jersey with names like Ritter Wheat Club, Deely Nuts, Tomato Cramber, Seaweed Bleiman, and my favorite, Beefy King. Of course, the fake farms also gave fake addresses, but not in rural New Jersey, mind you, they were in New Jersey beach towns. The Beefy King cattle ranch turned out to be the home of Joe Mancini. He is the Mayor of Long Beach Township who said quoting here, \"There's no farming here. We're a sandbar for Christ's sake.\" For the record Mancini has no cows, three dogs. It turns out there was an incentive to give out this money for each loan below $350,000.00, Kabbage got five percent between $350,000.00 and $2 million, it got three percent, and above $2 million, one percent. And this is tip of the iceberg stuff.

This is the opposite of what the gay community says they care about. Look, they come out against the conversion therapy. And the argument is, is that if people are going to become who they are, and we shouldn't be persuaded or moved or changed based on other people's experiences or opinions, and here it is, arguably, this is what they're doing.  If we're against conversion therapy because people can be persuaded, who should not be, who should be allowed to be themselves, what do you think is happening when you're talking about this, which is a sexual issue and a gender issue to three to eight year olds? I mean, if we're going to be taken seriously, we've gained a lot of goodwill with the American people, appropriately so that you know, there's all kinds of different lives in America, you know, a majority dynamic, of course, with heterosexuals, a minority dynamic with homosexuals, and you know, drag queens are -- they are fabulous. And Americans, you know, we embrace the underdog and the unusual. But this goes too far. What we should do, of course, if we want to be taken seriously and be able to say that everybody grows up, whoever it is they might end up being is to stop going after people's children, to stop trying to move an agenda that is both political and sexual to America's children. And then that way, obviously, if we're convinced as I am, that as a gay woman that we become who we are, through our experiences. And I don't want people to wonder, gosh, you know, was I persuaded? Was I cajoled? Was I bullied? Was I shaped by someone else? This is what none of us want. We don't want it to be about becoming not gay or moving us into a certain kind of arena. That's also up to parents, and how parents are going to raise their children. But for this to be taxpayer dollars television -- you know, wait 15 years for those three-year-olds to be 18 and then you can have a fascinating conversation and a great program. It might even be called \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" which, of course, gets all kinds of awards, and I enjoy immensely. But that's for adults, it is not for five-year-olds.

Now we have AOC and 34 or so House members using their power, prestige, time, resources to advocate on behalf of MS-13 members. It is truly astonishing. And there is no consideration for the victims of these gang members, because most of them have probably committed horrible crimes while they're here. But if we leave them here, they'll commit even more crime and how do you talk to a crime victim or a crime victim's family member and explain to them why we didn't deport an MS-13 member. It is truly astonishing. And this is on the heels of Joe Biden's policy of what they are now deporting, which is a very timid response, so just basically enough to pass the laugh test, you have to meet so many criteria to get deported. They don't want to deport most criminals. They want to make it hard to deport any gang members. They support sanctuary cities and then this -- to say this is not even enough. It's truly astonishing and people really wonder why we have this issue at the border. Well, we send the message loud and clear that no matter what you do when you get here, you will never be deported. And when you're here, you get everything American citizens get, and then some because you clearly have a lot more representation in Congress than most Americans, and certainly than crime victims, which is horrible. But you also have more representation in the White House. And again, this is like every single one of these things that people that bear the cost to this, the people that live in the neighborhoods that are afflicted by the gang members and by the gang crimes that are intimidated, they are terrorized, that are victims of most horrible crimes. They are not the ones that are making these policies. They're not the ones that are going, you know, driving to Whole Foods, parking outside in their Tesla. It's always the people that are the forgotten people that absorb all of these costs. And it is really, you know, it's so harmful. It's one of the most cynical and dishonest policy debates we've ever had in this country. And you look at this border crisis where you have the Vice President, I don't want to say her name for fear of mispronouncing it, but they put her in charge of this. One of the reasons is to really send the message that anyone can come here because they put somebody in charge of the border that hates law enforcement and is pro-open borders and pro amnesty. So, what is the message to the rest of the world? Come on in. It's open borders. It's amnesty and if you come in, you're never getting kicked out.",

Those would have been the little hairs growing on the heads of little infants in Pittsburgh if they hadn't been killed by abortion and then stitched on to lab rats for experimentation. This study was funded by a grant, by multiple grants from the N.I.A.I.D. office, which is run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and when I was undercover, Planned Parenthood abortion providers told me that they were the ones who were supplying the aborted baby body parts for experiments at the University of Pittsburgh.",

Instead, the letter was signed, \"Proud Members of the United States Capitol Police.\" So, it was anonymous. And that was the first tip this was not your average security bulletin. It definitely was not. It was instead a political demand. The letter instructed Members of Congress to vote yes to establish a quote \"January 6th Insurrection Commission.\" Police officers anonymously demanding the people they protect to vote a certain way on a specific piece of legislation. Haven't seen that before. Most people have long assumed the Capitol Hill Police Department was a law enforcement agency. Members of Congress certainly believed that. They trust their lives to the Capitol Hill Police, and that's why Capitol Hill Police don't lobby Congress. That would be a dangerous conflict of interest backed by an implied threat -- do what we say or watch your back. In this case, that's exactly what they were saying to Republicans. Quote, \"We, members of the United States Capitol Hill Police write this letter to express our profound disappointment with the recent comments from both chambers' Minority Leaders (Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell) expressing no need for a January 6 Commission.\" \"We are expected to remain neutral and do our jobs with honor and integrity,\" the letter continued. \"It is unfortunate that our bosses (Congress) are not held to the same standard that we the U.S.C.P. are.\" Well, that's a ransom note. Imagine getting it from one of your own bodyguards. It might be enough to make you rethink your position, which is of course the point of it. The Capitol Police are now effectively an armed Political Action Committee. So, you've got to ask, what other partisan demands will they make in the future? Do Capitol Police have strong views on voter ID laws? How about taxpayer- funded abortion? Or our next trade deal with China? If so, they've got the muscle to make their voices heard. You can see why this is setting a very bad precedent, but it didn't bother Democrats. It helped them in the short term. So, they immediately put that letter to use. Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland passed the letter around, his Chief of Staff sent it to every other Chief of Staff on Capitol Hill along with this note, \"Mr. Raskin is hoping your bosses will read this letter before the vote.\" Well today, CNN announced it has discovered who wrote this letter? Who was it? They're not going to tell you. Because CNN agrees with the contents of the letter, they have decided to keep that information from the public. Sorry, you can't know. It's not like the Capitol Hill Police are Catholic school kids from Covington, Kentucky. No, they are allies of CNN and CNN has an obligation to protect them. And of course, in this case, the stakes are too high not to. As Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reminded us yesterday, what happened on January 6th at the Capitol is comparable to the American Civil War."

But the Biden Justice Department said they've been charged with effectively trespassing. But you can still see the similarities. During the Civil War, more than half a million people were shot to death. On January 6th, one person was shot to death and she turned out to be an unarmed Trump voter gunned down without explanation by the Capitol Hill Police, but other than that, basically the same thing. Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio made a similarly sweeping and overheated point. He didn't mention Gettysburg or Shiloh, but Ryan did point out that anyone who votes against this commission is responsible for climate change."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "A thug, a screamer, hysterical, but apparently, he made a compelling argument. Thirty-five Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for that Commission yesterday. They joined what Tim Ryan described as the party that's living in reality, the party that wear surgical masks outside, the party that thinks it's possible to change your biological sex -- the reality party. One of the Republicans who voted with the reality party is Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. \"I support a bipartisan January 6 Commission,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"This should not be about party politics or becoming partisan fight.\" Well, of course not, and you wouldn't expect partisanship or party politics from Democrats in the House of Representatives. Pretty funny. To be fair, Adam Kinzinger is widely understood to be among the slowest members of Congress. Mazie Hirono level slow. So, it's entirely possible he had no idea what he was saying when he wrote it, maybe he didn't even write it. What's harder to explain are that several Republicans in the Senate including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine, who have suggested they too will support this Commission. Unlike Adam Kinzinger, Collins and Cassidy can read without moving their lips. They know what's in this legislation. The bill that the House passed yesterday was taken directly from the law that established the 9/11 Commission, almost 20 years ago, that legislation instructed Congress to quote: \"Investigate and report to the President and Congress on its findings, conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent acts of terrorism.\" That was the 9/11 law. The new legislation that will create a January 6th Commission demands the very same. Congress must, quote, \"Investigate and report to the President and Congress on its findings, conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures that could be taken to prevent future acts of targeted violence and domestic terrorism.\" Virtually identical language. That's not accidental. This is the new war on terror. But this war isn't aimed at Al-Qaeda or ISIS or any foreign power. This war is aimed at you and anyone else who stands in the way of the Democratic Party's agenda. Sean Davis understands this. He is the co-founder of \"The Federalist.\" We're happy to have him join us tonight. Sean, thanks so much for coming on. So, before we get to the things that we would like to know about January 6th, and there are quite a few of them, the two red flags in my mind, are one, the fact that Adam Kinzinger is mindlessly supporting it. So of course, it's probably done. But two, and more to the point, the hysteria, the overheated rhetoric, the clearly disproportionate almost lunatic descriptions of what happened on January 6th tell you that this isn't really a bipartisan effort to get to the truth, is it? SEAN DAVIS, CO-FOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": No, in fact, it looks a lot more to me like Mueller 2.0, just as the Mueller probe in 2017 was based on a lie, the lie of Russian collusion which didn't exist. It was based on that because they wanted to be able to get Trump and they wanted to be able to have all the law enforcement powers that come with the Special Counsel to go after his people, go after him, accuse him of collusion and obstruction of justice. This new commission is no different. It's Congress. It wants all the law enforcement powers the D.O.J. usually has to subpoena, to indict, maybe even to imprison if people don't do what Congress wants them to. If they're contemptuous of Congress, heaven forbid. And the whole thing is political nonsense. It's meant to give them something to hang on to for the next two years, heading into 2022 that they can use to demonize their opposition to shut their opposition down and make sure that they have no one challenge them heading into the next election."

What limits are there to their power to compel testimony? Can they just call in any MAGA grandma who happened to be within 500 miles of the Capitol and harangue her and demand that she sits before their Inquisition? Judging by their rhetoric, I don't think they're acknowledging any limit on their powers. And that's actually really scary and if you care about democracy, and the integrity of it, I don't see how you can possibly allow something like this to happen when we know how Democrats handle things.

I mean, you've got dozens of people sitting in solitary confinement tonight for the crime of trespassing. The N.S.A., C.I.A., F.B.I., U.S. Attorneys across the country, all mobilized in response to January 6th. We haven't done enough."

      "utterance": "So, the pretext behind all this is we just want to know more. So, when Adam Kinzinger sends his mindless little tweet, well, it is bipartisan, we just want to know more. There's actually a lot that we should know that we don't that Nancy Pelosi could make public today if she wanted to. For example, Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who was shot and killed -- unarmed -- shot and killed in the Capitol building in January 6th, apparently by a member of law enforcement. When she was killed, she was surrounded, and the video shows this, by law enforcement carrying rifles. Here's what we don't know. We don't know who killed Ashli Babbitt. And we don't know why. No one has ever explained that and that's not enough in a democracy, in a civilized country. You can't just shoot unarmed women and not explain who did it or why, sorry. Julie Kelly believes that. She is a civilized person. She's looked into these questions. She's a senior contributor to \"American Greatness,\" and we're happy to have her on tonight. So, it's just a little much and I don't want to belabor the point, but maybe it can't be said enough. The people calling for a 9/11 Commission to get to the truth have the truth and are withholding it from the rest of us. JULIE KELLY, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, \"AMERICAN GREATNESS\": That's right, Tucker. So that's only one part of what we don't know, is who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt. The Justice Department closed whatever investigation they had. We don't know anything about it. But to your point, we also don't know -- and you and I have talked about this -- why the U.S. Capitol Police, the Federal government, and Federal Judges are refusing to release more than 14,000 hours of surveillance footage captured just between noon and eight o'clock on January 8th, what are they hiding there? Also, Tucker, we still don't know who planted the pipe bombs, which also was a narrative that was planted by the U.S. Capitol Police that day. A lot of this actually is tracking back to the U.S. Capitol Police, as they've sort of been this partisan entity in fostering the narrative about January 6th, and so a lot of unanswered questions, you're right."

But in this specific case, they're the ones withholding the information from us. I mean, I am trying to let my head not explode on the air. Has any Republican as Adam Kinzinger or Dick Cheney's daughter, any of these people pushed for answers to these most basic questions, seriously?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KELLY",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, fortunately, Tucker, we started to see some pushback in the last week or so from House Republicans. Representative Louie Gohmert gave about a half hour speech on the House floor Friday, starting to raise questions about the shooting of Ashli Babbitt, and also the fact this wasn't an armed insurrection, and raising the very dangerous issue of pretrial detention. The government is seeking to keep people who haven't been charged in jail, in solitary confinement conditions in the D.C. jail for months, possibly up to a year before their trials even begin. And so, we saw we're seeing a little pushback, Chip Roy and Tom Massie sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland last week asking a bunch of questions, especially about pretrial detention. So, we are starting to see some Republicans push back, but we need more of it. I mean, this is a constitutional humanitarian crisis, especially for the people who have been charged and held in solitary confinement like they're hardened criminals. At the same time, the same Justice Department who has made public that they are releasing the same type of rioters, actually people charged with far more dangerous crimes, releasing them, expunging their records, and you know, obviously encouraging more violence because they always get away with it. But if you're on the political right, you will not, you will be punished severely."

Earlier this year, the younger Cuomo, the CNN one told his brother not to back down as multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. Now CNN knows about this. They've announced that Chris Cuomo will not face any discipline, but one of their media reporters -- there are two of them -- the creepier one did say today in his scolding little tone that everyone at the network was shocked by the revelations shocked, quote, \"The revelation that Cuomo had advised his brother during strategy sessions has vexed staffers inside CNN. Multiple CNN staffers told me they were bothered by Cuomo's conduct and the violation of traditional journalistic standards.\" I guess they didn't notice when Chris Cuomo had his brother on TV repeatedly, gave him advice on COVID.

Instead, it's to actually denounce some of the women, it is to lie about nursing homes. It's to cover up his own behavior and it's to discredit women. Part of the strategy was apparently to leak, classified -- not classified, but confidential rather, employment documents on one of Cuomo's own accusers. That's the strategy that Chris Cuomo was advising. This is a far cry from the guy who told us, oh, we have to believe all women. He chided us for not believing Dr. Blasey Ford at the time.

Of course, the fake farms also gave fake addresses, but not in rural New Jersey, mind you, they were in New Jersey beach towns. The Beefy King cattle ranch turned out to be the home of Joe Mancini. He is the Mayor of Long Beach Township who said quoting here, \"There's no farming here. We're a sandbar for Christ's sake.\" For the record Mancini has no cows, three dogs. It turns out there was an incentive to give out this money for each loan below $350,000.00, Kabbage got five percent between $350,000.00 and $2 million, it got three percent, and above $2 million, one percent.

I mean, if we're going to be taken seriously, we've gained a lot of goodwill with the American people, appropriately so that you know, there's all kinds of different lives in America, you know, a majority dynamic, of course, with heterosexuals, a minority dynamic with homosexuals, and you know, drag queens are -- they are fabulous. And Americans, you know, we embrace the underdog and the unusual. But this goes too far. What we should do, of course, if we want to be taken seriously and be able to say that everybody grows up, whoever it is they might end up being is to stop going after people's children, to stop trying to move an agenda that is both political and sexual to America's children. And then that way, obviously, if we're convinced as I am, that as a gay woman that we become who we are, through our experiences. And I don't want people to wonder, gosh, you know, was I persuaded? Was I cajoled? Was I bullied? Was I shaped by someone else? This is what none of us want. We don't want it to be about becoming not gay or moving us into a certain kind of arena. That's also up to parents, and how parents are going to raise their children. But for this to be taxpayer dollars television -- you know, wait 15 years for those three-year-olds to be 18 and then you can have a fascinating conversation and a great program. It might even be called \"RuPaul's Drag Race,\" which, of course, gets all kinds of awards, and I enjoy immensely. But that's for adults, it is not for five-year-olds. We can leave children out of it and then move along in our lives and get the respect we deserve."

She happens to be my least favorite singer ever. That tape was the result of an internal prank that's been going on for quite some time on this show. Someone put it in the script and like your average low IQ anchorman, I just read it cold, so I want to apologize for inflicting Cher on you. That won't happen again. Well, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has finally found a problem with Joe Biden's immigration policy. No, she is not crying at yet another fence outside an immigration facility, but she is still pretty upset. She is upset that Joe Biden is not doing enough to help MS-13. He is doing a lot to help, but not enough according to Sandy Cortez. She was one of 34 House Democrats who sent a letter to the D.H.S. Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas urging the government to deport fewer violent gang members and other felons. Quote: \"We urge the Biden administration to pursue humane and just immigration policies that aim to end mass incarceration, criminalization and deportation of immigrants.\" They went on to suggest anyone who is against this is needless to say, wait for it -- racist. Jonathan Fahey is the former Director of I.C.E. We're happy to have him join us tonight. Mr. Fahey, thanks so much for coming on. More violent gang members. I'm just -- I hate to ask you a philosophical question. But what - - other than destroying the United States, why would someone be for this?"

      "utterance": "Other than just simply trying to get as many illegal aliens in the country as possible and to encourage more to come by saying there are no scenario, you'll get thrown out, I can't think of anything whatsoever. It clearly will harm public safety, and this is so remarkable because if you think about it, it wasn't that long ago when Democratic politicians might be on a stage with police officers or crime victims speaking on their behalf. Now we have AOC and 34 or so House members using their power, prestige, time, resources to advocate on behalf of MS-13 members. It is truly astonishing. And there is no consideration for the victims of these gang members, because most of them have probably committed horrible crimes while they're here. But if we leave them here, they'll commit even more crime and how do you talk to a crime victim or a crime victim's family member and explain to them why we didn't deport an MS-13 member. It is truly astonishing. And this is on the heels of Joe Biden's policy of what they are now deporting, which is a very timid response, so just basically enough to pass the laugh test, you have to meet so many criteria to get deported. They don't want to deport most criminals. They want to make it hard to deport any gang members. They support sanctuary cities and then this -- to say this is not even enough. It's truly astonishing and people really wonder why we have this issue at the border. Well, we send the message loud and clear that no matter what you do when you get here, you will never be deported. And when you're here, you get everything American citizens get, and then some because you clearly have a lot more representation in Congress than most Americans, and certainly than crime victims, which is horrible. But you also have more representation in the White House. And again, this is like every single one of these things that people that bear the cost to this, the people that live in the neighborhoods that are afflicted by the gang members and by the gang crimes that are intimidated, they are terrorized, that are victims of most horrible crimes. They are not the ones that are making these policies. They're not the ones that are going, you know, driving to Whole Foods, parking outside in their Tesla. It's always the people that are the forgotten people that absorb all of these costs. And it is really, you know, it's so harmful. It's one of the most cynical and dishonest policy debates we've ever had in this country. And you look at this border crisis where you have the Vice President, I don't want to say her name for fear of mispronouncing it, but they put her in charge of this. One of the reasons is to really send the message that anyone can come here because they put somebody in charge of the border that hates law enforcement and is pro-open borders and pro amnesty. So, what is the message to the rest of the world? Come on in. It's open borders. It's amnesty and if you come in, you're never getting kicked out."

Definitely, and Tucker, I do just want to acknowledge for your viewers that this is a really hard subject to talk about and this is probably one of the most disturbing studies that I have ever reported on. As you say you can't show the images on air. You can watch them in the video that's posted at centerformedicalprogress.org. At the University of Pittsburgh, they were doing a study where they were taking the scalps of five-month-old, aborted babies and they were grafting them onto lab rats and lab mice to see how much longer they could keep them growing for and you can actually see the photographs in the published study of little baby scalps grafted onto the backs of lab rats growing little baby hairs. Those would have been the little hairs growing on the heads of little infants in Pittsburgh if they hadn't been killed by abortion and then stitched on to lab rats for experimentation. This study was funded by a grant, by multiple grants from the N.I.A.I.D. office, which is run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, and when I was undercover, Planned Parenthood abortion providers told me that they were the ones who were supplying the aborted baby body parts for experiments at the University of Pittsburgh."

      "speaker": "DALEIDEN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. No, and Dr. Anthony Fauci owns every bit of this study, because as the head -- and owns every bit of this issue -- because as the head of the N.I.A.I.D. Office, the buck stops with him in terms of how those grants are spent, whether they're being monitored, and made sure that they're ethically and legally and just compliant as far as good stewardship of taxpayer money. The fact that they were using scalps from five-month-old, aborted babies, that means that the heads of those children probably needed to be intact in order to get the scalps, which is an indication that those are either partial birth abortion or even infants delivered alive and whole. Did anybody at Dr. Fauci's office ever asked the researchers at Pittsburgh, hey, how are you getting those scalps? How are you getting whole scalps from the heads of fetuses without a partial birth abortion? I think that Dr. Fauci should be brought in front of the Senate or in front of the United States Congress and asked those questions directly about what his office did to make sure that these grants and that these barbaric experiments were in compliance with all the applicable Federal laws and regulations for those Federal taxpayer grants."
