      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Now the CDC says the COVID vaccine doesn't actually stop the spread of the virus. OK? So, why are we banning unvaccinated teachers from their own classrooms? We talked to one teacher who's taking her case to court and domestic terrorists. That's what the National School Board Association wants to label parents who stand up for their kids. Plus, Biden insults the American people and they're talking back, Raymond Arroyo has it in Seen and Unseen. But first, big blue cities block America. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Well, you can't say we didn't try to warn them. It's becoming more obvious by the day that these power hungry governors and radical mayors are endangering their state's futures. And will eventually see their states left behind. We tried to warn red and blue states that if they went the way of Europe, and kind of slow roll their reopenings, the free states would ultimately leave them all behind. And sure enough, we see it's all come to pass. Democrat runs states and cities that drag their feet on reopening and continue to weigh down their businesses and schools with all these mandates are bringing down the economy for the rest of America. One Bloomberg columnist recently looked at seven metro regions, New York, LA, San Francisco, Chicago, DC, Boston, and Philly. Now while all those places accounted for 25 percent of job losses at the beginning of the pandemic, they're now responsible for a staggering 44.8 percent of the job losses. And by the way, when you break it out further, the picture looks even more grim. The national average unemployment rate is 5.2 percent. But for New York and LA, it's over 10 percent. Chicago still atrocious at 8 percent. Wow. So, why is this happening? Because not everyone has the luxury of working from home people. As one Bloomberg column notes, many high skilled service workers started to work remotely. As a result, low skill service workers and big cities bore most of the recent pandemics economic impact. Anyone with a little bit of gray matter upstairs should have seen this freight train of an unemployment problem coming. It's also harmful. It's also unnecessary. Lawyers and accountants' people like that, they did great. They were able to take up knitting and beekeeping. But Fauci and the government smug COVID enforcers, they didn't consider what they were doing here. The facts tell us something very important about what's going on, about the trillions of dollars in new taxing and spending that Biden after everything we've been through wants to ram through. First of all, we don't need any of it. Most of the U.S. economy is doing fine. And the blue cities simply need to fully reopen, bring everyone back to work and just as we've been saying for months, there's plenty of pent-up demand out there and plenty of job opportunities for people just getting started in the workplace. But the blue state mayors, your friends like Lori Lightfoot, Eric Garcetti, Bill de Blasio, they refuse, they adamantly refuse to do the right thing, and instead, are doing everything possible to prevent life from returning to normal.",

Now while the Left demands obscene new levels of spending, this is happening at the same time, energy policies that they're dictating are having a devastating effect on the same working people are getting hammered on the other side. The cost of oil recently spiked to its highest price since 2014. And we're already seeing headlines in June that said, things are going to get worse and worse, natural gas going through the roof. The bottom-line this winter, Americans can expect bigger utility bills. But it's not just utility bills. Biden's climate crusade will lead to higher prices on everything else. Natural gas is consumed in large volumes to make plastic, fertilizer, steel and cement. Climbing gas prices are adding to the costs of producing manufactured goods at a time when investors are on the edge about the potential for runaway and inflation. There it is. Now this isn't an accident. It's Democratic policy. Biden's team and its supporters on the hill actually want you to travel less, to buy less and frankly, to enjoy life less. Their war on oil and gas is an immediate tax on every American that we're going to pay every day until the GOP returns to power. And now on top of that, yes, they want to spend trillions more. Now Biden and the Left want to radically change America forever.",

But other than the defense buildup, which was very important piece to strength, I think Trump's budget management was fine. I mean, I love it when Biden plays the victim and just blames Trump. I just love it. He blame Trump for the disaster in Afghanistan. He is blaming Trump for the catastrophe at the border. Now he wants to blame Trump for economic policies. Biden is going to reverse these policies as you've said in your introduction, all this spending is going to create higher inflation. The tax hikes are going to sweep across the board and lose jobs and shrink the economy and lower worker wages. One thing here too, you've got this big government dependency on welfare. Right. I mean give Joe Manchin some credit. He wants to - means test any entitlements. He wants to put time limits, and he wants to add back workfare. So, there's a link between work and federal assistance. The Biden crowd, the Left-wing progressives, Bernie Sanders and so forth. They don't want workfare; they don't want means testing.

Now look at - you can play budget games, Laura, you can add budget gimmicks, long-term programs that are permanent welfare and entitlements, you can score them as three years or five years and bring the top-line number down. But what I said before, I think is absolutely crucial to the future of this country. People should receive assistance if they are truly needy, but they need to be means tested. There should be time limits, and they should go back to the Clinton Gingrich welfare reforms, 25 years ago.

So, why are we banning unvaccinated teachers from their own classrooms? We talked to one teacher who's taking her case to court and domestic terrorists. That's what the National School Board Association wants to label parents who stand up for their kids. Plus, Biden insults the American people and they're talking back, Raymond Arroyo has it in Seen and Unseen. But first, big blue cities block America. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Well, you can't say we didn't try to warn them. It's becoming more obvious by the day that these power hungry governors and radical mayors are endangering their state's futures. And will eventually see their states left behind. We tried to warn red and blue states that if they went the way of Europe, and kind of slow roll their reopenings, the free states would ultimately leave them all behind. And sure enough, we see it's all come to pass. Democrat runs states and cities that drag their feet on reopening and continue to weigh down their businesses and schools with all these mandates are bringing down the economy for the rest of America. One Bloomberg columnist recently looked at seven metro regions, New York, LA, San Francisco, Chicago, DC, Boston, and Philly. Now while all those places accounted for 25 percent of job losses at the beginning of the pandemic, they're now responsible for a staggering 44.8 percent of the job losses. And by the way, when you break it out further, the picture looks even more grim. The national average unemployment rate is 5.2 percent. But for New York and LA, it's over 10 percent. Chicago still atrocious at 8 percent. Wow. So, why is this happening? Because not everyone has the luxury of working from home people. As one Bloomberg column notes, many high skilled service workers started to work remotely. As a result, low skill service workers and big cities bore most of the recent pandemics economic impact. Anyone with a little bit of gray matter upstairs should have seen this freight train of an unemployment problem coming. It's also harmful. It's also unnecessary. Lawyers and accountants' people like that, they did great. They were able to take up knitting and beekeeping. But Fauci and the government smug COVID enforcers, they didn't consider what they were doing here. The facts tell us something very important about what's going on, about the trillions of dollars in new taxing and spending that Biden after everything we've been through wants to ram through. First of all, we don't need any of it. Most of the U.S. economy is doing fine. And the blue cities simply need to fully reopen, bring everyone back to work and just as we've been saying for months, there's plenty of pent-up demand out there and plenty of job opportunities for people just getting started in the workplace. But the blue state mayors, your friends like Lori Lightfoot, Eric Garcetti, Bill de Blasio, they refuse, they adamantly refuse to do the right thing, and instead, are doing everything possible to prevent life from returning to normal."

Now while the Left demands obscene new levels of spending, this is happening at the same time, energy policies that they're dictating are having a devastating effect on the same working people are getting hammered on the other side. The cost of oil recently spiked to its highest price since 2014. And we're already seeing headlines in June that said, things are going to get worse and worse, natural gas going through the roof. The bottom-line this winter, Americans can expect bigger utility bills. But it's not just utility bills. Biden's climate crusade will lead to higher prices on everything else. Natural gas is consumed in large volumes to make plastic, fertilizer, steel and cement. Climbing gas prices are adding to the costs of producing manufactured goods at a time when investors are on the edge about the potential for runaway and inflation. There it is. Now this isn't an accident. It's Democratic policy. Biden's team and its supporters on the hill actually want you to travel less, to buy less and frankly, to enjoy life less. Their war on oil and gas is an immediate tax on every American that we're going to pay every day until the GOP returns to power. And now on top of that, yes, they want to spend trillions more. Now Biden and the Left want to radically change America forever."

Actually, inequality went down. So those are terrific achievements. Look, there was a lot of rescues, pandemic rescue spending and borrowing in 2020. But other than the defense buildup, which was very important piece to strength, I think Trump's budget management was fine. I mean, I love it when Biden plays the victim and just blames Trump. I just love it. He blame Trump for the disaster in Afghanistan. He is blaming Trump for the catastrophe at the border. Now he wants to blame Trump for economic policies. Biden is going to reverse these policies as you've said in your introduction, all this spending is going to create higher inflation. The tax hikes are going to sweep across the board and lose jobs and shrink the economy and lower worker wages. One thing here too, you've got this big government dependency on welfare. Right. I mean give Joe Manchin some credit. He wants to - means test any entitlements. He wants to put time limits, and he wants to add back workfare. So, there's a link between work and federal assistance. The Biden crowd, the Left-wing progressives, Bernie Sanders and so forth. They don't want workfare; they don't want means testing.

Whether you think it's 5 trillion, or 4 trillion, or 3.5 trillion, save America killed the bill. Manchin and Sinema had basically killed that bill. Now look at - you can play budget games, Laura, you can add budget gimmicks, long-term programs that are permanent welfare and entitlements, you can score them as three years or five years and bring the top-line number down. But what I said before, I think is absolutely crucial to the future of this country. People should receive assistance if they are truly needy, but they need to be means tested. There should be time limits, and they should go back to the Clinton Gingrich welfare reforms, 25 years ago. There should be work requirements, and there should be education requirements, so that people who are underwater can climb the ladder of opportunity.

The true cost is trillions of dollars of more money that we don't have. They don't want to be responsible though, for borrowing that money. That's why they're demanding that Republican provide them the votes. We are not going to do that. If Joe Biden's out there all day long, saying his plan doesn't cost any money.

      "utterance": "Well, many of these employees, the workers, teachers, they've worked through the epidemic, many of them have immunity derived from - recovering from natural infection. A mandate that doesn't acknowledge the scientific fact that they're that they're immune is not scientifically based. Furthermore, they have a point. I mean, they're essentially being forced to take the vaccine when they have medical qualms about it or other qualms about it. A much better way is just to accommodate them. We know already that the vaccinated people - can actually still spread the disease. So, this is sharp distinction between vaccinated, unvaccinated does not make that much sense. It makes in fact very little sense. Vaccination after a few months is a private matter because you're protected against severe disease. That's good, but you don't - you can still get infected. I personally was infected despite being vaccinated. So, what sense does it make to discriminate against the unvaccinated?"

But now apparently it is peer reviewed. It came out tonight. And they confirm that while hospitalizations, serious illness and death are still helped prevented at six months, the infection is not, and the transmissibility has already been acknowledged, Michael. If you have the vaccine, you can still transmit the virus, according to all these studies. And I think even the CDC has to acknowledge that, so it's kind of a strange thing. But Dr. Fauci had many things to say about vaccine mandates for schools, this is one of them."

We've been doing this for decades, my own children could not have gone to school, if they had not gotten vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella. So, when we see pushback on that, it's as if this never happened before. It's actually ongoing with other vaccines."

      "utterance": "I think that's a really good point. There has never been a vaccine requirement to teach New York City public schools. In New York state that has not been there at all. Also, with these COVID vaccines, they do not provide sterilizing immunity. The comparison between a COVID vaccine and an MMR shot is kind of ridiculous. You can compare the COVID vaccine much more to the flu shot, which generally is choice of if you want to take the flu shot or if you don't want to take the flu shot. It's actually scary when we see people like the good doctor who I'm so glad to see on the show with me here today, taken out of the debate, and this becomes far more political than it becomes about science. It's actually a very frightening thing."

Where are we going to be then? If the teachers are upset, and not all of them, but some of them are, then what are parents of five to 12-year-olds going to be saying in a few months? What are they going to do?"

      "utterance": "I think it makes no sense to mandate it. This should be a choice that parents make in conjunction with consultation with their doctors just we do with many, many other treatments. Making this forced mandated, essentially what it's done is breed distrust in public health. And frankly even in the other vaccines, the vaccine movement, the movement that was against vaccines was a tiny fringe movement before this. By these coercive measures, they have taken that movement and turned it into a much larger movement. It's actually damaging to public health, damaging the children, because it has bred distressed. I don't really understand the push behind it, especially for kids. The risk from COVID, the harm from COVID is so low, to mandate the vaccines, as was just said, it's not a sterilizing vaccine, unlike the MMR vaccine, which is. It's very, very different, and to treat it as if it were the same, I think Dr. Fauci is conflating things intentionally in order to get his way rather than just acknowledging a basic scientific facts."

Now, these people are also subjected to onerous vaccine and mask mandates, and then you see scenes like this from the Biden administration.
