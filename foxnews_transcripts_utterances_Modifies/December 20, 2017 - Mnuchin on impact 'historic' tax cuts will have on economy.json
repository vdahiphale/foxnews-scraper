      "utterance": "I think it's highly unlikely that there's a government shutdown. But I don't want to give that assurance until it's passed by Congress and it gets to the President. I can tell you the President doesn't want to shut down. And you know, I think that the right thing to do is let's get a short-term funding and we'll deal with this issues in January."

      "utterance": "so the budget has $700 billion for increasing the U.S. military, investing in that sort of thing. Is there assurance that these sequesters are going to be cut? I mean these are the battles really even if you punt to January that are going to have to take place in earnest, right."

      "utterance": "Well, you're right. And these are difficult discussions and they're going. We had a cabinet meeting today. The President made it very clear and Secretary Mattis gave a presentation to us on the military. It's a big priority. We've got to make sure that Americans are protected. The President wants our allies to begin to reimburse us for various different costs. But this is a priority of the President to make sure our military has the resources to meet our needs and protect the American people."
