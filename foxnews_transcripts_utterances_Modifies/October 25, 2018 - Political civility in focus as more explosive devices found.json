If you actually look at most normal Americans, they're nowhere as pluralized as it seems the extremes are. And so I think people in Washington need to think very seriously about how we get over this moment, because not only do you have these cultural clashes, and the harassment in the restaurants, you have mob violence, you have assassinations like this.

The tweet this morning does what he always does, which is to double down and take in, and in a reflection of his personal grievance instead of putting the country first. None of this is President Trump's fault. Have the Democrats said horrible things? I completely agree with Matt. Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton are especially complacent. President Obama and Vice President Biden have said divisive things. Everyone is guilty. I cannot believe what has come out of Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter's mouths in the last 24 hours.  It doesn't matter who did this. I would love him to be caught, or her, I would love them to pay the price.

So we have gone beyond even just we don't know who did this, we have no idea what their real motivation was or what their purpose was to, really, Trump is somehow directly responsible for this as incitement. They are not saying that he built the bomb. He obviously didn't have glass shards at home and was constructing this thing on his own. What they are saying, rather explicitly, there were CNN chyrons today that referred to Trump's hit list. There were chyrons that said the president wasn't taking personal responsibility for this. That is people claiming that the president has a direct causative effect on this.  And in this overall climate, I'm sorry, but there isn't equality here in terms of how much moblike behavior and crazy rhetoric is coming from both sides. The president fights back, and that means the president sometimes maybe goes a little bit further than most people, including his supporters, would want. On the left you have mobs on Capitol Hill, mobs on the street, Antifa on both coasts, people who are claiming the president is a traitor, the president is a rapist, the president is a racists, and this has been going on for 18 months.
