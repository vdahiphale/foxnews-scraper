So, what do you do in a safe situation? You think for yourself. So, I think that's where you're going to really -- that's where the real poll is on Tuesday. Now we got -- we -- you were talking about Joe being in Atlanta and we listen to Atlanta -- we listen to his speech yesterday when he came in during THE FIVE, which was grossly unfair. It's kind of surreal for me. Because people talk about Trump repeating himself, what about the candidate who constantly makes the familiar promises to African-Americans about homeownership, about education about wages and saying it as though none of these things have happened yet, who does that indict?  Who has been in power for 45 years? Who is that indicting? It's actually indicting Joe Biden, who has gotten none of this done. And so he has the gall to stand up there and repeat the same things he said over and over again as though they were now magically come true and you shouldn't support Trump, who in four years has done more for real wages, for real unemployment, and real opportunity in four years than I guess Biden did in 40 years.  I am jealous of Democrats who are able to say the same stuff every four years and no one bothers to call them on it when every metric that they promise gets worse. Democrat -- I mean, Trump did so much to enhance the freedom of the average African-American while Joe was, quote, \"putting them back in chains\" to use his phrases, merely quoting him.",

But I would say, how credible is this guy? I mean, I just don't know. What I do know is that, you know, the Trump camp took him and all their documents to a house in Virginia and had a Wall Street Journal reporter, somebody, you know, at a credible newspaper, our own parent company, and that reporter then not only listened to him, but went through the documents and came to a conclusion that Joe Biden did nothing wrong, no money changed hands to the Bidens. And so, I think to myself, you know, this just is incredible, so maybe that's why the media focuses on things people care about like, you know, we can't go inside restaurants even though it's getting cold, we can't send our kids to school.

Excuse me, Juan, let me just give Peter some advice, ask the vice president, hey, Mr. Vice President, have you ever met Tony? Let's see if he can answer that question, because that would settle a lot of things. You bring up credibility, let's bring it up. Who do you believe? Do you believe the naval officer that held a high security clearance that commanded a nuclear submarine that has e-mails and documentation and voice recordings, who went to the FBI under penalty of perjury and said his story, or do you believe the political family with a history of plagiarism and shady deal making who's hidden and ran for the hills since this broke and three of their business partners are in prison? The deal is very simple. They cooked it up in 2015, while Joe was V.P., the Chinese communist sent $10 million to the Biden family, five million of it was an interest-free loan, the other five million went to the holding company where Jim Biden the bro held back 10 for the big guy. So then Tony meets with the V.P. twice on this and then when Tony wants to put in good corporate governance, Joe Biden says no, they cut Tony out of the deal and then they smear him as a Russian agent when he goes to the FBI. But the best part of the story is this. The communist Chinese guy who they were dealing the deal with, he was under FBI surveillance because he was a spy. And then when he gets popped by the SDNY for bribery, Hunter Biden represents him for a million-dollar fee and now he's serving three years in jail. So, the Biden family was doing business with Chinese communist spies were who under FBI surveillance, boom. How's that for a boom?",

On October 21st, Harold Preston, an officer in Houston, he'd been a police officer for 41 years, he was shot and killed in a domestic disturbance. I bring that up, because in both of these instances with the police in Philadelphia, and the late Harold Preston, they arrived first, and they dealt with a risk. And one incident went one way, and led to rioting and looting which by the way, have nothing to do with racial injustice, it has to do with opportunity for looting. And the other one, you don't even hear about it. You maybe hear about it on THE FIVE that a police officer was killed, but they both have the same thing in common. Both police officers arrived first and have to deal with an unknown risk. And we allow the destruction to follow because our leaders are cowards. So, I'm going to cede the rest of my time for the next block because this is very important. This is not gross indifference of our leaders, it's the tragedy of the commons. They are looking out for themselves at the expense of the citizens. They're having these hearings on the Manchester bombing which happened in May 17th, 23 people were killed. They were interviewing security who had identified the bomber before he set his bomb off and killed nearly two dozen people. The reason why the security people didn't go after the guy, he was afraid that he would be branded a racist because the man was \"Asian, which is a Muslim.\" So, the security was fearful of being called out. This instinct is playing out nationwide in every liberal city where their liberal governance. They are fearful of being called racist when they condemn looting, or when they condemn arson or injuries, when innocent people are attacked. That is -- that trend is going to lead to the further destruction of our society. I'm living in New York City. Everybody I know that owns businesses are hiring security because they expect no one's going to be there for them. I mean, the mayor is gone. He's nowhere. The very wealthy anchors, they're going to go to the Hamptons. I'm going to stay downtown where my apartment is and I'm going to see what happens. And I have security. I've hired security.

I looked in the internals, they under sample Republicans by eight, they oversample independents and other by 14, that's where they hide the Democrat leaners, by the way and they have President Trump losing his base.

When you are alone in that voting booth, you are far from emotional and irrational peers, co- workers and neighbors who are constantly trying to judge you. Inside that voting booth, you can think for yourself, you can go with your gut and you don't have to worry about Twitter mobs or anybody the screaming memes of the media coming after you. So, what do you do in a safe situation? You think for yourself. So, I think that's where you're going to really -- that's where the real poll is on Tuesday. Now we got -- we -- you were talking about Joe being in Atlanta and we listen to Atlanta -- we listen to his speech yesterday when he came in during THE FIVE, which was grossly unfair. It's kind of surreal for me. Because people talk about Trump repeating himself, what about the candidate who constantly makes the familiar promises to African-Americans about homeownership, about education about wages and saying it as though none of these things have happened yet, who does that indict? Who has been in power for 45 years? Who is that indicting? It's actually indicting Joe Biden, who has gotten none of this done. And so he has the gall to stand up there and repeat the same things he said over and over again as though they were now magically come true and you shouldn't support Trump, who in four years has done more for real wages, for real unemployment, and real opportunity in four years than I guess Biden did in 40 years. I am jealous of Democrats who are able to say the same stuff every four years and no one bothers to call them on it when every metric that they promise gets worse. Democrat -- I mean, Trump did so much to enhance the freedom of the average African-American while Joe was, quote, \"putting them back in chains\" to use his phrases, merely quoting him."

I just want to mention one thing about Arizona, because I feel like it's super important that President Trump go there, he really needs to win it. And a lot of talk has been done about the suburban women, but not enough study and discussion has been centered around Latinos, especially Latino men. And President Trump is on track to do as well as he did in 2016 or better with Latino men, not just in Arizona, but across the board and that can help balance out some of the losses he may have had in the suburbs."

We would have to sedate the entire CNN anchor team with elephant tranquilizers. But today, more journalists are Democrats and are for warn. If you report on this story, you will be helping Trump get re-elected, so don't touch this story with a 10-foot pole, or a Hunter's case, a 10-foot strip pole. It's the same thing with riots.

I think that the bigger picture is so much more important, the way that the president frames it, right? He says, go with me, that the American dream, go with him you get the socialist nightmare. But these issues of character, if that is what we're worried about, right, so if that's what they say they are concerned about, this would be one of those issues.

Seth McFarlane did when he hosted the Oscars and so did Brad Pitt when he was dating Gwyneth Paltrow. He went up to Harvey Weinstein reportedly and threatened him because of something that Harvey Weinstein had said to his then girlfriend. And there are a few lonely voices who are covering this and, you know, what the hope is that Hunter Biden is just a really yucky person who has done some classless things and made questionable choices and they hope that that is how it is contained. And this is what I warned about during the impeachment, is that, if you lower the bar so much and if you create this simple threshold for impeachment, then you have to apply that universally to both sides. And if Tony Bobulinski is saying that Hunter Biden knew about all of this, if any of that is minutely proven and Joe Biden took a dime from any of that, then why wouldn't you, if you are using the same threshold and the same standard, why would you not impeach Joe Biden?

I mean, you know, for me, the bottom line -- the bottom line here is conspiracy theories are very entertaining, including a possible impeachment hearing before the man is elected. But I would say, how credible is this guy? I mean, I just don't know. What I do know is that, you know, the Trump camp took him and all their documents to a house in Virginia and had a Wall Street Journal reporter, somebody, you know, at a credible newspaper, our own parent company, and that reporter then not only listened to him, but went through the documents and came to a conclusion that Joe Biden did nothing wrong, no money changed hands to the Bidens. And so, I think to myself, you know, this just is incredible, so maybe that's why the media focuses on things people care about like, you know, we can't go inside restaurants even though it's getting cold, we can't send our kids to school. That's what people care about, and that's what get reporting coverage not wild conspiracy theories."

      "utterance": "-- this question for the next week. We'll see if they can do this. Excuse me, Juan, let me just give Peter some advice, ask the vice president, hey, Mr. Vice President, have you ever met Tony? Let's see if he can answer that question, because that would settle a lot of things. You bring up credibility, let's bring it up. Who do you believe? Do you believe the naval officer that held a high security clearance that commanded a nuclear submarine that has e-mails and documentation and voice recordings, who went to the FBI under penalty of perjury and said his story, or do you believe the political family with a history of plagiarism and shady deal making who's hidden and ran for the hills since this broke and three of their business partners are in prison? The deal is very simple. They cooked it up in 2015, while Joe was V.P., the Chinese communist sent $10 million to the Biden family, five million of it was an interest-free loan, the other five million went to the holding company where Jim Biden the bro held back 10 for the big guy. So then Tony meets with the V.P. twice on this and then when Tony wants to put in good corporate governance, Joe Biden says no, they cut Tony out of the deal and then they smear him as a Russian agent when he goes to the FBI. But the best part of the story is this. The communist Chinese guy who they were dealing the deal with, he was under FBI surveillance because he was a spy. And then when he gets popped by the SDNY for bribery, Hunter Biden represents him for a million-dollar fee and now he's serving three years in jail. So, the Biden family was doing business with Chinese communist spies were who under FBI surveillance, boom. How's that for a boom?"

I'm trying really hard not to talk about Jack Dorsey's beard. I made a commitment in the beginning of the year I wasn't going to mention physical appearance, so I'm just going to try to stay with that. But Juan, I mean, it's clear they couldn't name one liberal organization, one prominent Democrat that they've ever flagged for censorship yet I could name dozens of conservatives off the top of my head right now that have been censored. They say, oh, right now, we don't know any evidence if there was any Russia disinformation with Hunter Biden, no evidence of hacking, and no evidence that it was forgeries, yet you still, the New York Post, can't tweet that article out. And they say we have all these fact-checkers looking into it, and then Bob (INAUDIBLE) told Tucker Carlson, not one representative from Twitter, or Facebook has called him to help verify the story. So, you know, we bring these guys in every couple of months. They say they don't discriminate, and they fly home and discriminate. I'm sick of it."

I am just wondering where the traditional liberals went, the free speech absolutist. They were the ones that were always on this side, and now they're not. And they're on the side of an entity that is about controlling narratives. It's not about -- you don't cure censorship with more censorship so it's bizarre that we're even having this discussion. But you have to look at what they're doing. They're controlling stories. They're controlling narratives through algorithms. That is the scary part of this."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I think -- here's the thing is that under the law, as it was written in 1996, when the internet was just getting started, the section 230 basically what it says is, you cannot be sued or held liable for anything that is that somebody else posts on your site. But it also said that you are a private company, and therefore you're allowed to do whatever you want. So, as Neil Ferguson said today on \"THE DAILY BRIEFING,\" it's a catch 22 for the consumer of the information. And this is what I think. When you saw Ted Cruz today make that statement in the way that he did, even though this was an issue in 2016 and nobody did anything, and now we're in 2020, I think this is going to be an issue that Republicans and Democrats both try to run on in 2024. In the meantime, technology continues to grow by leaps and bounds. So, Washington is always so far behind where these guys are."

      "utterance": "I'm not a fan of it, but I don't think these big tech corporations have to worry about conservatives as much in terms of that 1996 law that Dana just pointed out as people like Elizabeth Warren. And if she becomes a part of the Biden administration, if he's elected, then she's going to do whatever she can if she is labor secretary, or treasury secretary to dismantle these companies and take them apart because I think you have a pretty robust antitrust appetite when it comes to big tech companies. And that's from both sides. So, it's very interesting that that employees of these companies have poured so much money into Joe Biden's campaign and other Democrat races because it's Democrats who want to take them apart and Republicans who are looking for this federal imposition of fairness. And Jack Dorsey perjured himself today when he said that the New York Post story is available for retweet. It is not. You cannot access it and you cannot retweet it and that is a lie. And he is the CEO of that company and he knows better."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Philadelphia rocked by a second night of violence and chaos as authorities try to regain control of the streets. Police say 1,000 looters targeted and vandalized businesses. This all broke up -- broke out after police shot a black man, 27-year-old Walter Wallace Jr. Now, officers say he was carrying a knife and ignored orders to drop it before they open fire. They killed him on Monday afternoon in that event. And other cities are already bracing for unrest over the election. Beverly Hills will close iconic Rodeo Drive next Tuesday over security concerns. And places like New York City, Chicago, and Baltimore are preparing for unrest, and it could extend way beyond that. In fact, Kennedy, we know that even in Texas, they are preparing for that eventuality."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "And I think what that shows is people are more optimistic than you would think that the President is going to be reelected. Because I think that's the only way you're going to see real unrest. If Joe Biden wins in a landslide, I think it's going to bring the temperature down a little bit. If the race is too close to call on election night, I don't think people are going to freak out as much. But if the president wins out, right, that is when you're going to see this kind of reaction. And it's interesting in Philadelphia -- Pennsylvania is one of the states that I think is actually a little bit closer than the polling dictates. So if this is happening in Philadelphia, which last I checked is in Pennsylvania, that could be a bad sign for the state for Joe Biden, regardless of his Scranton ties. And it's not just there, it is happening in cities in California, there were also cold protests in reaction to this killing."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I mean, we hear a lot about the victim who was killed. He was an armed and violent criminal. I believe he was awaiting trial for a violent assault. He put a gun to a woman's head previously, but I know that was in the past. On October 21st, Harold Preston, an officer in Houston, he'd been a police officer for 41 years, he was shot and killed in a domestic disturbance. I bring that up, because in both of these instances with the police in Philadelphia, and the late Harold Preston, they arrived first, and they dealt with a risk. And one incident went one way, and led to rioting and looting which by the way, have nothing to do with racial injustice, it has to do with opportunity for looting. And the other one, you don't even hear about it. You maybe hear about it on THE FIVE that a police officer was killed, but they both have the same thing in common. Both police officers arrived first and have to deal with an unknown risk. And we allow the destruction to follow because our leaders are cowards. So, I'm going to cede the rest of my time for the next block because this is very important. This is not gross indifference of our leaders, it's the tragedy of the commons. They are looking out for themselves at the expense of the citizens. They're having these hearings on the Manchester bombing which happened in May 17th, 23 people were killed. They were interviewing security who had identified the bomber before he set his bomb off and killed nearly two dozen people. The reason why the security people didn't go after the guy, he was afraid that he would be branded a racist because the man was \"Asian, which is a Muslim.\" So, the security was fearful of being called out. This instinct is playing out nationwide in every liberal city where their liberal governance. They are fearful of being called racist when they condemn looting, or when they condemn arson or injuries, when innocent people are attacked. That is -- that trend is going to lead to the further destruction of our society. I'm living in New York City. Everybody I know that owns businesses are hiring security because they expect no one's going to be there for them. I mean, the mayor is gone. He's nowhere. The very wealthy anchors, they're going to go to the Hamptons. I'm going to stay downtown where my apartment is and I'm going to see what happens. And I have security. I've hired security. My building hired security. That's what we have to do because we no longer trust our local government. It sucks. It's terrible. And people who are now back in New York who have to be here for work, it's going to be interesting when you see what really happens."

      "utterance": "Well, I think that what happened in Philadelphia has to do with a police shooting, not anything to do with Election Day. And I think it's grossly inaccurate to somehow create that impression. The question Philadelphia is why did he have to be shot and killed? His mother was explaining to the police, yelling to the police that he had mental issues, and I think that's what people are concerned about. With regard to the election stuff, I think there's nobody who stirs up fear and anxiety and the possibility of violence more than President Trump when he tells Proud Boys stand back, stand by, and tells people to go monitor those who are voting. It's just unbelievable. And I think he thinks that's an excuse if the election goes the wrong way for him to say that this election was illegitimate, but it's damaging to the country."

I mean, I will just say, Juan, a black male was shot dead the other night, a black female shot in the leg, three black men were shot in the abdomen, a white woman was shot in the knee, and a white man was shot in the back. ABC News crews were attacked and multiple ATMs were blown to smithereens. The Proud Boys weren't anywhere near any of that, OK. This is a city in Philadelphia that has a majority black police department, has a black police chief, has a Democrat mayor, and a Democrat governor. Somehow this is Trump's fault, I know that's what you're going to say, but it's not. Whether this guy had mental problems or was perfectly fit upstairs, he was charging police officers with a knife. That's a problem. I don't know how you deal with it, but it was a sad situation. And if this happens on Election Day or afterwards, I don't know what you're going to do and I don't know how -- what kind of excuse you're going to make up. You can't blame it on a Post Office conspiracy. You're not going to be able to blame it again on Russia collusion with the Hunter laptop. I don't know what the excuses this time for violence.
