      "sentences": "You did a great show tonight. All right, you take care. I'm Laura Ingraham, this is The Ingram Angle from the swamp tonight. And the reaction from the Democrats and media over the last 24 hours reveals many truths, but one truth in particular. The folks who are pushing this impeachment are no longer confident in their position. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, Lee Zeldin are here to explain. Also tonight, his aggressive reporting on Ukraine and the Bidens has made him public enemy number one to the Left.  Tonight John Solomon sets the record straight, and we have new reporting that'll rock Washington tomorrow. Plus, violent leftist attacks from coast to coast. We speak to a former MMA fighter who took on Antifa and a Republican Congressman's son who was attacked and spray-painted in the face by young Socialists in North Carolina. But first, Democrats impeach themselves. That is the focus of Tonight's Angle.  Despite relentless attempts to play act about how competent their impeachment case is, well Democrats and their kissing cousins in the media seem pretty shaky and incoherent. After the claim of a quid pro quo has sizzled, Democrats are frantically grasping for something that people can actually understand about this Ukraine thing.  Let's just pick bribery out of a hat.",

      "sentences": "OK, here's the problem, yes. Of course Nancy, it's in the Constitution, we can read, OK. President may be impeached for bribery, treason or high crimes and misdemeanors. But even assuming the Democrats strained in ridiculous interpretation of the facts, and I do not assume them, but this is the sake of their argument, attempted bribery isn't in the Constitution. Remember, Ukraine got its military aid, it was 14 days delayed, big deal. And remember, Ukraine never made any public statement about any investigation, and the fellow on the other end of the call, Zelensky, said he didn't feel pressured at all. He didn't even know aid was frozen to his country until weeks later.   So the call, in his words, was normal. So it's another swing and a miss. But that's OK, that's OK, because Democrats think they're cats. They have nine political lives when it comes to impeachment. So if the country is tuning them out and they were tuning them out, well it's only because their star witnesses lack a certain je ne sais quoi. NBC News tweeting, the first two witnesses called Wednesday testified to President Trump's scheme, but lacked the pizzazz necessary to capture public attention. Reuters had a similar take, fireworks and explosive moments were scarce. Ooh! Again, this just demonstrates that Democrats aren't serious about underlying substance. Their lack of dramatic flourish isn't the problem, it's the absence of facts that's the problem. The public though is I think a lot savvier than the Democrats think.  Case in point, we at Fox News crushed the competition last night and throughout the entire day of programming. Now, this must be very upsetting to the other cables and I want to rub it in their faces, no not at all, but after all this was supposed to be was it not their big payoff. Impeachment is upon us.   But even their viewers haven't seemed to have bought into the narrative. And just when you thought CNN couldn't go lower, they do go lower. Like this moment with Kellyanne Conway.",

In the past year, since taking control of Congress, these Democrats have done nothing for working Americans, except act on their own maniacal desire to dislodge President Trump from office.

Congressman Zeldin, you see their narratives shifting, they're adding, it's like a little basket of their own deplorables.

And the reaction from the Democrats and media over the last 24 hours reveals many truths, but one truth in particular. The folks who are pushing this impeachment are no longer confident in their position. Congressman Kevin McCarthy, Lee Zeldin are here to explain. Also tonight, his aggressive reporting on Ukraine and the Bidens has made him public enemy number one to the Left. Tonight John Solomon sets the record straight, and we have new reporting that'll rock Washington tomorrow. Plus, violent leftist attacks from coast to coast. We speak to a former MMA fighter who took on Antifa and a Republican Congressman's son who was attacked and spray-painted in the face by young Socialists in North Carolina. But first, Democrats impeach themselves. That is the focus of Tonight's Angle. Despite relentless attempts to play act about how competent their impeachment case is, well Democrats and their kissing cousins in the media seem pretty shaky and incoherent. After the claim of a quid pro quo has sizzled, Democrats are frantically grasping for something that people can actually understand about this Ukraine thing. Let's just pick bribery out of a hat."

      "utterance": "OK, here's the problem, yes. Of course Nancy, it's in the Constitution, we can read, OK. President may be impeached for bribery, treason or high crimes and misdemeanors. But even assuming the Democrats strained in ridiculous interpretation of the facts, and I do not assume them, but this is the sake of their argument, attempted bribery isn't in the Constitution. Remember, Ukraine got its military aid, it was 14 days delayed, big deal. And remember, Ukraine never made any public statement about any investigation, and the fellow on the other end of the call, Zelensky, said he didn't feel pressured at all. He didn't even know aid was frozen to his country until weeks later. So the call, in his words, was normal. So it's another swing and a miss. But that's OK, that's OK, because Democrats think they're cats. They have nine political lives when it comes to impeachment. So if the country is tuning them out and they were tuning them out, well it's only because their star witnesses lack a certain je ne sais quoi. NBC News tweeting, the first two witnesses called Wednesday testified to President Trump's scheme, but lacked the pizzazz necessary to capture public attention. Reuters had a similar take, fireworks and explosive moments were scarce. Ooh! Again, this just demonstrates that Democrats aren't serious about underlying substance. Their lack of dramatic flourish isn't the problem, it's the absence of facts that's the problem. The public though is I think a lot savvier than the Democrats think. Case in point, we at Fox News crushed the competition last night and throughout the entire day of programming. Now, this must be very upsetting to the other cables and I want to rub it in their faces, no not at all, but after all this was supposed to be was it not their big payoff. Impeachment is upon us. But even their viewers haven't seemed to have bought into the narrative. And just when you thought CNN couldn't go lower, they do go lower. Like this moment with Kellyanne Conway."

In the past year, since taking control of Congress, these Democrats have done nothing for working Americans, except act on their own maniacal desire to dislodge President Trump from office. That's the real impeachable offense and that's the angle.

Congressman Zeldin, you see their narratives shifting, they're adding, it's like a little basket of their own deplorables.

You're going to have increased violent crime. You're going to have increased murder. And we see cities like Baltimore and Chicago and others around the country where those numbers are at the highest they have ever been. And it takes aggressive law enforcement to deal with it. And that is not what we are seeing. We're seeing the opposite really. And we're seeing prosecutors who are basically promoting a diminished enforcement."

New York became a safer, cleaner place because they didn't let things slide. Your reaction to this antipolice sentiment that we see developing across the country, Leo?"

If there was a crime, I would like to know with a crime is, because all they are doing is just riding around. It's called expression. But what we are talking about is this. There has been an overcharging of people in this country, and even, we will all agree that even President Trump saw that with the First Step.
