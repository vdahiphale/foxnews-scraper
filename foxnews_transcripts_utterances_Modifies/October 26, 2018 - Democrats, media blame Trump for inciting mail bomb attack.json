We don't quite understand the relationship he has with his mother in South Florida, but we were given the impression that he was spending a lot of time in that van. Not quite homeless, but getting so close to the edge of that. From my experience, 12 devices take a significant period of time because you've got cut all the pipes, assemble them with the explosive powder, and then he's got to go to the physical process of addressing all of them and then delivering them. So, it would have been nice to have that question get in about premeditation because they can tell you whether for months he'd been planning this, so maybe he was simply a lone actor, or whether it was in a very short time frame indicating that others may have helped support him.",

People like to vote for their local congressman or woman based on some of the local issues. When you nationalize it, it's risky. And there was a New York Times piece a few weeks ago We still think this is going to blow up in the Republicans' face. I think the opposite is happening. I think the president's rallies have had a real impact in these battleground states. And evidence of that was today, The Washington Post had this piece where they went to California, where there's something like eight critical House races, and the Democrats think they're going to flip five or six of them. And they interviewed all these voters who said, \"Actually, we don't think the Democrats are going to win a lot of these races,\" and these Democratic voters are nervous that it's going to be like election 2016 redux, where they're going to be left crying, like they were on election night at Hillary Clinton's headquarters. So these were Democrats in The Washington Post saying that Trump has gotten out there, President Trump, and has lit up his base: between Kavanaugh, the caravan, the other issues that he's focused on. And Democrats may not like it, but he has nationalized the election. Yes, he's made it about himself, for better or for worse, and it's fired up Republicans.",

So Democrats are worried a little bit about that. And the thing about the caravan is that there is -- it is visual, OK? So President Obama saying that he want to send troops to the border is the same thing as President Trump doing it. It just happens to be a week before the midterms, but the caravan is there. It's not about the caravan, though. And I think the White House could do a better job of explaining to people it's the daily assault on the border of 640 or so average attempts a day to cross the border. So in addition to the caravan, there's all of these things happening there. And I think that President Trump will start to try to get something with Mexico like he has with Canada, which is Canada agrees to deal with asylum- seekers in Canada. People that want to come into the United States, Canada says, \"We will process them here.\" We should have the same thing in Mexico. And President Trump has an opportunity with the new leader that's taking over in December or January in Mexico, he could try to do that. Because this issue is interesting for the midterms.

And the Democrats are anti-process, and that's why they can push these foolish ideas and then demean those against them. Because they know the Republicans will get the job done.

Obviously, there appear to be the forever stamp which was self-adhesive, but there was talk in your reporting about may be saliva. I don't know if that's from the back of the envelope. What do we know about the evidence?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "What we know about the evidence I think is really two-fold. One is that there was a tremendous wealth of evidence because the bombs did not explode. But secondly, and I think more importantly from the FBI director that they did quickly recover a latent fingerprint on the envelope that carried the pipe bomb that was going to the Democratic congresswoman, Maxine Waters, and then they were able to extract DNA from other suspect devices. So they had three data points. They all aligned with Cesar Sayoc, and then they had his prints in the database because he had a pretty extensive criminal history and was known to law enforcement. So I don't know at this point whether the DNA was link from saliva or it may have been a fiber such as -- or a hair that was attached to that black electricians tape. Remember, I was reporting that yesterday? That's like a magnet for DNA evidence."

But we don't see any evidence of political violence previously, do we?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "What we're able to find in our research today, Juan, is that there was a bomb threat. I believe the date was 2002. I do not have a lot more granularity and texture of whether that bomb threat related to a political idea or motivation. But Director Wray said that they hope in the coming days to have more information about what the motivation was, whether it was political, and even more importantly, whether he was acting alone or he helped from others who are unaware of what he was planning with the packages."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "I was trying to ask at the news conference, but I never got my question in for some reason, about the level of premeditation, right? Because when you're talking about over a dozen devices, that takes a significant period of time for an individual, was he doing them just in his van or was he doing them at his mother's home? We don't quite understand the relationship he has with his mother in South Florida, but we were given the impression that he was spending a lot of time in that van. Not quite homeless, but getting so close to the edge of that. From my experience, 12 devices take a significant period of time because you've got cut all the pipes, assemble them with the explosive powder, and then he's got to go to the physical process of addressing all of them and then delivering them. So, it would have been nice to have that question get in about premeditation because they can tell you whether for months he'd been planning this, so maybe he was simply a lone actor, or whether it was in a very short time frame indicating that others may have helped support him."

And evidence of that was today, The Washington Post had this piece where they went to California, where there's something like eight critical House races, and the Democrats think they're going to flip five or six of them. And they interviewed all these voters who said, \"Actually, we don't think the Democrats are going to win a lot of these races,\" and these Democratic voters are nervous that it's going to be like election 2016 redux, where they're going to be left crying, like they were on election night at Hillary Clinton's headquarters."

      "speaker": "So these were Democrats in The Washington Post saying that Trump has gotten out there, President Trump, and has lit up his base",
      "utterance": "between Kavanaugh, the caravan, the other issues that he's focused on. And Democrats may not like it, but he has nationalized the election. Yes, he's made it about himself, for better or for worse, and it's fired up Republicans."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So the other -- the other aspect here is Latino voters. Interesting information out today. They don't feel like they're being addressed by Democrats, they are not just monolithic voters on one thing, on immigration. It's not motivating them to get out to vote. So Democrats are worried a little bit about that. And the thing about the caravan is that there is -- it is visual, OK? So President Obama saying that he want to send troops to the border is the same thing as President Trump doing it. It just happens to be a week before the midterms, but the caravan is there. It's not about the caravan, though. And I think the White House could do a better job of explaining to people it's the daily assault on the border of 640 or so average attempts a day to cross the border. So in addition to the caravan, there's all of these things happening there. And I think that President Trump will start to try to get something with Mexico like he has with Canada, which is Canada agrees to deal with asylum- seekers in Canada. People that want to come into the United States, Canada says, \"We will process them here.\" We should have the same thing in Mexico. And President Trump has an opportunity with the new leader that's taking over in December or January in Mexico, he could try to do that. Because this issue is interesting for the midterms. It's not all -- it's not the No. 1 issue for everybody, but it will motivate some people."

But I think it's -- what Trump said was very important, because he mentioned the word \"process.\" And when he explained it as a process, you could understand the idea of line cutting, that if you're in the process for ten years, trying to become a citizen and you see this, you think -- you you sense that it is unfair. And the Democrats are anti-process, and that's why they can push these foolish ideas and then demean those against them. Because they know the Republicans will get the job done. They know they're going to protect the border. They know that the agents will be out there. So they can actually romanticize a terrible idea, knowing that the Republicans will actually fix the problem. And it's sad, because it's not going to end well for those poor people that are -- that are marching along. They're the pawns in all of this. They're the -- left-wing activists and politicians have pushed them along, and they're not going to get in. Maybe a few of them well. They will all be turned back."

It was very intense, and I was really not a very good colleague, because I tucked in behind Jesse the entire time. So we'll have a whole package for you. It's to get you in the Halloween spirit."

The track kept him with a bone exposed overnight. Dirty gauze bandages, and took him to a vet, dumped him to euthanize him. Thank the lord, the vet saved his life. And there, my girlfriend Lara Trump and I this morning were with Bart. And Bart now has a great home. He got his cast off, and that's why Lara Trump, Congressman Matt Gates, it's a whole bipartisan support, are supporting voting yes to Amendment 13 to ban greyhound racing. You can still gamble, just not run these dogs 45 miles per hour and drug them on cocaine."
