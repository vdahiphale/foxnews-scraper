So that they can warp public opinion which they're doing, so that they can shake the confidence of Republicans who support the president, which is happening, I think. And handicap him with a hole, big, giant cloud headed for 2020. The reason why they're doing this is not -- it's because they hate him. Because -- do this little -- do this little experiment, I wrote this stuff down almost with a swear word. Imagine a Democratic president doing this in three years, ushering in prison reform, Democratic president, drawing down wars because he's stingy about blood and treasure, ushering in record employment for women and minorities, growing medium household income 8.3 percent to a record $66,000, placing restrictions on China for suppressing Muslims. That sounds like the greatest Democratic president in history, definitely better than Obama. He just happens to be a Republican. And he just happens to be Donald Trump.   So it's all about how much they hate the guy because they should be embracing his policies. I'm amazed how many Democrats are upset about this siring decision when, basically, it's always been about American troops first. Making sure they're safe, not risking blood and treasure. So the thing is for me is like -- it drives me crazy that we take this story seriously. I'm not just a Fox host, Dana. I'm a Fox viewer, OK?  You know the guy at the hair club? I just don't -- I'm not just president, I'm a client. Well, I'm a Fox News client, so it drives me nuts that we take seriously this narrative, this conjoint narrative from the Democrats and the media. CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, they must be laughing their asses off when we dance to their tune. This is such a joke. It's such a joke. It's all design to win an election.

She alleges the former NBC host kissed her, turned her over and though she repeatedly said she did not want to partake, claims Lauer proceeded to sodomized her while she cried into a pillow.

Yet once it was over, she was the one calling me asking to rekindle it. And the alleged victim does acknowledge in the book that she had more sexual encounters with Lauer once they were back in New York.

The fact that he was fired so quickly within that 24-hour period is interesting. I don't know what kind of internal investigations went on at NBC. It's always very challenging when these things happen because you don't know why some people get fired immediately, some don't. How you sort of research this to try to figure out how to potentially take somebody's whole career and just destroy it based on an allegation. How do you go about proving an allegation? There's so many things that come into play and also you want to be so sensitive to the person coming forward with the allegations because that person may be telling the complete truth and may have suffered a very long time in fear of coming out against someone who is such a high profile figure. So, the truth is oftentimes you don't know what to say in situations like this. I do think people will be looking to this book and we'll be reading this book very carefully because Ronan Farrow did start the MeToo movement and allowed a lot of people who were abused for a very long time to have the confidence and the power to come forward.

We want those Democrats and Republicans who support impeachment to be held accountable for that decision. This is a serious matter, they're agreeing. They want the full transcript of that Volker deposition. And they're saying if you're going to do this you have to do it properly. Now, I get that Joe Biden needs this really badly to be a headline. He needs the top of everybody's page when they (INAUDIBLE), impeachment, impeachment, impeachment because he doesn't want you talking about the economy. He doesn't want you talking about border security. He doesn't want any of the accomplishments that this president has put forward to be highlighted. He doesn't want it highlighted that he really hasn't set forth an agenda, and most Democrats can't even name what positive things he would do if he actually got elected. So he needs this story badly.

So, there's no -- like he is the vice president, right? If you think back to when Obama was going after George W. Bush about torture for all those times. Who came out and defended? It was Dick Cheney, right? That was the proper place for Dick Cheney to be -- to be able to defend.

So that they can warp public opinion which they're doing, so that they can shake the confidence of Republicans who support the president, which is happening, I think. And handicap him with a hole, big, giant cloud headed for 2020. The reason why they're doing this is not -- it's because they hate him. Because -- do this little -- do this little experiment, I wrote this stuff down almost with a swear word. Imagine a Democratic president doing this in three years, ushering in prison reform, Democratic president, drawing down wars because he's stingy about blood and treasure, ushering in record employment for women and minorities, growing medium household income 8.3 percent to a record $66,000, placing restrictions on China for suppressing Muslims. That sounds like the greatest Democratic president in history, definitely better than Obama. He just happens to be a Republican. And he just happens to be Donald Trump. So it's all about how much they hate the guy because they should be embracing his policies. I'm amazed how many Democrats are upset about this siring decision when, basically, it's always been about American troops first. Making sure they're safe, not risking blood and treasure. So the thing is for me is like -- it drives me crazy that we take this story seriously. I'm not just a Fox host, Dana. I'm a Fox viewer, OK? You know the guy at the hair club? I just don't -- I'm not just president, I'm a client. Well, I'm a Fox News client, so it drives me nuts that we take seriously this narrative, this conjoint narrative from the Democrats and the media. CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, they must be laughing their asses off when we dance to their tune. This is such a joke. It's such a joke. It's all design to win an election.

However, her pregnant victim story fell apart when school board records obtained by the Free Beacon shows the school offered her a new contract. She quit anyway. Backing up the tale she told back in 2007 when she said she left by choice. Of course, all politicians lied. Those who say they don't are lying. Warren's lies, however, fit a pattern. It's victim karaoke. An opportunistic deception to exploit the plight of others. It's no different than parking in a handicapped space and faking a limp, Jesse. It's fraud. Now, Liz claims her Native-American roost was an honest mistake, but it got her P.R. as the first minority woman in Harvard law which was so heavily promoted by her and by Harvard. But when she knew that scheme was imploding she paraded that pathetic DNA test proclaiming her Native-American blood, but a toaster had more. That wasn't an honest mistake. So as Biden gets hit by a Ukraine boomerang, she's now the front runner. Will this new lie cause her in 2020? Perhaps. But if she losses, she can just lie again and say that she won.

She alleges the former NBC host kissed her, turned her over and though she repeatedly said she did not want to partake, claims Lauer proceeded to sodomized her while she cried into a pillow. Matt Lauer is now defending himself saying he will no longer provide his accusers shelter with his silence saying, \"she claims our first encounter was an assault, yet she actively participated in arranging future meetings and met me at my apartment on multiple occasions to continue the affair.\" She says, I was the one pursuing the relationship. Yet once it was over, she was the one calling me asking to rekindle it. And the alleged victim does acknowledge in the book that she had more sexual encounters with Lauer once they were back in New York. Meantime NBC News is standing by the accuser quoting here, Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible. As we said at the time and here's Lauer's former co-host Savannah Guthrie.

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, he talked about that actually. And it's from a communications standpoint. I think that's - it's interesting in terms of the strategy. He said that he did not say anything. He thought that was the best course of action, but he regrets that, and he wishes that at the time that he would have said something at the time of his firing that he should have said something. He said he's lost all the credibility with his family, that all of this is playing on public. He has - everything has been taken from him. He's been in hiding now. At the same time, there is a woman who worked with him, who obviously, if this is all true, went through something quite horrible. But it is curious and concerning that the relationship went on. What NBC is saying is that as soon as they found out about it, they fired Lauer within 24 hours. So, for the company is saying, we did the right thing. She thinks she did the right thing and talking to Ronan Farrow for this book and he'll be doing some interviews tomorrow, so maybe we'll find out more. But then this whole piece about Matt Lauer finally deciding to defend himself, I think he probably has to ask himself if it is too little too late and if it will actually pass muster as this interview with Ronan Farrow will get underway tomorrow."

And when you're accused of rape, and you believe you're innocent, you're sure as hell going to fight. I think one of the probably the biggest story out of this is did NBC you know spike the - want to spike the Harvey Weinstein story to protect NBC and the issues that they were sure to come. I believe there is a mutually assured destruction for pigs, right. NBC will tell, we don't go after Weinstein and then Weinstein will bring up what's going on at NBC. So that guarantees protection for people and I wonder if Harvey. the Harvey's of the world, the Bill Cosby's of the worlds were able to enjoy their mayhem, because no one wanted to attempt the retaliation. If I do a story on this person with this story - person do a story on me, it's unlike nuclear war that you don't have a first strike capability. They could strike back."

      "speaker": "BILA",
      "utterance": "I mean I don't know. I mean I'm sure he was very angry about that. I don't know if that was part of his motivation. I think Savannah Guthrie's reaction when talking about the allegations is the only one you can have, when you say I don't know what to say because the allegations are horrific. The fact that he was fired so quickly within that 24-hour period is interesting. I don't know what kind of internal investigations went on at NBC. It's always very challenging when these things happen because you don't know why some people get fired immediately, some don't. How you sort of research this to try to figure out how to potentially take somebody's whole career and just destroy it based on an allegation. How do you go about proving an allegation? There's so many things that come into play and also you want to be so sensitive to the person coming forward with the allegations because that person may be telling the complete truth and may have suffered a very long time in fear of coming out against someone who is such a high profile figure. So, the truth is oftentimes you don't know what to say in situations like this. I do think people will be looking to this book and we'll be reading this book very carefully because Ronan Farrow did start the MeToo movement and allowed a lot of people who were abused for a very long time to have the confidence and the power to come forward. So, I think it will be a pivotal book."

He was working with NBC on other projects. Hillary's daughter Chelsea was hired by NBC for 600 larges for doing nothing. So, and obviously NBC wanted Hillary to be President. It's disgusting, the whole entanglement situation. You never going to know the truth and you're never going to know the truth, what happened between those two. Well, we do know that she got seven figures after this from NBC, because clearly, she was not able to continue to work at NBC News after everybody knew who she was, it was a terrible environment."

But you just think about relationships and I think it's harder now in the age of social media to find the time and the effort, work takes up a lot of time.
