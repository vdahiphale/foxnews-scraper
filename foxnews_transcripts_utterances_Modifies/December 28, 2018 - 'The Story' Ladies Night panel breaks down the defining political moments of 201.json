He was arrested twice before, and yes, has known gang affiliations often using different aliases.   Authorities say he was trying to flee to Mexico after the shooting. And we've learned his brother and the co-worker have also been arrested for attempting to mislead the authorities. Arriaga stunning rap sheet has infuriated officials like the sheriff leading the investigation now this shooting death. Tonight, Sheriff Adam Christianson is bluntly pointing the finger at California's sanctuary laws, which limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Sanctuary policies again that the president has repeatedly railed against.

Because that's a federal determination so that they then could be held. And they could be held even if they were only in for a DUI. Since that time, my state has systematically stopped that kind of activity every chance they get. That's what sanctuary means is, that you do not ask if they were illegal, and you do not cooperate.

Obviously, Congressman, you know better than I, there's still a battle going out -- going on between the President and Democrats on the Hill about funding for the wall. First of all, let's start simply. How do you solve this problem when you have some people in this country as you just heard saying that the sheriff who says that the sanctuary policies are to blame is a liar."

The fact is that when I came to office 18 years ago, the County of Orange, you know, North of San Diego, already had a program and this was under Bill Clinton. Had a program where they formally not only honored these detainers, but they also allowed ICE to come in and evaluate people to find out whether they were unlawfully in the country. Because that's a federal determination so that they then could be held. And they could be held even if they were only in for a DUI. Since that time, my state has systematically stopped that kind of activity every chance they get. That's what sanctuary means is, that you do not ask if they were illegal, and you do not cooperate. And so, these sheriff's hands are tied by California state law in almost every case and it's been a fight -- and it's a fight that quite frankly, citizens are losing."

If you follow his positioning in this with the government shutdown, and the campaign, obviously, he talked bluntly about a big beautiful wall. More recent -- and that was going to be paid for by Mexico. Now recently, he's talking about a $5 million down payment that's paid for by the taxpayers, obviously, a hard-working men and women. On top of that, then he says well maybe it will be a fence, not a wall. And then today, it was tweeting no it has to be a wall or I'm shutting down the border. When he keeps shifting like that, how do the Republicans actually negotiate with the Democrats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, we negotiate from history. The fact is that in San Diego, almost 20 years ago, then-Duncan Hunter -- Congressman Hunter began building a fence. He was building it with military reserve personnel and he were welding up pieces of metal. That made our border the safest border -- not only the busiest border but the safest border with Mexico, period. It is a proven system, and whether you use a metal fence or you use a wall, as long as it gives the Border Patrol, the ability to safely navigate and to get to an area without being swarmed -- you know, swarmed to overpower, it works. So, fence or wall, the president's right, you can use either term. What you need is you need a barrier, it is what the Border Patrol. The men and women who stand at the border, who drive, at the border, who die at the border, have been begging for, for years."

So, these officers gunned down on Christmas night. On Wednesday, she sends out a tweet saying, I'm writing to voice my strong concern about the recent deaths and illnesses of children detained in Border Patrol custody, to request a full accounting -- \" She will -- and what not. Then, on Thursday, another tweet, \"Read my letter calling for a hearing on the deaths of two young children in Border Patrol custody this month. We must know more about the care and treatment of these kids.\" Absolutely, we must know more about that, but she has tweeted absolutely nothing about this officer being gunned down by an illegal immigrant in your state, in her state. And then, quickly, Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman, one of your colleagues, as you know, he had a whole series of tweets today attacking the president about the wall. Saying he doesn't -- you know, know what he's doing. So, I sent a tweet to him saying, \"Congressman, doing a story on reaction from lawmakers in California to the killing of police officer Ron Singh. Have you sent any tweets or full statements on the police officer killed in your home state?\" If he response later, but it's been hours, sir. He hasn't responded to me, he hasn't put out a tweet. Why are Democrats in your state not even saying, we're sorry that this officer was killed by illegal immigrants?"

Supporting law enforcement, having an orderly immigration system, having a barrier with proper openings in it for people to immigrate. That all is how you save lives on both sides. The fact is for decades, anywhere we have better border security, we save lives not just Border Patrol agents and ICE. We save lives of those immigrants, and that's important. And I think anyone that doesn't do both is missing the point that you -- to be compassionate is to have security and an immigration policy that allows people to come here legally."

They have since clarified sort of to say now Trump becomes a first president since 2002 not to visit troops on or before Christmas.

And then of course, we and others all found. You've seen him the pictures of Barack Obama in 2008. He wasn't president yet but he was a senator. He was on the campaign. He was on the campaign trail and then visited the troops, and he was signing autographs. It was a nice thing to do for Barack Obama. Donald Trump does it in somehow it's the end of the world."

There's no problem with that. There are some questions I think legitimately raised about the attack that he made to the Troops about Democrats. I think that was inappropriate. Certainly, supporting the troops we all do Democrats and Republicans, but that's a that's another issue. Signing hats, signing memorabilia, signing plaques, have at it."

It's the right thing to do because we're never going to be able to overcome the 60 votes in the Senate. His point being the president wants some money for the wall.

One thing about the $5 billion is on the Armed Services Committee as I am, and also on the transportation infrastructure, we really require the government agencies to tell us precisely what they want the money for, not just generally for a road or for an airport but rather exactly whether it's going to be, how it's going to be spent. And I think the President owes that to the Congress. If he has $5 billion for border security, fences, or walls, tell us exactly where it is or where it's going to be built.

But I think that when I grew up, a favorite teacher of mine said that while it's great to read for pleasure and important to do so and to read to reinforce or to expand your understanding of your own point of view, it's particularly important to read things that you know you will disagree with so that you hear other arguments that also can refine your own point of view, but we'll see how many people pick up on his --"

But that brings me to the next little list, which is Gallup does this thing every year at the end of the year. Who is most admired? And it was interesting that Michelle Obama tops the list of women. You see that she knocked Hillary Clinton out of the top spot. Now, it's very divided. It's only at 15 percent. Oprah Winfrey at five percent, Hillary Clinton at four and Melania Trump who is relatively new as first lady, at four percent. Tammy, what stuck out for you?"

It's a random phone call to I think over about a thousand people. You can choose whomever you want. And generally what you are going to get are people who have been positively portrayed in the media and are in the media a lot. She is coming off of her book tour so it's not that surprising. But it's not, as you noted, it's like a 15 percent. She won with 15 percent. So it's not kind of a deep analysis of who the majority of Americans admire. But it does tell you who they have been portraying positively up until this point, which was Hillary, which means for some reason Hillary is not at the top spot because the media is not portraying her in the same fashion."

And Michelle Obama on this book tour is not selling out small bookshops or Starbucks coffee shops. She's selling out arenas. And it's because the book really talks about what everyday women go through. Infertility, marriage counseling, dealing with children.

And so she snuck out of the back door, her and Malia, so they could be with the people and nobody saw them, but they were outside as the White House was lit up with a rainbow which speaks to who she is as a person and why this book is the number one selling book in the country this year."

But he was saying, you know, if Trump would just tell us exactly where he wants the wall and what he wants, I seem to recall that the Obama administration had billions of dollars to build a wall, a virtual wall, and Janet Napolitano just stopped and said, you know what, we are not going to use it for that. We don't know where that money went, Ed. We don't know what they did with it. We need to protect the country and we lost the majority. I told our conference repeatedly in September, if we don't put money out there for a wall before the election, we may not be back in the majority. That happened, but a note of encouragement, Ed, we took a stand. Unfortunately, it was after we lost the majority, but I think it bodes well and it's inconsistent with Boehner's (ph) opposition of just keep feeding the Democrats rope and they will hang themselves, and that's a poor metaphor. But the fact is, as I told Boehner once, look, you said feed him rope, now they've used it to hog-tie us. It's time to stand up and we never did.
