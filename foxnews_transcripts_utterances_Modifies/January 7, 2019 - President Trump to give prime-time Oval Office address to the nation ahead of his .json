And basically, in the '70s, this act was passed. It was post-Watergate, it was post-Vietnam.  And the main thing that he would have to do is cite a specific emergency provision, a specific emergency power, right, that activates what he's asking for. And so, there are hundreds of them by the way. There are hundreds of provisions under this act and he just has to specifically cite it.  And underneath that, he gets extraordinary authority. He can take land. He can seize property. He can restrict travel, et cetera. And we are hearing already from the left and some of those comments things like, well you know, we are going to take this to court and this is just like the steel (ph) thing and it's not. It's totally separate. The only challengeable aspect would be whether that specificity is tied together, right? And the other thing that people should understand is that those specific provisions, there's monetary associations with it. So, if he went under the immigration act for example, that caps at $20 million.  So really -- and there is a ton more options and what not, but basically a kind of overview would be cobbling together the money and the funding and whether that's in articulable (ph) specificity. And by the way, it pretty much is because, for example, under that immigration act, all that needs to happen is for him to cite the fact that the current resources are basically being stretched thin, they are not keeping up with it.   So, there's that. And I also think -- on Representative Jeffries' comment about, well, we don't want to hold the American people hostage any longer over this medieval wall --",

The president has told the truth on the caravan from the beginning. He said it was mostly men, not a bunch of women and children. The men were looking for money, not asylum. And what happened when the caravan finally reached the southern border? Uptick 300 percent in violence perpetrated against the border agents. If anything the president has compromised and moderated his position, if you look at he's offering out $800 million for humanitarian situation. He is saying now we want a steel fence. The steel fence has been voted on positively by Democrats in the past. It's an environmentally friendly. Water can just trickle through it.  It helps the U.S. steel industry as well. People can see through it so they have visibility on the other side. A lot of these things that the president is doing is trying to bring Nancy Pelosi to the negotiating table.

Obviously, most Democrats don't support it. There is no national emergency. You can go back to the midterms. There was -- remember, we were being invaded. Now, it looks like there was no invasion. It was a bunch of desperate people. At the moment, he says, oh, there are all these criminals coming over. If you watch Fox News Sunday yesterday, Chris Wallace absolutely dismantled Sarah Huckabee Sanders on this point. There is no evidence, even from Trump's own Justice Department, his own immigration services.   So, he is doing this for some political reason, and it's not quite clear what it is except to me, to distract from his own problems with Wall Street going on to us, the failure to enact an asylum ban, to the problems that he has with John Bolton contradicting him about the pullout in Syria.",

Should we ask Nancy Pelosi about removing the walls that we already have on the border because there are walls on the border. This stance is so weak. You could blow it over with a sneeze. And also, I know -- Juan always keeps saying, oh, it's appealing to the base. Essentially, that's what politics is, is you are appealing to the people who voted for you and he made a promise that he was going to build a wall. It might have put him in a corner, it might, but he has to actually address it because no one really addressed it in this way before. The fact is the Democrats agree with him on everything and the only reason why they won't do it is because it's him.  So the bottom line is, it's a personal vendetta. And President Trump tomorrow should talk about the wall but also to talk about the personal vendetta and say look, hey, clearly, the Democrats were for this but they don't like me so I'm going to step out of this. I want somebody else to take charge of this. I will step out of the room so you guys -- I don't want the credit. I will step out of here.

So the press creates a shield around her, in which any criticism must be due to sexism or bigotry, when in fact, it is in their heads and not ours. But the strategy works by preventing real criticism about her actual beliefs, which are retreads of horrible ideas from previous centuries, socialism with a smile, fascism among friends, Venezuela meets vegan. The sad news is that we have proof of such utopian nightmares. Sadder news, so many young people don't care. Socialism is a brand that happily reinvents itself with every naive generation. AOC's fans like to say she is living in our heads like Pharrell Williams singing \"Happy.\" But in fact, it's the policies that live in our heads, and they should live there because we know so many people who have been brutalized by such ideas. When you hear someone talk about socialism like it's a fun new way to pay down my college debt, you've got to scream. Just prepare to be called awful things for doing so. Today, pointing out the evil of the past makes you the bane of the present.  You know, Jesse, you know that I love? Here's the left, suddenly they want to return to the 1950s.",

      "utterance": "So, I think what's important for me is for viewers to understand what it would look like if the president actually declared a national emergency and what that -- what trickles down from that. And basically, in the '70s, this act was passed. It was post-Watergate, it was post-Vietnam. And the main thing that he would have to do is cite a specific emergency provision, a specific emergency power, right, that activates what he's asking for. And so, there are hundreds of them by the way. There are hundreds of provisions under this act and he just has to specifically cite it. And underneath that, he gets extraordinary authority. He can take land. He can seize property. He can restrict travel, et cetera. And we are hearing already from the left and some of those comments things like, well you know, we are going to take this to court and this is just like the steel (ph) thing and it's not. It's totally separate. The only challengeable aspect would be whether that specificity is tied together, right? And the other thing that people should understand is that those specific provisions, there's monetary associations with it. So, if he went under the immigration act for example, that caps at $20 million. So really -- and there is a ton more options and what not, but basically a kind of overview would be cobbling together the money and the funding and whether that's in articulable (ph) specificity. And by the way, it pretty much is because, for example, under that immigration act, all that needs to happen is for him to cite the fact that the current resources are basically being stretched thin, they are not keeping up with it. So, there's that. And I also think -- on Representative Jeffries' comment about, well, we don't want to hold the American people hostage any longer over this medieval wall --"

We are held hostage throughout the entire nation right now with everything that is coming over the southern border and how it impacts all aspects of the criminal justice system. It's not just the drugs coming across or migrants seeking asylum. It goes so much deeper than that. When we have -- what's the currency of all the gangs riddling in these cities? It is drugs.

The wheel works over time and it's because it's effective, just like walls are effective. I don't like how Nadler is saying that the president is going to lie tomorrow night. The president has told the truth on the caravan from the beginning. He said it was mostly men, not a bunch of women and children. The men were looking for money, not asylum. And what happened when the caravan finally reached the southern border? Uptick 300 percent in violence perpetrated against the border agents. If anything the president has compromised and moderated his position, if you look at he's offering out $800 million for humanitarian situation. He is saying now we want a steel fence. The steel fence has been voted on positively by Democrats in the past. It's an environmentally friendly. Water can just trickle through it. It helps the U.S. steel industry as well. People can see through it so they have visibility on the other side. A lot of these things that the president is doing is trying to bring Nancy Pelosi to the negotiating table. If anything, Nancy looks like the one stuck in the mud."

    {

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, in order for border security. I mean, unless -- I mean, if the argument is Democrats don't click here on border security that is patently false. This whole thing though is striking to me and that the only way to understand it is that Trump is playing base, tribal politics. Most independents don't support it. Obviously, most Democrats don't support it. There is no national emergency. You can go back to the midterms. There was -- remember, we were being invaded. Now, it looks like there was no invasion. It was a bunch of desperate people. At the moment, he says, oh, there are all these criminals coming over. If you watch Fox News Sunday yesterday, Chris Wallace absolutely dismantled Sarah Huckabee Sanders on this point. There is no evidence, even from Trump's own Justice Department, his own immigration services. So, he is doing this for some political reason, and it's not quite clear what it is except to me, to distract from his own problems with Wall Street going on to us, the failure to enact an asylum ban, to the problems that he has with John Bolton contradicting him about the pullout in Syria."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "There is plenty that we can talk about. But let's talk -- let's stick on this. So the president is going to address the nation tomorrow night. Can he address all those things that Juan is saying for independents that might not be on board?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think he should address the crux of the argument of the Democrats when they are constantly saying walls are immoral, OK. That's the whole point and that's kind of like what everybody is saying. It's horrible. It's immoral. Well, what about the walls that we already have then? Should we ask Nancy Pelosi about removing the walls that we already have on the border because there are walls on the border. This stance is so weak. You could blow it over with a sneeze. And also, I know -- Juan always keeps saying, oh, it's appealing to the base. Essentially, that's what politics is, is you are appealing to the people who voted for you and he made a promise that he was going to build a wall. It might have put him in a corner, it might, but he has to actually address it because no one really addressed it in this way before. The fact is the Democrats agree with him on everything and the only reason why they won't do it is because it's him. So the bottom line is, it's a personal vendetta. And President Trump tomorrow should talk about the wall but also to talk about the personal vendetta and say look, hey, clearly, the Democrats were for this but they don't like me so I'm going to step out of this. I want somebody else to take charge of this. I will step out of the room so you guys -- I don't want the credit. I will step out of here. You get the engineers involved because you just heard Schumer say that it's not so much about the money now. It's the fact that they don't have a plan. Well, that's the step. So now you come up with a plan with the engineers involved."

The media created a fake story that conservatives attacked her over this delightful trifle. Not really. In fact, the only stories written about the dance were by liberals using it to falsely smear the right. So the press creates a shield around her, in which any criticism must be due to sexism or bigotry, when in fact, it is in their heads and not ours. But the strategy works by preventing real criticism about her actual beliefs, which are retreads of horrible ideas from previous centuries, socialism with a smile, fascism among friends, Venezuela meets vegan. The sad news is that we have proof of such utopian nightmares. Sadder news, so many young people don't care. Socialism is a brand that happily reinvents itself with every naive generation. AOC's fans like to say she is living in our heads like Pharrell Williams singing \"Happy.\" But in fact, it's the policies that live in our heads, and they should live there because we know so many people who have been brutalized by such ideas. When you hear someone talk about socialism like it's a fun new way to pay down my college debt, you've got to scream. Just prepare to be called awful things for doing so.

Whether you love Trump, you'll sit and listen.  Whether you hate Trump, you'll sit and listen. So he was hypersensitive. But there's a leftist principle also behind his statement, and that is \"If I believe that you are immoral, if I believe that Donald Trump is immoral and that his followers or his supporters are immoral, then I don't have to play fair. I don't have to be an objective journalist anymore. I don't have to be objective in my headlines or on the front page.\" Opinion journalism can then infect every area, which is really convenient for them. Because the right, we think you're wrong. Juan, we think you're wrong, but we'll debate and engage. But the left thinks you're evil, so they don't have to. And that's incredibly convenient for them to justify what he just said, which is that our biases are moral, OK, so we can say whatever you want before -- about Trump. But the fact is, those biases existed before Trump. They hate everybody outside of New York. Outside of the cities. What you like, they hate, and because you like Trump, they hate you."

The next court date is set for March 4. All right. So Juan, I'm going to start with you. Over 30 men have come out and accused Kevin Spacey of some type of sexual misconduct. Is this the one where he's going to face a reckoning?"

And he did this video where he pretends to be the character out of \"House of Cards,\" Frank Underwood. I think the video is called \"Let Me Be Frank.\" And then he starts saying, \"Oh, if it was only so simple.  Everybody wants me to be guilty. People are assuming this and assuming that, and the whole story hasn't come out.\" To be fair to him, let the story come out. But wow, what you just said is telling. So it's not only in the U.S., this case up in Massachusetts. But you also have people in London, where he was the artistic director at a theater there, saying that over a span of 20 years, he was guilty of such behavior. So these allegations now touch so many parts of his life and career that he's been -- not only was he canceled out of \"House of Cards,\" but he lost the opportunity to be in a biopic about Gore Vidal. And he's lost other opportunities. And, you know, we'll see what comes of it. I'm just stunned that he's only the second man to be criminally charged in all we've heard from the #MeToo movement."

One: men in positions of power can abuse their authority. and industries can protect them in order to protect the bottom line. But also, two, he's innocent until he's proven guilty.  And you've got to follow the facts. And in this case, it's going to be adjudicated in the courtroom, not the court of public opinion. So that's a good thing. Usually in cases like this, you need eyewitness testimony. You need some sort of video surveillance. We're hearing there's a Snapchat video involved of him using his hands to touch someone. But, you know, traditionally, guys like this will skate on a -- on a situation like this.

That his presence on the case apparently will mean that there's a lot of headlines in this case. He was part of the Boston clergy defense and so there -- just he gets a lot of media. So that will be part of it. But this is also the first time a high-profile gay celebrity has been targeted in the #MeToo movement. And I don't know exactly where it will go. Just obviously, I don't know. The Frank Underwood video, I don't know -- again, I feel like it's all part of a P.R. strategy and it's perhaps something that his lawyer suggested that he do."

We had a barbecue, and they were out. There was dancing, as you can see. They were trying to teach us to dance. We were not very good. We were giving it our best shot. And then, my young friend -- and Greg knows her, too -- Macy English, there you see her. She's 14.
