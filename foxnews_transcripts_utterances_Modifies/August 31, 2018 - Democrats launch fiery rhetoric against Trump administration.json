You know what I like about the moon landing by the way? When they got up there, they had a cassette machine and they played Frank Sinatra and Count Basie singing Fly Me to the Moon, first music ever played on the moon ever played on the moon. And that is American. Because if it had been the Russians, they would have played something big by the Soviet 1812 Overture or something, and the Germans would have played Beethoven. There is something very American. Only the Americans could have done that. Kennedy set the nation a challenge. It rose to the challenge and being American, they exceeded it and that flag should be in that story. It's just a bad story telling if you ask me.",

They should have had a female, perhaps Reese Witherspoon should have played. Because it's not -- it's not an American achievement or a masculine achievement. It's just an achievement. So anybody could have played Neil Armstrong. Also, what really upsets me is that he's a Canadian playing an American. Hollywood, how can they allow cultural appropriation like this? That is totally immoral. But the worst thing about this is, in all seriousness, he has no right to speak for Neil Armstrong. He shouldn't have said that. That's the problem with this.

And in fact, you see the Democrats pushing heavy on healthcare, on the immigration front. I can go on.

You call this figure Trump. You call him Hitler or bin Laden. But then, by extension, all the supporters are accessories to the evil. That means it is now OK to call his supporters appeasers and so on. And then, what that does, that elevates any action, maybe by Antifa as somewhat heroic because it's a moral act because these people are evil. And then, finally, that encourages violence to suppress their political freedoms. And right now, I believe that we're between step 3 and step 4. We have seen violence by Antifa towards people trying to suppress their political freedoms, their political voice. We are seeing that happen.

First, a new movie starring Ryan Gosling as former astronaut Neil Armstrong receiving, it's receiving a big backlash because the film intentionally leaves out the iconic moment in 1969 when the American flag was planted on the moon. The Canadian actor defends the decision to omit Old Glory. He says the historic mission transcends countries and borders as a human achievement. And Gosling says he doesn't think Neil Armstrong views himself as an American hero. This comes as a new report in Variety shows just how Gosling's celebrity friends are gearing up for the midterms. They are donating big bucks, more than $27 million to try to help Democrats win back control of the Congress. So, Mark, let's start with the landing on the moon in this movie."

The Canadian Red Ensign was the first flag to be landed on the moon and you Americans faked it up in that bit of Utah desert or whatever it is. I think this -- this is pathetically sad. You know what I like about the moon landing by the way? When they got up there, they had a cassette machine and they played Frank Sinatra and Count Basie singing Fly Me to the Moon, first music ever played on the moon ever played on the moon. And that is American. Because if it had been the Russians, they would have played something big by the Soviet 1812 Overture or something, and the Germans would have played Beethoven. There is something very American. Only the Americans could have done that. Kennedy set the nation a challenge. It rose to the challenge and being American, they exceeded it and that flag should be in that story. It's just a bad story telling if you ask me."

And at all of those camps, there were American flags everywhere. And it was always in the shared love of pursuit of space and flight and living among the stars and playing among the stars. And it wasn't from nationalistic to the detriment of other types of cultures type of indoctrination happening. So I totally disagree with how that's portrayed.

He planted an American flag. Stop rewriting history to make everybody feel like they're part of everything. If the Canadian or anyone else had gone to the moon, I would expect them to plant a Canadian flag and I would expect that to be part of the story.

It could easily have been a woman at that time, if there was a female astronaut. So why did they need a male actor to play Neil Armstrong. They should have had a female, perhaps Reese Witherspoon should have played. Because it's not -- it's not an American achievement or a masculine achievement. It's just an achievement. So anybody could have played Neil Armstrong. Also, what really upsets me is that he's a Canadian playing an American. Hollywood, how can they allow cultural appropriation like this? That is totally immoral. But the worst thing about this is, in all seriousness, he has no right to speak for Neil Armstrong. He shouldn't have said that. That's the problem with this. He shouldn't have said, he thought he knew what Neil Armstrong was thinking. And last point is it was called the Space Race. It was a race to the moon among countries and that's why it was called a Space Race."
