Something his own lawyer actually had to admit today. He was trying to subvert the President's authority. He thought he was the President when he was over there in Ukraine. And so why should the President want him serving in the White House. What is so hard to understand about any of this? And let's remember, Vindman didn't just want the President out of office. He's someone whom the Ukrainians asked three times to be their defense minister. I still can't get over that.  Here now is Lee Smith, investigative journalist, author of the book The Plot Against the President aptly timed late tonight. Along with Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author and filmmaker.   Dinesh, we're going to start with you. You and I, Dinesh have talked about this before regarding Mr. Vindman and others like him who find themselves just - they can't stand the fact that I guess they're not sitting in the Oval Office. So, how is reassigning a bureaucrat worse than what the mob does to people as says - the crowd was saying today.  DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, I remember distinctly from the Godfather that when Frank Pentangelli planned - was part of a coup against the boss, he expected recriminations. He didn't think that he could try to take the big guy out and not expect there to be any consequences. Now, the thing about Vindman is that, Vindman was if can step back from this and look at it. He was part of an attempted sort of palace coup. The coup was mounted from the outside by the House. But what strikes me from the beginning is how impeachment was essentially power driven. The Democrats had the majority in the House. They voted impeachment. The Republicans had the majority in the Senate. They voted it down. So, Vindman was part of the inside operation working with these outsiders to overthrow the President. The plot failed. The plot was defeated. And now Trump wants to clean house. If you want to call it payback, I say it's very necessary payback.  INGRAHAM: The President has a right to have people that he wants to work in his administration. That's why he's the Chief Executive Officer of the executive branch. I don't know why people can't understand that.",

The timing wouldn't looked very good, wouldn't it have for cause because he went right to Zelensky. He, as a junior staffer on the NSC, went to a foreign president and started waving him off on what he thought was inappropriate conduct.  D'SOUZA: Vindman was actually telling the Ukrainians that they could ignore what Trump was saying and indicating on the grounds that Trump was somehow contradicting U.S. policies. Think about this. According to Vindman, there's a thing called U.S. policy that he Vindman is the spokesman for. And Trump is sort of out of sync. He's marching out of tune. In reality, Trump makes policy Vindman should be advising Trump. If Vindman disagrees with Trump, he should tell Trump.   So, this is a rogue officer and no wonder he became such a useful idiot for impeachment, because after all, this was a guy that he always thought that he knew better than the President.  INGRAHAM: They're concerned tonight, Lee, because his poor brother, his twin brother.

Look, one of the important things that I think that we have to understand is, this is a continuation of the operation that's been going on for three years. I think as good as a week as this has been for the President, we need to understand this will happen again. We know who will be involved. It will be rogue intelligence officials.

Adam Schiff, the gang, they're going to be back in action when they get their teeth sunk into this. But is this the case? Well, joining me now is Robert Ray, former Whitewater Independent Counsel, former member of Trump's successful team defending in that Senate trial.   Also, with me is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow and constitutional scholar. Robert, I want to start with you. The President clearly has the authority to do everything he did today. There's no intent to interfere with employment, so forth. So, why are all these legal experts calling this illegal under the federal code?  ROBERT RAY, FORMER MEMBER OF TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM: Because they want to jump to witness tampering in the same way they wanted to claim that the President's right to fire the FBI Director was somehow obstruction of justice.

He offered damning indictments of Democrats all week long. It was insane. He just went bananas. I mean he basically said, you know, you're missing America, guys. You're missing America.  TOM BEVAN, PRESIDENT, \"REALCLEARPOLITICS\": Yes, Carville had had really two there are two things that were driving him nuts. Number one is that that the Democratic candidates and the base are really getting pulled far to the Left on issues that he said were a distraction, things like free health care for illegals, he mentioned, and some other things. The other thing that really had him upset is that this disconnect between the elites and the sort of Main Street regular working-class people. He talked about, you know, it's the deplorables, it's the folks on CNN that are laughing and snickering. This is - James Carville knows that this is a disaster brewing for his party.

He was a Russian co-conspirator. He was more working with Putin. Mueller didn't deliver. Then they impeached him, predicted doom for the Republican Party. They were going to crack all these defections. None of it happened. More people rallying to Trump. Economy booming. And where are the Democrats? The misery index of the Democrat Party is up to here. Most people are, meanwhile, happy.  DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, you know, I'm involved. I'm supporting Mike Bloomberg, who I think is the only one who can beat Donald Trump. But your analysis is right, Laura. Let's be honest. The best week of the Trump presidency, the Democrats through an ill guided impeachment that we discussed many times on this air, the wrong thing for the Democrats to do. It backfired in their face. The State of the Union, a rousing success.  And frankly, how bad could Iowa have been for the Democrats? That five, four days, five days later, they can't even figure out who won or if they've counted the votes. So, look, this is a very bad situation for my party.

As you mentioned, his approval ratings are at all-time highs. And on the economy, they're even higher. And so, if Democrats don't take this issue head on and try and challenge him on it some way, they're going to fail.

Then what are all the radicals do in the party who trash the billionaires all the time?  BEVAN: I don't know how this is going to work out. And certainly, if Biden does falter, it looks like he's not going to do well in New Hampshire. He even conceded that as much during tonight's debate. This race could shift. It is certainly setting up. As Bloomberg has strategized this thing, it's going along to his plan. The question is whether he will be able to capitalize on it or whether Buttigieg becomes the alternative or someone else. But I do think Joe Biden, he doesn't have to win New Hampshire, but he has to bounce back and have a strong finish.

First, the posts in question came from something called 4chan and were from after the caucus had ended. And second, there's no evidence that those Internet trolls were the ones clogging the election hotlines. A more likely reason, the phones were busy from Democrats frantically calling. They were calling about the faulty technology that was failing them at the time. That brings me to my next point. While Maddow and others were mired in all these wild theories and casting about, the real conspiracy was staring them right in the face. Months ago, the DNC secretly hired the firm Shadow Inc. And it was hired to develop the glitchy tech that was causing all the problems in Iowa. Last year the liberal nonprofit Acronym reportedly became the sole investor in Shadow Inc. Acronym has deep ties to the party establishment, and its political arm called Pacronym, isn't that cute, is bankrolled by liberal megadonors. Are you connecting the dots? In 2019 they even got a seven-figure contribution from George Soros' Democracy PAC. Acronym was cofounded in 2016 by a woman named Tara McGowan. She is married to Michael Halle. He's a senior official with Pete Buttigieg's campaign. I seem to remember Pete declaring victory before he even got on the plane for New Hampshire. We know the establishment is scared of Bernie Sanders, is slowly realizing Biden is dead in the water. So wouldn't the more likely, if you're going to come up with any conspiracy, and we're not trying to peddle it, but if you're going to come up with the theory that has any legs, wouldn't it involve the DNC's choice to contract with such a politically connected firm? I wonder if MSNBC or any other network, frankly, will investigate that. Now I want to take you 1,700 miles west of Iowa to Los Angeles, California, where, of course, we have been reporting for a couple years now where the homelessness crisis is just out of control. But now we are finding out it's being fueled by a violent Mexican drug cartel, and they are only able to do so because of a new state law.

This was passed back in 2014. The idea behind it was to end the war on drugs. What it did was it reduced drug possession from a felony down to a misdemeanor. But what we have seen happen now is police departments are no longer able to arrest any of these addicts. And portions of L.A., our camera crew went down there and got some of that video, certain blocks look like a scene out of \"The Walking Dead.\" It's gotten so bad, people are walking around like zombies.

And so why should the President want him serving in the White House. What is so hard to understand about any of this? And let's remember, Vindman didn't just want the President out of office. He's someone whom the Ukrainians asked three times to be their defense minister. I still can't get over that.

So, how is reassigning a bureaucrat worse than what the mob does to people as says - the crowd was saying today.  DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, I remember distinctly from the Godfather that when Frank Pentangelli planned - was part of a coup against the boss, he expected recriminations. He didn't think that he could try to take the big guy out and not expect there to be any consequences. Now, the thing about Vindman is that, Vindman was if can step back from this and look at it.

He, as a junior staffer on the NSC, went to a foreign president and started waving him off on what he thought was inappropriate conduct.  D'SOUZA: Vindman was actually telling the Ukrainians that they could ignore what Trump was saying and indicating on the grounds that Trump was somehow contradicting U.S. policies. Think about this. According to Vindman, there's a thing called U.S. policy that he Vindman is the spokesman for. And Trump is sort of out of sync. He's marching out of tune.

Look, one of the important things that I think that we have to understand is, this is a continuation of the operation that's been going on for three years. I think as good as a week as this has been for the President, we need to understand this will happen again. We know who will be involved. It will be rogue intelligence officials. It will be the press. And it will most likely be Adam Schiff. The way to defend against this is for the Republican Senate to run an offense here.

So, these are the types of people who are working in the government. Two great guests and a fantastic week and Friday night. Gentlemen, thank both of you. And I got to get to this part of it, because there's a legal aspect we have to talk about. The Left is going to have you believe that these removals are the extension of this cover up. Adam Schiff, the gang, they're going to be back in action when they get their teeth sunk into this. But is this the case? Well, joining me now is Robert Ray, former Whitewater Independent Counsel, former member of Trump's successful team defending in that Senate trial. Also, with me is John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow and constitutional scholar. Robert, I want to start with you. The President clearly has the authority to do everything he did today. There's no intent to interfere with employment, so forth. So, why are all these legal experts calling this illegal under the federal code?  ROBERT RAY, FORMER MEMBER OF TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM: Because they want to jump to witness tampering in the same way they wanted to claim that the President's right to fire the FBI Director was somehow obstruction of justice. It doesn't have any more merit than that previous allegation did. And the President, I think, understandably reacted to - I essentially agree with the notion with regard to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman of dealing with deep state rogue and with regard to - further with regard to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman."

Then what are all the radicals do in the party who trash the billionaires all the time?  BEVAN: I don't know how this is going to work out. And certainly, if Biden does falter, it looks like he's not going to do well in New Hampshire. He even conceded that as much during tonight's debate. This race could shift. It is certainly setting up. As Bloomberg has strategized this thing, it's going along to his plan. The question is whether he will be able to capitalize on it or whether Buttigieg becomes the alternative or someone else. But I do think Joe Biden, he doesn't have to win New Hampshire, but he has to bounce back and have a strong finish. If he finishes in fourth place there and he's double digits behind the leaders, it's going to be a long couple weeks before he gets to his, quote-unquote, firewall in South Carolina, and a lot can change in that time."

      "utterance": "OK, a tinfoil hat may not be big enough for Rachel. A tinfoil crown would look really nice, though. Two things here. First, the posts in question came from something called 4chan and were from after the caucus had ended. And second, there's no evidence that those Internet trolls were the ones clogging the election hotlines. A more likely reason, the phones were busy from Democrats frantically calling. They were calling about the faulty technology that was failing them at the time. That brings me to my next point. While Maddow and others were mired in all these wild theories and casting about, the real conspiracy was staring them right in the face. Months ago, the DNC secretly hired the firm Shadow Inc. And it was hired to develop the glitchy tech that was causing all the problems in Iowa. Last year the liberal nonprofit Acronym reportedly became the sole investor in Shadow Inc. Acronym has deep ties to the party establishment, and its political arm called Pacronym, isn't that cute, is bankrolled by liberal megadonors. Are you connecting the dots? In 2019 they even got a seven-figure contribution from George Soros' Democracy PAC. Acronym was cofounded in 2016 by a woman named Tara McGowan. She is married to Michael Halle. He's a senior official with Pete Buttigieg's campaign. I seem to remember Pete declaring victory before he even got on the plane for New Hampshire. We know the establishment is scared of Bernie Sanders, is slowly realizing Biden is dead in the water. So wouldn't the more likely, if you're going to come up with any conspiracy, and we're not trying to peddle it, but if you're going to come up with the theory that has any legs, wouldn't it involve the DNC's choice to contract with such a politically connected firm? I wonder if MSNBC or any other network, frankly, will investigate that. Now I want to take you 1,700 miles west of Iowa to Los Angeles, California, where, of course, we have been reporting for a couple years now where the homelessness crisis is just out of control. But now we are finding out it's being fueled by a violent Mexican drug cartel, and they are only able to do so because of a new state law. KTTV investigative reporter Bill Melugin has the story for us tonight. Bill?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELUGIN",
      "utterance": "First off, thanks for having me, Laura. The DEA is about as strong as of critic of Prop 47 as you're going to find. They genuinely believe that the ongoing drug crisis that we have here on the streets of L.A., in particular the meth addiction epidemic in our homeless population, is fueled in part by California's Prop 47. This was passed back in 2014. The idea behind it was to end the war on drugs. What it did was it reduced drug possession from a felony down to a misdemeanor. But what we have seen happen now is police departments are no longer able to arrest any of these addicts. And portions of L.A., our camera crew went down there and got some of that video, certain blocks look like a scene out of \"The Walking Dead.\" It's gotten so bad, people are walking around like zombies. People are shooting up in public with no fear, no consequence. They are not forced into treatment anymore under Prop 47. So the situation has gotten so bad, so out of control, the DEA is fed up, and they are slamming Prop 47 now."

Perhaps even more shocking, a random man walks up, asks if he can have some. He takes a hit, and then he's on his way. Moments later, this hooded drug dealer approaches our crew, offering to sell meth."

    {
      "speaker": "MELUGIN",
      "utterance": "There is just no fear anymore, and they don't have any reason to be afraid because they know they're not going to be arrested. And we talked to LAPD about this, they expressed a lot of frustration, because the law still allows them to arrest these folks under a misdemeanor crime, but nothing's going to happen. They can take them to jail, but one of the main ideas behind Prop 47 was to reduce the state inmate population. So when they show up to jail with a misdemeanor warrant for drug use, nothing's going to happen. They're going to be let out that night. They're going to get maybe a citation, and it's just this endless cycle with police telling us that they arrest the same people over and over and over. And that's why nobody is afraid anymore. Within a 10-minute span you can go anywhere in downtown L.A. and find three or four or five people just shooting up meth in public, and nobody even blinks an eye anymore."

He's the president who has defied every skeptic, pretty much every critic, he's primed to do it again in November. But you must stay vigilant and don't let false accusations against him, his team, or his policy stand. If you're in a conversation, be polite, but you have the facts, you've been watching the show. But it's been a fantastic week, a fantastic few weeks. Thanks for watching us. You make this all possible. We have a great team that puts a show on every single night. And we will be covering the New Hampshire primary next week. I'm going to be up in our decision desk in New York, and we have great people on the ground in New Hampshire.
