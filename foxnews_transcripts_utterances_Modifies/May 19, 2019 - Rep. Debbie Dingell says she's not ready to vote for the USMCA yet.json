Joining us exclusively straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on President Trump's immigration plan, where Republicans and Democrats can work together ahead of the 2020 election, reaction to one GOP lawmaker claiming President Trump committed impeachable offenses.  We will also hear from the ranking members of two powerful committees this morning, Congressman Doug Collins from Judiciary on his Democratic colleagues targeting Attorney General Bill Barr before the Justice Department inspector general releases his report on the origins of the Russia probe.  And Congressman Mac Thornberry is here from Armed Services on Iran tensions and how concerns over Chinese telecom giant Huawei may be impacting U.S.- China trade talks.  Plus, Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here with us, co-chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, along with former House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, why he says, when it comes to the origins of the Russia probe, look to e-mails between James Comey and John Brennan. All that as we look ahead right now right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  And the long-awaited DOJ inspector general's report on the origins of the Russia investigation is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. A source telling FOX News that I.G. Michael Horowitz is focusing on the role of the Steele dossier in securing a surveillance warrant on former Trump aide Carter Page. Attorney General William Barr, speaking out on all of this, saying he has questions about how then president-elect Trump was briefed on the salacious and unverified material in that dossier.",

When did he actually come to the conclusion that there was no obstruction? When did he actually decide that there were issues that we didn't look into the dossier more? These are the kind of lessons we want to see.   But it is interesting that the chairman of my committee, Chairman Nadler, he's talked about getting Mueller there. And then he talks to him some more. And we're still not having him here.  So I think that the interesting thing here, Maria, is Democrats are becoming more and more concerned about what they're finding out. They did not get out of the Mueller report what they wanted. They don't like an attorney general who's actually doing his job. And now they're beginning to worry that if Mueller comes in and he just confirms what they have, they're in a tough political position.

He's been truthful on everything that he has said so far to everyone. So I think he is really taking this in a very panoramic view. He's looking at it from all sides.

If there was something wrong, will it be -- they will be held accountable, and that it won't happen again.

And I think that is one -- something that he's made very important. Field level officers didn't -- and field level out agents did not do most of the investigation. This was conducted at the senior levels at the Department of Justice. So when you look at the Department of Justice's investigation, the Russian part, and then you also look how it came over from the midyear investigation, I think you're going to see a lot of overlap.

And Chairman Nadler can't seem to get off of. One is messaging bills that will never become law. And, if they did, they'd be very harmful, number two, not dealing with a crisis on the border. This week's dreamer bill is a very -- an expansion of amnesty for those who have came over, perceivably under those, the children who came over with no way of having any control over that by parents. The bill has a lot of problems. We're going to be dealing with that in committee this week. But the question I have for my chairman and others in the Democratic Party is, why are we not focused on the crisis at the border that the president's been talking about for a long time, but now is averaging over the past week or so 4,500 apprehensions a day?

The other thing is, if you don't believe this is a problem, if you don't believe we need to fix it, which is what my bill does, is, there was a 51- year-old Honduras man the other -- just recently who had been deported once, who came over with a 6-month-old child that was not his relative, knowing that, once they got here, he would be treated differently because he had the unaccompanied minor with him.

And I'm glad that he has focused on that, because that's something that, frankly, also the Democrats have ignored completely as well. But he also, again, continues the twofold purpose on the border itself. That's where my bill comes in. That's what he has discussed in his. And that is dealing with the Flores decision, which means that we can't keep the unaccompanied minors in custody for more than 20 days. Then we also have the asylum fix in my bill, which is raising the credible fear standard. Right now, more than 80 to 90 percent, once they cross the border and simply say, I have credible fear that if I go back to something would happen to me, they're let in.

He's looking at what has happened. He sees what's been going on over the past couple years. And he wants to know, what is the predicate for it? How did we get here? Were there things that were done right? Were there things that were done wrong? This is an attorney general who seems to really take his job seriously, who's been very straightforward with the American people. He's been very straightforward with Congress and with the media. I think this is the thing that we have needed the most in this, is clarity from someone who says, let's find the answers, let's take all the spin off, and let's get to the bottom of it."

And I think it really speaks well for the attorney general and also why the Democrats are so afraid of this attorney general actually asking the real tough questions and putting Mr. Durham in charge of this. The things that would concern me the most damning things that I would be looking at, is, was there information that was misleading to the FISA court? Was there actual lies? Was there abuses there that now are coming out? Was there other issues that have been now misrepresented maybe before Congress or before other agencies as we go forward? I think these are the questions that you have to ask. What I appreciate about the attorney general not doing is jumping to conclusions. He said, we're going to investigate this. We're going to see what actually was out there, because there's too many discrepancies in the stories. But if there are some out there who have been trying to now cover up their tracks, I think Bill Barr is going to get to the bottom of it."

But we just had George Papadopoulos on just two weeks ago, who told us informants were thrown at him as early as March of 2016. Are we learning more and more evidence that, in fact, the spying and the informants began way before the official beginning of that investigation, which they're saying is July of '16?"

It goes back to sort of that cabal that started on the mid-year investigation, the Clinton e-mail investigation with Strzok and Page and Baker, Comey, all this coming together. And so now we're getting a better picture of the intent and better picture of what they were actually planning. As this is actually investigated, and Mr. Durham continues is, this is where I believe we will see the -- either the confirmation of what many of us have thought, that there was this determination that they didn't like the president, now President Trump, candidate Trump at the time, and they were doing everything in their possibility to keep that from happening."

An A.G. must act like the leader of the Department of Justice, an organization based on truth.

He's actually been one at the center of this whole thing for the last two- and-a-half years. And now he's going out and actually talking about Attorney General Barr and slime. Maybe he's -- I'm not sure where he's coming from on that part, because the former FBI director has put enough slime out there himself by how he has acted and how he has went forward on many things, when we look at his performance, especially coming out of the Clinton investigation, into the issues with the FISA, into the issue of the Russia investigation.

And I know others have as well, because we have serious questions about the Mueller report as well, not just the fact that there was no collusion, no obstruction, and no charges obstruction, but actually what did he look at? When did he actually come to the conclusion that there was no obstruction? When did he actually decide that there were issues that we didn't look into the dossier more? These are the kind of lessons we want to see. But it is interesting that the chairman of my committee, Chairman Nadler, he's talked about getting Mueller there. And then he talks to him some more. And we're still not having him here. So I think that the interesting thing here, Maria, is Democrats are becoming more and more concerned about what they're finding out. They did not get out of the Mueller report what they wanted. They don't like an attorney general who's actually doing his job. And now they're beginning to worry that if Mueller comes in and he just confirms what they have, they're in a tough political position. And I think that is the problem that they're facing now, is, what do they do with what they promised, when they went out over their skis and said, all this is going to be proven and Donald Trump is guilty? Now they're having to deal with reality."

And he said, I want my folks to look at this and determine, is there -- was there something wrong? If there was something wrong, will it be -- they will be held accountable, and that it won't happen again.

And, Congressman, I just want to wrap up what we were just talking about before we get into immigration. It was just about three days before Hillary Clinton was to be interviewed before the FBI for the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails. And her husband, Bill Clinton, met with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac in Phoenix. You remember the day. I remember the day. And our viewers know exactly what went on there. Do you think this is going to be part of any of these investigations, that e-mail investigation of Hillary Clinton, and why her husband met with the sitting attorney general? And, if I remember correctly, at the time, they said they decided to talk about grandkids."

But I believe what the attorney general is looking at is, where did this come from? And I think there's some overlap between the players. And I think that is one -- something that he's made very important. Field level officers didn't -- and field level out agents did not do most of the investigation. This was conducted at the senior levels at the Department of Justice. So when you look at the Department of Justice's investigation, the Russian part, and then you also look how it came over from the midyear investigation, I think you're going to see a lot of overlap. So there could be some questions there. We will have to see how the USA wants to do that."

Let me move on to immigration, because the House Judiciary Committee this upcoming week is going to be voting on three immigration bills Wednesday, the first real action the House has taken on this issue, although you have a bill on the border crisis. Tell me about what you're going to be voting on this upcoming week."

And this is -- again, the unfortunate part of what we have had, Maria, is for many of us who believe that there are bipartisan solutions, especially for immigration and for other things, the Judiciary Committee has really been on two tangents. And Chairman Nadler can't seem to get off of. One is messaging bills that will never become law. And, if they did, they'd be very harmful, number two, not dealing with a crisis on the border. This week's dreamer bill is a very -- an expansion of amnesty for those who have came over, perceivably under those, the children who came over with no way of having any control over that by parents. The bill has a lot of problems. We're going to be dealing with that in committee this week. But the question I have for my chairman and others in the Democratic Party is, why are we not focused on the crisis at the border that the president's been talking about for a long time, but now is averaging over the past week or so 4,500 apprehensions a day? These are family units."

One, this is bigger than the numbers when President Obama went on TV and made the plea saying, we have a crisis. And we actually stayed that summer and gave more money. And there seemed to be bipartisan support at that point for the unaccompanied minors coming across the border. Now, it seems like the Democrats simply want to use them as pawns. The other thing is, if you don't believe this is a problem, if you don't believe we need to fix it, which is what my bill does, is, there was a 51- year-old Honduras man the other -- just recently who had been deported once, who came over with a 6-month-old child that was not his relative, knowing that, once they got here, he would be treated differently because he had the unaccompanied minor with him.

And I'm talking to these children, one an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, who are alone. They crossed the border alone. The other woman, who was holding an infant, had been walking in hitchhiking for three months. It's an incredible story, particularly what you see happening with children. So what did you think of the president's analysis this week, and his plan to tackle the border crisis, now 520,000 apprehensions just since October? We saw many of them while we were standing right there talking to Border Patrol."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "The numbers are staggering. And I'm proud of the president. I think that what the president has done is, he's taken a twofold approach. One, this week, he actually introduced and discuss legal immigration, which is something that is valuable to our economy, valuable to our nation and sovereignty as a status, is people who want to come here who can produce and be a part from all over the world, no matter where they come from, having that ability to come under our legal immigration system. And I'm glad that he has focused on that, because that's something that, frankly, also the Democrats have ignored completely as well. But he also, again, continues the twofold purpose on the border itself. That's where my bill comes in. That's what he has discussed in his. And that is dealing with the Flores decision, which means that we can't keep the unaccompanied minors in custody for more than 20 days. Then we also have the asylum fix in my bill, which is raising the credible fear standard. Right now, more than 80 to 90 percent, once they cross the border and simply say, I have credible fear that if I go back to something would happen to me, they're let in. But when they actually come back, if they do come back to the immigration court, less than 10 percent are actually -- roughly around 10 percent are actually getting to stay under that standard."

This is where it's really -- these three areas, the Flores asylum and these trafficking victim, actually, is really the key crux of taking away the -- just the heinous act of letting people think that there is something better for him if they take on these trips, the young people that you saw, those children coming across."

And that elevated threat is particularly directed towards Americans. And I think anyone really has to have their political blinders on to dismiss this elevated threat information that we have received. And I think the administration has responded appropriately by making it clear, not just through words, but through actions, movement of troops and forces and so forth, that, if Iran attacks us, we will respond."

We saw this past week four tankers receive some sort of attack or explosion that didn't sink them, but it may have been a warning sign that Iran could do worse. And, remember, the context here is, Iran's economy is in real trouble. And oil is a major factor in their economy.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "THORNBERRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you're right. It has certainly gone beyond trade and economics at this point. Part of what's at stake is which nation is going to set the standard for the rest of the world, which nation's values are going to predominate. We see China using not just their military, but their economic and trade leverage and investment, all over the world to get their hooks into some of these less developed countries who are just desperate for ports and roads and other kinds of infrastructure. But once China starts getting their hooks in them, then they expect those lesser developed countries to toe the line. And they're doing it not just in Asia, but in Africa and all sorts of places around the world. We see Chinese influence in South America, for example. So this is -- really is a worldwide competition, a strategic competition that goes far beyond trade and economics. And I think it's very important for the president not to capitulate and back down now in these trade talks, because there are things that are much bigger at stake."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And when you say get their hooks in there, let's explain that for a moment, because China has a lot of money. It throws it around. It may acquire various firms, if they want that technology. And those companies who are money-losing will just get acquired by Chinese. They are also telling countries in Africa and throughout Europe, we have your back when it comes to infrastructure of telecom. We will build your infrastructure with Huawei technology. What are the risks around that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THORNBERRY",
      "utterance": "Oh, they're enormous. And they're not just doing that in Africa and South Asia. Even in Europe, they will go into Europe with very low-cost telecommunications equipment. But there is a real significant danger, with all of that Chinese-built equipment, that it doesn't just perform its mission, but it also is a threat to the information that passes through that equipment and sends it back home to Beijing. And so one of our major areas of discussion in recent months with our European allies is, don't be swayed by these low-cost deals that China is trying to make with you, because there is a real threat to your security and our ability to share information. So, whether it is Huawei routers, whether it is financing ports and infrastructure and so forth with debt terms that the countries can't possibly pay back, whether it is, as you mentioned, buying firms to get their intellectual property, stealing intellectual property all over the -- all over the world, there is a worldwide competition going on here. China has all sorts of levers to -- and tools to use, and it's using them effectively."

So now there is nothing holding us back to pass the bill that would bring more jobs to America. And the timing could not be more perfect. It will only make us stronger in this battle with China, where China doesn't want to have a fair trade agreement. But it would unite America's. And that is something that would be much stronger in this debate going forward, make America stronger, make our economy even bigger and create -- they're talking about more than 200,000 new jobs.

Those milestones of the trade -- of the steel tariffs, the idea that Mexico would even have a vote in their own Senate to change their labor laws proves it's an opportunity now to move forward. And I think it's a better time to do it now than moving later into the year, especially when we're dealing with China right now. You would want America to have a stronger hand in this debate."

This makes America stronger. You asked for certain requirements. Those have been met. Now is the perfect time to really focus on America. Move this forward. And right now, in the next two months, would be the best time to vote on it."

We were working about lowering prescription drugs. In Energy and Commerce, we actually passed three bills that would give the public and the consumer more options at a lower price. And it passed unanimously, with every Republican and every Democrat voting for it. But before it came to the floor, the Democrat leadership put a poison pill in it. And, in this poison pill, dealing with the Affordable Care Act, they were now going to remove, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 1.5 millions Americans' preferred health plan. They wanted to make sure that this bill would not become law. Even one of the congresswomen who was one of the best friends with the speaker, Anna Eshoo, said she did not like this path going forward. And then, when we look at Ways and Means, we just had the Secure Act dealing with pensions..."

They're removing the 529 plan that gives the parents the freedom to save money for their kids' college. They're breaking their promise. And if that is the pattern, how could we ever get to an infrastructure deal or other items? So, that is the concern. This is not the same Democratic Party in the past. This has become a socialist Democratic Party that wants greater control over our lives and less freedom."

They won't even schedule it in a committee. This is what we're talking about when you say anti-Semitic. This goes to the core of it. It's about boycotting, divestment, sanctions against Israel, wanting Israel to fail. The Democrats say one thing, but this new socialist Democratic Party won't even allow this to go into committee. So we have one rule that we can deal with. It's called a discharge petition."

Number two, President Trump has engaged in impeachable -- impeachable conduct. Number three, partisanship has eroded our system of checks and balances.

He's been in Congress quite some time. I think he's only ever asked one question in all the committees that he's been in. He votes more with Nancy Pelosi than he ever votes with me. It's a question whether he's even in our Republican Conference as a whole. What he wants is attention in this process. He's not a criminal attorney. He's never met Mueller. He's never met Barr. And now he's coming forward with this? Because this is what he wants. He wants a Sunday show to put his name forward with a question. It's really disturbing, because, when you watch on the floor, you could have a bill with 400 votes all supporting it. There will always be one opposed, and that will be Justin Amash."

I am one of those people who has said from the beginning Congress has an oversight responsibility. We need to continue that oversight. But we have got -- both parties, by the way, have got to deliver for the people. And he was right to talk about prescription drugs. But where you go across this country, it's all I have heard about again this weekend. People are worried about the cost of health care, the cost of their prescription drugs."

      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "Well, we did pass a drug -- we passed some bills this weekend on drug pricing. But the fact of the matter is, we have got to do a lot more. I hope we can do it in a bipartisan way, because here's the reality. We can get bills through the House. We want to work in Energy and Commerce, which is the committee I'm on, moving out these bills. The more bipartisan we make them, I think it's better off for the country. We need the Senate to move the bills. I assure you we will get bills out of the House. And we will do it quickly, that let's hope that we can get bills that are bipartisan and that we can get the president to sign. The president is hearing the same things."

      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "I think there's two issues. One is that it -- we made progress in Mexico on the labor provisions, but we -- it's got to be stronger on enforcement of those labor provisions. And they have got to make it there. General Motors moved a Blazer plant to -- or put a Blazer plant in Mexico and is paying $1.50 an hour. And we're competing with that salary. And it's not tough enough to make sure that that doesn't happen yet. And, two, Kevin McCarthy didn't talk about the fact that there are pharmaceutical provisions in there that will increase the cost of drugs. We need to address those. Ambassador Lighthizer knows that those have to be addressed. He is dealing. He said, tell me who to deal with. I'm talking to 100 people. He is dealing with the speaker of the House. We know we need a level playing field. That's an important piece of legislation. But it's got to be done right."

And both communities are under attack with people that are targeting them with hatred and fear and bigotry. We got to stand up against all of this. One of the most fundamental pillars of our Constitution is freedom of religion. And these two communities -- I am absolutely for a free state of Israel. We have to make sure that they can be there.

When did the Russia probe begin? When did it become hopelessly commingled with the Trump campaign? What was the factual predicate? Where are the transcripts, if any exists, between the informants and the telephone calls to George Papadopoulos, why the defensive briefing so inadequate of President Trump? Why didn't you do a follow-up defensive briefing? That doesn't even get to the whole FISA story in the fall. That's just -- that's just the spring and summer of 2016. There are lots of questions. And I hope Bill Barr finds someone who is skilled enough to answer them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, if the bureau is going to send an informant in, the informant is going to be wired. And if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there's going to be a transcript of that. And some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist, but they haven't been made public. And I think one in particular is going -- it has the potential to actually persuade people. Very little on this Russia probe, I'm afraid, is going to persuade people who hate Trump or who love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that I think has the potential to be a game-changer danger, if it's ever made public."

You know, Johnny Ratcliffe is rightfully exercised over the obligations that the government has to tell the whole truth to a court when you are seeking permission to spy or do surveillance on an American. And part of that includes the responsibility of providing exculpatory information or information that tends to show the person didn't do something wrong. If you have exculpatory information, and you don't share it with the court, that ain't good. I have seen it. Johnny has seen it. I would love for your viewers to see it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, take a half-step back. People use the word dossier, and it has such an official sound to it. I mean, let's just call it for what it is. It's a series of rank hearsay -- hearsay compilations put together by an FBI source who was later defrocked, paid for by the Democrat National Committee. And, oh, by the way, Christopher Steele hated Donald Trump too. So we can call it a dossier. It sounds official. It's really something The National Enquirer would blush if they printed. So we know that it was used four times by the United States government. What we're trying to figure out is whether or not it was used a fifth time in the intelligence assessment. And you got Brennan, Clapper and Comey, all three who know full well whether or not it was used in the intelligence assessment, but they're giving you different -- they're giving you different versions."
