      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" And tonight, as we speak, fake news outlets all over the country, they are drooling over Kamala Harris. They are singing her praises. They are writing what are cringe-worthy fluff pieces to, of course, please their far-left editors.  But while they lie to your face, again, we will bring you the truth. We will, as usual, do the job, the state run propaganda hate-Trump media mob called refers us to do. Buckle up, because tonight, we are vetting Kamala Harris and it continues. In just moments, we will call out her phony praise of Joe Biden. Wow. Amazing what a day can do and it can change everything.  We'll also show you her very and most radical socialist positions from police, to fracking, the consumption of red meat and even the elimination of straws and all private health care plans, they would be outlawed and her support of gun bans by executive fiat.  Also, Vice President Mike Pence will weigh in, straight ahead. But we'll start in Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden somehow managed to travel a few miles away from his basement bunker to introduce his new running mate after, what, a three-hour delay and extremely long, meandering speech, delivered with the help of his trusty teleprompter in an almost empty gymnasium, Joe Biden finally made it official.  And during the joint event, didn't take questions after trashing President Trump, predictively. Of course, both Biden and Harris heaped scripted praise all over each other. It was so fake, so blatantly phony that you couldn't help but kind of cringe when you know the truth. There was only a few months ago that Kamala Harris was heavily suggesting that Joe Biden was a racist and a sexist. Oh, amazing how things change in election years, isn't that?",

That historic -- both historic legislation, and worked with the former Klansman on the issue of stopping the integration of schools and saying he didn't want his kids going to school in a, quote, racial jungle. So why would Joe Biden pick a running mate who all but pretty much called him racist over and over again? Why would he pick someone who said \"I believe Biden's sexual misconduct accusers\"?  Well, the answer is simple. Senator Harris is a favorite of the radical far left establishment. New York toilet paper Times, though, they called her a pragmatic moderate. No way, shape, or form. That's just another outright lie by The New York Times. 2019, she had the most liberal voting record of any other U.S. senator. She was actually to the left of Bolshevik Bernie Sanders. She was the cosponsor of that insane Green New Deal and maybe they are just trying to cover up his crazy socialist agenda by giving Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez a whopping 60 seconds, we found out tonight, to speak at the Democratic Convention.  Unfortunately, for Kamala Harris, she is now on tape promising to ban all fracking. Pennsylvania, are you paying attention? On day one in office, take a look.",

Now, get this: the media raised those questions about 71-year-old John McCain and his age in 2008. They raised questions about 73-year-old Ronald Reagan during his reelection bid in 1984.

I'm not a doctor, but he looks kind of fragile, tired, weak to me. These constant embarrassments, they are beginning to raise a lot of serious questions. And people in the country are talking about it, whether the mob wants to cover it up or not. The confusion, the bouts of anger. Are you a junkie? Did you get tested for cocaine? Come on, man. Almost no one outside of this network even seems willing to seriously broach the subject. We will do our job. In fact, they are actively trying to cover up his apparent issues. Over there at state-run conspiracy television MSDNC -- well, they seemingly actually cropped out what appeared to be a written script of Biden and having a casual video conversation with Kamala Harris. And by the way, you can actually see Biden in that picture, he's holding the phone upside down.  And ultimately the Biden campaign is hoping that Kamala Harris will bring a much-needed boost of energy, charisma, alertness, that Biden clearly lacks. That was those are fundamentals I think for the hardest job in the world and is one problem with that theory.  Kamala -- well, she doesn't connect with voters. Her presidential bid was a massive failure, a flop. She dropped out in December before any primary or any caucus. She was pulling at a meager 2 percent or less, especially after Tulsi Gabbard's takedown. Even in her home state of California, she was pulling in single digits. They know her best. But fear not, the media mob, the cult that they are, that hates Trump 24/7, all they will do and say anything they can to help lift her up. Just take a look at today's front page, New York toilet paper \"Times\", it's worthless. Basically, it's as good as toilet paper. Compare it to their coverage in 2016 of Vice President Pence. Donald Trump's choice for a running mate.  As we have said many times on the show, back in 2007 forward, journalism is dead, it is gone, it is buried.

And that is that Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left.  Kamala Harris, like Joe Biden, supports higher taxes, socialized medicine, open borders, abortion on demand. And where Joe Biden said he would be willing to cut funding to police, she said recently that she thought that we should reimagine the police in this country.  And I just have to tell you, I -- you know, I like the matchup. You know, it's on, Sean. I can't wait to get back out there. I will be in Iowa tomorrow, telling the story of what this president has done, how we made this country stronger, more prosperous in our first three years, how President Trump has seen us through the worst pandemic in 100 years, and how we have already created more jobs in the last three months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama created in their eight years in office.  I'm excited to tell the story.

And now, America's military is stronger than ever before.  But this president, by cutting taxes, by rolling back more regulations than any president in American history, by fighting for the kind of free and fair trade like the USMCA that was a win for American manufacturing, a win for American farmers, a trade deal that Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against, and you see his commitment to follow through on appointing conservatives to our courts at every level.  Contrast that with now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They actually want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They want to do their own version of the Green New Deal, of a $2 trillion massive environmental agenda. They are going to appoint activists to our court. They're going to support taxpayer funding of abortion.  They support open borders. And the truth of the matter is, beyond all of that, with everything that's happening in Chicago and New York and Portland and Seattle, you have in President Trump a leader who is standing without apology with the men and women of law enforcement.  And in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party and the radical left, you have people talking about cutting funding to law enforcement, a party that's advocating defunding law enforcement.

Sidney Powell pointed that out back in 2015.

It appears she lied to Congress. She said she knew nothing about the FBI collusion investigation or the sub investigation of Michael Flynn. In fact, she knew all about it and was involved in it. She attended the White House meeting in which it was discussed with Comey and Obama. And, of course, there are documents that show she knew about the investigation shortly after it was launched in the summer of 2016. She lied about unmasking, claiming she knew nothing about it. When confronted with evidence, she admitted it was a lie because she was complicit in the unmasking. But worse than that, she was reading and analyzing secret intelligence summaries of Trump officials. That was political espionage, because the summaries had nothing to do with national security and everything to do with politics. But I'll make this prediction.

They are writing what are cringe-worthy fluff pieces to, of course, please their far-left editors. But while they lie to your face, again, we will bring you the truth. We will, as usual, do the job, the state run propaganda hate-Trump media mob called refers us to do. Buckle up, because tonight, we are vetting Kamala Harris and it continues. In just moments, we will call out her phony praise of Joe Biden. Wow. Amazing what a day can do and it can change everything. We'll also show you her very and most radical socialist positions from police, to fracking, the consumption of red meat and even the elimination of straws and all private health care plans, they would be outlawed and her support of gun bans by executive fiat. Also, Vice President Mike Pence will weigh in, straight ahead. But we'll start in Wilmington, Delaware, where Biden somehow managed to travel a few miles away from his basement bunker to introduce his new running mate after, what, a three-hour delay and extremely long, meandering speech, delivered with the help of his trusty teleprompter in an almost empty gymnasium, Joe Biden finally made it official. And during the joint event, didn't take questions after trashing President Trump, predictively. Of course, both Biden and Harris heaped scripted praise all over each other. It was so fake, so blatantly phony that you couldn't help but kind of cringe when you know the truth. There was only a few months ago that Kamala Harris was heavily suggesting that Joe Biden was a racist and a sexist. Oh, amazing how things change in election years, isn't that?"

That historic -- both historic legislation, and worked with the former Klansman on the issue of stopping the integration of schools and saying he didn't want his kids going to school in a, quote, racial jungle. So why would Joe Biden pick a running mate who all but pretty much called him racist over and over again? Why would he pick someone who said \"I believe Biden's sexual misconduct accusers\"? Well, the answer is simple. Senator Harris is a favorite of the radical far left establishment. New York toilet paper Times, though, they called her a pragmatic moderate. No way, shape, or form. That's just another outright lie by The New York Times. 2019, she had the most liberal voting record of any other U.S. senator. She was actually to the left of Bolshevik Bernie Sanders. She was the cosponsor of that insane Green New Deal and maybe they are just trying to cover up his crazy socialist agenda by giving Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez a whopping 60 seconds, we found out tonight, to speak at the Democratic Convention.

As part of her radical socialist agenda, Harris would even ban plastic straws and limit your consumption of red meat. I just love when the government is there to tell me how to live.

And, of course, your taxes, they will go through the roof. She's already plotting major tax hikes. So, let's keep track of this minor part of her radical agenda, Senator Harris would confiscate your private health insurance, your income, yep, it even says by executive fiat we are going to take away some of your guns, your plastic straws, your red meat and that list goes on. She wants the government to complete would dictate every aspect of your life. That's because like many of the radical socialist left, well, Senator Harris believes that the American people actually says it about one particular voting bloc and demographic are just stupid.

I'm not a doctor, but he looks kind of fragile, tired, weak to me. These constant embarrassments, they are beginning to raise a lot of serious questions. And people in the country are talking about it, whether the mob wants to cover it up or not. The confusion, the bouts of anger. Are you a junkie? Did you get tested for cocaine? Come on, man. Almost no one outside of this network even seems willing to seriously broach the subject. We will do our job. In fact, they are actively trying to cover up his apparent issues. Over there at state-run conspiracy television MSDNC -- well, they seemingly actually cropped out what appeared to be a written script of Biden and having a casual video conversation with Kamala Harris. And by the way, you can actually see Biden in that picture, he's holding the phone upside down. And ultimately the Biden campaign is hoping that Kamala Harris will bring a much-needed boost of energy, charisma, alertness, that Biden clearly lacks. That was those are fundamentals I think for the hardest job in the world and is one problem with that theory. Kamala -- well, she doesn't connect with voters. Her presidential bid was a massive failure, a flop. She dropped out in December before any primary or any caucus. She was pulling at a meager 2 percent or less, especially after Tulsi Gabbard's takedown. Even in her home state of California, she was pulling in single digits. They know her best. But fear not, the media mob, the cult that they are, that hates Trump 24/7, all they will do and say anything they can to help lift her up. Just take a look at today's front page, New York toilet paper \"Times\", it's worthless. Basically, it's as good as toilet paper. Compare it to their coverage in 2016 of Vice President Pence. Donald Trump's choice for a running mate. As we have said many times on the show, back in 2007 forward, journalism is dead, it is gone, it is buried.

And that is that Joe Biden and the Democratic Party have been overtaken by the radical left.  Kamala Harris, like Joe Biden, supports higher taxes, socialized medicine, open borders, abortion on demand. And where Joe Biden said he would be willing to cut funding to police, she said recently that she thought that we should reimagine the police in this country.  And I just have to tell you, I -- you know, I like the matchup. You know, it's on, Sean. I can't wait to get back out there. I will be in Iowa tomorrow, telling the story of what this president has done, how we made this country stronger, more prosperous in our first three years, how President Trump has seen us through the worst pandemic in 100 years, and how we have already created more jobs in the last three months than Joe Biden and Barack Obama created in their eight years in office.  I'm excited to tell the story.

We rebuilt our military, restored the arsenal of democracy. And now, America's military is stronger than ever before.  But this president, by cutting taxes, by rolling back more regulations than any president in American history, by fighting for the kind of free and fair trade like the USMCA that was a win for American manufacturing, a win for American farmers, a trade deal that Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against, and you see his commitment to follow through on appointing conservatives to our courts at every level.  Contrast that with now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They actually want to raise taxes by $4 trillion. They want to do their own version of the Green New Deal, of a $2 trillion massive environmental agenda. They are going to appoint activists to our court. They're going to support taxpayer funding of abortion.  They support open borders. And the truth of the matter is, beyond all of that, with everything that's happening in Chicago and New York and Portland and Seattle, you have in President Trump a leader who is standing without apology with the men and women of law enforcement.  And in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party and the radical left, you have people talking about cutting funding to law enforcement, a party that's advocating defunding law enforcement. The choice could not be clearer.  And, as I said, I can't wait to get out there, and get out there and tell that story. And I think the American people are going to vote for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House."

This is a president who, because of the policies we advanced, we actually saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for African-Americans.  We saw the creation of thousands of Opportunity Zones and creating billions of dollars of investment in our inner cities. This is a president who doubled the school choice program here in our nation's capital, has been fighting for educational opportunities for every American, especially our minority communities.  And that's a record that I'm excited to talk about. This is a president who's been out there fighting for the American dream for every American, regardless of race or creed or color."

Remember, we showed you Tulsi Gabbard ripping her record in a debate last night and as attorney general -- district attorney, rather, in San Francisco and is California attorney general, Harris' office was plagued by incompetence and efficiency, even claims of last night and as attorney general -- district attorney, rather, in San Francisco and is California attorney general, her office was plagued by incompetence and efficiency, even claims of outright corruption. Sidney Powell pointed that out back in 2015. Harris was scorched by a federal judge after, quote, Harris and her staff defended the indefensible after it was revealed that a state prosecutor falsified a transcript of a confession. So ever since, Harris has, well, set foot on Capitol Hill, she's been working overtime to pander to the far left and pretend like none of that ever happen. Remember the Michael Brown case, Ferguson, Missouri? Just last year, quote, tweeted: Michael Brown's murder forever changed Ferguson and America. His tragic death sparked a desperately need conversation and a nationwide movement. We must fight for stronger accountability of racial equality in our justice system."

You saw different Kamala Harris today at the press conference and this was the Kamala Harris who wanted to destroy Joe Biden. Let me be very clear about her. She will say things about Black Lives Matter. She said that today. Well, Kamala, is it Black Lives Matter like David Dorn, the black officer, is a black lives like the ones in Chicago? When you say black lives matter, is that all black lives or are you just saying that to appease the extremist group? That's a situation that she has explained. The other thing about it is, if she is such a pro-law and order moderate Democrat, where's all the police unions supporting her? They are supporting Donald Trump. One last thing, she's a nasty person. She's mean. Look what you try to do with Justice Kavanaugh.

If you believe in science stuff, liberals claim they believe in science and everything. Let's not forget as well, the two most memorable moments of Kamala Harris' campaign was when she implied that Joe Biden was a racist, number one. That was her star is born moment in the second one is that she believed Joe Biden's accusers, that he was all gropey, you know, and hansy and stuff, you know, things -- putting hands on people he probably shouldn't have been doing.

You know, and Beto who would lick his finger and change his position based on the political winds -- well, Kamala Harris is even worse. You know, I use this analogy once talking about Beto, but I think it applies better to Kamala Harris. She's like -- a member Ghostbusters? You know, Gozer the Gozerian, you know, Gozer is whatever you think he is. You know, If you think of the stay puffed marshmallow man, that's what he -- that's Kamala Harris.

Kamala's, well, California's top prosecutor at the time ordered a raid on the residence of David Daleiden, remember him, who produced the undercover videos to expose highly controversial activities within Planned Parenthood.

It appears she lied to Congress. She said she knew nothing about the FBI collusion investigation or the sub investigation of Michael Flynn. In fact, she knew all about it and was involved in it. She attended the White House meeting in which it was discussed with Comey and Obama. And, of course, there are documents that show she knew about the investigation shortly after it was launched in the summer of 2016. She lied about unmasking, claiming she knew nothing about it. When confronted with evidence, she admitted it was a lie because she was complicit in the unmasking. But worse than that, she was reading and analyzing secret intelligence summaries of Trump officials. That was political espionage, because the summaries had nothing to do with national security and everything to do with politics. But I'll make this prediction.

My new book, \"Live Free or Die\" America and the world on the brink will debut number one on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list. I can't thank you enough. It's not about being number one, it's about keeping America number one. This is the most radical, extreme agenda. It'll destroy -- if these policies are implemented, it'll destroy liberty and freedom, and these promises will never be fulfilled. I'm hosting a live virtual event 7:00 Eastern tomorrow. Information, just go to Hannity.com and 40 percent off today on the book. Let not your heart be troubled. Governor Huckabee in for Laura tonight. Governor, how are you? It's great to see you.
