This afternoon, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by President Trump and Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi raising the debt ceiling and funding the government into December. Along with devoting $15 billion for Hurricane Harvey relief. The House is expected to pass the bill quickly, and President Trump isn't stopping there. Also agreeing with Senator Schumer to pursue a plan that would eliminate debt ceiling votes altogether. Administration officials are out advancing the new shift in strategy.",

But this is where President Trump again, as we're going back to old tweets and old things, 2012 talked about, as a civilian, he would have compassion for these people.",

That right there is Cockburn Town in Turks and Caicos, and they're getting pummeled by a Cat 5 hurricane. Probably something they've never seen here. Similar to what we saw yesterday, yesterday the islands in the Western Tales (ph) and British Virgin Islands that have never seen that strong of a storm. This is what the future radar looks like. So throughout the night tonight, it's going to move through Turks and Caicos, kind of the southern Bahama islands here. But nothing at all that is going to break this storm apart. And this brings us to Saturday morning. You still still a very well- defined storm here. In fact, all of our forecasting shows that it will maintain Category 5, maybe Category 4 strength all the way through interaction in south Florida. A lot of that is because the water temperature is incredibly warm. It's going to be going over the warmest water that it has in its entire life span so far. Tends into the upper SC. That's plenty of fuel for the storm.  And take a look at what's happening right now. So we talk about storm surge, maybe 15 to 20 feet across these islands in Turks and Caicos. A lot of those islands aren't even that tall. So we're going to have a complete wash over of those islands. And then waves on top of that: 45 and 46 feet of waves. That's what we're recording on some of these buoys out here. So all of those waves moving that direction. Things are looking bad. Overall, the forecast track has changed a little bit from what we've been talking about throughout much of the day today. It shifted a little bit to the west. It's really not good news for all of this population zone here on the eastern shore of Florida, especially around Homestead and up towards Miami. That would put in an intense amount of storm surge right into this area. Not just the wind but the storm surge. And would probably be one of the worst storms we've ever seen in this area, the way this is looking right now.",

We've been seeing -- most of the trending going towards the eastern side here of Florida. I will tell you, so this is the European model, and it's probably the best forecasting model that we have. In its last run, it took a big jog to the west, and that puts it making landfall over the Keys here and brings all of the bad weather. It's bad weather everywhere. But the worst of the weather here towards the Miami area. I will tell you his is the first run that has moved that far west. They will probably continue to bounce back and forth. And I don't think we will really know exactly what track this takes until we see that right-hand turn, and that's going to be Saturday sometime.  So even throughout the day tomorrow we're not going to know for sure. Anywhere in south Florida is going to be dealing with hurricane-force winds and eventually probably towards Monday, maybe north Florida, certainly into Georgia. Prior runs that show this further offshore, still a very real possibility. But second -- this second landfall in Georgia and South Carolina.

This afternoon, the Senate passed a bill sponsored by President Trump and Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi raising the debt ceiling and funding the government into December. Along with devoting $15 billion for Hurricane Harvey relief. The House is expected to pass the bill quickly, and President Trump isn't stopping there. Also agreeing with Senator Schumer to pursue a plan that would eliminate debt ceiling votes altogether. Administration officials are out advancing the new shift in strategy."

The best part about this is this clears out the next 90 days for us to focus on important things. So we have the funding for Harvey. We're focused on tax reform. That's going to be the big priority for the next 90 days.

In addition to the optics, the fact that this particular deal, this debt ceiling deal, doesn't just have like a three month deadline. It took the cap off the funding. Whereas you can rack up as much debt as you want. So in D.C., when do we actually cut spending? And that's a real consideration."

You're right, Gianno. Because I think he thought that was a better opportunity than doing nothing. He knew he had no political capital. Nothing he would have tried to put forth through that Congress would have been successful.

That right there is Cockburn Town in Turks and Caicos, and they're getting pummeled by a Cat 5 hurricane. Probably something they've never seen here. Similar to what we saw yesterday, yesterday the islands in the Western Tales (ph) and British Virgin Islands that have never seen that strong of a storm. This is what the future radar looks like. So throughout the night tonight, it's going to move through Turks and Caicos, kind of the southern Bahama islands here. But nothing at all that is going to break this storm apart. And this brings us to Saturday morning. You still still a very well- defined storm here. In fact, all of our forecasting shows that it will maintain Category 5, maybe Category 4 strength all the way through interaction in south Florida. A lot of that is because the water temperature is incredibly warm. It's going to be going over the warmest water that it has in its entire life span so far. Tends into the upper SC. That's plenty of fuel for the storm. And take a look at what's happening right now. So we talk about storm surge, maybe 15 to 20 feet across these islands in Turks and Caicos. A lot of those islands aren't even that tall. So we're going to have a complete wash over of those islands."

      "utterance": "45 and 46 feet of waves. That's what we're recording on some of these buoys out here. So all of those waves moving that direction. Things are looking bad. Overall, the forecast track has changed a little bit from what we've been talking about throughout much of the day today. It shifted a little bit to the west. It's really not good news for all of this population zone here on the eastern shore of Florida, especially around Homestead and up towards Miami. That would put in an intense amount of storm surge right into this area. Not just the wind but the storm surge. And would probably be one of the worst storms we've ever seen in this area, the way this is looking right now."

    {
      "speaker": "REICHMUTH",
      "utterance": "Yes. Not super confident. So we're confident that Florida is going to get a big impact from the storm. We've been seeing -- most of the trending going towards the eastern side here of Florida. I will tell you, so this is the European model, and it's probably the best forecasting model that we have. In its last run, it took a big jog to the west, and that puts it making landfall over the Keys here and brings all of the bad weather. It's bad weather everywhere. But the worst of the weather here towards the Miami area. I will tell you his is the first run that has moved that far west. They will probably continue to bounce back and forth. And I don't think we will really know exactly what track this takes until we see that right-hand turn, and that's going to be Saturday sometime. So even throughout the day tomorrow we're not going to know for sure. Anywhere in south Florida is going to be dealing with hurricane-force winds and eventually probably towards Monday, maybe north Florida, certainly into Georgia. Prior runs that show this further offshore, still a very real possibility. But second -- this second landfall in Georgia and South Carolina. But also, now, may be possible it just stays over the Florida Peninsula."

So a Category 5, the worst hurricane ever, went over these northern islands here. And the lesser Antilles in the British Virgin Islands. The worst one they've ever had. The pictures that are coming out are devastating. Hurricane Jose behind it is now a Cat 3 hurricane. That's a major hurricane. And take a look at this. Barbuda yesterday was hit. Right here in this cone, possibly having a second major landfall of a hurricane in four to five days. I've never heard of anything like that. When you imagine all the pictures that we've seen there, all of that loose debris, the houses, the structures that have been weakened. Now another storm moving on right behind that. It is -- it's kind of unfathomable what potentially could happen there."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REICHMUTH",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a great question. For one thing, we haven't seen that across some of those buildings. Since Hurricane Andrew, they've put in a lot better building codes in a lot of south Florida, and a lot of those high rises are new. So in some cases, those building codes would be able to withstand it. That said, a Cat 4 or a Cat 5 is probably past its ability, at least with some of those windows. So I think we'll see a lot of window damage in some of those areas.
