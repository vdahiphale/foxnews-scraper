The toy your parents never wanted you to have, but you're an adult now, so who cares what they think. Rotten eggs. Proven to fly 50 percent further than fresh eggs when throwing them at the low-energy nerds in chess club. Flaming bags of dog crap, because who needs regular dog crap when it's so much more awesome on fire? Bricks. Throw them through the windows of an abandoned house or use them to build a wall. An old board with a nail in it. This isn't your grandfather's old board with a nail in it. This one comes with a free tetanus shot. A toaster fork. Need to pick up that stuck slice of bread? This 100 percent metal fork is the last one you'll ever need. The lame shrill media will tell you not to use it, but what do they know anyway? And finally a live Cobra in a tiny MAGA hat. Talk about the perfect stocking stuffer. It's the ultimate line of Trump 2020 campaign merchandise. Note to the coolest, none of these exists, so please don't stick forks in a toaster.

Why do those regrets sound like my goals?"
