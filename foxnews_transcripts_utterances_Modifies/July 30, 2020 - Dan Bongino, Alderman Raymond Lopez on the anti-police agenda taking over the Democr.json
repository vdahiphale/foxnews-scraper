      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity\". Tonight, so much breaking news that we will cover.  In just a moment, we will bring you the very latest out of Chicago. Three police officers were shot today.  We'll also show you what federal officers are now facing in Portland with video that shows the ongoing violence from their perspective that Democrats are denying.  The great one, Mark Levin, will be here, along with Leo Terrell, Larry Elder, and much more. First, we turn to Atlanta where civil rights leader, Congressman John Lewis, was laid to rest earlier today.  Now, I lived in Atlanta four years, wonderful years actually, often disagreed with and got to know many of these brave, courageous, civil rights leaders. Among them, John Lewis, disagreed politically, but I admire the courage that he had during the civil rights movement, marching on the front lines in Mississippi, in Selma, Alabama. He was severely injured while marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and his skull was fractured but because of his bravery, his persistence, along with the determination of nonviolent, other civil rights leaders, guess what? They made real change to help us become a more perfect union, made the country a better place for all Americans. His work did help make America more perfect, but we have a long way to go.  And that, of course, led to the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act, the ‘65 Voting Rights Act, which was filibustered by, let's see, the person that Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Bill and Hillary Clinton described as their mentor, Robert KKK Byrd -- ironic considering Obama's comments which we will get to.   So it was particularly troubling when the former president, Barack Obama, used John Lewis' funeral to deliver what was a divisive, politically charged, and frankly at times mean-spirited speech, filled with statements not based in truth or reality. Let's watch.",

There are those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting, by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restricted ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election.

      "sentences": "Barack Obama politicizing a funeral.   Remember Democrats did the same thing in 2002 during the memorial service for Senator Paul Wellstone. They turned a somber event into a massive, political rally. And, frankly, it disgusted everyone that tuned in. Today, we saw the very same thing, very similar with Barack Obama. In an effort to trash to President Trump and his supporters, Obama said many things that are simply, factually inaccurate and not true.  And, by the way, I told you and I tell you every two years, every four years, Democratic Party, the playbook remains the same -- they divide America, old versus young, rich versus poor, and they play the race card. Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air, water, and they want to throw grandma over a cliff in a wheelchair. Let's break it down. Obama comparing Trump to George Wallace, accusing federal law enforcement officers of using tearful gas and batons on peaceful protesters. Now, is this the so-called peaceful protesters that Obama is talking about?  The video that you're now seeing is taken from an angle from the federal officers in Portland, who are trying to stop the federal courthouse from being burned to the ground. In fact, these officers only came outside. One \"A.P.\" reporter embedded confirmed all of this, the federal building when that building came under attack.  So far, 59 officers have been injured trying to defend the courthouse, and those inside. Now, they have been hit with bricks, frozen water bottles, sticks, Molotov cocktails, fireworks. Three officers likely permanently blinded by the so-called peaceful protesters, Barack, with high powered lasers. The courthouse remains intact but firebombed on multiple occasions covered with graffiti. Is that peaceful, Barack? And vandalized night after night after night. Does this -- I ask you at home -- look peaceful, like the peaceful protest to you? Does it to you, Barack Obama? Do you really think we're that stupid? Sad, pathetic tactics and rhetoric uttered today.  Recently, Portland police recovered several large clips and Molotov cocktails in a bag near the riots. And, of course, this is not the first time that Obama has wrongly vilified police.   Let's not forget Ferguson. Let's not forget Baltimore. Let's not forget Cambridge and other high-profile incidents. And breaking today after the reopening of the case the prosecutors had in Ferguson, Missouri, they decided once again to not charge former Officer Darrell Wilson with any crimes. Remember multiple eyewitnesses, many minority, confirmed at his story completely. So, what we are witnessing today in another attempt by Democrats to divide America as they do every two and four years, along the lines that I just mentioned. And according to Barack Obama, those in power, hmm, who might he be talking about? Targeting minorities by attacking voting rights with surgical precision? Sound familiar? It should!  Because we hear this garbage every two and four years, which brings us to a very important \"Hannity\" history lesson tonight, because every single election, it is the same rhetoric from Democrats old versus young, rich versus poor, black versus white.  For example, 1998, one radio ad in Missouri claiming that black churches' crosses will burn if Republicans are elected. Listen for yourself.",

Every single Republican candidate running for major office every two four years, same thing, racist, sexist, misogynist, the whole list goes on. And the list could go on and on.  But as you can see, nothing new for the Democrats. In reality, it was President Trump not Barack and not Joe who actually got real results for every demographic group in the country. As a matter of fact, the most disproportionately hurt by Biden/Obama policies were minorities in America. It was Donald Trump, not Barack, not Joe that assured record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment.  And it was President Trump who increased funding. Longest term commitment with the largest amount of money to historically black colleges. President Trump developed opportunity zones. President Trump that passed criminal justice reform and prison reform and police reform, not Barack and not Joe.  And, today, you heard Obama say the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era. The only relic we should be concerned about is Obama's former vice president, because while Barack is comparing his political adversaries to racists and bigots, well, it's Joe Biden, the leader, their presidential candidate this year, Joe Biden works hand-in-hand with segregationist to slow integration.  Let's quote NBC News, shall we? He led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. 1977, Joe worried that his children would grow up in a, quote, \"racial jungle\", Biden's words. And let's not forget, for decades, Biden revered the former Klan leader, Robert KKK Byrd. Biden called Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, close friend, a mentor.  By the way, Byrd was also praised by Pelosi and by Schumer and by Bill and Hillary Clinton. And Byrd, by the way, along with Al Gore Sr. and others, well, they filibuster the 1964 Civil Rights Act for people like John Lewis, they accomplished which by the way was historic in every way imaginable, praising the guy that filibustered all of that? Which was ultimately passed? Why? Because Lyndon Johnson got overwhelming support from Republican senators, 80 percent in the Senate and the House. By the way, why did Democrats constantly get a pass for their disgusting history of racism? Sadly, by the way, we talk about these Democrats and George Wallace and so many others, you're talking about Democrats. And many on the left, by the way, are still getting a free pass. African-American Trump supporters are constantly demeaned, they are minimized, they're called every name in the book simply because of their race and their political beliefs.  We saw another example of this on MSDNC, all things propaganda state-run Democratic Party, radical socialist network. Take a look.",

We'll have a special message and remembering Herman Cain and his groundbreaking life in a few moments.  But first, let's address the shameful behavior from the mob and media surrounding his death. \"Reuters\" summing up his amazing life as a man who refused to wear a mask? Fake news CNN's Anna Navarro tweeting, quote, Herman Cain thought COVID was a hoax, scoffed at wearing a mask, died of COVID. Once sparsely watched MSDNC host blaming Trump for Cain's death?

Or are they just using it as a political weapon on the day he dies? By the way, it's psychosis, it's hatred, its madness. The mob hates Donald Trump so much, they literally are reveling and debt using it as a cheap political point. We'll have more of my monologue in just a moment. But joining us now with reaction, nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Larry Elder, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell. All right, Leo. You are the formal liberal. You have not voted Republican your entire life. You said on this program you're going to vote for Donald Trump this year. You saw Barack Obama today, and I can go on, and he said a lot of other things beyond that we just played, as he went on to then give talking about automatic registration, including inmates, et cetera, et cetera, getting rid of the filibuster, Jim Crow relic. And I'm looking at this and I'm listening to this and I'm saying -- and he talked about the expanding Civil Rights Act in honor of John Lewis.

What amazes me is he basically lied on television when he said that federal truth were used for peaceful protesters. There's not a peaceful protester who is trying to demolish a federal building. He tried to make an analogy that Donald Trump is George Wallace. Mr. Obama, 1.2 million black people, including one more, Leo Terrell voted for Donald Trump in 2016. It is unbelievable that he would play the race card. But you're right. You got a great man in John Lewis who died, buried today, and Herman Cain is being vilified.

Obama is a race card player and Leo Terrell is absolutely right. He is a consummate race card player which makes him more dangerous than Al Sharpton because he and people like Eric Holder can do it with a straight face and nice suit and tie, a big vocabulary, nice, well-crafted sentences, but it's the same B.S.

He's milked it for maximum power, he and his wife are now worth tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars having sold their presidency after they left office. He gives the speeches now and he's abused the black community more than any modern president that I'm aware of or any modern politician for that matter. What exactly has this man done for the black community since he's been in the private sector? What did he do for the black community when he was president other than kill school choice in Washington, D.C.? I can tell you what Lincoln did for African-Americans. I can tell you what Grant did. I can tell you what Eisenhower did. I can tell you what LBJ did. I can tell you what Donald J. Trump did, but I can't tell you what Obama did. Now, I want to educate Obama, the former law school professor and all the leftist kooks out there, this country systemically racist? Let me tell you something, no country puts hundreds of thousands of men on the battlefield and lose them in a civil war to keep a union and end slavery. The equivalent of 4 million men lost their lives to end slavery. That's a little bit more than Barack Obama has done or LeBron James. Let's go over it quickly. Civil Rights Act of 1866, does that sound like a country systemically racist? I don't have time to get into what everyone of these acts did, but people can look them up. Civil Rights Act of 1871, Civil Rights Act of 1875, Civil Rights Act of 1957, Civil Rights Act of 1960, liberals, follow along. Civil Rights Act of 1964, Civil Rights Act of 1965, Civil Rights Act of 1968, Civil Rights Act of 1990, Civil Rights Act of 1991. We have Supreme Court decisions, 1948, Shelley versus Kraemer. 1954, Brown versus Board of Education. 1962, Bailey versus Peterson. This is what I would have said at John Lewis' funeral, 1967, Loving versus Virginia. 1968, Jones versus Mayer. 1971, Griggs versus Duke Power. 1986, Paxton versus Kentucky. Now, here is what I didn't hear at the funeral when Obama was giving a Democrat left-wing kook speech, not a word about America's greatness. Not a word about how men in our military, black, white, brown, red, yellow, went off to beat Hitler, and Tojo, and Italy, fascist Italy, put their lives on the line, 400,000 of them died. Not a word about the men in Korea and Vietnam and Afghanistan and Iraq in our diverse, integrated military, not a damn word. Not a word about the thousands murdered and our city every year -- 7,500 black people, mostly 90 percent by other black people, including in his city of Chicago. Didn't bring it up once. Not a word about the nuclear family and personal responsibility and opportunity. Not a single uplifting word for the country that made him rich and made him president and made him powerful. Rather than saying, look at what I've done with my life, look at what I've become, look at all the people trying to pour over our border legally and illegally, of all races from the third world, south of the border, from the continent of Africa, from the Far East, from the Middle East, from all over the world, why are they trying to come here? Because of George Wallace and Bull Connor? This guy -- they want to run against George Wallace and Bull Connor. Well, I would say this to President Trump, you've got a quasi Bull Connor and a quasi George Wallace, his name is Joe Biden. And Joe Biden bragged about working with James Eastland and Stennis, two white segregationists and racists from Mississippi. He bragged about working with other segregationist. Joe Biden has said nasty bigoted things throughout his life despite the Praetorian guard left-wing media that protects him and his bubble in his basement, and all the rest of it. The fact of the matter is, I know this: Donald Trump at the private sector hired thousands of black Americans. Tell me, today, the very wealthy Obama's, how many black Americans have they hired? How many black Americans have a help? How many black Americans did Biden hire? None, few. This president hired thousands during the past century career in the private sector and as president of the United States, what did he get, 7, 8 percent of the black community and yet what has he done in the black community? A thousand times more than Obama ever dreamed of doing. So Obama gives a good pastor-like speech, but when the rubber hits the road, he's nowhere to be found. That's it.",

Three police officers were shot today. We'll also show you what federal officers are now facing in Portland with video that shows the ongoing violence from their perspective that Democrats are denying. The great one, Mark Levin, will be here, along with Leo Terrell, Larry Elder, and much more. First, we turn to Atlanta where civil rights leader, Congressman John Lewis, was laid to rest earlier today. Now, I lived in Atlanta four years, wonderful years actually, often disagreed with and got to know many of these brave, courageous, civil rights leaders. Among them, John Lewis, disagreed politically, but I admire the courage that he had during the civil rights movement, marching on the front lines in Mississippi, in Selma, Alabama. He was severely injured while marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and his skull was fractured but because of his bravery, his persistence, along with the determination of nonviolent, other civil rights leaders, guess what? They made real change to help us become a more perfect union, made the country a better place for all Americans. His work did help make America more perfect, but we have a long way to go. And that, of course, led to the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act, the ‘65 Voting Rights Act, which was filibustered by, let's see, the person that Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Bill and Hillary Clinton described as their mentor, Robert KKK Byrd -- ironic considering Obama's comments which we will get to. So it was particularly troubling when the former president, Barack Obama, used John Lewis' funeral to deliver what was a divisive, politically charged, and frankly at times mean-spirited speech, filled with statements not based in truth or reality. Let's watch."

There are those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting, by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restricted ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election. It's going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don't get sick. And if all this takes is eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do."

      "utterance": "Barack Obama politicizing a funeral. Remember Democrats did the same thing in 2002 during the memorial service for Senator Paul Wellstone. They turned a somber event into a massive, political rally. And, frankly, it disgusted everyone that tuned in. Today, we saw the very same thing, very similar with Barack Obama. In an effort to trash to President Trump and his supporters, Obama said many things that are simply, factually inaccurate and not true. And, by the way, I told you and I tell you every two years, every four years, Democratic Party, the playbook remains the same -- they divide America, old versus young, rich versus poor, and they play the race card. Republicans are racist, sexist, misogynist, xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic, they want dirty air, water, and they want to throw grandma over a cliff in a wheelchair. Let's break it down. Obama comparing Trump to George Wallace, accusing federal law enforcement officers of using tearful gas and batons on peaceful protesters. Now, is this the so-called peaceful protesters that Obama is talking about? The video that you're now seeing is taken from an angle from the federal officers in Portland, who are trying to stop the federal courthouse from being burned to the ground. In fact, these officers only came outside. One \"A.P.\" reporter embedded confirmed all of this, the federal building when that building came under attack. So far, 59 officers have been injured trying to defend the courthouse, and those inside. Now, they have been hit with bricks, frozen water bottles, sticks, Molotov cocktails, fireworks. Three officers likely permanently blinded by the so-called peaceful protesters, Barack, with high powered lasers. The courthouse remains intact but firebombed on multiple occasions covered with graffiti. Is that peaceful, Barack? And vandalized night after night after night. Does this -- I ask you at home -- look peaceful, like the peaceful protest to you? Does it to you, Barack Obama? Do you really think we're that stupid? Sad, pathetic tactics and rhetoric uttered today. Recently, Portland police recovered several large clips and Molotov cocktails in a bag near the riots. And, of course, this is not the first time that Obama has wrongly vilified police. Let's not forget Ferguson. Let's not forget Baltimore. Let's not forget Cambridge and other high-profile incidents. And breaking today after the reopening of the case the prosecutors had in Ferguson, Missouri, they decided once again to not charge former Officer Darrell Wilson with any crimes. Remember multiple eyewitnesses, many minority, confirmed at his story completely. So, what we are witnessing today in another attempt by Democrats to divide America as they do every two and four years, along the lines that I just mentioned. And according to Barack Obama, those in power, hmm, who might he be talking about? Targeting minorities by attacking voting rights with surgical precision? Sound familiar? It should! Because we hear this garbage every two and four years, which brings us to a very important \"Hannity\" history lesson tonight, because every single election, it is the same rhetoric from Democrats old versus young, rich versus poor, black versus white. For example, 1998, one radio ad in Missouri claiming that black churches' crosses will burn if Republicans are elected. Listen for yourself."

Every single Republican candidate running for major office every two four years, same thing, racist, sexist, misogynist, the whole list goes on. And the list could go on and on. But as you can see, nothing new for the Democrats. In reality, it was President Trump not Barack and not Joe who actually got real results for every demographic group in the country. As a matter of fact, the most disproportionately hurt by Biden/Obama policies were minorities in America. It was Donald Trump, not Barack, not Joe that assured record low after record low after record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. And it was President Trump who increased funding. Longest term commitment with the largest amount of money to historically black colleges. President Trump developed opportunity zones. President Trump that passed criminal justice reform and prison reform and police reform, not Barack and not Joe. And, today, you heard Obama say the filibuster was a relic of the Jim Crow era. The only relic we should be concerned about is Obama's former vice president, because while Barack is comparing his political adversaries to racists and bigots, well, it's Joe Biden, the leader, their presidential candidate this year, Joe Biden works hand-in-hand with segregationist to slow integration. Let's quote NBC News, shall we? He led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. 1977, Joe worried that his children would grow up in a, quote, \"racial jungle\", Biden's words. And let's not forget, for decades, Biden revered the former Klan leader, Robert KKK Byrd. Biden called Byrd the dean of the U.S. Senate, close friend, a mentor. By the way, Byrd was also praised by Pelosi and by Schumer and by Bill and Hillary Clinton. And Byrd, by the way, along with Al Gore Sr. and others, well, they filibuster the 1964 Civil Rights Act for people like John Lewis, they accomplished which by the way was historic in every way imaginable, praising the guy that filibustered all of that? Which was ultimately passed? Why? Because Lyndon Johnson got overwhelming support from Republican senators, 80 percent in the Senate and the House. By the way, why did Democrats constantly get a pass for their disgusting history of racism? Sadly, by the way, we talk about these Democrats and George Wallace and so many others, you're talking about Democrats. And many on the left, by the way, are still getting a free pass. African-American Trump supporters are constantly demeaned, they are minimized, they're called every name in the book simply because of their race and their political beliefs. We saw another example of this on MSDNC, all things propaganda state-run Democratic Party, radical socialist network. Take a look."

We'll have a special message and remembering Herman Cain and his groundbreaking life in a few moments. But first, let's address the shameful behavior from the mob and media surrounding his death. \"Reuters\" summing up his amazing life as a man who refused to wear a mask? Fake news CNN's Anna Navarro tweeting, quote, Herman Cain thought COVID was a hoax, scoffed at wearing a mask, died of COVID. Once sparsely watched MSDNC host blaming Trump for Cain's death? Now, what we see is beyond disrespectful, beyond tasteless and shameful. By the way, did they know anything about Herman Cain, his health condition, anything about it at all? Or are they just using it as a political weapon on the day he dies? By the way, it's psychosis, it's hatred, its madness. The mob hates Donald Trump so much, they literally are reveling and debt using it as a cheap political point. We'll have more of my monologue in just a moment. But joining us now with reaction, nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Larry Elder, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell. All right, Leo. You are the formal liberal. You have not voted Republican your entire life. You said on this program you're going to vote for Donald Trump this year. You saw Barack Obama today, and I can go on, and he said a lot of other things beyond that we just played, as he went on to then give talking about automatic registration, including inmates, et cetera, et cetera, getting rid of the filibuster, Jim Crow relic. And I'm looking at this and I'm listening to this and I'm saying -- and he talked about the expanding Civil Rights Act in honor of John Lewis.

Now, back to Obama, step aside Al Sharpton, because you've got a competitor and Barack Obama using a house of worship, using a funeral to raise a Democratic campaign speech. What amazes me is he basically lied on television when he said that federal truth were used for peaceful protesters. There's not a peaceful protester who is trying to demolish a federal building. He tried to make an analogy that Donald Trump is George Wallace. Mr. Obama, 1.2 million black people, including one more, Leo Terrell voted for Donald Trump in 2016. It is unbelievable that he would play the race card. But you're right. You got a great man in John Lewis who died, buried today, and Herman Cain is being vilified. I am sick and tired of black Republicans being vilified. We are smart enough to realize that we are off of the Democratic plantation, and we're going to vote what is in the country's best interest.

That the major problems facing the black community would still remain? Am I wrong that 70 percent of black kids are being raised without fathers? Am I wrong that there's a 50 percent urban high school dropout rate and a lot of the kids when they graduate cannot read, write and compete at grade level? Am I wrong that there's a 25 percent of young black men living in the inner-city who have criminal records? If getting rid of white racism mean those problems still remain, then white racism is not the problem and its eradication is not the solution. Obama is a race card player and Leo Terrell is absolutely right. He is a consummate race card player which makes him more dangerous than Al Sharpton because he and people like Eric Holder can do it with a straight face and nice suit and tie, a big vocabulary, nice, well-crafted sentences, but it's the same B.S. They are arguing that America is a systemically racist country. It is a lie but they have to push that lie every four years in order to get 95 percent of the black people to pull that lever for them.

We will have a rehearing by all judges on the cord. Remember just last month, a three judge panel ruled in favor of the DOJ which wants both sides to drop the prosecution. Now, the rehearing is scheduled for Tuesday, august 11th, and more injustice is for General Flynn. Here to explain is General Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell with an update.

Judge Sullivan's petition for rehearing should not have been considered by the court because he had no standing to file it. He's not a party in the case. He's supposed to be a neutral umpire. And yet, he has taken on the role of an advocate for some sort of hearing that he wants to conduct back in his court on an issue that the government has decided to dismiss, the case has decided to drop where there's no longer a case and controversy at all because both parties have agreed to dismiss it. And he cannot act as a prosecutor because only the Department of Justice can under Article 2 of the Constitution. So, there are two constitutional provisions that preclude him from doing what he's trying to do. And the court seems to be indicating that it's going to give him that opportunity, despite the fact he has no constitutional to proceed."

Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, guess what, they don't really care. They just once again resorting to petty politics, wanting to stop the package just like they did the last time with a blue state wish list.

Even today when you have unemployment insurance, the extra amount of money that the government puts in, to extend it, the Republicans said, let's extend it a week while we negotiate, you know who said no? Chuck Schumer. But watch what they'll say out on television. The president was willing to continue to go forward to protect those who are unemployed right now, so we can get people working again, and solve this problem. Every single time we work on COVID legislation, you know who's held it up? Nancy Pelosi. Remember at her refrigerator when small businesses need the money for employees? She said no. When the very first CARES Act went forward, she said no and held it for another week. How many more people were unemployed because of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer's actions?"

We now have a report in a paper today that the FBI says China is trying to influence our election and we know who they want to win, and also influence members of Congress. They denied that in Foreign Affairs vote just the other day. We even have the Armed Service chairman say it wasn't China's fault. It's not their responsibility to warn America about the virus, trying to blame the president.

But also, just breaking tonight, as we move forward, \"The Washington Post\" reporting the Postal Service backlogs sparking worries the ballot delivery could be delayed in November. President's right to call attention to it. He has no intention of delaying the election at all. Here with reaction, the author of the number one \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"Unfreedom of the Press\", the host of \"Life, Liberty and Levin\", number one show here, Sunday night, 8:00 a.m., Fox News Channel. I call him the great one. You know, Mark, we watch this -- Barack Obama gives the eulogy to the service to John Lewis today.

Now, you tell me and this happened every two or four years, Mark."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "You know, Sean, that speech by Obama reminded me of the good old days of Obama when he was a community activist hanging out with domestic terrorists. He was probably really getting into the, you know, Molotov cocktails, and all the rest, the good old days for Obama. You know, Obama has milked this country for everything it's worth. He's milked it for maximum power, he and his wife are now worth tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars having sold their presidency after they left office. He gives the speeches now and he's abused the black community more than any modern president that I'm aware of or any modern politician for that matter. What exactly has this man done for the black community since he's been in the private sector? What did he do for the black community when he was president other than kill school choice in Washington, D.C.? I can tell you what Lincoln did for African-Americans. I can tell you what Grant did. I can tell you what Eisenhower did. I can tell you what LBJ did. I can tell you what Donald J. Trump did, but I can't tell you what Obama did. Now, I want to educate Obama, the former law school professor and all the leftist kooks out there, this country systemically racist? Let me tell you something, no country puts hundreds of thousands of men on the battlefield and lose them in a civil war to keep a union and end slavery. The equivalent of 4 million men lost their lives to end slavery. That's a little bit more than Barack Obama has done or LeBron James. Let's go over it quickly. Civil Rights Act of 1866, does that sound like a country systemically racist? I don't have time to get into what everyone of these acts did, but people can look them up. Civil Rights Act of 1871, Civil Rights Act of 1875, Civil Rights Act of 1957, Civil Rights Act of 1960, liberals, follow along. Civil Rights Act of 1964, Civil Rights Act of 1965, Civil Rights Act of 1968, Civil Rights Act of 1990, Civil Rights Act of 1991. We have Supreme Court decisions, 1948, Shelley versus Kraemer. 1954, Brown versus Board of Education. 1962, Bailey versus Peterson. This is what I would have said at John Lewis' funeral, 1967, Loving versus Virginia. 1968, Jones versus Mayer. 1971, Griggs versus Duke Power. 1986, Paxton versus Kentucky. Now, here is what I didn't hear at the funeral when Obama was giving a Democrat left-wing kook speech, not a word about America's greatness. Not a word about how men in our military, black, white, brown, red, yellow, went off to beat Hitler, and Tojo, and Italy, fascist Italy, put their lives on the line, 400,000 of them died. Not a word about the men in Korea and Vietnam and Afghanistan and Iraq in our diverse, integrated military, not a damn word. Not a word about the thousands murdered and our city every year -- 7,500 black people, mostly 90 percent by other black people, including in his city of Chicago. Didn't bring it up once. Not a word about the nuclear family and personal responsibility and opportunity. Not a single uplifting word for the country that made him rich and made him president and made him powerful. Rather than saying, look at what I've done with my life, look at what I've become, look at all the people trying to pour over our border legally and illegally, of all races from the third world, south of the border, from the continent of Africa, from the Far East, from the Middle East, from all over the world, why are they trying to come here? Because of George Wallace and Bull Connor? This guy -- they want to run against George Wallace and Bull Connor. Well, I would say this to President Trump, you've got a quasi Bull Connor and a quasi George Wallace, his name is Joe Biden. And Joe Biden bragged about working with James Eastland and Stennis, two white segregationists and racists from Mississippi. He bragged about working with other segregationist. Joe Biden has said nasty bigoted things throughout his life despite the Praetorian guard left-wing media that protects him and his bubble in his basement, and all the rest of it."

      "speaker": "The fact of the matter is, I know this",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump at the private sector hired thousands of black Americans. Tell me, today, the very wealthy Obama's, how many black Americans have they hired? How many black Americans have a help? How many black Americans did Biden hire? None, few. This president hired thousands during the past century career in the private sector and as president of the United States, what did he get, 7, 8 percent of the black community and yet what has he done in the black community? A thousand times more than Obama ever dreamed of doing. So Obama gives a good pastor-like speech, but when the rubber hits the road, he's nowhere to be found. That's it."

It's now reported that apparently Gardner used the case to fund-raise for her reelection campaign, campaign emails sent out on July 17th includes request for donation and reads, quote: President Trump and the governor are fighting for the two pointed the guns at peaceful citizens during the Black Lives Matter protest. Here with reaction Mark McCloskey. Mark, when I interviewed you the last time, it didn't sound peaceful, I guess, if you break down a gate to a community.

Yes, it was peaceful all right. Later that same night, that same crowd out in front of Mayor Krewson's house, one produced an AK-47 and actually challenge the Channel 5 reporter.
