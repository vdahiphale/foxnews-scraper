And, by the way, of the $500 billion trade deficit we have got, roughly $370 billion of it is with China. So, no question about that.   And one of the issues that he's focused with China, as you know, is intellectual property, the fact that they take our secrets and use them. And so it's real. And it's good that he is finally sort of standing up to it, not finally him, but finally an American administration is doing that. But, Neil, you have to be careful how you do it.",

So -- but, look, I think that's appropriate. If you go too far, I think what some people in the White House were saying -- you mentioned Steve Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury -- is you will actually end up shooting yourself in the foot, if you really do in fact have the Chinese retaliating against our products, and yet we aren't getting satisfaction on more entry into their markets.  So, there's a way to do this. We have the bigger market. We have the trade deficit.

But with regard to China, I do think there is a big middle ground here, which is to say to China, look, we're looking for reciprocity. We're looking for a level playing field. We're not trying to punish you.  We're just saying, you're a big, mature trading partner now. You're part of the WTO, World Trade Organization. You have to live by their rules. And one of the issues on U.S. investment over there has always been that, in many industries, the Chinese require that there be Chinese ownership. And that's one thing the president has focused on appropriately.  One of the issues there is those Chinese owners, 51 percent owners, take the intellectual property and sometimes use it for another Chinese company or otherwise have it be used on the Chinese side.",
