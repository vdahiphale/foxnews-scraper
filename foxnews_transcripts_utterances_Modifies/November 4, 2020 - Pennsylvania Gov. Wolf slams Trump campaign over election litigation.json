Even though we've already called this state for the former vice president and I'm going to step out of the camera for just a moment so you can see what's happening here and the real question is, is the GOP at equal footing with the Democrats as you see more than 130 tables here in this room. They continue to go over the absentee ballots, but the argument being made by backers of the president is it's simply not a fair process.  There's a 3 to 1 advantage for Democrats versus Republicans if not more so at tables here inside the building, in fact outside, we saw protesters going back and forth, protesters and counter protesters the argument being they should stop this count until there is equality inside the building. But because they have not been able to allow as many GOP observers inside the building, they are making the argument that this entire process is flawed and it is subject to the lawsuit that you pointed it out.  Now there's something else that we're going to keep an eye on as the count does continue here inside the building. The secretary of state tells us that this was an historic turnout by Michigan voters, the most ever in a presidential election. Usually, you're looking at between 63 and 66 percent participation among registered voters. Will that number be top say 70, 72 or will it be close to 90 percent as some reporting happened over in Wisconsin? That's the kind of irregularity that is really concerning backers of the president. So, the count continues. We'll keep an eye on it.  But for now, back to you.",

Nevertheless, we want to ensure that there is fair counting. When you look at a state like Michigan, whether this is your reporting, Matt Finn from Fox News' reporting putting out papers, so we're not allowed to observe spoiled ballots and whether they are rejected or counted, that is a problem.

That's what happened in 2000. They also reached a point where after the Supreme Court of the United States went with the Republicans with the Bush ticket, some of the lawyers for our ticket argued to Al Gore that he could go back to the Florida Supreme Court and ask for a statewide recount. And Al decided, much to his credit, that it was time to end it, that the Electoral College was going to meet the following week and that the inauguration was a month away and we had to move on to an orderly transfer of power.

Even though we've already called this state for the former vice president and I'm going to step out of the camera for just a moment so you can see what's happening here and the real question is, is the GOP at equal footing with the Democrats as you see more than 130 tables here in this room. They continue to go over the absentee ballots, but the argument being made by backers of the president is it's simply not a fair process. There's a 3 to 1 advantage for Democrats versus Republicans if not more so at tables here inside the building, in fact outside, we saw protesters going back and forth, protesters and counter protesters the argument being they should stop this count until there is equality inside the building. But because they have not been able to allow as many GOP observers inside the building, they are making the argument that this entire process is flawed and it is subject to the lawsuit that you pointed it out. Now there's something else that we're going to keep an eye on as the count does continue here inside the building. The secretary of state tells us that this was an historic turnout by Michigan voters, the most ever in a presidential election. Usually, you're looking at between 63 and 66 percent participation among registered voters. Will that number be top say 70, 72 or will it be close to 90 percent as some reporting happened over in Wisconsin? That's the kind of irregularity that is really concerning backers of the president.

You might remember, Bret and Martha, there was a recount in 2016. Jill Stein asked for it that netted President Trump an extra 131 votes, which would in 2020 leave him 20,379 votes shy of a win, though, again, there's all this mail-in-voting.

Just six months ago, you had a Philadelphia judge who was convicted in a scheme to accept bribes as he cast fraudulent ballots four months ago. You had a Democrat individual who was charged for in 2014, 2015 and in 2016 stuffing the ballot box with fraudulent ballots. So, we want to be on alert. And what that means is having people at the polls, volunteers who can observe how the ballots are counted and ensure that it is counted accurately. Right now, we're not being given that.

We just want to ensure everything is fair because we do believe we're going to prevail. Bret, by the most conservative estimates that we have come up with, very conservative saying we get, let's say, 5 percent of the vote in Philadelphia, 30 percent of the vote in remaining counties. And that is indeed conservative, because when you look at Westmoreland County, when you look at Franklin County, these are counties we carry by 69 to 80 percent. I am saying if we only count 30 percent of that for Trump, which we believe it will be far more, we anticipate winning Pennsylvania by 40,000 votes, which is why we have declared victory. Nevertheless, we want to ensure that there is fair counting. When you look at a state like Michigan, whether this is your reporting, Matt Finn from Fox News' reporting putting out papers, so we're not allowed to observe spoiled ballots and whether they are rejected or counted, that is a problem. So, we want fairness because we're going to win in a free election where the votes are counted fairly."

And this is a lot of votes here. All right. This is Pima County. So, this is Tucson, Arizona. Not as many votes, but still pretty populated area here. It's our understanding at the moment that Donald Trump needs to perform two points better than he is at the moment. If he does that, then Kayleigh has got an argument there. But at the moment, it doesn't appear that he's hitting that number. Now, with the Trump campaign would argue that a lot of these rural counties outside of Phoenix and outside of Tucson still have to check in and they believe they will be votes for the red team.

About 400,000 of those are right there in Maricopa County, which is crucial. They've released party ID of these ballots. There are more Republican ballots than Democrats, and we believe the unaffiliated ballots will break our way at the end of the night. Last night, we were pulling in about 62 percent of the ballots in Maricopa County of the Election Day voting, and we only need about 57.7 percent to prevail in Arizona. So, we believe we win. In fact, we're predicting by about 30,000 votes we win and there will be a very good drop, it looks like tomorrow morning in Maricopa County, which we think will change the analysis."

Using a PowerPoint presentation, former Obama White House counsel Bob Bauer displayed recent lawsuits from the Trump campaign and Republicans in Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania and explained why they were struck down. The cases ranged from efforts to stop ballot counting, to efforts to disqualify ballots from drop boxes, in-person absentee voting, and early in-person voting. And they feel confident the high court will not side with Trump. BOB BAUER, BIDEN CAMPAIGN ADVISER & LAWYER:  If at some point he arrives before the Supreme Court with a novel proposition that ballots that were lawfully cast by eligible voters, but not yet counted by the time Donald Trump wanted them counted, that somehow they don't count anymore?

And I want to say there's a good side to it, which is in America, we're a rule of law country. We settle our conflict in court. We don't try them out in the streets. And I think it's very important that both parties, both presidential candidates make very clear to their supporters that it's in the courts that this will be decided and they've got an opportunity to make the case that they want to make. That's what happened in 2000. They also reached a point where after the Supreme Court of the United States went with the Republicans with the Bush ticket, some of the lawyers for our ticket argued to Al Gore that he could go back to the Florida Supreme Court and ask for a statewide recount. And Al decided, much to his credit, that it was time to end it, that the Electoral College was going to meet the following week and that the inauguration was a month away and we had to move on to an orderly transfer of power. As my appeal to both parties, both candidates in this year's election, it has to -- it ought to be fought out in court, but it has to end at some point for the good of the country."

Now, this is a live look at the ballot count happening right now at the Philadelphia convention center. The Trump claims that they have video, apparently, from Pennsylvania that shows Republican ballot observers being kept some 30 feet away. They say that their observers can't really see anything. They are having to use binoculars. They have no way of seeing if the ballots have proper signatures or if they are postmarked correctly.

They say, look, we think that everything has been above board. We have been telling you to watch that live feed of the ballot counting. You could watch it for yourself and see for yourself what's going on. \\ I was taken back there yesterday. I was in that room to watch the ballot counting happening live in person. Now, I couldn't see what was written on those ballots. I was further way than where the observers were standing. But I could tell you that they could definitely see if there was, you know, some activity like tossing a ballot away or perhaps tearing it up. They could see that. I can't tell you though if they could actually see the words written on those ballots and that is what's being disputed right now. Back to you."

They filed lawsuits six months ago and were successful in Democratic run states to loosen up the security apparatus for mail-in ballots. They used COVID as the reason, and many courts and public officials granted their request to loosen up signature matches to get ballot boxes, which were unsupervised and insecure and get ballot harvesting in some states, which they never had before. And so, I understand the angst of the president and I think that the Democrats need to just calm down and remember that they've had their day in court, and now the Republicans are going to have -- and the president is going to have his day in court. And that's the way our system runs. And in the final analysis, this is about math, it's about perception, it's about faith in the integrity of the vote, and we're going to have a solution and somebody is going to win, and somebody is going to lose."

      "utterance": "There are significant, I think, systemic problems in American political polling. And I think people who deny that are missing something. And I don't know how you could miss it, frankly, because if you go back, I went back just for fun today because this is how I have fun. I went back to 2014, 2016, 2018, big races to see what the polling differential was, and in almost every case that I could find where there was a big surprise and the outcome turned out to be, whoa, it wasn't going to be like that based on the polling and the other side actually won. In almost every case, the polling had underestimated what the Republican ultimate win margin was or their vote total was or rather, their vote share. So I think we have seen this now in four consecutive cycles and you'd think there'd be enough people in the polling industry, aside from some outliers who they all make fun of like Trafalgar, those are weirdos, those yahoos, ignore that, don't put them in your averages. And then the yahoos are looking a lot closer to reality than the A plus pollsters. That's a problem and the one example I'll give because there are many from this cycle, Susan Collins and her dominant win. She won by nine points."

In Wisconsin, \"The Washington Post,\" my newspaper, \"The Washington Post\" poll had Donald Trump losing by 17 points, you know. That's about -- that gets the award for the most off of the entire election. But here's the question, I mean, as you said the other night, this is even worse than 2016. And it's really a catastrophic failure of polling. And so the question is, and this is why we're having so much trouble now in the aftermath of the election, because if those voters look at this and they say, if the media and the pollsters did such a bad job predicting the election, how can we trust them to call it? You know, we're hearing all these people questioning the Fox decision desk --"

Going out into community and having conversation with your neighbors and telling them about your issues and ask them to go vote for you, right. So, if you say, oh, well the polling is good here so we don't have to go here. We don't have to have a conversation with these people about their issues. And we saw that happen all across the country, both Democrats and Republicans. And I think Bret is right when you talk about how it's doing down ballot.
