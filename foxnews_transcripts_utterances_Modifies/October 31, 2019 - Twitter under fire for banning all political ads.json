Yesterday the president tweeted an obviously photoshopped image of himself pinning the Medal of Honor on the hero dog. The brainless media sprang into action to prove that yes, this was fake. Reporter Steve Herman breathlessly tweeted, \"I've requested details on this photo come up, there was no such K-9 event on today's schedule.\" Excellent scoop, Steve, I can't wait to see who plays you in the movie.  The New York Times solemnly added yes, this photo was indeed altered. And then there's Jim Acosta who said a White House official says the dog is not at the White House. Good catch, Jim. Be sure in fact check this photo, too, right there. Yes, it was a great moment for me, I don't like to brag.   Now sensing they were ripe for ridicule the media switched gears saying the image was disrespectful to the man whose image was photoshopped. But that guy, James McCloughan got a kick out of it, he loved it. Of course, he never would have known about it if the reporters hadn't run to him with their tattle tails between their legs. Mind you, this is the same media who can't be bothered with actual stories whether it's the origins of the Steele dossier or the political bias of the whistleblower, but the media is in a pickle. Because good news about America means good news for Trump. And so, they act smaller with each passing achievement. Maybe Trump shouldn't be so effective, just to give the media a break. It will be like the good old days under Obama.  OK, we have a lot of dog experts here. Dana, we learned the dog -- it's a she. The name is Conan, a little confused by that.",

And one of the states, I think, it was California. You can't even graduate 50 percent of your students. I mean, that's an outrage. I might have this wrong; I think it was reading proficiency at 57 percent out there. Betsy DeVos calls this a crisis of student achievement. Now, if you look at since 1992, it's not like money hasn't been poured into schools. That is happening. Maybe more money needs to be poured in. OK, but you have to be able to show that it would actually make a difference. The other thing that people should be really concerned about is that the people, two years ago, you do this test every two years. Two years ago, let's say that you were in the higher rankings. They continued to do better. People that were in the lower rankings continued to do worse. And so, if you're worried about inequality, you should just not think about just throwing money at this problem, but trying to figure out how are you going to deal with that? The last thing I would say is, it's a real outrage to American taxpayers. State and local taxes, federal government taxes. And then you have people who are not proficient in reading and math going to colleges that they cannot afford that are breaking their parents bank accounts or putting them into debt because of student loans. And they have to take remedial classes in English and math so that they can get through. So, now the colleges are doing the job of what K through 12 should have been doing.",

We are in the top five in the world of countries in terms of our expenditure per student. And it's how we spend the money. We're too busy blowing it on the teachers pensions because it's not like any of them are getting really well. They're not well salaried. They're not being invested into ensure that the students are getting what they need so that kids who are behavioral problems or different paces that are taking up space are taking up the time. They don't - that they are encroaching on the other students that are just trying to be educated. We reward the wrong things. We incentivize social media and entertainment and that kind of immediate gratification culture without investing in actual education. We also reward test results rather than that kind of work ethic and investment that builds it along the way.

Also, for the first time in any sports league championship series, both teams lost every home game. What an amazing story. So, as a Nationals fan, someone sent me today a pair of lucky rose-colored sunglasses. They're coming from Bubbly Springs Water outfielder Gerardo Parra has been wearing them for good luck since he started wearing them. The team went from 12 games under 500 to the World Championship.

The New York Times solemnly added yes, this photo was indeed altered. And then there's Jim Acosta who said a White House official says the dog is not at the White House. Good catch, Jim. Be sure in fact check this photo, too, right there. Yes, it was a great moment for me, I don't like to brag. Now sensing they were ripe for ridicule the media switched gears saying the image was disrespectful to the man whose image was photoshopped. But that guy, James McCloughan got a kick out of it, he loved it. Of course, he never would have known about it if the reporters hadn't run to him with their tattle tails between their legs. Mind you, this is the same media who can't be bothered with actual stories whether it's the origins of the Steele dossier or the political bias of the whistleblower, but the media is in a pickle. Because good news about America means good news for Trump. And so, they act smaller with each passing achievement. Maybe Trump shouldn't be so effective, just to give the media a break. It will be like the good old days under Obama. OK, we have a lot of dog experts here. Dana, we learned the dog -- it's a she. The name is Conan, a little confused by that."

This comes as a new study finds teenagers spend more than seven hours a day on their phones. Could it be that that's to blame? So, Dana, let me just start by saying the student achievement numbers are basically flat since 1992. So, you know, that's a long time. And Betsy DeVos says, hey, the schools aren't delivering for these kids. Now, the contrary argument comes from people like Rosa DeLauro, who's a Democrat, Chair of the House Subcommittee on Education. And she says we need to spend more money."

And one of the states, I think, it was California. You can't even graduate 50 percent of your students. I mean, that's an outrage. I might have this wrong; I think it was reading proficiency at 57 percent out there. Betsy DeVos calls this a crisis of student achievement. Now, if you look at since 1992, it's not like money hasn't been poured into schools. That is happening. Maybe more money needs to be poured in. OK, but you have to be able to show that it would actually make a difference. The other thing that people should be really concerned about is that the people, two years ago, you do this test every two years. Two years ago, let's say that you were in the higher rankings. They continued to do better. People that were in the lower rankings continued to do worse. And so, if you're worried about inequality, you should just not think about just throwing money at this problem, but trying to figure out how are you going to deal with that? The last thing I would say is, it's a real outrage to American taxpayers. State and local taxes, federal government taxes. And then you have people who are not proficient in reading and math going to colleges that they cannot afford that are breaking their parents bank accounts or putting them into debt because of student loans. And they have to take remedial classes in English and math so that they can get through. So, now the colleges are doing the job of what K through 12 should have been doing."

We are in the top five in the world of countries in terms of our expenditure per student. And it's how we spend the money. We're too busy blowing it on the teachers pensions because it's not like any of them are getting really well. They're not well salaried. They're not being invested into ensure that the students are getting what they need so that kids who are behavioral problems or different paces that are taking up space are taking up the time. They don't - that they are encroaching on the other students that are just trying to be educated. We reward the wrong things. We incentivize social media and entertainment and that kind of immediate gratification culture without investing in actual education. We also reward test results rather than that kind of work ethic and investment that builds it along the way. This was totally predictable just like homelessness and opioids and all the other stuff I always talk about, because this has been a long time coming.

I think the bureaucrats hate school choice because the competition bares their incompetence. Right. What they got - then you find out that the money that we've been shoveling them for so long has been going nowhere, because the money goes up and the scores get worse. So, it's not a money thing. You know, I think that they group students incorrectly. I think that they used to be that if you were at a certain rate or speed, you could go into one class and other kids that. I don't think they do that anymore, do they? They put everybody together. I don't know. You have them like you say, it's more important to be woke than well read.

Watch this. That's Howie Kendrick lining up pitch down the line and off the foul pole in Houston for a two run homers for the first time since 1924, the Washington baseball team won the World Series. Also, for the first time in any sports league championship series, both teams lost every home game. What an amazing story. So, as a Nationals fan, someone sent me today a pair of lucky rose-colored sunglasses. They're coming from Bubbly Springs Water outfielder Gerardo Parra has been wearing them for good luck since he started wearing them. The team went from 12 games under 500 to the World Championship. Can you believe this? Parra picked him up as a promotional event a few years ago. Of course, he's also famous for doing the baby shark."
