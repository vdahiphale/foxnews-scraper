As it relates to the Mueller hearings up on Capitol Hill today, the Trump campaign, the RNC have called it a -- quote, unquote -- \"disaster\" for Democrats. The press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said it was a -- quote -- \"embarrassment.\" And then just a little while ago, since both hearings have wrapped up, we got the first take from the president, in which he just took to Twitter and wrote the following, saying -- quote -- \"Truth is a force of nature.\" After the first hearing earlier today, the president seemed almost gleeful at what he had heard or seen, writing at that point -- quote -- \"I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning's hearing.\"  That was a bit of a 180 from earlier in the day, when the president started off this morning by taking to Twitter being once again extremely critical of Robert Mueller, saying that he is highly conflicted and saying of the investigation that it was the biggest witch-hunt in U.S. history.  After that first hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, the president's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, put forth a statement in which he said, \"The case is closed,\" essentially saying it is time to move on. Sekulow writing at one point -- quote -- \"It is also clear that the special counsel conducted his two-year investigation unimpeded. The American people understand that the issue is over. They also understand that the case is closed.\" So, as we stand here, Neil, at 4:05 on the North Lawn, we anticipate President Trump on the South Lawn here any moment. He is heading for -- to West Virginia, rather, for a campaign event later this evening. We will see what the president has to say most likely momentarily -- Neil.",

Even when they tried to get him to confirm things that were in the report, which you would think would be low-hanging fruit for the Democrats, he stumbled and asked for page number references.

He said things like he sat in on very few interviews. I mean, for Bob Mueller, it wouldn't be a problem for him just to sit in the back of the room, even if he wasn't the one conducting the interview, but just to show his active participation and involvement.

They're going to haul this thing around like the corpse and \"Weekend at Bernie's\" and try to see if they can jazz up some interest in their -- in their base. I don't think it's going to go anywhere. The problem with this is everything that is in the report that is most damning, the best thing that Republicans can say about it is that not criminal, but it's not great. It's nothing that we don't already know about Trump. It's stuff that's baked into the cake. As long as the economy continues to zip along, I don't think any of this is going to actually stick.

There's nothing there. And today was even more proof of that. Mueller didn't show up. He wasn't in the house. He appeared weak. He could not recall or answer basic questions.

But there were certainly something for the president supporters and for his critics. One of the key pieces of testimony came in an exchange with the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler. He asked the former special counsel about a legal memo from the Justice Department and whether it made him feel handcuffed because it states that you cannot indict a sitting president. Here's that exchange."

Robert Mueller also testified that he decided against issuing a subpoena for the president to do an in-person interview because he felt it would be too time-consuming, and he felt it was important to expeditious -- expeditiously, rather, deal with the allegations.

As it relates to the Mueller hearings up on Capitol Hill today, the Trump campaign, the RNC have called it a -- quote, unquote -- \"disaster\" for Democrats. The press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said it was a -- quote -- \"embarrassment.\" And then just a little while ago, since both hearings have wrapped up, we got the first take from the president, in which he just took to Twitter and wrote the following, saying -- quote -- \"Truth is a force of nature.\" After the first hearing earlier today, the president seemed almost gleeful at what he had heard or seen, writing at that point -- quote -- \"I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning's hearing.\" That was a bit of a 180 from earlier in the day, when the president started off this morning by taking to Twitter being once again extremely critical of Robert Mueller, saying that he is highly conflicted and saying of the investigation that it was the biggest witch-hunt in U.S. history. After that first hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, the president's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, put forth a statement in which he said, \"The case is closed,\" essentially saying it is time to move on. Sekulow writing at one point -- quote -- \"It is also clear that the special counsel conducted his two-year investigation unimpeded. The American people understand that the issue is over. They also understand that the case is closed.\" So, as we stand here, Neil, at 4:05 on the North Lawn, we anticipate President Trump on the South Lawn here any moment. He is heading for -- to West Virginia, rather, for a campaign event later this evening. We will see what the president has to say most likely momentarily -- Neil."

It depends on who you are, of course. Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree. Tom, good to chat with you again. What do you make of just how this all went down?"

      "speaker": "TOM DUPREE, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL",

They pinned their impeachment hopes on a rock-solid performance by Bob Mueller today, one that would stir the passions of undecided Americans and people who hadn't yet focused on the report. That's, of course, not what they got. Bob Mueller himself wasn't what I anticipated. He was halting, he was hesitant. He seemed strangely disconnected from key aspects of his own report. Even when they tried to get him to confirm things that were in the report, which you would think would be low-hanging fruit for the Democrats, he stumbled and asked for page number references. And, of course, he wouldn't give the Democrats the one thing they desperately wanted, which was a statement that, in his mind, the president obstructed justice. Bob Mueller was very clear,he wasn't prepared to go there."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

But what surprised me -- and you know this process better. You know Bob Mueller better. He didn't have his fastball today. And I'm not meaning to disparage him. But he didn't seem to know a lot, or maybe that was his way of not answering a lot, or leaving it at the report. But certain details that came to light made me wonder, did he delegate a lot of this? Did his staff really write this up more than he did?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPREE",
      "utterance": "It doesn't surprise me that he would have delegated a lot. Obviously, the investigation was a big project. We all know the raw numbers about number of witnesses and that sort of thing. But at the same time, I would think he would have been more attuned to the need to show that he was master of the report, that he was in command of the material. He said things like he sat in on very few interviews. I mean, for Bob Mueller, it wouldn't be a problem for him just to sit in the back of the room, even if he wasn't the one conducting the interview, but just to show his active participation and involvement. And I think this performance today is going to fuel a lot of speculation about just how involved was Bob Mueller in the report that now will bear his name and history."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I suspect that there will be a constituency within the Democratic Party that will still be pounding the table on impeachment, the presidential candidates, among others. But I think, for most people, you're going to see a shift reflected in what actually Congressman Schiff said at the end, where the focus now is on the overall morality or ethics."

      "utterance": "See, if I was listening to see if Schiff was going to phrase his closing statement in the context of high crimes and misdemeanors, which, of course, is the constitutional standard for impeachment, that's not what he did. He took a different route. He focused on ethics, calling to our higher nature, which is all fine.

Would we have had the gains and the record gains we did in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 today, not so much the Dow, if this had gone differently, or adversely, much more adversely, for the president? We won't know. We do know that we have records on the Nasdaq and S&P 500. And we have the Dow down about 79 points. But I got to tell you, Boeing was the lion's share of that. It is indicating a lot of problems with that 737 MAX, just completed its worst quarter in its history, and now indicating that that thing might not be flying anytime soon, maybe ever. We're on that, also back at the White House, where we could -- I stress could -- be hearing for the president of the United States, who thinks this all went well for him today. A lot of people on both sides of the aisle, at least on this matter, agree."

They seemed to be going his way, and he liked the way ultimately it presented him, not as any sort of a criminal, and where this sort of thing wouldn't really develop into much more than what it has. So, it won't really move the needle, which, again, is just to the president's liking.

They're going to haul this thing around like the corpse and \"Weekend at Bernie's\" and try to see if they can jazz up some interest in their -- in their base. I don't think it's going to go anywhere. The problem with this is everything that is in the report that is most damning, the best thing that Republicans can say about it is that not criminal, but it's not great. It's nothing that we don't already know about Trump. It's stuff that's baked into the cake. As long as the economy continues to zip along, I don't think any of this is going to actually stick.

We know there are members of Congress who said they didn't read the report. But a lot of people probably did tune into these hearings. So it's very interesting. It will be interesting to see just what people think about some of the things Mueller said. I mean, he did sort of confirm that, in his mind, the president did commit obstruction. I mean, he was asked if the only reason he was indicted -- wasn't indicted is because of the OLC opinion. And he said yes. So it wasn't great for the president."

This was a huge loss for the Democrats and the anti-Trump media. They hung their hats on the Russia -- Russia collusion, and that there's a there there, and that Adam Smith said that there was more evidence out there that he knew about -- Schiff -- excuse me. There's nothing there. And today was even more proof of that. Mueller didn't show up. He wasn't in the house. He appeared weak. He could not recall or answer basic questions. And that's because I don't think Mueller wrote this report. Mueller is a figurehead with all of this. And the anti-Trump lawyers are the ones who really did all of this work, which is why Mueller has no idea what's going on. I was waiting for him to say, what report are we talking about?"

Now, to be fair to Mr. Mueller, he didn't want to be put in this position, didn't want to testify, found it certainly to be weird, at a minimum, for a prosecutor to be speaking before a congressional body, let alone two of them, and didn't want to add fuel to that fire. But I was surprised that he seemed to have the hands-off relationship because there was so much with which he at least appeared to be unfamiliar, unless it was -- he was being very cunning about it.

So we have these two hearings with panels of men berating a septuagenarian about a publicly available document. And he's there, to the best of his memory, 400-plus pages, trying to recall everything that's in it, while they're basically reciting back to him stuff that we all have access to in the first place. And so, look, I don't fault him for anything. He's a career lawman. He did a job he was asked to do. I respect him for that. I respect him for his service to his country. I don't think there's anything wrong that you can say about Robert Mueller. I don't think there's any reason to criticize him. I think this entire spectacle, especially with other things in the news, the United Kingdom has a new prime minister, the governor of Puerto Rico is holed up on his island amid a major scandal, and here we are doing dramatic readings of a publicly available document and watching this image of congressmen berating a 74- year-old man as he tries to remember to the best of his abilities.

What do you think of that?"

We didn't get anything new. And polls have consistently shown that election interference is well, well beneath other issues in terms of importance in the minds of voters. That's Democrats and Republicans. What people want to hear about is health care, immigration is rising, climate change, of course, especially among younger people. So I don't want Democrats -- Democrats to take the bait here. We need to focus on those issues if we're going to beat Trump in 2020, not on the Mueller report, collusion issue.

I have known Bob Mueller, served directly under him for, oh, two-and-a-half years, probably sat in 500 meetings with him. I can just say that he wasn't hitting on all six cylinders today. That was -- that wasn't a stellar performance on his part. Maybe he was tired. Maybe he's just -- his age is catching up to him. But he wasn't sharp today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of Democrats had expected him to deliver the goods and to raise some of the concerns and remind Congress, it's up to you now to follow up on some of the clear crumbs that I dropped for you to pick up and pursue. Did that work? Did that happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWECKER",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm convinced now -- I was very confused when this report first came out regarding volume two and the obstruction non-call. I'm pretty convinced at this point after his testimony that he did mean to put this matter in the hands of Congress. Whether he -- I don't think he's putting his finger on the scale one way or the other. I just believe that he punted to Congress, or he punted it to the American people in terms of the next election. But one thing is certain. This matter is out of the hands of the judicial system. It's now in the hands of either Congress or the American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, you know him very, very well, and you referred to that and all that. Now, I'm just beginning to wonder about his management style. I got the impression he had delegated a lot of this. That's a big job, I understand, a big legal team. But there was a lot with which he seemed totally unfamiliar, or at least maybe he was doing that by design, so they would just drop the line of questioning. But he had his moments where he wasn't only detached, but seemed out of touch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWECKER",

    {
      "speaker": "SWECKER",

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Chris, thank you very much for taking the time. It's good getting a friend's insight, someone who worked with the guy for so many years, Chris Swecker, former FBI. We told you that we were following very closely what the president had to think about this. He's already tweeted about it, that he thinks this was pretty good day. He is still talking to reporters as we speak. The tape comes in from that, you know the drill. You will see it back and hear what the president had to say about all of this. Also keeping you on top of developments in Puerto Rico and San Juan, more to the point, where Ricardo Rossello apparently is still meeting with his Cabinet there. A lot of protesters there over the course of the past week have been demanding that he go. Earlier this week, he spoke with our own Shepard Smith to say he would wait until the end of 2020, not run for reelection. But that's a lot of time. These protesters, and as Shepard reminded him, they want you to go now. So we don't know whether that is what's going to happen today, but everyone is on tenterhooks in Puerto Rico just wondering."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the president is still talking to reporters at the White House and saying this whole testimony today with Bob Mueller was bad for our country, and we have done a lot for our country, also saying right now that he didn't have the right to exonerate me. Didn't happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, to hear some of the president's remarks, they didn't lay a glove on him here, referring to the Bob Mueller testimony today on Capitol Hill before two House committees, the president obviously feeling confident that Mueller failed to do what he said a lot of Democrats wanted to do, to sort of nail him to the wall and maybe pave the way to impeachment hearings. He might be right about that. And given the fact that the markets absorbed all these body blows just fine, thank you, the S&P, the Nasdaq into record territory, the Dow, which has been down a lot today, still finished down. A lot of that was just Boeing and this idea that its 737 MAX could be delayed, if not put off indefinitely, and that it had its worst quarter in history. So that was the story there. So this is not the story for them now. To the host of \"Making Money,\" bestselling author Charles Payne. What do you make of that market reaction? CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": It was -- the overall market today, it was absolutely phenomenal, Neil. It really, really was."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. If you think about it, if it were going just the opposite, I always think the markets aren't red or blue through these kind of things. If they know a crisis is coming, constitutional or otherwise, they're going to sell off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right. Absolutely. And there was no sign of a constitutional crisis. In fact, here was the irony. As the herring went on, and as Boeing layered it on thicker and thicker, hey, not only did we have a terrible quarter, we may not -- we may have to put prediction on hold, that stock started to really crater. And yet the broader market moved higher and higher. The S&P, the Nasdaq closed at all-time highs. You had about 2-1 stocks up vs. down. It was really a remarkable session."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The Nasdaq thing was kind of weird too, Charles, if you think about it. Not to get too in the weeds here, but that it hits a high, but without the help of Apple or Amazon or some of these big names or Google that are going to be the target apparently, the administration going after them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "You're right. And it's -- at one point last year, back in October of last year, when we were at all-time highs, six stocks, those stocks and a couple others you just named, were responsible for almost the entire move. Now we have got a market where about 470 stocks are up for the year out of the S&P 500, most of them up double digits, 10 to 20 percent. And today it was about the chip companies. Texas Instruments had one of its best sessions in years."

You want to see these kind of names where people don't have to -- who are risk-averse, who don't want to be in a stock, because any stock that can be up 20 points a day can be down 20 points in a day."

It's going to be really hard to rev up the ante for more impeachment hearings."

The New Yorker put out a headline that this -- he all but said that -- The Washington Post -- the headlines were going out fast and furiously. Bob Mueller has kind of walked that back. Honestly, I think, if you're going to be honest about this, I -- the most vulgar tweet out there by a Democrat, but perhaps the one that hits home most, is from Michael Moore."

It's all digital, right? So someone has it on a chip or run -- I have no idea. But when he's done, they're going to get that back. We will run it in the newsroom. We are also watching very closely what's going on in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the governor, Ricardo Rossello, is still holding, as we speak, a meeting with his Cabinet. You might recall protesters there have been gathering with just the worsening financial crisis there on the fact that they're missing billions of dollars, and the fact that big cruise lines, everyone from Celebrity to Royal Caribbean, have taken them off their tour lists for their ships. That's a big, big financial hit. He has already said he is not inclined to run for election next year. But those protesters were saying that they want him out now. And in an interview with our Shepard Smith earlier in the week, that was the point that Shep kept pounding. They want you out now. The indications are, in meeting with his Cabinet, he's trying to either explain otherwise or cave into the reality he is not a very popular guy -- after this."

You were trying to illustrate the point that the president wasn't trying to interfere with him, in that he hadn't tried to fire him, remove them, or any of that. Might have been a lot of rumors out there, but, in the end, he got to finish the project, got to leave as prosecutor himself, but on his terms, not on any presidential demands. Was that what you were kind of saying?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESKO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, you're exactly right. So, several Democrats that spoke before me kept on bringing up on how the president wanted to fire Mueller and that he told McGahn, and then he was trying to do things. But the bottom line is, he didn't fire Mueller, and Mueller was able to do his entire investigation without being obstructed by anyone. And he himself resigned. So I thought it was really not a good point by the Democrats. In fact, this entire day, I think, was a failure for the Democrats, because Chairman Nadler had public basically said his purpose for doing this was to try to sway the public opinions towards impeachment. And I don't think he got this from this hearing at all today. In fact, I totally think it was a failure."

    {
      "speaker": "LESKO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I -- I hope you're right, because it should have been a disappointment to them. I mean, I, quite honestly, was surprised that Mr. Mueller seemed to be having difficulty asking -- answering some fairly simple questions. And then he contradicted himself a few times, especially about this OLC opinion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "In other words, how far he could go on the obstruction of justice charge and all that. I guess I'm more curious, what happens now? We do know that Nancy Pelosi is meeting with all the key committee heads, including Judiciary and Intelligence, about what to do now. We don't know what will come up of that. We do know she's speaking likely in the next hour to sort of give us a what next thing. But what do you -- what do you think is going to happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESKO",
      "utterance": "Well, if the Democrats are smart, they would stop this, because the American people are seeing through it. I mean, how many subpoenas does Chairman Nadler and the other committees have to deliver and how many contempts of Congress? I mean, it's just becoming commonplace now. And the American people are ready to move on and really address the important issues. In fact, I had a local radio station in Arizona ask me today, why aren't you focusing on the Russia collusion or interference, I should say, the Russia interference in our elections, so that it doesn't happen in the future? Why aren't the Democrats focusing on that? Well, that's a good question. I don't know why they aren't."

      "utterance": "Well, I think the American public probably wants us to move on. Unfortunately, what we have seen so far from my Democratic counterparts is just about in every committee in the House, they're using it to influence the 2020 election. So I don't have high hopes that they're going to stop on this, because they just want it to keep coming up in the media. So then I think it's fair game, if they're going to continue, that we want to get to the root of the problem. Like, what started this to begin with? And was there Russian influence on the Steele dossier? I mean, these are legitimate questions that were brought up today in the testimony. And I do think they need to be answered."

But he was saying things like, we had a good day today, no defense for this ridiculous hoax, that, if you looked at the polls and what they're showing, it's a big day for our country and the Republican Party. But he's pretty pleased. Are you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESKO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he should be pleased, because, like I said, I think Chairman Nadler's -- he has said it publicly in the past, that he wanted to do this because he didn't think that the American public read the report. So he wanted to get Mueller on TV, and get some gotchas or something to sway public opinion towards impeachment. And I think it backfired on them, quite frankly. And I think it backfired because, first of all, there's nothing there. But, secondly, Mr. Mueller himself seemed very disoriented, couldn't answer certain questions. So I don't think that worked in their favor."

And they were saying that -- a lot of them pointed to Congressman Ratcliffe's questioning. And this is where he brought that up, the exoneration fact. And he's one of the few Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who has a lot of legal experience. And he brought up, why did you even make the point that -- about exoneration? That's not your job. And we can see the president using that line of questioning. A lot of people were cheering on Ratcliffe during that. I think Congressman Meadows even told us that he was the star of the show. And so it was interesting that the president really hyped that up. But, again, we didn't really learn a lot from today. I know that, speaking with a lot of members prior to his testimony, they weren't expecting to hear a lot. But they were at least hoping for, especially Democrats, some sort of dramatic clip to come of it, if it wasn't going to be some sort of new revelation. And Mueller wasn't giving them any of that."

And one of them was that, yes, Mueller's work, he's finished with this report, but we're not done here. They plan to continue their oversight efforts into the fall. And I think that's what Congresswoman Dean was getting at. And they're just showing that this fight isn't over.
