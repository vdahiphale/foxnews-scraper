We do know this -- Joe Manchin laid down a marker today, and \"The Washington Post\" took note, saying \"Joe Manchin delivers a dagger to the heart of the progressive cause. They can huff and puff all they want, but they won't blow down the West Virginia Democrat's House because he correctly read public opinion. Reengineering the fabric of American life is modern progressivism's whole point. Its adherents believe that the nation is in crisis. Crises demand immediately and wide-ranging action, not incremental change or tinkering around the edges. Their ambitions, however, can only prevail in a democracy if they are supported by public opinion.\" That's where we are at this hour. Let's bring in our panel, Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina. Mara, we don't know where this is going. We do know that it's going to be less than $3.5 trillion in the reconciliation bill, if it happens. MARA LIASSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Yes, it's definitely going to be less. I think we've known that for quite some time. But we just didn't know the actual parameters of the negotiation. And I think the big progress that was made today is that Joe Manchin said in public before a camera what he's been saying in private and actually on paper in this memo that he and Chuck Schumer signed, that his number, top line number is $1.5 trillion. He has some other substantive demands. He wants new entitled programs, social safety net programs to be means tested. He wants to roll back the Trump tax cuts, including carried interest. So he has a whole lot of things that he cares about. Now, he did not say that this was a hard and fast number and he wasn't flexible at all. He said, we're going to negotiate.

Look, he reads the politics very well. Not just in his own state, but in, I think, the broader dynamic. And I think in this moment there ought to be a lot of critiques of the approach that Nancy Pelosi used, because at the end of the day, she may have missed an opportunity to achieve a package that could be much more perhaps than what Manchin's number would be, but far less than what progressives are currently demanding.

      "utterance": "It depends. It depends on how many Republican senators continue to call Republican members of the House and ask them to vote for the infrastructure bill. So Kevin McCarthy has a job to do here, too, which is keep the Republicans coalesced. I love AOC's political strategy, which is insult the person whose vote you need. I just don't think it's going to work."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But let's take you to the flipside, Ben. What about those moderate Republicans who look at the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and say, this is a chance to finally build that bridge, to finally fix that road that I have been talk about fixing to my constituents forever. Maybe I should vote for it. Is the politics of the moment more important than the bridge at home?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "I think that's the big question, but headed into a midterm year, delivery of that bridge is going to become less and less of their priority. And one more note on this. The kind of jabs that we've seen not just at Joe Manchin but today from some progressives at Arizona Senator Sinema have really become more and more aggressive during this point. The idea said by one member today that she hasn't shown us anything but a designer purse. That's not the kind of insult that's going to go across very well with someone who is navigating a situation and who, last I checked has, 40 percent popularity among Republicans in Arizona."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And either one of them could become Republicans and change the dynamic. You get Senate Majority Leader McConnell. All right, thank you all. When we come back, a look at the newly renovated Washington Bureau."

      "utterance": "Fancy. Finally tonight, FOX News is marking the 25th anniversary this year. We've covered a lot of stories in that time, and a lot have come from here in our Washington Bureau, where this program originates. As we look back on the past quarter century, we're also moving forward with a special ceremony here just a short time ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "A state-of-the-art, all-digital newsroom, the FOX News Washington Bureau reopened after a major renovation. Two new flagship studios, a super high resolution technology platform for video and graphics, and our newsroom."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Reconfigured to allow producers and editors to easily monitor the ever-growing number of satellite video feeds on 75-inch TV screens. FOX Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch calls it an investment in the future for the top-rated news channel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LACHLAN MURDOCH, FOX CORPORATION CEO",
      "utterance": "And the reason is to give all of you the space and environment to continue to do your very best work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Another behind the scenes feature of our new bureau, two very special places honoring two very special people. First, the Charles Krauthammer Green Room. If you've watched SPECIAL REPORT, you know how important he was to the show and the channel. We miss his words of wisdom every day. This plaque says in memory of our beloved colleague, friend, and patriot. This is the Tony Snow Radio Studio in honor of our friend who passed away 13 years ago, the host of FOX News Sunday. This is to remember him every day."

    {
      "speaker": "JAY WALLACE, FOX NEWS MEDIA PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "The heartbeat of the news operation since FOX News Sunday kicked off 25 years ago this past spring."

      "speaker": "SUZANNE SCOTT, FOX NEWS MEDIA CEO",
      "utterance": "This is also a moment to remember an extraordinary voice and gentle giant in our business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "This renovation was long in the planning. The original FOX News Washington Bureau was our home through the major news events of our time -- impeachments, wars, congressional fights, Bush v Gore, and 9/11. But an ever-evolving news environment has inspired us to redesign our new offices bigger and better to complement the latest technology along with our solid storytelling and reporting."
