Well, that's exactly what happened in this case. The girl apparently admitted in court that she previously had had a consensual relationship with her attacker, and that they even had agreed to meet in the bathroom where the attack occurred. 'Washington Post' reporter Justin Jouvenal, should be juvenile, while not mentioning the name of the victim or her attacker, published these details. He then followed it up with a tweet, clearly trying to throw shade on the judge's decision. The chief judge in juvenile court, who heard all the evidence in the case, decided that the accused male teenager who wore a skirt did commit the sexual assault. But it seems the reporter wasn't happy with that. Now, my question is, where are all the women who stood up for professed victims in the past? Well, let's remember their words.",

The very Democrats, who claimed to be the 'Me Too' defenders. Now, even kids are realizing that their schools are a mess. Students at multiple area high schools participated in walkouts today to protest for safer schools after the Loudoun County School Board officials originally denied that these attacks ever had occurred. Now, parents are justifiably fed up. The latest non-fake outrage involves Loudoun County's requirement that parents must sign an NDA, a nondisclosure agreement, to view part of its new race and equity curriculum. Now, \"As part - as a part of the school's broader equity agenda, the district spent approximately $7,700 to become a licensed user of something called Second Step Programs, a branch of the left-leaning nonprofit organization Committee for Children. According to a copy of the NDA-style form, eligible parents at the LCPS must sign the document to view the second step curriculum.\" All this board members who are, by the way, attacking parental rights, in this case, making them sign some agreement that they're not going to talk about it, have to be defeated. All of them have to be thrown out on there you know what, next go around. The campaign against parental involvement in schools is being led, not surprisingly, by left-wing activists, like Jack Schneider and Jennifer Berkshire. Writing in 'The Washington Post', \"Parents claim they have the right to shape their kids' school curriculum. They don't. To turn over all decisions to parents would risk inhibiting the ability of young people to think independently.\" Oh, that's lovely. Well, naturally, Randi Weingarten, the odious head of the American Federation of Teachers, love this anti-parent take tweeting, \"Great piece on parents' rights and public schools\". That's funny. Because by parents rights, she means the right to step aside and let the experts control it all. Who on earth would tolerate disrespect? Parents, you're paying the bills here? Why accept the abuse? And by the way, this will only make matters worse in schools, where parents have started their own walkouts that are permanent. Loudoun County is growing in population, but its school enrollment is dropping, meaning the schools are losing state funding. Good. And the uber-rich and ultra liberal Fairfax County public schools right outside of D.C. are also seeing trouble on the horizon. All of last year, we warned them, that if they kept their schools closed for in-person learning, while dumbing down their curriculum with anti- racism and equity, parents would start pulling their kids out. And that's exactly what's happened. The district is still down 10,000 students from their pre-pandemic levels. Now, why what happened? Well, they moved their children to private or parochial schools. Others opted for home-schooling, others went to areas of the country where schools were operating in person. And yet school leaders, according to this piece, acknowledge that, when it comes to students who had been in classrooms pre-pandemic, they say they have no idea where they've gone. Well, they haven't - they haven't been disappeared by a musician - a magician. My goodness. And these people, who don't know where the kids have gone, are in charge of your kids' education. This is absolutely terrifying. But don't worry. Their priorities include paring back on AP courses, and mandating that (ph) athletes get the vaccination. Parents are not just walking out on these radical school administrators, they want to throw them all out.",

The Democratic Party is about to experience what a political walkout across America feels like. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Naomi Wolf, former Democrat advisor and author of \"Outrages\"; and Emily Devault, a Loudoun County parent whose daughter took part in today's walkout. Naomi, let's start with you. Where are the feminists rushing in to condemn this school board in Loudoun County, and what their role in covering this up was? And also, the politicians. Where are the feminists? NAOMI WOLF, \"OUTRAGES\" AUTHOR: This is a painful and mortifying moment, Ms. Ingraham. There are, of course, feminists, dads, and moms across the country, who identify as feminists. Survivors of sexual assault should be rallying to support this family that's doing absolutely everything right, when it comes to how you should support a child who's been sexually assaulted. The dad is saying - you know, trying to tell people who are responsible, trying to warn other parents. This is exactly the right thing to do when a violent crime like this has taken place. They're rejecting shame, they're rejecting blame, and they're being targeted. So I'm embarrassed and ashamed that feminists are not standing up to support this family. And I'm embarrassed and ashamed that there's not a chorus, calling out the horrific treatment of this young lady, who is a minor, by the court system and also 'The Washington Post'. I just want to note very quickly. There's a lot - there's so much wrong with the way this young woman is being treated. That it almost seems - like bizarre - like almost punishing the parents, and punishing this family for speaking out. I just want to note, I'm as, unfortunately, a survivor of child rape, rape in childhood, and I'm also an advocate. I've walked with rape survivors as they've gone through the judicial process, which is so painful.",

These are parents, these are moms and dads who don't want this racist hate America curriculum taught in their schools, want to get involved in their kids' education.

You know what was interesting about that first letter on the 29th of September, that got this whole thing rolling, not once - not once in that six page letter was the word parent, or parents mentioned.

You go through these clinical trials, and the really study starts when you give it to the American public. This was an emergency use authorization vaccine. Now they are doing these studies, and it took six months to do these studies in five to 11 years old. And if you look at it, six months to five and 11 years old, compare this to when they did studies on polio. It was over a million people that they studied this in, and it took over a year. There is no comparison with this. We do not know the long-term effects, the health effects, that these babies will suffer. And you know that we see the myocarditis and the inflammatory responses in those young people from 18 to 26. So how do we know this is not going to happen in these children? Laura, even when you look at Pfizer's research, they didn't study things like does it keep these children from getting COVID? Does it keep them from being hospitalized? You know what they looked at? What is that antibody response? What is that immune response? That's what they studied. And here we are talking about natural immunity. We know that children recover from this with mild to little symptoms, and hospitalization is almost unheard of in these children. So why would you subject these five to 11 years old to a vaccine where we don't have long-term studies?",

Now, I'm young enough to remember that when liberal journalists over at 'The Washington Post' used to believe that it was reprehensible for a defendant to use the victim's sexual history to impeach her credibility. Well, that's exactly what happened in this case. The girl apparently admitted in court that she previously had had a consensual relationship with her attacker, and that they even had agreed to meet in the bathroom where the attack occurred. 'Washington Post' reporter Justin Jouvenal, should be juvenile, while not mentioning the name of the victim or her attacker, published these details. He then followed it up with a tweet, clearly trying to throw shade on the judge's decision. The chief judge in juvenile court, who heard all the evidence in the case, decided that the accused male teenager who wore a skirt did commit the sexual assault. But it seems the reporter wasn't happy with that. Now, my question is, where are all the women who stood up for professed victims in the past? Well, let's remember their words."

The very Democrats, who claimed to be the 'Me Too' defenders. Now, even kids are realizing that their schools are a mess. Students at multiple area high schools participated in walkouts today to protest for safer schools after the Loudoun County School Board officials originally denied that these attacks ever had occurred. Now, parents are justifiably fed up. The latest non-fake outrage involves Loudoun County's requirement that parents must sign an NDA, a nondisclosure agreement, to view part of its new race and equity curriculum. Now, \"As part - as a part of the school's broader equity agenda, the district spent approximately $7,700 to become a licensed user of something called Second Step Programs, a branch of the left-leaning nonprofit organization Committee for Children. According to a copy of the NDA-style form, eligible parents at the LCPS must sign the document to view the second step curriculum.\" All this board members who are, by the way, attacking parental rights, in this case, making them sign some agreement that they're not going to talk about it, have to be defeated. All of them have to be thrown out on there you know what, next go around. The campaign against parental involvement in schools is being led, not surprisingly, by left-wing activists, like Jack Schneider and Jennifer Berkshire. Writing in 'The Washington Post', \"Parents claim they have the right to shape their kids' school curriculum. They don't. To turn over all decisions to parents would risk inhibiting the ability of young people to think independently.\" Oh, that's lovely. Well, naturally, Randi Weingarten, the odious head of the American Federation of Teachers, love this anti-parent take tweeting, \"Great piece on parents' rights and public schools\". That's funny. Because by parents rights, she means the right to step aside and let the experts control it all. Who on earth would tolerate disrespect? Parents, you're paying the bills here? Why accept the abuse? And by the way, this will only make matters worse in schools, where parents have started their own walkouts that are permanent. Loudoun County is growing in population, but its school enrollment is dropping, meaning the schools are losing state funding. Good. And the uber-rich and ultra liberal Fairfax County public schools right outside of D.C. are also seeing trouble on the horizon. All of last year, we warned them, that if they kept their schools closed for in-person learning, while dumbing down their curriculum with anti- racism and equity, parents would start pulling their kids out. And that's exactly what's happened. The district is still down 10,000 students from their pre-pandemic levels. Now, why what happened? Well, they moved their children to private or parochial schools. Others opted for home-schooling, others went to areas of the country where schools were operating in person. And yet school leaders, according to this piece, acknowledge that, when it comes to students who had been in classrooms pre-pandemic, they say they have no idea where they've gone. Well, they haven't - they haven't been disappeared by a musician - a magician. My goodness. And these people, who don't know where the kids have gone, are in charge of your kids' education. This is absolutely terrifying. But don't worry. Their priorities include paring back on AP courses, and mandating that (ph) athletes get the vaccination. Parents are not just walking out on these radical school administrators, they want to throw them all out."

Woke activists, who are masquerading as teachers or administrators, obviously can't be trusted. They have other priorities. The walkouts we saw today in Virginia are only the beginning. The Democratic Party is about to experience what a political walkout across America feels like. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Naomi Wolf, former Democrat advisor and author of \"Outrages\"; and Emily Devault, a Loudoun County parent whose daughter took part in today's walkout. Naomi, let's start with you. Where are the feminists rushing in to condemn this school board in Loudoun County, and what their role in covering this up was? And also, the politicians. Where are the feminists? NAOMI WOLF, \"OUTRAGES\" AUTHOR: This is a painful and mortifying moment, Ms. Ingraham. There are, of course, feminists, dads, and moms across the country, who identify as feminists. Survivors of sexual assault should be rallying to support this family that's doing absolutely everything right, when it comes to how you should support a child who's been sexually assaulted. The dad is saying - you know, trying to tell people who are responsible, trying to warn other parents. This is exactly the right thing to do when a violent crime like this has taken place. They're rejecting shame, they're rejecting blame, and they're being targeted. So I'm embarrassed and ashamed that feminists are not standing up to support this family. And I'm embarrassed and ashamed that there's not a chorus, calling out the horrific treatment of this young lady, who is a minor, by the court system and also 'The Washington Post'. I just want to note very quickly. There's a lot - there's so much wrong with the way this young woman is being treated. That it almost seems - like bizarre - like almost punishing the parents, and punishing this family for speaking out. I just want to note, I'm as, unfortunately, a survivor of child rape, rape in childhood, and I'm also an advocate. I've walked with rape survivors as they've gone through the judicial process, which is so painful."

But there was kind of a woke thing happening, because it wasn't clear whether the individual is gender fluid or not. We don't know if that came into play.

They have to report it. So they're - you know, their last interviews, they're saying, 'Oh, the guidelines were unclear'. This is nonsense. So I think what I'd encourage everyone to realize is, there's something bigger going on here. Parents are being targeted. They're being identified as domestic terrorists for speaking up at meetings where their kids' education is at stake. There is a bigger picture of like a war against the family."

Well, that's interesting. I've been reading a lot of social media responses to this walkout. And I'm just shocked by some of the pushback, because they're saying, this is just political. It's political posturing. It's - it's something to help Youngkin at this time. This has nothing to do with politics. This has nothing to do with politics. This is a crime in our schools. It could have been a guy, it could have been a girl. We're done. We're done with the issues in Loudoun County. We needed something positive today.

Who cares more about a kid's education, government, or moms and dads? And I'll bet on moms and dads every single time. And that's why parents - you know, what else I said last week at the hearing? As I said, I think this memo from the Attorney General is the last straw. I think when you start telling parents, governments better. They know more about your kids than you do, when you start telling them that that's the last straw.

When Marco Rubio introduced a bill that would have banned products tied to the CCP's systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, well, John Kerry, along with Big Tech, were instrumental in hobbling that effort. Now, why? Because Kerry didn't want to offend China. That's why. The fact is, Kerry has been undermining our country to appease China for years."

We have big disagreements with China on some key issues. Absolutely. But climate has to stand alone. Well, I'm going to fight over this issue. That's a trade issue, or a cyber issue. And we're going to fight about that while the world is falling apart. You really be certifiable."

Well, what's certifiable here is believing that China actually plans to live up to any climate commitment it makes. So despite signing the Paris accord, China brought three times more coal power online in 2020 than the rest of the world combined. And now, with rolling blackouts gripping the country, the CCP faces losing its grip on power, while China is ordering mines to produce as much coal as possible. Still Kerry seems to be poised to give China anything it wants in return for just empty promises. It's time to change this climate of weakness, and get rid of John Kerry.

This administration is willing to sacrifice just about any element of American security, whether that's with partners in the Middle East, or now you're talking about Chinese Communist Party, all on the altar of this faithful commitment to climate change. He'll sacrifice the Uyghurs in the western part of China, he will sacrifice the Tibetans, the people of Hong Kong, and America's national security interests. Remember, this is an administration that's already letting China bring in crude oil from Iran. It's an administration took a properly extraditable Chinese leader of Huawei, who was sitting in Canada, to be returned to the United States under criminal indictment. They let her go. This administration that is willing to appease the Chinese Communist Party for anything, all for the sake of a phony promise, Laura. The Chinese Communist Party is no more likely to actually live up to his commitment on energy than a man in the moon. They just simply aren't going to do it. We signed the Paris Climate Accords, and in the Trump administration we actually reduced total carbon output from the United States of America. The Chinese Communist Party didn't get out of the deal. They stayed in, but of course, increased their carbon output tremendously."

They're not about to change just because John Kerry shows up and tells them, hey, America is going to sacrifice its economy, America is going to sacrifice millions of its own jobs and good income for hardworking Americans. You should do that too. This is a fool's errand. Secretary Kerry has been on a fool's errand on lots of fronts. Remember, this was the man who said you couldn't have Arab countries recognize the state of Israel or there would be war if he didn't solve the Palestinian problem. He's been wrong an awful lot. There's no chance the Chinese Communist Party is going to reduce its carbon emissions just for the sake of appeasing some American interests.

I think he thinks he is sitting across from a leader who he can roll and get a deal that will make a lot better outcome for the Chinese Communist Party, a worse outcome for the American people, frankly a worse outcome for most the Chinese people as well, but certainly one that's not in America's best security interest.

But now to earn your trust, Good Information is planning to focus primarily on local news by acquiring a company called Courier Newsroom which has local outlets in eight states including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This is the same group of stations, mind you, that was cited by the media watchdog group NewsGuard for, quoting here, \"failing to meet several basic standards of credibility and transparency.\" And to further boost your confidence, Good Information will be led by Tara McGowan, a former Democratic strategist who previously ran a progressive nonprofit called Acronym, which back in 2020 ran one of the largest digital campaigns to beat Donald Trump. Acronym also invested in the company that made major headlines for producing the disastrous cellphone app that broke the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses by severely delaying the vote tally. But now Tara McGowan has released that reads in part, quoting here, \"At Good Information Inc we are committed to scaling immediate solutions that counter dangerous information where it spreads.\" And maybe by \"dangerous\" she means shutting down stories like Hunter Biden's laptop or the Wuhan lab week, both of which were labeled disinformation and conspiracies by the left, only to be proven legit.

Days ago Harvard University sophomore name Kyla Golding published a lengthy diatribe about what convinced her to quit the pre-med program. Her righteous rebellion started when a grand jury declined to charge police in the death of Breonna Taylor on the day of her inorganic chemistry exam. She writes, \"my body inhaled molecules of white supremacy as they seeped out of my computer from that proctored Zoom room. They entered my bloodstream and catalyzed a metabolism that would allow for the invasion of my body by a violently infectious lifeform. The presence of the germ of white supremacy would cause a steric hindrance within me. I haven't been able to show up mentally or emotionally in a science class since.\" Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker, host of \"The Dinesh D'Souza Podcast.\" Dinesh, why does this all start sound like \"The Babylon Bee,\" a satiric website?"

I was reading through this young woman's comments, and I actually don't think her anger is feigned. It's not made up. It's actually genuine, but I think it's aimed at the wrong target. The target is actually not white supremacy. She's not experiencing white supremacy in any meaningful sense. It's really probably Affirmative Action, but as the economist Thomas Sowell pointed out years ago, what Affirmative Action does is it takes minority kids, often pretty smart minority kids, but it creates a mismatch. It promotes them into an environment where they are competitively outmatched by their peers. Obviously, this young woman can't say, listen, I'm having Affirmative Action problems. I'm not as well prepared. All my peers are smarter than me. Maybe I should have majored in Afro-American studies and not taken chemistry. But here I am in chemistry class. I need help. She can't say any of that, so she has to displace her rage and displace her anger. And so she invents the phantom of white supremacists. By the way, not white supremacy happening to her, but white supremacists happening someplace else, which is evidently preventing her from performing in class. And now I understand she has withdrawn from school."

But it would have required me to release by breath, to plead for the need to catch it. Thirteen months later the germ of white supremacy stills shows up in my body every time I enter the Science Center C lecture hall or its Zoom room equivalent.\" Dinesh, she should have majored in drama, perhaps.

There's evidently no white supremacists at Harvard, there's no one who is mistreating her. There are no professors who have been even condescending to her. She is finding white supremacy in a distant place. It's sort of like if I were at Dartmouth and said, listen, the reason I am performing poorly at school is because there are slum kids in India who only get one meal a day.

You go through these clinical trials, and the really study starts when you give it to the American public. This was an emergency use authorization vaccine. Now they are doing these studies, and it took six months to do these studies in five to 11 years old. And if you look at it, six months to five and 11 years old, compare this to when they did studies on polio. It was over a million people that they studied this in, and it took over a year. There is no comparison with this. We do not know the long-term effects, the health effects, that these babies will suffer. And you know that we see the myocarditis and the inflammatory responses in those young people from 18 to 26. So how do we know this is not going to happen in these children? Laura, even when you look at Pfizer's research, they didn't study things like does it keep these children from getting COVID? Does it keep them from being hospitalized? You know what they looked at? What is that antibody response? What is that immune response? That's what they studied. And here we are talking about natural immunity. We know that children recover from this with mild to little symptoms, and hospitalization is almost unheard of in these children. So why would you subject these five to 11 years old to a vaccine where we don't have long-term studies?"
