That's because everyone is focusing on Bob Mueller preparing to testify before Congress tomorrow, not so much on Washington spending like there is no tomorrow, a lot more debt and right now a lot more worries. So, while Mueller may be on the hot seat, taxpayers may just be getting hot and bothered. That includes you.  And we are on top of both, which would include you.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  More on that big spending measure in a moment. First to Catherine Herridge on that big hearing, and the attorney general, William Barr, now weighing in on that -- Catherine.",

      "sentences": "Thanks, Neil. And good afternoon. A short time ago, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee put out a statement about the Democrats making a surprise add for tomorrow's hearing. And the key line is buried at the bottom, saying that the move could jeopardize tomorrow's session.  Aaron Zebley is counsel for Robert Mueller and, according to the Republican statement, could advise him privately and simultaneously testify alongside him. We're told the late add may violate House rules about notification.   And a lawyer also acting as a sworn witness is a gray area. The Collins statement says -- quote -- \"A last-minute addition to the witness list would now jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with the rules of the House. This appearance stunt is unsurprising, in light of the Democrats' repeated attempts to circumvent, misrepresent and flout the rules and procedures governing this committee's business.\" Also, a senior Justice Department official sending the former special counsel a letter formally advising him to limit his public testimony to the report and his statement about two months ago, after the report was complete. It reads in part -- quote -- \"Should you testify,\" because it's Mueller's decision as a private citizen, \"the department understands that testimony regarding the work of the special counsel's office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29, specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in and doesn't go beyond the public version of your March 22, 2019, report to the attorney general or your May 29 public statements.\"   So in layman's terms, that means no classified information, no grand jury material, nothing about the redacted portions of the report and, more significantly, nothing more about what they call uncharged third parties. In this case, it's a broad exemption that also includes the president of the United States. Speaking to FOX News earlier today, Attorney General William Barr said Mueller had asked the department to get specific about the boundaries.",

I love it when people can come together to do something, even if it does mean spending massive amounts of money. I understand why people on the left are mad about this. I understand why some conservatives have some pause. But when I look at what's going on here, I really look at two things. As a veteran, I will always be a major proponent of defense spending.  And when you think about the defense spending, everybody thinks about making the fighter jets stronger and the tanks and all that stuff. But it's really supporting not only our veterans, but our active-duty troops. The president actually talked to the largest group of a conservative team today in Washington, D.C. He brought up the spending that we're doing for the military. And he brought up something, the VA Choice Act. I don't think a lot of people know a lot about that. This is something that helps veterans get private care when they do not live close to a VA facility. So when we're spending money on this, I think that's a good thing. It's always a good thing to keep America strong. And the second really good thing about this bill is that it helps them reprogram funds for the border wall. If you have ever been to a Trump rally, if you have ever been to a Trump speech, if you have ever talked to Donald Trump supporters, they want that wall.   And I think that, if this bill passes, if it gets the votes that it needs, we will be able to get more funding for the wall as well, because he's going to have the opportunity to reprogram funds for the wall without restrictions.",

It's really hard to rein in spending, and deficit spending is growing faster now than it ever has before. But we have to remember that lot of this was about honoring the money and honoring our debts and the money we have already spent. So I think that's something that absolutely has to get done. And Republicans and Democrats know that it has to get done for the good of our economy.  But I think folks are right. Whenever we have to raise the debt limit, which we do, Republicans and Democrats on the far right and the far left, they love to point fingers and talk about under which presidency the debt raised more. And the fact of the matter is, it's everybody's fault, and that the tax cuts costs money. They add to the deficit. Republicans need to understand that. Democrats also have to prioritize domestic spending. So I think it's -- everybody's got to come together and deal with entitlements, like I think one of the panelists said before, and discretionary spending, or else nothing's ever going to happen.

Crew on board the USS Boxer saw one drone go down in the water. They saw the splash. The other disappeared from radar and was thought destroyed. CBS first quoted the head of U.S. Central Command, General Frank McKenzie, who said there may have been more. Both drones were taken out by this new Marine Corps anti-drone jamming device strapped to the deck of the USS Boxer without firing a shot, frying the drones' electronics. New satellite images show that British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero as it was circled by an Iranian fast boat, and now held in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Iran's foreign minister says his country seized the tanker after it hit a fishing boat. The vessel's parent company pushed back -- quote -- \"We can confirm that we are not aware of and nor is there any evidence of a collision involving the Stena Impero.\" The 23 crew members aboard a British oil tanker continue to be detained by Iranian forces for a fifth day.

And, unfortunately, Theresa May has been incredibly weak-kneed on this -- on this front so far, and the new prime minister has to demonstrate some real resolve and leadership. And I would like to see Britain joining with the United States actually in taking clear action here in the defense of the waterways of the Strait of Hormuz.  And this idea that there's going to be some sort of European coalition guarding the waterways, I think, is sort of pie in the sky right now, because the Europeans are simply lacking the willpower to do anything, nor, in most cases, do they actually have the military power to do so.

And while I think we can all acknowledge that there are thousands, if not millions of Americans that are trying to support their family on one, two or three minimum wage jobs, I think we also need to acknowledge that there are regional differences when it comes to the standard of living. What -- a place like New York may need $15- or $20-an-hour minimum wage, but a place like Ohio made need $10 an hour. Small businesses are also -- could also be disproportionately impacted. So I would say it needs to be decided regionally as far as minimum wage increases. And I think that small businesses need to be exempt under 50 employees.

We have anecdotal evidence of seeing companies are laying off workers when that one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter approach does go into effect. Certainly, in Rashida Tlaib's home district in Michigan, you would possibly see job losses. The Restaurant Association, a lot of the workers there could see their jobs cut. We saw that with Amazon. When Amazon raised its minimum wage, what did it do? It started to cut bonuses. It started to cut stock-based pay, and it moved more to robots. So a lot of these people on the left like to cite the Nordic countries as their socialist models. The Nordic countries do not, do not have a minimum wage. We're talking Sweden, Finland and Denmark.

And for their families, at least we are giving them some help, help because they gave us so much help on that horrible day, 9/11.\" President Trump has indicated that he will sign this bill.

      "utterance": "Thanks, Neil. And good afternoon. A short time ago, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee put out a statement about the Democrats making a surprise add for tomorrow's hearing. And the key line is buried at the bottom, saying that the move could jeopardize tomorrow's session. Aaron Zebley is counsel for Robert Mueller and, according to the Republican statement, could advise him privately and simultaneously testify alongside him. We're told the late add may violate House rules about notification. And a lawyer also acting as a sworn witness is a gray area. The Collins statement says -- quote -- \"A last-minute addition to the witness list would now jeopardize whether tomorrow's hearing complies with the rules of the House. This appearance stunt is unsurprising, in light of the Democrats' repeated attempts to circumvent, misrepresent and flout the rules and procedures governing this committee's business.\" Also, a senior Justice Department official sending the former special counsel a letter formally advising him to limit his public testimony to the report and his statement about two months ago, after the report was complete. It reads in part -- quote -- \"Should you testify,\" because it's Mueller's decision as a private citizen, \"the department understands that testimony regarding the work of the special counsel's office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29, specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in and doesn't go beyond the public version of your March 22, 2019, report to the attorney general or your May 29 public statements.\" So in layman's terms, that means no classified information, no grand jury material, nothing about the redacted portions of the report and, more significantly, nothing more about what they call uncharged third parties. In this case, it's a broad exemption that also includes the president of the United States.

Bob Mueller is going to do exactly what he said he was going to do. The statement from the Department of Justice or from the attorney general, Mueller requested it. So they're not muzzling him.

And he was held in contempt in spite, and he stuck to his guns. It's -- prosecutors just can't talk publicly about why they did certain things. It would just be a dangerous precedent.

If they want to pursue impeachment, that's up to them, but they don't need Mueller's report or Mueller's testimony.

The Washington Examiner's Tiana Lowe. We have got Turning Point USA's Rob Smith, Democratic strategist Kristen Hawn. You could go ahead all day, Tiana, and blame both parties for this excess. They have accepted a deal mutually repulsive, and, at the same time, welcome to both sides. So it keeps the government lights on for a couple of years. But it is getting to be a lot of red ink.

So how do Republicans respond when Democrats want to expand Social Security that will become insolvent in the next 15 years? They say, hey, we will just tack on another entitlement in the form of a paid family leave program to Social Security. So, I mean, I just think like the whole Tea Party promise, Republicans have shown that they're deeply unserious about fulfilling that promise. At least Democrats admit that they want to take and spend your money."

It's going at a pace that now exceeds that of the prior administration. And this president has been bashing that administration for accumulating debt. It does seem to be sort of like a bipartisan bent here. What do you make of it?"

      "speaker": "ROB SMITH, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm really glad you said that. For me, I guess I look at it very positively. Everything is so polarized. Everybody's arguing back and forth. I love it when people can come together to do something, even if it does mean spending massive amounts of money. I understand why people on the left are mad about this. I understand why some conservatives have some pause. But when I look at what's going on here, I really look at two things. As a veteran, I will always be a major proponent of defense spending. And when you think about the defense spending, everybody thinks about making the fighter jets stronger and the tanks and all that stuff. But it's really supporting not only our veterans, but our active-duty troops. The president actually talked to the largest group of a conservative team today in Washington, D.C. He brought up the spending that we're doing for the military. And he brought up something, the VA Choice Act. I don't think a lot of people know a lot about that. This is something that helps veterans get private care when they do not live close to a VA facility. So when we're spending money on this, I think that's a good thing. It's always a good thing to keep America strong. And the second really good thing about this bill is that it helps them reprogram funds for the border wall. If you have ever been to a Trump rally, if you have ever been to a Trump speech, if you have ever talked to Donald Trump supporters, they want that wall. And I think that, if this bill passes, if it gets the votes that it needs, we will be able to get more funding for the wall as well, because he's going to have the opportunity to reprogram funds for the wall without restrictions."

It's really hard to rein in spending, and deficit spending is growing faster now than it ever has before. But we have to remember that lot of this was about honoring the money and honoring our debts and the money we have already spent. So I think that's something that absolutely has to get done. And Republicans and Democrats know that it has to get done for the good of our economy. But I think folks are right. Whenever we have to raise the debt limit, which we do, Republicans and Democrats on the far right and the far left, they love to point fingers and talk about under which presidency the debt raised more. And the fact of the matter is, it's everybody's fault, and that the tax cuts costs money. They add to the deficit. Republicans need to understand that. Democrats also have to prioritize domestic spending. So I think it's -- everybody's got to come together and deal with entitlements, like I think one of the panelists said before, and discretionary spending, or else nothing's ever going to happen. So both sides need to get serious."

Crew on board the USS Boxer saw one drone go down in the water. They saw the splash. The other disappeared from radar and was thought destroyed. CBS first quoted the head of U.S. Central Command, General Frank McKenzie, who said there may have been more. Both drones were taken out by this new Marine Corps anti-drone jamming device strapped to the deck of the USS Boxer without firing a shot, frying the drones' electronics. New satellite images show that British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero as it was circled by an Iranian fast boat, and now held in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Iran's foreign minister says his country seized the tanker after it hit a fishing boat. The vessel's parent company pushed back -- quote -- \"We can confirm that we are not aware of and nor is there any evidence of a collision involving the Stena Impero.\" The 23 crew members aboard a British oil tanker continue to be detained by Iranian forces for a fifth day.

Of course, the bigger issue looming in the background is the Brexit issue. But immediately on his desk, he's going to have to deal with the Iran situation. And you have a British-flagged vessel that is being detained by Iran. You have 23 sailors who have been held hostage by the Iranians. This is a completely unacceptable situation. And you need to see very firm British action being taken. And, unfortunately, Theresa May has been incredibly weak-kneed on this -- on this front so far, and the new prime minister has to demonstrate some real resolve and leadership. And I would like to see Britain joining with the United States actually in taking clear action here in the defense of the waterways of the Strait of Hormuz. And this idea that there's going to be some sort of European coalition guarding the waterways, I think, is sort of pie in the sky right now, because the Europeans are simply lacking the willpower to do anything, nor, in most cases, do they actually have the military power to do so. And it's time for the United States and the United Kingdom, I think, to work together here to take action against the Iranians. So the new prime minister has to demonstrate real leadership, completely break away from Theresa May's failed policies on Iran. Britain needs to get out of the JCPOA, Iran nuclear deal agreement, and enforce sanctions against Iran alongside the United States. We do need..."

It's completely unacceptable. And the next time the Iranians dare to even consider this sort of action, there should be the threat of a British military response against any Iranian vessel that threatens a British ship. The British must be prepared to defend that vessel. We need to have a robust British military presence in the strait in order to do so. There's only one frigate there right now.

And while I think we can all acknowledge that there are thousands, if not millions of Americans that are trying to support their family on one, two or three minimum wage jobs, I think we also need to acknowledge that there are regional differences when it comes to the standard of living. What -- a place like New York may need $15- or $20-an-hour minimum wage, but a place like Ohio made need $10 an hour. Small businesses are also -- could also be disproportionately impacted. So I would say it needs to be decided regionally as far as minimum wage increases. And I think that small businesses need to be exempt under 50 employees. Now, the big boys like Walmart, that's a whole different story. Those guys need to pay more and give more hours, so they're not -- so their employees are not relying on things like Medicaid and the tax dollars, because those multinational corporations can afford it."

It did say it's hard to tell how the U.S. economy and the companies in the U.S. economy would react. We have anecdotal evidence of seeing companies are laying off workers when that one-size-fits-all, cookie-cutter approach does go into effect. Certainly, in Rashida Tlaib's home district in Michigan, you would possibly see job losses. The Restaurant Association, a lot of the workers there could see their jobs cut. We saw that with Amazon. When Amazon raised its minimum wage, what did it do? It started to cut bonuses. It started to cut stock-based pay, and it moved more to robots. So a lot of these people on the left like to cite the Nordic countries as their socialist models. The Nordic countries do not, do not have a minimum wage. We're talking Sweden, Finland and Denmark. It's a one-size-fits-all approach that's not working. There's different costs of living in different parts of the country. So the federal approach, top-down approach, might be the wrong way to go for the U.S. economy."

It's not going anywhere to the Senate, but they were willing to accept the standard rate for everybody, without distinctions in being in cheaper parts of the country, or kids vs. adults, that kind of thing. But leaving that aside, I'm wondering if Republicans then look like they're fighting this. And, again, I should stress that the congresswoman is among a couple just even mentioning this figure. Is it a big issue for them at all?"

And I think that's a good argument to take to the people. The American people understand we want to keep jobs growing. We don't want to kill jobs. We don't want to send jobs offshore overseas. And that's what this $20-an-hour minimum wage proposal would do. So I think the Republicans have a strong argument to the American people to say, we're about growing more jobs in the U.S. We want more people working in the U.S., and not going overseas for cheaper -- for cheaper labor."

They said, we want to help these 9/11 victims. But they were concerned at the fact that this fund could go until 2090. It's been a very emotional day here on Capitol Hill, as they finally lugged this across the finish line. I'm going to read something to you here from Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, what he said about this just a few minutes ago on the floor. He said -- quote -- \"We are now at the very end of a long struggle. But the struggle doesn't end for those who are sick or those who might get sick. And for their families, at least we are giving them some help, help because they gave us so much help on that horrible day, 9/11.\" President Trump has indicated that he will sign this bill. We don't know when that's going to come. But, remember, the House of Representatives passed this overwhelmingly a couple of weeks ago. And, again, this concern about the overall cost of this, I tried to ask the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, about that. These were two amendments that Senators Lee and Rand Paul had designed to say, let's try to cut some of this funding. Let's try to be responsible, from their vantage point. And Mitch McConnell wanted no part of my question. He basically said, we're going to be compassionate, and we're going to help those who worked on the pile shortly after 9/11, Neil."

And just to spell this out, this provides $10.2 billion in funding over 10 years, including the roughly $4 billion for claims already filed. And this is something that has grown exponentially larger in the process. You might recall 340 New York City firefighters died on September 11. Shortly thereafter, 200 more would perish from illnesses contracted at ground zero. There are reports that better than 16,000 could be eligible for claims being processed now. And, again, as Chad indicated, this will go to the president's desk, where he is expected to sign it. GOP pollster Lee Carter with me right now.

It's -- this is something we should all agree on. And I understand ideology. I understand saying we have to be able to afford the things that we're putting out there. But this isn't -- this isn't the sword to die on. And this now gives Democrats a way to say, look, another reason why Republicans are heartless. And that's not what we want to have. We want these people to be taken care of in perpetuity. They did things for us that we can't even imagine. If we can't run in and help them here, when they ran into literally save our lives on 9/11, then we have got -- we have got big problems."

Now, officials believe it's publicity that surrounded that helped many avoid arrest, even though all had been ordered deported by a judge. Neighbors like you see here in L.A. and elsewhere use phone trees and lookouts to undermine the operation. So ICE has accelerated their work site enforcement, issuing 3,200 notices to businesses, which usually force illegal labor to quit to avoid apprehension."

As part of this crackdown, they will also now begin enforcing a 1996 law targeting recent immigrants not near the border, but in cities nationwide. Now, in the past, the agency had simply issued detainers from migrants mostly convicted of violent crimes. Now, however, those arrested with, say, a DUI or a theft, domestic assault, they will become a priority. Democrats overwhelmingly supported expedited removal under Presidents Clinton and Obama. Now, however, many consider it harassment and, Neil, overreach -- back to you."

And it was about a 402-12 vote in the House. The Victims Compensation Fund from 9/11 is going to be beefed up, to the point of about $10.2 billion over 10-year, on top of $4 billion to make good on claims already filed for the more than 16,000 who are going to benefit. Let's go to Internet radio host Mike Gunzelman. We have also got the host of \"Sincerely Kat\" on FOX Nation, Kat Timpf. Kat, we were talking about, whatever point you can make about trying to pay for everything, that this was, I think you were saying, not a hill worth dying on here. What do you make of that?"

However, when you're talking about this issue, it's really not the best look to vote against this, especially when you know it's going to pass anyway.

All I'm saying is, I can't really imagine a worse look, in terms of something that you're going to go about blocking. There are so many ridiculous things that our government spends money on.

They -- clearly, they didn't really think it -- I really don't think they thought it out or thought that this would be -- how they didn't expect this type of backlash, when it's such a -- it's a no-brainer, when it really comes down to it, and when you're wasting so much money?
