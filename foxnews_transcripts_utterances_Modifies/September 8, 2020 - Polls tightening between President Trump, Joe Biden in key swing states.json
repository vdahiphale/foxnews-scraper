Welcome to the final stretch. We are less than two months out from Election Day, and the race for the White House continues to tighten and a lot. President Trump making stops in Florida and North Carolina, while Biden takes a break from the campaign trail a day after his event in Pennsylvania. The president railing against Joe Biden while in the sunshine state this afternoon.",

This is a really sharp contrast to the extreme radical left that you've had to deal with. Joe Biden's plan would destroy America's middle class.

With President Trump closing the gap with Biden on some coveted swing states, Politico is noting that, quote, \"while national polls have generated a portrait of Biden holding a commanding lead, it's something of a mirage. In the swing states of matter, it is trench warfare. Biden's advantage, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average is within the margin of error in half of the eight states. And Trump is a president whose support has been notoriously difficult for pollsters to survey.\" So Juan, I think that -- I would like to go to you first to just talk about the fact that we are two months away.

Would you rather be a guy who is having money trouble at the moment and seems to have spent money early on, and now is having to pull as in key states like Michigan?   Or would you rather be someone who just raised a record amount of money in the month of August? Would you rather be someone who dealing with -- allegedly making derogatory statements about, you know, our war dead, or would you rather be someone who sent his son to battle, you know, under the American flag? So I think that if you look at it in those terms and you look at the big poll numbers. As you say, it's tight in some states. But even in the swing states, the majority of the swing states now favor Biden. And you have a number of states like Arizona that previously would have been thought to being the Republican calm (ph) and now look pretty good. So, you know, you always have to give the advantage to the incumbent. But I would say right now, you know, as we start the sprint, as you put it, Dana. I would rather be Biden than Trump.",

So that's quite a significant change. And also, just the look and feel of the campaign, like, the president's on the road, he's there. He's at a beautiful stop there in Jupiter, Florida. He's making big announcements, including one about oil drilling off the coast.

Biden's on the defense. Take a look at the Florida poll, NBC. They have it tied. It's un-skewed. That's a poll that they actually have the breakdown reflecting the 2016 exit polls. And Biden is losing Hispanics. Trump is doing much better with Cubans in Venezuelans, has a little bit more work to do with Puerto Ricans in the Orlando area. But the president will win Florida, I can guarantee you that. Look at how he's doing in North Carolina over-performing with plaques (ph), his push for charter schools. School choice is really paying off.  And now, according to East Carolina University, he's up two points there. If I'm Joe Biden, I'm nervous, because right now, Donald Trump is within the margin of error in every single battleground state. You talk to the Trump campaign. They're pretty confident. I don't think the Biden campaign is that confident. If you want to look at numbers, the Republicans are out- registering Democrats by massive margins. In Florida, (Inaudible) by 450,000, North Carolina, 230,000, Pennsylvania, 150,000, the president's approval rate in Rasmussen right now is at 51 percent. Democrats very nervous about that, because at this stage in the re-election for Barack Obama in Rasmussen, he was at 48 percent, got re- elected. Bush was at 51 percent at Rasmussen at this point, got re-elected.  I think these raises dead-even with the president having a slight edge. And right now, I'd rather be President Trump.",

And it is kind of like when you drive a lemon off the lot and it doesn't make it to the highway. That's how it kind of feels. But this is -- we talked about the polls. And I think this is the toughest election in recent memory since 2016. To poll, because it's the first time in media and the Democrats and pop culture in general has painted a rather large target on the back of a group of voters, them being Trump voters, which forces them into the shadows. So when you talk about shy voters, we are only undercounting Trump voters. People are only lying that they're voting for Joe. They aren't lying voting for Trump, because why would you vote? Why would you lie about something that would get you abused? That's like going to the doctor and telling him that you are smoking more, you know? No, no, no, when you are going to lie to you doctor, you're going to tell him that you've lost weight and that you're -- you cut your smoking in half.  So there's a really simple experiment for the media to do. Go to a Trump event in a Biden shirt, then go to a Biden event in a Trump shirt and compare and contrast and see how people treat you. Lastly, to the derogatory story in the Atlantic. I need to comment on that. You need to have an anonymous story like that when there is an economic recovery, a jobs recovery, and hopefully a strong path to corral COVID, which I think is happening. So you need stuff like this.  But the funniest thing about the Atlantic story and this upcoming Michael Cohen book, they're like a farmer's almanac that tells you the weather that already happened, right? So wait a second. You are telling me that Trump says offensive things in public? Oh, my god, what do we do? We've only known that for four years, maybe even longer than that. And lastly, for the journalists out there, let's come up with a real definition of what confirmation means, because confirmation of an unproven allegation from a source isn't a confirmation of fact. It's a confirmation of an unproven allegation.",

But I think Republicans are a little bit more stressed out about the fact that when it comes to early voting and absentee ballot requests, the Democrats have astronomical advantages on that point. And early voting is already underway. So, you know, obviously -- talk about whatever you want. But I do think that there is some making up to do, at least on that front.",

Because in these battleground states that will determine the election, it is a three-point race with only two months to go. And we all remember in 2016 when Trump was behind in Pennsylvania at this time by two points, behind by three points in Michigan and seven points in Wisconsin.  And obviously, he won all three. So I think the national media is obviously focusing on national polls. And some state polls have suspect voter polls. Just the Florida -- one that you were mentioning on, that was an interesting skewed toward Republican voter makeup. And it only interviewed 138 Hispanics. So I think we should sort of take a step back and understand that polls at this point are not going to reflect necessarily the mood and the preferences of the electorate, especially when we are waiting for a COVID stimulus coming out. There's obviously a lot of unrest in urban environments and that mail-in voting, Dana that you touched on, that's going to play a huge part.",

Talk about extortion. Elect me or you are dead. But it's also based on ridding something they kept denying. The Dems kept saying the widespread brutality was fantasy.   They pushed it as mostly peaceful, as statistically, that's OK. But how good would you feel if you were told your parachute is mostly safe? But now, they have read the polls in they see that they were wrong. It's the only language they respect. But remove their lies and you see the real of these police incidents, drugs, mental illness, non-compliance. It exists across all races.  A mind on drugs are plagued by illness will not comply, and the police require compliance. It is that incompatibility that the media and Dems turned into fodder for unrest. And now boxed in, they must blame Trump. Of course, we could remind them Trump offered help, but that acceptance would be cooperating with orange man bad. If Wheeler had shelved his ego and taken Trump's help early on, that Trump supporter would be alive as well as many other people. Instead, they sheltered behind denials until the polls force them to emerge, finally, to survey the damage done. It wasn't just Joe in the basement. It's the whole party. They hid from the hell until it was time to campaign, which answers that great philosophical question. If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there but Democrats, does it make a sound, unless it's Trump's fault, no. All right, Jesse, it seems like Joe wants his cake and eat it too, a phrase I just came up with. He condemns Antifa, but he says it's Trump's fault for the violence.

I don't think anyone's going to believe it. It's a lot of money to spend on national cable to defend yourself. It seems like he has to have other people defend himself because he can't get his message out because all he's doing is reading what's in a teleprompter that his staff puts up. It looks like he wants to be the reader of the free world. Right now, I don't know. Biden's saying that Donald Trump wants to defund the police, and I see where he gets it. He said it's in the budget. I looked at the budget. And under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the cops program, community policing, was funded at about 200 million a year, under Donald Trump, funded about 300 million a year.

Portland has seen the resignation of over 100 officers in the last six months. Dozens more are looking for other jobs. And keep in mind. This is against the backdrop of their eliminating the background units. So these vacant positions aren't being filled. So it's not as if there are new people that are filling these positions. I think the bottom line is that condemnation means nothing without policy and action. And that is where that ad falls flat. It's also ironic to me that Biden is calling for a fresh start when electing him would literally be resurrecting the crypt keeper that was on the Hill for the last 70 years.  But let's take Portland back for a second. There, the mayor and the governor, have said that they want an end to the violence and the agitation. But that law enforcement there, they are still handcuffed. There are still active restraining orders in place by the courts preventing them from using teargas, pepper spray, LRADs, sound speakers, unless it's in certain specific situations.  So again, it's words without backing it up with a policy to actually help. The only way, by the way -- the only reason, by the way, that the mayor and the governor came out decrying it was because the not-small businesses came out in that area, saying that they were going to leave.

President Trump making stops in Florida and North Carolina, while Biden takes a break from the campaign trail a day after his event in Pennsylvania. The president railing against Joe Biden while in the sunshine state this afternoon."

If Joe Biden gets in, your Second Amendment is gone."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And the battleground brawl is starting to ramp up, too. With President Trump closing the gap with Biden on some coveted swing states, Politico is noting that, quote, \"while national polls have generated a portrait of Biden holding a commanding lead, it's something of a mirage. In the swing states of matter, it is trench warfare. Biden's advantage, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average is within the margin of error in half of the eight states. And Trump is a president whose support has been notoriously difficult for pollsters to survey.\" So Juan, I think that -- I would like to go to you first to just talk about the fact that we are two months away. Where do you see the state of the race at this time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I tend to break it down pretty much in binary terms, Dana. You know, who would you rather be as you start the sprint to the finish line? Would you rather be a guy who is having money trouble at the moment and seems to have spent money early on, and now is having to pull as in key states like Michigan? Or would you rather be someone who just raised a record amount of money in the month of August? Would you rather be someone who dealing with -- allegedly making derogatory statements about, you know, our war dead, or would you rather be someone who sent his son to battle, you know, under the American flag? So I think that if you look at it in those terms and you look at the big poll numbers. As you say, it's tight in some states. But even in the swing states, the majority of the swing states now favor Biden. And you have a number of states like Arizona that previously would have been thought to being the Republican calm (ph) and now look pretty good. So, you know, you always have to give the advantage to the incumbent. But I would say right now, you know, as we start the sprint, as you put it, Dana. I would rather be Biden than Trump."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And the NBC Marist poll today, Jesse, it showed something I think the Trump campaign would probably be very happy with, a tie at 48-48, and then an increase in support from 2016 to now with Hispanic voters from about 35 percent in 2016 to 50 percent in 2020. So that's quite a significant change. And also, just the look and feel of the campaign, like, the president's on the road, he's there. He's at a beautiful stop there in Jupiter, Florida. He's making big announcements, including one about oil drilling off the coast. So when Juan says he you would rather be Biden than Trump at this point, I'm assuming you have different point of view."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So Biden is playing basketball and he's just four corners. He's just trying to run out the clock. Trump's full-court press, he is fast break, he's aggressive. Biden's on the defense. Take a look at the Florida poll, NBC. They have it tied. It's un-skewed. That's a poll that they actually have the breakdown reflecting the 2016 exit polls. And Biden is losing Hispanics. Trump is doing much better with Cubans in Venezuelans, has a little bit more work to do with Puerto Ricans in the Orlando area. But the president will win Florida, I can guarantee you that. Look at how he's doing in North Carolina over-performing with plaques (ph), his push for charter schools. School choice is really paying off. And now, according to East Carolina University, he's up two points there. If I'm Joe Biden, I'm nervous, because right now, Donald Trump is within the margin of error in every single battleground state. You talk to the Trump campaign. They're pretty confident. I don't think the Biden campaign is that confident. If you want to look at numbers, the Republicans are out- registering Democrats by massive margins. In Florida, (Inaudible) by 450,000, North Carolina, 230,000, Pennsylvania, 150,000, the president's approval rate in Rasmussen right now is at 51 percent. Democrats very nervous about that, because at this stage in the re-election for Barack Obama in Rasmussen, he was at 48 percent, got re- elected. Bush was at 51 percent at Rasmussen at this point, got re-elected. I think these raises dead-even with the president having a slight edge. And right now, I'd rather be President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "All right. And Greg, I'm -- obviously, Greg, you can talk about whatever you want. But I do want to you see if you had thought anything about -- you see these videos of Joe Biden doing Q and A with some people over Zoom, but apparently, possibly, you know, reading his responses from a teleprompter."

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "How dare he read from a teleprompter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "It's not so much the reading. It's that -- it just -- he looks like he's out of gas even when he wakes up in the morning. And it is kind of like when you drive a lemon off the lot and it doesn't make it to the highway. That's how it kind of feels. But this is -- we talked about the polls. And I think this is the toughest election in recent memory since 2016. To poll, because it's the first time in media and the Democrats and pop culture in general has painted a rather large target on the back of a group of voters, them being Trump voters, which forces them into the shadows. So when you talk about shy voters, we are only undercounting Trump voters. People are only lying that they're voting for Joe. They aren't lying voting for Trump, because why would you vote? Why would you lie about something that would get you abused? That's like going to the doctor and telling him that you are smoking more, you know? No, no, no, when you are going to lie to you doctor, you're going to tell him that you've lost weight and that you're -- you cut your smoking in half. So there's a really simple experiment for the media to do. Go to a Trump event in a Biden shirt, then go to a Biden event in a Trump shirt and compare and contrast and see how people treat you. Lastly, to the derogatory story in the Atlantic. I need to comment on that. You need to have an anonymous story like that when there is an economic recovery, a jobs recovery, and hopefully a strong path to corral COVID, which I think is happening. So you need stuff like this. But the funniest thing about the Atlantic story and this upcoming Michael Cohen book, they're like a farmer's almanac that tells you the weather that already happened, right? So wait a second. You are telling me that Trump says offensive things in public? Oh, my god, what do we do? We've only known that for four years, maybe even longer than that. And lastly, for the journalists out there, let's come up with a real definition of what confirmation means, because confirmation of an unproven allegation from a source isn't a confirmation of fact. It's a confirmation of an unproven allegation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "All right. Let me ask you about this, Emily. There's this other factor in North Carolina where the polls are tightening perhaps. But I think Republicans are a little bit more stressed out about the fact that when it comes to early voting and absentee ballot requests, the Democrats have astronomical advantages on that point. And early voting is already underway. So, you know, obviously -- talk about whatever you want. But I do think that there is some making up to do, at least on that front."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I agree with that, Dana. And here's what I wanted to focus on since I'm going last today. I wanted to be the caveat caller here on the panel. Because in these battleground states that will determine the election, it is a three-point race with only two months to go. And we all remember in 2016 when Trump was behind in Pennsylvania at this time by two points, behind by three points in Michigan and seven points in Wisconsin. And obviously, he won all three. So I think the national media is obviously focusing on national polls. And some state polls have suspect voter polls. Just the Florida -- one that you were mentioning on, that was an interesting skewed toward Republican voter makeup. And it only interviewed 138 Hispanics. So I think we should sort of take a step back and understand that polls at this point are not going to reflect necessarily the mood and the preferences of the electorate, especially when we are waiting for a COVID stimulus coming out. There's obviously a lot of unrest in urban environments and that mail-in voting, Dana that you touched on, that's going to play a huge part."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Wait. There's violence, who knew? I guess now that it's in a campaign ad, you'll finally see it on CNN and MSNBC. Of course, if Biden wins, the violence will vanish. Talk about extortion. Elect me or you are dead. But it's also based on ridding something they kept denying. The Dems kept saying the widespread brutality was fantasy. They pushed it as mostly peaceful, as statistically, that's OK. But how good would you feel if you were told your parachute is mostly safe? But now, they have read the polls in they see that they were wrong. It's the only language they respect. But remove their lies and you see the real of these police incidents, drugs, mental illness, non-compliance. It exists across all races. A mind on drugs are plagued by illness will not comply, and the police require compliance. It is that incompatibility that the media and Dems turned into fodder for unrest. And now boxed in, they must blame Trump. Of course, we could remind them Trump offered help, but that acceptance would be cooperating with orange man bad. If Wheeler had shelved his ego and taken Trump's help early on, that Trump supporter would be alive as well as many other people. Instead, they sheltered behind denials until the polls force them to emerge, finally, to survey the damage done. It wasn't just Joe in the basement. It's the whole party. They hid from the hell until it was time to campaign, which answers that great philosophical question. If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there but Democrats, does it make a sound, unless it's Trump's fault, no. All right, Jesse, it seems like Joe wants his cake and eat it too, a phrase I just came up with. He condemns Antifa, but he says it's Trump's fault for the violence. That is not a coherent strategy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Right now, riots are number -- the three issue among voters. They've supplanted the Coronavirus, economy and healthcare one and two. So Joe's playing catch up little bit. You know, it's a slick ad. I don't think anyone's going to believe it. It's a lot of money to spend on national cable to defend yourself. It seems like he has to have other people defend himself because he can't get his message out because all he's doing is reading what's in a teleprompter that his staff puts up. It looks like he wants to be the reader of the free world. Right now, I don't know. Biden's saying that Donald Trump wants to defund the police, and I see where he gets it. He said it's in the budget. I looked at the budget. And under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the cops program, community policing, was funded at about 200 million a year, under Donald Trump, funded about 300 million a year. So this is another lie, and I caught him lying."

Portland has seen the resignation of over 100 officers in the last six months. Dozens more are looking for other jobs. And keep in mind. This is against the backdrop of their eliminating the background units. So these vacant positions aren't being filled. So it's not as if there are new people that are filling these positions. I think the bottom line is that condemnation means nothing without policy and action. And that is where that ad falls flat. It's also ironic to me that Biden is calling for a fresh start when electing him would literally be resurrecting the crypt keeper that was on the Hill for the last 70 years. But let's take Portland back for a second. There, the mayor and the governor, have said that they want an end to the violence and the agitation. But that law enforcement there, they are still handcuffed. There are still active restraining orders in place by the courts preventing them from using teargas, pepper spray, LRADs, sound speakers, unless it's in certain specific situations. So again, it's words without backing it up with a policy to actually help. The only way, by the way -- the only reason, by the way, that the mayor and the governor came out decrying it was because the not-small businesses came out in that area, saying that they were going to leave.

And I know lots of people on the Democratic side say it's not a choice selection. It's a referendum on Trump. But if you think about it, it's really, you know, who votes for evil. So I think it's like there's no real choice here. It's implicit in the ad. A condemnation of Trump as, in fact, you know, causing darkness, violence, division in American society, unsettling, chaotic kind of governance. And I think that's what comes through to people.

There are people in the country who are saying we just need a circuit breaker. We need, like, a break to the chaos in whatever way that the see it. Now, both sides, Trump is trying to explain how he sees the violence and how Democratic mayors and governors have let this get out of control. Biden is saying but you're president, so it's happening on your watch. What I don't hear is from Biden and Kamala Harris is how it would end or be different on their watch.

That's probably going to -- hate the word, trigger some people. However, I also think that this is a really good time to say let's get the schools open. Let's figure out a way to get these kids back in the classroom. You hear nightmare stories all across the country, little kids crying because they can't figure out how to handle all the different Zoom things. You need that interaction with teachers and with your fellow students. And this week, Mitch McConnell and the U.S. Senate Republicans are going to put forward a very targeted coronavirus relief bill. It has money for schools, $100 billion. And if the Democrats don't want to vote for that, they're going to have to explain why they would just wait and do like -- try to do a huge bill rather than this bill that would have money for contact tracing, figure out a way to get kids tested if they needed, maybe some cleaning supplies, if that's what the school districts decided.

My twin started school today. And they go in and there's a kind of a temperature thermometer that you walk through, and they test you, and they all have to wear masks, and then there's dividers on the desks for separation, and they get a little outside time to loosen up and they can take their masks off outside.

This pandemic, to your point, though, is an opportunity for change in innovation, because it won't be the last pandemic, right? If we'll be lucky, there will be more pandemics because that means we survive this one. But we know it's going to happen as long as the earth exists. So, this should be the time that we experiment with prototypes and start creating rules, some loose rules to define what the experience is like. Maybe you have a very sparse background when you're -- when you're doing Zoom. You don't have distractions. You don't have toys; you don't have anything there. It should be devoid of distraction. And maybe teachers don't have to see you all the time. Maybe you just check-in. I will use Peloton again as an example. None of the instructors can see me working out or Dana working out because all they see are the little -- their little lesson. Meanwhile, we could be wearing anything we want.

And they get to set the prices, but more importantly, they get to treat the customer like crap, because you don't have any competition, right? Well, California is a monopoly in its mindset. It's a singular left-wing orthodoxy that sets the punitive taxes and sets the punitive policies and the customer i.e. the citizen in California is screwed. So what do you do with monopolies? You break them up. California needs to be broken up so that they're -- the smart areas of the country can govern themselves. Orange County, for example, they don't need to be hooked up with Marin County. You don't need to be dragged down by those idiots.

I don't think it's that bad at least in the short term. It's the long-term problem for California that, as you just touched on, the grid issue in particular. Part of the other thing is that you have all of these fires. And one of the problems that California is left to talk about is climate change. What happens when you have massive forest fires that burn two million acres of forest? It throws a whole bunch of carbon up into the atmosphere. And that's all happening on public lands. The private landowners are the ones who are actually, you know, replanting, figuring out a way to be responsible and be smart with their forests. The public lands are not being taken care of.

Here's a little video of him cuddling her."

And then with their whole family, including rye Rye-Rye -- Rye-Rye is the older brother. He's only two and a half. He's having a little hard time with this new family member, but he'll come around.

Here I am having fun with my granddaughter who's wearing her Coronavirus mask. But the trip I got to tell you, guys, was really about being on the water. Here's my wife finding blue crabs in the crab trap. And here's my granddaughter, both of them, Pepper and Wesley, fishing with their first fishing rods. And here's my grandson Eli trying to get the fish to bite. And here's my daughter, as you know, one of the leaders of the National Park Trust making closing arguments for the fish to come on up and get in her trap. So, while all that was going on, I was just sitting on the porch relaxing. Labor Day fun."

I don't know who has but I'm not saying it because I don't want to embarrass them. But some police officer was serving papers but it got interrupted. Look who interrupted the paper serve. That's right. The goat broke into a police officer's vehicle and destroyed the paper. So now, one lucky person will not be served papers today. And that's why the good is the greatest of all time."
