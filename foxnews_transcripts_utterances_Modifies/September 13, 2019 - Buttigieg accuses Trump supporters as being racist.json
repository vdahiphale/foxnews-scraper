      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington this Friday night. You're going to want to stay with us for the whole hour because we have debate recap unlike anything you've heard before with Mercedes Schlapp, Tom Bevan, Candace Owens, and a heck of a lot more. Plus we have Raymond Arroyo with a special debate version of Friday follies. I think we're going to hit Uncle Joe's chopper trouble. The Camela Islam standup routine, oh that was a stinker we got it all covered. Also tonight, two exclusions, first, famous Hollywood Actor walks away from the Democrat Party, the backlash fellow actors are giving him. Oh, that's been swift.  Isaiah Washington is here to tell us why he now supports Donald Trump. Plus an Anti-AOC, it's really an Anti-Socialism ad aired during last night's debate. It tore up the Internet. The woman behind the ad is here to respond to AOC and all of the rest of the critics. But first, the week that was. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\"  You can kind of feel it, right? The weather is changing. Fall is right around the corner. I'm talking about the fall of the Democrats. It's been a terrible, awful week for them, capped off by a miserable three-hour debate on ABC.  First, there are signs that the Democrats will give Trump a win. They didn't want to do this. But they're going to give Trump a win. And I think they're going to allow a vote on that U.S. MCA, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade deal. Even \"The Washington Post,\" almost fell over when I read this, said it's a no-brainer. Bring the thing up for a vote. Second reason it's been a bad week for the Democrats, the DOW is now up around 27,000, the S & P is at 3,000.  Well, that's near record territory for the DOW, up for the eighth straight day. Now, what does this indicate? Renewed optimism among consumers and businesses and this is important toward the close of this year. The President and his team, still open to a trade deal with China. A tight labor market here at home, that means wages continue - now see, a little bit of an uptick. That's all good news. I love a tight labor market. Third, the Democrats have absolutely no answer for Trump on the economy. Instead, what we heard at last night's debate with the same tired platitudes.",

But they just did not look like they were going to be able to stand on the stage and debate this President on his accomplishments because the Democrat candidate leading the pack still, after all of their efforts to take them down, could barely string together two coherent sentences.",

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "Well, he was no longer the Vice President but it felt good to say that, I'm sure. All of the Democrats on stage demonstrated in one way or the other that they're simply not competent to govern, even liberals know this isn't working. The lefty publication, \"Slate\" eviscerated Biden's answer on the question of reparations. And all \"Slate\" did was merely publish Biden's incoherent answer in full. And when ABC moderators raised the issue of trade, everyone on stage, except Andrew Yang, was caught stumbling or responded again with meaningless bromides.  They looked like they were kind of 7th graders shocked about a surprise question that their teacher dropped in on a history exam. Tell us about that. Elizabeth Warren, she said proudly that she's going to ban all fracking. Good luck winning Texas with that position, Liz.  Beto's gun buyback it's a gun ban just spelled differently. Not happening. And Bernie Sanders, he just always seemed angry. He kind of looks like he belongs to that Waldorf and Statler in the Muppets. That's a good look. All kidding aside, this is our future. This is our lives. This America, the money that everybody has earned, looked so hard to earn in the past few years, do I think Americans are going to turn that all over, all of those gangs, to, what Elizabeth Warren and her Green Raw New Deal or let Julian \"Let Them All In\" Castro throw open our country's borders? No way. Compare Trump's record of peace and prosperity to what will undoubtedly happen if one of the top Dem contenders wins. I have to say, I don't even think it's close. People who don't know a lot about politics are sure - they're absolutely sure that Trump's personality, his tweets, and his tone, it's all going to sink him.  He's too abrasive, he is too cocky. He swings at too many pitches, blah, blah, blah. All I'll say about that is a lot of people - they don't like Bill Belichick either. He's gruff. He doesn't smile much. But guess what, Belichick wins and wins and wins.   A lot of people do like them, especially when he wins. The truth is Obama really was a great politician. You've got to be honest about that. He was terrific. Captivated a crowd but none of the Dems running now really are. And I don't even think it's their fault, it's just not in their DNA, it's not in their skill set. What do these folks do? Well, Joe Biden should move on and may be write his memoir, tell old yarns about his life as a Senate or growing up as a young boy. Mayor Pete, he can actually just go back to South Bend and try to fix the horrible crime problem there. And then Elizabeth Warren, she can go back to the sequestered life on a college campus, maybe do some DNA research. Bernie Sander, he should just leave politics and run one of those free socialist circulars that get at the supermarket rails against corrupt local politicians, always stacked up.  And maybe Julian Castro can go assist migrant families at the borders a lot of work to be done there. And Corey Booker, he can start his own vegan YouTube channel, big business there. Amy Klobuchar she should go be a partner at some big booming law firm and start ordering associates around.  Kamala Harris, she would be a good President, at like a small liberal arts college or maybe she'd be a good local television anchor. I could see that. Beto O'Rourke should run a school of rock franchise. He has a lot of experience in that arena. But none of them, and I mean none of them should ever get close to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And that's \"The angle.\" The Democrat parade of idiocy last night was so spectacular, we felt compelled to bring back the Ingraham Awards. OK, joining me to present these prestigious awards and comments is Mercedes Schlapp, Senior Advisor to the Trump 2020 Campaign. She's live from CPAC West in Reno, Nevada, also here, is Tom Bevan, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Real Clear Politics.   All right, guys, great to see you on a Friday night. First up, okay, we're calling this is the Annie Grab Your Gun Award. And it goes to, Beto O'Rourke. Well, apparently he can't stand a man with a gun.",

MERCEDES SCHLAPP, SENIOR ADVISOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, it definitely won't win states like Texas, for example. And even today, speaking to several of the audience members in Nevada, you know, they had a very serious discussion on the 2nd amendment and the fact that especially in the rural counties of Nevada and certain states like New Mexico, that they're very concerned about the second amendment rights being violated.  Again, there is - there is this need to figure out how to deal with gun violence, absolutely. And the President has addressed this issue when it comes to figuring out how to deal with more extensive background checks. It's different when you're talking about taking away guns from law-abiding citizens. It absolutely violates our 2nd amendment rights. And it's incredibly troubling. While the base - the liberal base gets very excited about this and Beto is obviously trying to gain some points on the liberal side, I think when you look at common sense Americans are saying, wait a second, he's going way too far.",

You're no different from the bystander that is waiting on the blood to spill from a martyr.\" Joining me now exclusively is Isaiah Washington, host of the podcast \"Isaiah Washington Speaks Again.\" He's also the author of a book, \"A Man from Another Land.\" And he helped to create the new PAC Legacy Republicans.

And the irony is that I made a tweet on the 1st, April 1st, and then on April 2nd, Fox News decided to cherry-pick one of my tweets that implied that I was slamming 44 and supporting 45. Let me just make it perfectly clear. I am not one to be categorized. I'm not a Trump supporter, but I am a huge supporter of many people, over 60,000, that are Trump supporters. So what I mean by that, in the very fabric of my DNA, I have naturally been a protector and a liberator. I love this country. I'm a patriot. I'm former military. So I will say this.

Plus we have Raymond Arroyo with a special debate version of Friday follies. I think we're going to hit Uncle Joe's chopper trouble. The Camela Islam standup routine, oh that was a stinker we got it all covered. Also tonight, two exclusions, first, famous Hollywood Actor walks away from the Democrat Party, the backlash fellow actors are giving him. Oh, that's been swift. Isaiah Washington is here to tell us why he now supports Donald Trump. Plus an Anti-AOC, it's really an Anti-Socialism ad aired during last night's debate. It tore up the Internet. The woman behind the ad is here to respond to AOC and all of the rest of the critics. But first, the week that was. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" You can kind of feel it, right? The weather is changing. Fall is right around the corner. I'm talking about the fall of the Democrats. It's been a terrible, awful week for them, capped off by a miserable three-hour debate on ABC. First, there are signs that the Democrats will give Trump a win. They didn't want to do this. But they're going to give Trump a win. And I think they're going to allow a vote on that U.S. MCA, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade deal. Even \"The Washington Post,\" almost fell over when I read this, said it's a no-brainer. Bring the thing up for a vote. Second reason it's been a bad week for the Democrats, the DOW is now up around 27,000, the S & P is at 3,000. Well, that's near record territory for the DOW, up for the eighth straight day. Now, what does this indicate? Renewed optimism among consumers and businesses and this is important toward the close of this year. The President and his team, still open to a trade deal with China. A tight labor market here at home, that means wages continue - now see, a little bit of an uptick. That's all good news. I love a tight labor market. Third, the Democrats have absolutely no answer for Trump on the economy. Instead, what we heard at last night's debate with the same tired platitudes."

      "utterance": "Well, he was no longer the Vice President but it felt good to say that, I'm sure. All of the Democrats on stage demonstrated in one way or the other that they're simply not competent to govern, even liberals know this isn't working. The lefty publication, \"Slate\" eviscerated Biden's answer on the question of reparations. And all \"Slate\" did was merely publish Biden's incoherent answer in full. And when ABC moderators raised the issue of trade, everyone on stage, except Andrew Yang, was caught stumbling or responded again with meaningless bromides. They looked like they were kind of 7th graders shocked about a surprise question that their teacher dropped in on a history exam. Tell us about that. Elizabeth Warren, she said proudly that she's going to ban all fracking. Good luck winning Texas with that position, Liz. Beto's gun buyback it's a gun ban just spelled differently. Not happening. And Bernie Sanders, he just always seemed angry. He kind of looks like he belongs to that Waldorf and Statler in the Muppets. That's a good look. All kidding aside, this is our future. This is our lives. This America, the money that everybody has earned, looked so hard to earn in the past few years, do I think Americans are going to turn that all over, all of those gangs, to, what Elizabeth Warren and her Green Raw New Deal or let Julian \"Let Them All In\" Castro throw open our country's borders? No way. Compare Trump's record of peace and prosperity to what will undoubtedly happen if one of the top Dem contenders wins. I have to say, I don't even think it's close. People who don't know a lot about politics are sure - they're absolutely sure that Trump's personality, his tweets, and his tone, it's all going to sink him. He's too abrasive, he is too cocky. He swings at too many pitches, blah, blah, blah. All I'll say about that is a lot of people - they don't like Bill Belichick either. He's gruff. He doesn't smile much. But guess what, Belichick wins and wins and wins. A lot of people do like them, especially when he wins. The truth is Obama really was a great politician. You've got to be honest about that. He was terrific. Captivated a crowd but none of the Dems running now really are. And I don't even think it's their fault, it's just not in their DNA, it's not in their skill set. What do these folks do? Well, Joe Biden should move on and may be write his memoir, tell old yarns about his life as a Senate or growing up as a young boy. Mayor Pete, he can actually just go back to South Bend and try to fix the horrible crime problem there. And then Elizabeth Warren, she can go back to the sequestered life on a college campus, maybe do some DNA research. Bernie Sander, he should just leave politics and run one of those free socialist circulars that get at the supermarket rails against corrupt local politicians, always stacked up. And maybe Julian Castro can go assist migrant families at the borders a lot of work to be done there. And Corey Booker, he can start his own vegan YouTube channel, big business there. Amy Klobuchar she should go be a partner at some big booming law firm and start ordering associates around. Kamala Harris, she would be a good President, at like a small liberal arts college or maybe she'd be a good local television anchor. I could see that. Beto O'Rourke should run a school of rock franchise. He has a lot of experience in that arena. But none of them, and I mean none of them should ever get close to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And that's \"The angle.\" The Democrat parade of idiocy last night was so spectacular, we felt compelled to bring back the Ingraham Awards. OK, joining me to present these prestigious awards and comments is Mercedes Schlapp, Senior Advisor to the Trump 2020 Campaign. She's live from CPAC West in Reno, Nevada, also here, is Tom Bevan, Co-Founder and Executive Director of Real Clear Politics. All right, guys, great to see you on a Friday night. First up, okay, we're calling this is the Annie Grab Your Gun Award. And it goes to, Beto O'Rourke. Well, apparently he can't stand a man with a gun."

MERCEDES SCHLAPP, SENIOR ADVISOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Well, it definitely won't win states like Texas, for example. And even today, speaking to several of the audience members in Nevada, you know, they had a very serious discussion on the 2nd amendment and the fact that especially in the rural counties of Nevada and certain states like New Mexico, that they're very concerned about the second amendment rights being violated. Again, there is - there is this need to figure out how to deal with gun violence, absolutely. And the President has addressed this issue when it comes to figuring out how to deal with more extensive background checks. It's different when you're talking about taking away guns from law-abiding citizens. It absolutely violates our 2nd amendment rights. And it's incredibly troubling. While the base - the liberal base gets very excited about this and Beto is obviously trying to gain some points on the liberal side, I think when you look at common sense Americans are saying, wait a second, he's going way too far."

So I guess we can say in liberal land, he's evolved on this issue but what a wild message from someone from Texas.

And you know, I think it's again these second-tier candidates that aren't really breaking through. And Pete hasn't really offered a vision, many of these Democrats, they haven't offered a vision of how they want to move forward and help America grow. Especially, from the terms of what you said earlier, from an economic standpoint. So I thought that the exchange it was bizarre between the two of them.

They all kind of - even the ones on the stage were giggling and laughing about it. It didn't go over well among even left wing folks on Twitter.

He gave out the wrong information. But what's more interesting is he was snide. Biden turns around. He's not sure about what he said. What did he say? And then Bernie tells him what he said. And you suddenly see Biden gets annoyed. And you can see in this area, right around the brow area, that furrows and his face tightens up, the mouth gets really tight. And then he pivots his entire body weight to show that he's shutting him down. And interestingly enough, Biden is usually the one that pivots towards individuals so watching him pivot away was a strong suggestion that he's not having this."

      "utterance": "Yes. So this is really quick this was interesting. When you see Biden initially, when somebody smiles like that, when they've been asked a hot-button question. When they smile that way, what they're doing is demonstrating a cover-up. So they don't want to show you the true emotion which probably frustration or anger, so they cover it up with a smile. The second thing he does is he strokes his microphone a little bit. That's called the displacement activity. And what that does is it allows him to feel in control for a brief few seconds, just until he gets himself back in to speed."

      "utterance": "The woman behind that anti-AOC socialism ad is Republican activist Elizabeth Heng, the daughter of Cambodian refugees who fled communism. AOC wasn't thrilled about the ad, as you can imagine. She tweeted in response, \"Know that this wasn't an ad for young conservatives of color. That was the pretense. What you watched was a love letter to the GOP's white supremacist case.\" Here to respond is Elizabeth Heng, former congressional candidate and executive director of New Faces GOP PAC. All right, Elizabeth, well, AOC says this was a love letter to white supremacists. You don't look like a white supremacist. You are yourself are a minority. But does she have a point? Do you have to have her self-immolating in flames there?"

      "utterance": "I'm not going to get in a debate, especially with the name calling, with a -- with a member of Congress. I put the ad on there because I wanted to have a real discussion about what true socialism is in this country, and have her defend the ideology which she continues to promote. Yet, instead of actually having a real policy debate, she insults me with name calling and a number of other areas."

      "utterance": "Omar says it should be pulled from the air. Maybe you can reach out to her and see if she'll actually have a conversation with you, or maybe have some kind of forum on, I don't know, defending the tenets of socialism. But Ilhan Omar obviously very controversial herself rallying to the side of fellow squad member AOC here. So they're all rallying. Rashida Tlaib, all of them are coming to her defense. And this is after of course they all throw around the phrase \"white supremacist\" like it's nothing. As my mother used to say, they can dish it out, but they can't take it. They can dish out the worst pejorative about people because they disagree with them, but the moment you prick their little trial balloon, they start to scream foul. I'm not buying the damsel in distress routine from the squad."

      "speaker": "HENG",

So instead of defending the policy stances that they continue to push of these big socialist ideologies, they resort to throwing -- calling people racist and sexist and all these other things, instead of actually talking about what the real policy -- instead of actually talking about what and defending the arguments that they continue to have."

It's never worked around the world. Variants haven't, the real deal hasn't work. It's never worked. It has led to heart ache and the superrich and the super poor. It's never led to anything else."

And so that's why I want to highlight this during the Democrat presidential debate in hopes that it would go viral so we could begin to educate young people and have a discussion of truly what this has done throughout the world, not just in Cambodia, but in Venezuela, in Cuba, North Korea, China, in Russia, because we're not learning this in our education system. And this is forcing discussion."
