And among those, you have two convicted child sex offenders of 18th Street Gang member, it's an everyday situation along the border. Meantime, in our latest polls, you see an uptick in the favorability of building U.S.-Mexico border wall now from December of 2019. And then on the job approval, as we mentioned at the top of the show, when it comes to foreign policy, and immigration, border security and immigration, these are the items in President Biden's job performance, where he is underwater, upside down, his overall approval ratings above 50%. But these are the draws the Achilles heels. Let's bring in our panel, Bill McGurn columnist for The Wall Street Journal, Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post, and Jonah Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Dispatch. Jonah, you don't see a ton of coverage about the border, other than us and a few other places, but not a lot. And it seems like it's just increasing.",

So just looking at it in a narrow political sense, I assume the Biden administration figures that they can get to July, without too much more blowback, they'll be fine. But as for the root causes, the root causes are the same as they have been for the last 30 odd years, which is that life in Central America is substantially poor and more violent than life in the United States. People want to leave Central America and try their luck for a better life in the United States. And we should finally, rationally manage our laws to facilitate that with the -- in the most humane, and least costly and most beneficial way for our country. And one way I've written about that, I think would be a very good idea would be to extend the legal immigration opportunities for guest workers from Central America, not just Mexico, so that they can come here to do seasonal labor, which is what many of them end up doing and then return to their homes. And then all the other enforcement we do would be on a stronger, more legitimate footing.",

Look, as far as I can see, the Biden approach is See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and dump it on Kamala who has wisely steered clear of going to the border, why would you go when they're not doing anything to fix the problem? So what I can see is, the limited effort is to try to build spaces to accommodate people, which is a zero sum game, they just can't do it fast enough. I think they should -- they need to admit they made some mistakes. I mean, we had these agreements with Central American countries. And I also I agree, Chuck, this sense, the real solution for all of this is Congress, and to come to some kind of deal. And that means given take on both sides to have it. Because what we have now is not a rational system. It's not designed to facilitate an orderly process. It invites cats (ph). And it's just one aspect of a lot of our immigration system that's corrupted. I'll say one last thing about guest workers. I actually agree with Chuck, but I think it'd be better to open more opportunities for guest workers. But that's anathema to a lot of people, because they're not really voters. A lot of people would want to come here work, feed their families and go home. And I don't see why don't -- why we don't make more opportunities for that.",

Democrats have an agenda about immigration that has a lot to do with padding voter rolls. Republicans are a hot mess on all sorts of different ways about all of this. I'm with these guys. I think guest worker programs do not scare me. I think rationalizing labor markets as labor markets makes a lot of sense.

And when you have number that high, having skepticism, we haven't paid the full price, in the sense of its effects, which could be inflation, slowing the economy and so forth. I think he's treading in dangerous areas on this for a simple reason. I don't think it's going to work. Does anyone think the government's ability to get things done like create this Nirvana with their green union jobs, left and right, you know, no more gasoline and so forth, and no cost to anyone? Does it anyone really believe that's going to come apart? We couldn't even get the shovel ready projects the last time around.

And that's exactly what they're arguing over on the Hill. And it's very uncertain. Exactly how much of that will be enacted into law and how soon and so on and so forth. I do believe, though, that the President has so clearly laid down a marker in favor of this large expansion of the government and mind you President Trump wasn't exactly a deficit cutter himself, that he will, you know, if indeed, he runs for reelection, that will be one of the major sort of signature changes in his term that he will be held accountable for whether it, you know, works out or whether it doesn't.",

And then all of a sudden, they have this window of opportunity. And so, like almost every president the last 30 years before him, they're wildly overreaching. And there is a cautionary tale here for Republicans at the beginning of the Trump administration. There were a lot of Republicans who said, in effect deficits don't matter.

      "utterance": "Well, we'll see what happens. I guess I don't agree with Jonah in the sense that, you know, typically in the summer when the temperature spike, the flow of migrants slows down. So just looking at it in a narrow political sense, I assume the Biden administration figures that they can get to July, without too much more blowback, they'll be fine. But as for the root causes, the root causes are the same as they have been for the last 30 odd years, which is that life in Central America is substantially poor and more violent than life in the United States. People want to leave Central America and try their luck for a better life in the United States. And we should finally, rationally manage our laws to facilitate that with the -- in the most humane, and least costly and most beneficial way for our country. And one way I've written about that, I think would be a very good idea would be to extend the legal immigration opportunities for guest workers from Central America, not just Mexico, so that they can come here to do seasonal labor, which is what many of them end up doing and then return to their homes. And then all the other enforcement we do would be on a stronger, more legitimate footing."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, look, I agree, there are a lot of different policy solutions, but you can't have a policy solution when you have an administration that denies there's a problem. Look, as far as I can see, the Biden approach is See No Evil, Hear No Evil, and dump it on Kamala who has wisely steered clear of going to the border, why would you go when they're not doing anything to fix the problem? So what I can see is, the limited effort is to try to build spaces to accommodate people, which is a zero sum game, they just can't do it fast enough. I think they should -- they need to admit they made some mistakes. I mean, we had these agreements with Central American countries. And I also I agree, Chuck, this sense, the real solution for all of this is Congress, and to come to some kind of deal. And that means given take on both sides to have it. Because what we have now is not a rational system. It's not designed to facilitate an orderly process. It invites cats (ph). And it's just one aspect of a lot of our immigration system that's corrupted. I'll say one last thing about guest workers. I actually agree with Chuck, but I think it'd be better to open more opportunities for guest workers. But that's anathema to a lot of people, because they're not really voters. A lot of people would want to come here work, feed their families and go home. And I don't see why don't -- why we don't make more opportunities for that."

      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",

But instead, what we have is a bipartisan consensus to tolerate incoherence and chaos, which fuels further cynicism and distrust on both sides. Democrats have an agenda about immigration that has a lot to do with padding voter rolls. Republicans are a hot mess on all sorts of different ways about all of this. I'm with these guys. I think guest worker programs do not scare me. I think rationalizing labor markets as labor markets makes a lot of sense. But no one has the incentive structure in Congress to address any of this, whether you call it comprehensively or something else in a sane and rational matter."

And so that means our budget deficits are going to explode. This is reckless. This is not leadership. This is not the thing that many of these voters who voted for Joe Biden were actually looking for. And so, it's incumbent upon Congress to come up with our own budget that actually makes sense for the American people, not this lunacy coming out of the White House."

Optimistic 51% in our latest poll about the U.S. economy. And you can see where that stands. But the question about the Biden administrations increasing government spending specifically, when asked about that too much 47%. And that number, again, about right 33%. I'm back with the panel. Bill, your thoughts on this budget and where we are?"

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm generally a person that thinks there's too much of the government. But you know, the proportions of what Joe Biden are doing in peacetime are just extraordinary. We have an editorial that just went up at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__wsj.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=YbNy72ndRks1yxk-EUkJYYp_vbi_8q7Jxg-mlIRd4mo&s=Q3qxCON1IIQiCVshGWdHEnDr4fvkdmR30QYunQpkEjA&e= . But this is an extraordinary development. And when you have number that high, having skepticism, we haven't paid the full price, in the sense of its effects, which could be inflation, slowing the economy and so forth. I think he's treading in dangerous areas on this for a simple reason. I don't think it's going to work. Does anyone think the government's ability to get things done like create this Nirvana with their green union jobs, left and right, you know, no more gasoline and so forth, and no cost to anyone? Does it anyone really believe that's going to come apart? We couldn't even get the shovel ready projects the last time around. So the answer is to greatly an exponentially increase the spending, I don't see it."

That's going to happen again. Don't forget that all this big headline number in this plan includes a bunch of stuff he's already announced, the American Rescue Plan, the American Families Plan. And that's exactly what they're arguing over on the Hill. And it's very uncertain. Exactly how much of that will be enacted into law and how soon and so on and so forth. I do believe, though, that the President has so clearly laid down a marker in favor of this large expansion of the government and mind you President Trump wasn't exactly a deficit cutter himself, that he will, you know, if indeed, he runs for reelection, that will be one of the major sort of signature changes in his term that he will be held accountable for whether it, you know, works out or whether it doesn't."

You have there are a bunch of historians who have a lot to answer for because they all whispered in Joe Biden's ear, you can be the next FDR, you can do a new deal. He didn't come into office with that plan. He didn't think he was going to control the Senate. He thought he's going to have to negotiate with Mitch McConnell. And then all of a sudden, they have this window of opportunity. And so, like almost every president the last 30 years before him, they're wildly overreaching. And there is a cautionary tale here for Republicans at the beginning of the Trump administration. There were a lot of Republicans who said, in effect deficits don't matter. We can do national industrial policy and all these things. And this proves that at least aspirationally Republicans can never outbid Democrats when it comes to spending."
