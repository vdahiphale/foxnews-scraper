It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Our tough on terror president refusing to be politically correct while our national security is at stake, you heard him refer to the Manhattan truck terror suspect as an animal yesterday, threatened to throw him in Gitmo. Now, he's calling for an even tougher punishment for the slaughter of 8 deaths. This morning tweeting, would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo, but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system. There's also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. Death penalty. This afternoon, we heard more from President Trump on the flawed immigration program that allowed the jihadi suspect into our country.",

A criminal complaint says he confessed to planning the bike path attack about a year ago. Then, on October 22nd, rented the truck he used for a dry run. Investigators have discovered several pieces of evidence linking Saipov to ISIS. Cell phones recovered at the scene contain mounds of ISIS propaganda, some showing awful things, beheadings and the use of trucks as weapons, also a note pledging allegiance to ISIS. Now authorities also say the married father of three had previous contact with terror suspects known to the FBI. So Jesse, you see this guy come in to court in a wheelchair, he's shackled there. He wants an ISIS flag in his room. But at this point, do we really know how the legal system is going to deal with him? Do you have any idea, you know, what's the next step?",

And the amount of videos that he had from ISIS, and beheading on his cellphone, just underscore that these tech giants need to be much more aggressive in eliminating this type of radical propaganda. They can build algorithms. They can hire more people. They can make some sort of team effort to get over there and really do some better investigative stuff, because this stuff is just so prevalent. I don't know why you can continue to have that stuff online.  And I think political correctness potentially played a lot, a big role in this deadly attack if you think about the NYPD surveillance program that was going on. I believe the mosque that he was going to was under surveillance until de Blasio and the ACLU ripped that away. The neighbor, I think, Greg alluded to in the last segment, Batista had seen this guy in an empty U-Haul with some buddies making little dry runs with nothing in the back of the van, several times in the neighborhood, didn't say anything. Reminds me of the San Bernardino neighbor, also didn't say anything. Political correctness kills.  An Imam reportedly had been trying to get in touch with de Blasio for an entire year, saying he'd noticed an uptick of radicalism in certain areas in the Manhattan area. Had reached out to him on social media, actually had written hard letters, and had sent staff to de Blasio's staff to try to alert him. No response there. And just the lottery system just doesn't make sense to me. We shouldn't be running our immigration system based on a lottery system. You don't have parties based on a lottery system.

And Greg, Elizabeth Warren on CNN today said she does agree that the election at the DNC was rigged in favor of the Clintons.

Now, he's calling for an even tougher punishment for the slaughter of 8 deaths. This morning tweeting, would love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo, but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system. There's also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. Death penalty.

As ill-advised as it might be, he's reflecting the frustration and the anger of his constituents. He's acting exactly like we would.

So talking about Gitmo is useless on this particular case. I would if he captures enemy combatants on the battlefield. Take them to Gitmo. I see no problem with that.

So, you know I was listening to Greg, and I think just like Dana said, you know, Greg's right. You know, it's like one of us is in the White House and somebody says, oh, you know, there's a threat to the herd and we say go get them to the shepherd, go get them. We don't like that mean old wolf. And in this case, that's what Trump is behaving like. He's not behaving, as Dana said, like the commander in chief, like the leader of the flock who would in some way say here are our rules. Here is how we have survived as a nation. A constitutional based republic for so long is because we're a nation of laws. And we understand how despicable this character is, but guess what, we have a system that can handle it and put it in place. Instead, he derided our own justice system. It's unbelievable."

He wanted to die by suicide by cop, which is why he has those two bogus guns. He was hoping to die. He wanted to be a martyr. I'm actually with Senator Lindsey Graham on this, who's a military lawyer for 33 years and thinks we should tried him as an enemy combatant and send to some place like Gitmo. I guarantee if you polled detainees at Gitmo, they would rather die than be there. So I think we actually give this guy what he wants if he gets the death penalty. I think there's an argument to be made that we are at war with ISIS. This guy is a terrorist. He's with armed with ISIS against the United States, and he's an enemy combatant and should be treated as such."

These guys -- as soon as you join ISIS, you're no longer an American. You're no longer a permanent resident of the United States, and you deserve to rot in hell in Gitmo."

Because you think back there was an interesting piece in the Wall Street Journal editorial this morning defending the diversity program that President Trump is so critical of that diversity visa program. And in the piece the Journal editorial writers talked about how the Tsarnaev brothers, the ones who did the Boston bombing, the younger brother, they were really transitioned into ISIS followers as children. So they were here and then they radicalized while in the U.S. Or Omar Mateen, the Orlando club bomber, he was an American-born citizen. Syed Farooq, the San Bernardino guy, U.S. born. His wife was the immigrant. So the question is, you know, how do you revoke someone from being an American citizen?"

If you pledge your allegiance to ISIS, if you take up arms against the United States in the name of ISIS, as evidenced by what this guy shouted when he got out of the car, we know by the note that he left, he is a member of ISIS. That is what drove him to do that. That in his radical extremist ideology that you should no longer be considered a United States citizen. I guarantee most Americans agree with me."

So we have to change it for the future. It may not work now in the past. What I would do is the piece of information here -- he's married with three kids. So here's a theme with a family. And I said this before yesterday, and Terry has brought this up and people -- he's not really a lone wolf if you've got family. So if the family -- if you say your family is going to suffer, we're sending your family back if you do this, that directly affects the community in which these suspects, the people that you have suspicion on, live. And it forces people -- forces family members to say, well, what he's doing is directly affecting our lives. So if people know -- maybe if a person knows that their families at risk, then they might not do it, or maybe the family might act on it."

So now, I'm listening to you and I'm thinking to myself, you know, in our tradition we don't say that the sins of the father should be visited on the child. And when you have a situation like that, I think it was Jason Chaffetz who said to us yesterday, in Israel, this is what happens. If you have this problem, you know, they raise the Palestinian house and the family, right? But we don't do that. We don't say to somebody committed a terrible crime here in the United States."

We would not do that to an armed robber take his family. But this is war. And in war, you have to change the rules. And the rules here is nothing really working in preventing these things, except like we don't know what's being prevented because it's behind the scenes. In this case, a tool which is the targeting family and say this family -- we're not hurting the family, but you're leaving. You're all going. That isn't -- that's something new."

A criminal complaint says he confessed to planning the bike path attack about a year ago. Then, on October 22nd, rented the truck he used for a dry run. Investigators have discovered several pieces of evidence linking Saipov to ISIS. Cell phones recovered at the scene contain mounds of ISIS propaganda, some showing awful things, beheadings and the use of trucks as weapons, also a note pledging allegiance to ISIS. Now authorities also say the married father of three had previous contact with terror suspects known to the FBI. So Jesse, you see this guy come in to court in a wheelchair, he's shackled there. He wants an ISIS flag in his room. But at this point, do we really know how the legal system is going to deal with him? Do you have any idea, you know, what's the next step?"

And the amount of videos that he had from ISIS, and beheading on his cellphone, just underscore that these tech giants need to be much more aggressive in eliminating this type of radical propaganda. They can build algorithms. They can hire more people. They can make some sort of team effort to get over there and really do some better investigative stuff, because this stuff is just so prevalent. I don't know why you can continue to have that stuff online. And I think political correctness potentially played a lot, a big role in this deadly attack if you think about the NYPD surveillance program that was going on. I believe the mosque that he was going to was under surveillance until de Blasio and the ACLU ripped that away. The neighbor, I think, Greg alluded to in the last segment, Batista had seen this guy in an empty U-Haul with some buddies making little dry runs with nothing in the back of the van, several times in the neighborhood, didn't say anything. Reminds me of the San Bernardino neighbor, also didn't say anything. Political correctness kills. An Imam reportedly had been trying to get in touch with de Blasio for an entire year, saying he'd noticed an uptick of radicalism in certain areas in the Manhattan area. Had reached out to him on social media, actually had written hard letters, and had sent staff to de Blasio's staff to try to alert him. No response there. And just the lottery system just doesn't make sense to me. We shouldn't be running our immigration system based on a lottery system. You don't have parties based on a lottery system. You invite people who you want to come in."

So there's couple of things the need to happen, obviously, it's difficult to take all these videos down. So they exist. But could we have counter videos, right? Like I'm looking for the Imam who was going to come out and he's going to be really charismatic, and he's going to tell all of these young men that this is a ticket straight to hell if they do that. The problem with the guys that don't say anything is that they make it even worse for their community. If one of the complaints is that there's not -- an ability to assimilate. Well, if you get further and further isolated in your community that is going to continue to happen. It's not American's fault. It's not the citizen's fault.

It fails to explain that the largest number of victims of radical Muslims are actually Muslims. So if we -- they're not killing the writers of commentary. They're going after Muslims. So if we didn't exist, if America didn't exist, this would still exist because the wrath of Islamism exists. It's a desire for supremacy no matter what. It's either obedience or death. So the fact is we have to treat this like -- even if we domed America right now, we've already have it here, so we have to treat it like a disease. Just like I said before, I don't understand why people watch The Walking Dead when you already have it all around you. This is really something that is unheard of in civilization where you have creatures roaming your country who want to kill people. This is a brain disease. It's a mission that they have.

And they said -- his opponent, Northam, was OK with sanctuary cities. So this Latino group comes out, and this is a return volley. And to use minority child actors as prey for a racist, truck-driving white male Gillespie supporter is so unprofessional, so inappropriate. And to have the aerial shot like it's a crime scene in progress. And you notice the decal of the \"Don't Tread on Me\" Tea Party thing and the Confederate flag, and then to sting out with the racist torch-holding Confederate supporters. The whole thing is just sickening. What I think's happening is -- would you imagine if Romney in 2012 came out within an ad of black gang member bicycle riding men menacing little white children in the neighborhood, with some rap music underneath and then maybe a Reverend Wright sound bite and then stinging out with \"Romney for president.\" That ad would be so denounced by every American in the country. This is the exact same thing but reversed. And it's sad, because big picture, Democrats would rather fight Trump than fight MS-13 or fight (AUDIO GAP).

And it was so despicable that even the mainstream media, both nationally and locally, had turned against our opponent. And that was really the change in tide of polling for our candidate, as well, because voters realize that that candidate went way too far. And so I agree with you, Jesse, where I actually think this will hurt Ralph Northam. And apparently, this was in response to the fact that he is not connecting with Hispanics to the degree -- I think he's even doing worse than Hillary Clinton was.

And Ed Gillespie is someone I've known for a very long time. He helped my son when my son was running as a Republican in the District of Columbia. They raised an amazing amount of money. So I know Ed and feel good about him. But let me just say that, when I go home on the weekends, I'm in that Virginia area, so I see the ads from this campaign. And Ed has run ads that suggest that MS-13 is all over Virginia. And it's like, \"Whoa, wait a second. We have problems with gangs, but it's not so pervasive.\" But guess what? It plays into this idea that immigration is somehow associated with the horrors of this gang. He runs an ad that says, \"Kill, rape, control,\" which is the MS-13 motto. He talks about \"our families, our heritage\" being threatened. And talk about identity politics. Sort of sounds like he's not talking to people who look like me, Greg."

Brazile wrote that she called Senator Sanders this past September with concern. Here's an excerpt. \"'Hello, Senator. I've completed my review of the DNC, and I did find the cancer.' I explained that the cancer was that she had exerted this control of the party long before she became its nominee. When I hung up the cult of Bernie, I started to cry.\" So this is Donna Brazile, full disclosure, a good friend of mine. Obviously, she's been in the news a lot, and she had her own problems during the 2016 election. But this is explosive. And Greg, Elizabeth Warren on CNN today said she does agree that the election at the DNC was rigged in favor of the Clintons.

They were two, in a weird way, identically fresh voices from the outside, even though Sanders has been in politics for a long time. But then Hillary, she stole the baton in a relay race and ran in the wrong direction. I mean, how -- this is what I don't understand. How come the Dems -- I would be -- I would hate her guts, because she elected Trump. They could -- they might have had a President Sanders. They might have had a president anybody other than Hillary.

They're hitting a ball, which is a round orb, which is basically symbolic of what we do to the planet Earth every day. Every day we hit planet Earth with our evil carbon bat. Then we circle the diamond, which is mined in third-world countries. Thank you very much. Perhaps to steel home, the same way we stole home from indigenous populations."

It's -- there you've got a corpse, and the toe tag says \"Trump.\" And it says, \"Make America Crip Again.\" Because we love our Crips. What I find interesting about this is obviously this is not very nice. But who cares? It's art. In his world, it's art, even though it's evil. What's interesting is he just started hosting a new game show on TBS. So he's got a game show on TBS, \"The Jokers Wild.\" It's a reboot of the classic show. And I'm just curious, like, what goes on in the TBS board meeting the next day when your game show host is advocating the assassination of a president. When your host is advocating the assassination of a president. Your host of a game show. How are you going to deal with that tomorrow morning? I want to know."
