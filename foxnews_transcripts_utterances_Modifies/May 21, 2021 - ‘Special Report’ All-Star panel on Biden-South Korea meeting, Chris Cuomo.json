First of all, this could have been in many ways a Mike Pompeo press conference. A lot of the key words and phrases that we have used amongst many administrations were there. We talked about shared future, shared values. What's really important here is that President Biden and Moon committed to the complete denuclearization, and that's really important because we saw strategic patience was the philosophy that the Obama administration pursued. Obviously, we went for a bigger grand bargain in the Trump administration. But I think two big things that are coming out of this has been reported that the Biden team are going to use the basis of the Singapore summit. That was between Trump and Kim Jong-un the first time at the leader level that Kim Jong-un, that a leader of North Korea committed to complete denuclearization. So President Biden may be changing the style by which he operates with DPRK, but he certainly is using very similar language, very similar substance. One thing that I would say a that was really missing, though, in this whole conversation that was just in a glaring omission to me was there was no mention of China significantly at all. And I don't know how you have President Moon at the White House and how you don't have a major announcement on the policy towards China from these two major allies. Big omission.",

Here's a president with 40 of experience, foreign policy experience. Every president is an answer to his, and one day we'll say her predecessor. This president brings more experience in government than any president in my lifetime, and I would argue as much as any president has brought. He recommitted and made clear our commitment to a two-state solution. He made clear, as Morgan said very well, the commitment to a denuclearized region. But I think more so than anything, when he said that he has private conversations with leaders and he takes leaders at their word, as much as there is a stylistic difference, there's a bit of a substantive different there as well I think with him and his predecessor. I was hoping to hear something on China. I don't think the omission is quite as glaring as my good friend things. I would have been nice to hear more there.

President Biden speaking from Washington today talking about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and it does come amid this cease-fire announcement last night that ended 11 straight days of fighting between Hamas, the group in control of Gaza, and Israel. What the president didn't really talk about was Hamas. And Hamas is the group in control of Gaza. They control about 40 percent of the Palestinian population. So, while he was very clear about the possibility of a two- state solution, he didn't address this key issue of how to involve the Gazans in that conversation. We spoke with a senior Hamas official over the past 24 hours who indicated the Biden administration is still not speaking directly with Hamas inside Gaza. So it creates this situation where you have the American administration talking directly with the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, but Abbas does not represent the 2 million Palestinians living here. So while this cease-fire agreement is great news, it isn't necessarily great news for a larger peace process because you still have this major disconnect between the Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Palestinians living in Gaza.

One of the things that sort of jumped out at me, though, in President Biden's comments was he was rather unambiguous about how he approaches Hamas. He said Hamas is a terrorist organization. We recognize that. I think that was the exact quote. You have others in his party who have encouraged him to deal with Hamas, to talk about Hamas as a political organization with a terrorist wing. He was rather unequivocal about it, said Hamas is a terrorist organization. I do think that makes it difficult. If you go back and you look at the roots of some of what we have seen over the past few weeks and the power struggle between the Palestinian authority and Hamas, Hamas is gaining strength. Hamas is doing well. They were expected to do well in these elections. And I think the president sent a message in effect saying Mahmoud Abbas could potentially be a partner here. Hamas cannot.",

But one point that he got wrong, and I will end on this, is he said that there won't be peace in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians until the Arab neighbors recognize Israel.

How does this rebuilding come about?"

      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Yes, you are exactly right. I think the devil will be in the details, to use the old cliche. One of the things that sort of jumped out at me, though, in President Biden's comments was he was rather unambiguous about how he approaches Hamas. He said Hamas is a terrorist organization. We recognize that. I think that was the exact quote. You have others in his party who have encouraged him to deal with Hamas, to talk about Hamas as a political organization with a terrorist wing. He was rather unequivocal about it, said Hamas is a terrorist organization. I do think that makes it difficult. If you go back and you look at the roots of some of what we have seen over the past few weeks and the power struggle between the Palestinian authority and Hamas, Hamas is gaining strength. Hamas is doing well. They were expected to do well in these elections. And I think the president sent a message in effect saying Mahmoud Abbas could potentially be a partner here. Hamas cannot."

      "utterance": "Morgan, did you take any of what the president said today about being very clear that he likes to have private conversations with people, and he takes leaders at their word, and doesn't like to do things publicly, as a mention or an allusion to the previous administration?"

    {
      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he has been around a long time and that's his style. And we'll see if there is any policy outcomes from his style. I was encouraged by the fact that he was so defensive of Israel, especially in the face of some pretty extremist things that you have seen from his party. But one point that he got wrong, and I will end on this, is he said that there won't be peace in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians until the Arab neighbors recognize Israel. And I would remind President Biden that four Arab states have recognized Israel in Abraham Accords, and what he should do is build on that and not trivialize those accomplishments that can help him get to peace."

      "utterance": "I agree with Morgan there. I think Joe Biden believes that building a coalition of allies to isolate and pressure whichever nation or what the problem may be, whether it's with North Korea or the Middle East, that's the approach I heard from him today. That's the approach I have known for him when I was in Congress, about him, and I'm pleased to see he is continuing in that tradition."
