The Biden administration was just forced to admit that not only were the vast majority of people flown out of Afghanistan, the ones who didn't help us, many may not even be Afghans at all. This is unbelievable.  Ken Cuccinelli. He served as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Trump. He says the man he fired for altering documents is now in charge of vetting the refugees. Great. Cuccinelli is here to tell us more. But first, frauds and generals. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".  Less than 24 hours after Biden's tone deaf and hectoring speech about the Afghan withdrawal, his top military leaders decided to further squander what's left of their credibility. Today, they came off like junior members of the White House comms team, saying anything to prop up the commander-in- chief who didn't fire them. Well, they bombed. But not in the way we want the military to bomb. We have 13 American troops dead, hundreds of our fellow citizens stuck in enemy territory, and an emboldened Taliban in other terrorists. Any rational person knows this was a humiliating failure. And the honorable thing, the honorable thing to have done was to admit you didn't measure up and tender your resignation. But instead, like clockwork, Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman Mark Milley were desperately trying to hang on to their jobs by mouthing whatever would please Biden's political team.",

How do we know who helped there do what? And how do we know who's telling the truth here, because some NGO vouches for some person that - you see where this is going? There are literally millions of people in Afghanistan who could be considered at risk. Should they all come? You think maybe Congress should get involved here, or we should just let Austin make all the decisions? This is an administration after all that believes the Taliban will actually help us, or that China cares about stuff like climate change, or that Europe is going to help us with China.

And now more than any time, I think, since the Cold War, we need competent and committed military leaders who can help protect us and our freedom from our enemies. Biden tells us that the decision to handle withdrawal was unanimous. All his military advisers agreed. Well, if that's the case, really that's the case? China believe, they all need to be fired. I see zero reason to believe, given what we've seen in these last few months, that our military is currently constituted, led by these men, can defeat China anywhere at any time.   And I was thinking about this today, do we really think like General MacArthur or Bradley or Marshall or Eisenhower would have put up for a second with the ineptitude of Milley, Austin and CENTCOM commander McKenzie? Of course, not.  I think if Austin had been in charge of the Incheon Landing, North Korea would have control of the entire Korean peninsula at this point. And I think if Reagan had asked Milley to save Granada, well, Granada would have - Grenada would have been in Cuban hands today. You know, Putin is thinking, ok, if these clowns had been in charge of the Cold War, well, he'd be running the whole world by now.  The point here isn't just about Afghanistan. We need and our troops deserve a functional military led by competent men and women to take on the biggest threats we face. China's committing genocide, threatening our military dominance everywhere. And if Milley and Austin can't figure out how to secure an airport, how on earth are they going to secure Taiwan? And that's the \"Angle\".

This is a very dangerous neighborhood that it's not just about Afghanistan. And then you extend it to the rest of the world and you see that we are weak. I've been told by members - military that I served with that they are on the ground and other places like Africa and other places that their partners are telling them, we can't trust America. And our guys, in many cases, put their lives on the line and require the support of our partners. And when they don't trust us and they don't think we're going to be there for them, this really makes it dangerous.  And Austin and Milley had been architects of a failed war policy since they were one-star generals. Austin was in charge of it as the CENTCOM commander.

The vetting process done correctly is about a 14-step process, typically taking 18 months to two years. Now, if you pour enough resources in anything, you can accelerate that. But that sort of assumes you can gather the information you need to even determine who's in front of you.  And as you noted, Laura, in your comments, only a small minority of the Afghans that have been evacuated out of Afghanistan are even alleged to have worked with us over in Afghanistan. I mean, this is a miniscule portion of the overall population. And I am not excited about large scale Afghan refugee movement over here, pew. And you know, maybe your listeners don't.

So while the White House likes to say it's following the science, instead it appears to be administering political pressure. And now Marion Gruber and Philip Krause, two of the FDA's top vaccine regulators have resigned. And according to Politico, this could lead to an even bigger mutiny, because staff members feel like they've been cut out of key decisions. And because the plan to offer booster shots to adults is, \"premature and unnecessary\". And yet the administration has set a September 20 deadline to begin giving most adults booster shots. One expert says, it was \"the administration's booster plan; it wasn't the FDA's booster plan\". And remember, Pfizer just completed its booster shot application to the FDA five days ago. It's anybody's guess when Pfizer will actually get approval. And we also don't know when Moderna or Johnson & Johnson will submit their initial applications.  Then, as you mentioned, there's the confusion started by the President himself. Last week, Biden said booster shots could be given five months after the initial vaccine, but the Biden administration says, it's eight months.

As you've mentioned, the randomized villages were - some villages were assigned or taught to wear masks and others were not. So the first study that we have that's randomized is important. That's the Denmark study, which already showed that people wearing masks, individuals wearing masks do not have a lower of infection testing for virus than people wearing masks. Those are high- quality surgical masks. That was a randomized study. So that's known, and that's very good evidence. Masks do not protect somebody from getting infection. This is a different type of study. This test to see if people get in a village symptomatic COVID if the villagers wear masks versus other villages that they don't wear masks as much. And what this showed was - so it's a good study because it's prospective and randomized. What it showed, there's two results, one, in people defining COVID as symptoms plus antibodies, there is no evidence that cloth masks have any impact. No significant impact with cloth mask for people who have COVID as defined by COVID symptoms with antibody documentation. So, cloth masks are worthless according to this study. The second part is the surgical mask study. And the surgical mask study shows that there is from my reading here, about 11 percent decrease in individuals having symptomatic COVID with antibodies, 11 percent. And so - and basically only older people. And so, what this shows you after all is said and done is it confirms that cloth masks are worthless. It shows a very - if you take the data at face value, a very minimal impact 11 percent decrease symptomatic cases in mask usage by the village. And so of all the clamoring for something desperately to show that masks work.  This is what I would call extremely weak tea. In fact, it confirms the reason why we have seen all over the world and in the United States that mask usage by the population does not significantly stop the spread of the virus.",

This is unbelievable. Ken Cuccinelli. He served as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Trump. He says the man he fired for altering documents is now in charge of vetting the refugees. Great. Cuccinelli is here to tell us more. But first, frauds and generals. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Less than 24 hours after Biden's tone deaf and hectoring speech about the Afghan withdrawal, his top military leaders decided to further squander what's left of their credibility. Today, they came off like junior members of the White House comms team, saying anything to prop up the commander-in- chief who didn't fire them. Well, they bombed. But not in the way we want the military to bomb. We have 13 American troops dead, hundreds of our fellow citizens stuck in enemy territory, and an emboldened Taliban in other terrorists. Any rational person knows this was a humiliating failure. And the honorable thing, the honorable thing to have done was to admit you didn't measure up and tender your resignation.

But instead, they got the equivalent of second rate political hacks. Remember, it was just a few months ago that our commander-in-chief and his top military brass were focused on really important stuff like white rage and climate change, when they should have been gaming out all possible Afghanistan scenarios. And as if to throw acid on an open sore, these same foolish men have moved on to rewriting our immigration laws, specifically on the refugee question and who deserves Special Immigrant Visas.

How do we know who helped there do what? And how do we know who's telling the truth here, because some NGO vouches for some person that - you see where this is going? There are literally millions of people in Afghanistan who could be considered at risk. Should they all come? You think maybe Congress should get involved here, or we should just let Austin make all the decisions? This is an administration after all that believes the Taliban will actually help us, or that China cares about stuff like climate change, or that Europe is going to help us with China.

And now more than any time, I think, since the Cold War, we need competent and committed military leaders who can help protect us and our freedom from our enemies. Biden tells us that the decision to handle withdrawal was unanimous. All his military advisers agreed. Well, if that's the case, really that's the case? China believe, they all need to be fired. I see zero reason to believe, given what we've seen in these last few months, that our military is currently constituted, led by these men, can defeat China anywhere at any time. And I was thinking about this today, do we really think like General MacArthur or Bradley or Marshall or Eisenhower would have put up for a second with the ineptitude of Milley, Austin and CENTCOM commander McKenzie? Of course, not. I think if Austin had been in charge of the Incheon Landing, North Korea would have control of the entire Korean peninsula at this point. And I think if Reagan had asked Milley to save Granada, well, Granada would have - Grenada would have been in Cuban hands today. You know, Putin is thinking, ok, if these clowns had been in charge of the Cold War, well, he'd be running the whole world by now. The point here isn't just about Afghanistan. We need and our troops deserve a functional military led by competent men and women to take on the biggest threats we face. China's committing genocide, threatening our military dominance everywhere. And if Milley and Austin can't figure out how to secure an airport, how on earth are they going to secure Taiwan? And that's the \"Angle\". Joining me now is Afghanistan veteran; retired Brigadier General Don Bolduc was one of the 90 former flag officers calling on Austin and Milley to resign.

And no one in his or her right mind thinks Kerry is positioned to be tough on China.

      "speaker": "BOLDUC",
      "utterance": "Well, it says that they can bully us around. I mean, what Secretary Austin and General Milley and General McKenzie did was weaken us. Our geopolitical position has been weakened. This isn't just about Afghanistan, this is now about a region that has nuclear concerns with Pakistan and India. It has stability concerns up in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan out west with Iran. This is a very dangerous neighborhood that it's not just about Afghanistan. And then you extend it to the rest of the world and you see that we are weak. I've been told by members - military that I served with that they are on the ground and other places like Africa and other places that their partners are telling them, we can't trust America. And our guys, in many cases, put their lives on the line and require the support of our partners. And when they don't trust us and they don't think we're going to be there for them, this really makes it dangerous. And Austin and Milley had been architects of a failed war policy since they were one-star generals. Austin was in charge of it as the CENTCOM commander. So if they failed predominantly during the last 20 years as general officers, then how in God's name can we think that they were going to get the withdrawal right? They just--"

But initial figures suggest that only about 8500 of those who left were Afghans. So, as we've been asking now for two, three weeks, who is really coming here? Joining me now is Ken Cuccinelli, former acting Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary. Ken, I am stunned when I watched these Republicans, these senators on TV like Joni Ernst, on CNN earlier today. Oh, we welcome the refugees with open arms. And I guess it makes everyone feel better to say that. But shouldn't we be concerned that same people screwed up with withdrawal are trying to assure us about the interagency process in all?"

And now all of a sudden, we're going to do 18,000 of them and their families in, what, weeks or months. That is just - that is not realistic. The vetting process done correctly is about a 14-step process, typically taking 18 months to two years. Now, if you pour enough resources in anything, you can accelerate that. But that sort of assumes you can gather the information you need to even determine who's in front of you. And as you noted, Laura, in your comments, only a small minority of the Afghans that have been evacuated out of Afghanistan are even alleged to have worked with us over in Afghanistan. I mean, this is a miniscule portion of the overall population. And I am not excited about large scale Afghan refugee movement over here, pew. And you know, maybe your listeners don't. So left wing foundation did a survey in Afghanistan eight years or so ago and found that 99 percent of them want to live under Sharia law.

And they are one of the key DHS agencies in doing the vetting such as it is, and handling the visas for these incoming folks for the Department of Homeland Security. And now he has been put in charge of this, as I understand it, for USCIS. And I saw it today in one of these crazy press conferences, and maybe it was yesterday. One of the folks for DHS said that someone from FEMA is in charge of the DHS operation, which tells me that they're just treating this as a logistical effort to house lots of people quickly, not a vetting effort of some people with three deadly terrorist groups over there, Taliban, ISIS, and Al Qaeda.

So while the White House likes to say it's following the science, instead it appears to be administering political pressure. And now Marion Gruber and Philip Krause, two of the FDA's top vaccine regulators have resigned. And according to Politico, this could lead to an even bigger mutiny, because staff members feel like they've been cut out of key decisions. And because the plan to offer booster shots to adults is, \"premature and unnecessary\". And yet the administration has set a September 20 deadline to begin giving most adults booster shots. One expert says, it was \"the administration's booster plan; it wasn't the FDA's booster plan\". And remember, Pfizer just completed its booster shot application to the FDA five days ago. It's anybody's guess when Pfizer will actually get approval. And we also don't know when Moderna or Johnson & Johnson will submit their initial applications. Then, as you mentioned, there's the confusion started by the President himself. Last week, Biden said booster shots could be given five months after the initial vaccine, but the Biden administration says, it's eight months. So despite no FDA approval, the CDC says more than a million people in the U.S. have already gotten boosters, an indication that health care providers are taking guidance from the White House.

Now, the study based on data from villages in Bangladesh, claims that roughly 29 percent increase in mask use resulted in a roughly 9 percent, 9 percent decrease in symptomatic COVID infections. So this is settled science, well, far from it? Here now is Dr. Scott Atlas, former COVID adviser to President Trump and author of the upcoming book, \"A Plague Upon Our House\".

      "speaker": "SCOTT ATLAS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COVID ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "OK. Thanks for having me, Laura. First, just to say. This is the second randomized prospective study, which is a good study. This is a study in Bangladesh. As you've mentioned, the randomized villages were - some villages were assigned or taught to wear masks and others were not. So the first study that we have that's randomized is important. That's the Denmark study, which already showed that people wearing masks, individuals wearing masks do not have a lower of infection testing for virus than people wearing masks. Those are high- quality surgical masks. That was a randomized study. So that's known, and that's very good evidence. Masks do not protect somebody from getting infection. This is a different type of study. This test to see if people get in a village symptomatic COVID if the villagers wear masks versus other villages that they don't wear masks as much. And what this showed was - so it's a good study because it's prospective and randomized. What it showed, there's two results, one, in people defining COVID as symptoms plus antibodies, there is no evidence that cloth masks have any impact. No significant impact with cloth mask for people who have COVID as defined by COVID symptoms with antibody documentation. So, cloth masks are worthless according to this study. The second part is the surgical mask study. And the surgical mask study shows that there is from my reading here, about 11 percent decrease in individuals having symptomatic COVID with antibodies, 11 percent. And so - and basically only older people. And so, what this shows you after all is said and done is it confirms that cloth masks are worthless. It shows a very - if you take the data at face value, a very minimal impact 11 percent decrease symptomatic cases in mask usage by the village. And so of all the clamoring for something desperately to show that masks work. This is what I would call extremely weak tea. In fact, it confirms the reason why we have seen all over the world and in the United States that mask usage by the population does not significantly stop the spread of the virus."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Joining me now, one of our favorites, Heather Mac Donald, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and author of \"The War on Cops.\" Heather, you predicted much of this, but it's clear here that Elder is perceived as a problem for the left. Whether he is successful against spending that is seven times what he has by the Democrats, but they're worried about him. Why? HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR, \"THE WAR ON COPS\":  He's a threat to the Democratic hold on California, and he's also a threat to the perceived monopoly of leftwing ideology on black leaders and voters. And so they are unleashing their biggest weapon, the media is, to take him down, which is the race card. They're accusing him of being a white supremacist or a shill for white supremacists. In fact, so white is Larry Elder that no one has mentioned the historic nature of his candidacy, that he would be the first black governor of the biggest state in the country. Imagine if he were a Democrat, Laura. It's all we would be hearing about, breaking glass ceilings, diversifying the politicians. And instead all they can talk about is that he would reinstate Jim Crow."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Heather, as you point out in your piece, Elder has the temerity to actually state facts on who the victims of this crime really are and who the perpetrators proportionally are. And that drives the left completely crazy. They can't really dispute the facts. But they say somehow by reporting the facts, he's a racist as a black man. How does that make any sense?"

      "speaker": "MAC DONALD",
      "utterance": "It's a complete taboo. You are not allowed to talk about the facts that blacks die of homicide between the ages of 10 and 43 at 13 times the rate of whites. That is a civil rights problem. The problem in the community is not the police. It's criminals. That's what Larry Elder is saying. He's warning us that when you demonize the cops as racists, they back off of lawful proactive enforcement. The result is hundreds, thousands more black lives taken. Black children gunned down on a regular basis in their beds and their front yards. Elder is confronting that fact. Nobody else wants to talk about it. If he gets into the governorship, we will have the police once again reactivated, able to do their jobs, and one would hope blacks in communities able to go about free from fear, go to work, go to school without worrying about these insane drive-by shootings."

They want safety. They want to be respected. And when you ask basic questions of what kind of life they want to lead, ask them are you happy the way things are. No. Why not make a change? A lot of them say yes, maybe we should. So again, if we had a media that was fair and didn't have million-dollar donations going to Newsom to shield him from criticism, who knows what might happen."

      "speaker": "MAC DONALD",
      "utterance": "Yes, break that monopoly. Try something different. And I have to say as well, Laura, the narrative that the cops are on this vendetta to gun down black -- innocent blacks is completely false. I crunched some numbers for this piece and found that this year a police officer is 370 times more likely to be killed by a black criminal than an unarmed black is to be killed by a police officer. Larry Elder understands that this narrative is not just false, it's dangerous."
