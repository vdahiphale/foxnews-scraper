We weren't having people exactly jump off the ship to run away from President Trump over in the Senate. But, that said, by putting up a strong vote there, that probably influences the other body. Also, look at the two Democrats who jumped ship. You had Jeff Van Drew, a freshman Democrat who flipped a district from red to blue in New Jersey, and Collin Peterson, a moderate Democrat from the western side of Minnesota, one of the more conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives. Very interesting thing about Collin Peterson, his district was carried by President Trump by 31 points in 2016. The other thing that's interesting about Collin Peterson, there's only two Democrats left in the House who voted for the impeachment inquiry in 1998 with President Clinton. Collin Peterson was one of them. He didn't vote for it today, Neil.",

I teach due process, when it applies, when it doesn't. And it always applies at the last stage, when somebody is literally, in the words of the Constitution, going to be deprived of liberty or property. In the criminal case, that's the criminal trial. In an administrative proceeding before a regulatory agency, it's at the final trial hearing level, when the evidence is presented. In the case of impeachment, that's in the Senate. That's when the evidence will be presented. Both sides will present their side. Both sides will cross-examine. Due process doesn't apply to the investigatory side. And, by the way, as a practical matter, most congressional investigations of executive wrongdoing or possible wrongdoing are conducted in secret. We don't want one witness listening and comparing his testimony to the other. We want to avoid the usual grandstanding and speechifying that both parties tend to engage in when the hearings are televised."

The resolution passed today provides the transcripts will be made available. So far as I can tell, the procedures and protections for the president in this proceeding will be at least as great as those for Nixon and those for Clinton. In fact, they actually get one extra one. They get to examine the witnesses. But, Neil, there's a hidden thing in here which nobody else seems to pointed out. And that is it provides that, if the president unlawfully withholds documents or withholds or prohibits people from testifying, then the chairman, particularly of the Judiciary Committee, can punish him. And he can punish him by cutting off their right, the president's right, the right of president's counsel, to present witnesses and to cross- examine. And that could be a very serious threat hanging over his head, a lot more effective at producing documents and getting witnesses than holding them in contempt of court or threaten them with fines or whatever they have been doing so far that hasn't worked."

But, be that as it may, the read on all of it with Gary B. Smith and Tim Anderson. Tim, what do you think? I mean, what was rattling these guys?

I mean, the S&P is up 5 percent since October 2. So stocks have had a great month of October. You know, we had some profit-taking today. Some of the major averages were pressed right up against some very serious resistance levels.

And on the flip side, as Tim pointed out, we had a good October, what, up 5 percent from the lows, about 2 percent from the beginning of the month. And that's facing all the headwinds of the tariffs, of Brexit, of the economy slowing. The drip, drip, drip of the bad news just keeps coming in, impeachment, of course, or potential, I suppose."

And their expectation is worst-case scenario, Tim, the president might get impeached in the House, but it's not going anywhere in the Senate. They're not worried. I always like to say that these guys in the markets, they're not red or blue. They're green. They love making money. And they have been making a lot of money with this president, just like they made a lot of money with the last one who was impeached, Bill Clinton, and that -- and they don't want to see that disrupted, and they don't think it will be disrupted. Do you feel that way?"

It's the House Intelligence Committee, not the Judiciary Committee. They might eventually get to that. Jerry Nadler, for the time being, is not part of this process, as these hearings that they will have maybe in two or three weeks and release these transcribed interviews, that is still under the aegis of the House Intelligence Committee.

And that's important to note as you look toward a prospective Senate trial. Again, these weren't articles of impeachment, but the idea that Republicans mounted a united front, that kind of influences Republican senators. We weren't having people exactly jump off the ship to run away from President Trump over in the Senate. But, that said, by putting up a strong vote there, that probably influences the other body. Also, look at the two Democrats who jumped ship. You had Jeff Van Drew, a freshman Democrat who flipped a district from red to blue in New Jersey, and Collin Peterson, a moderate Democrat from the western side of Minnesota, one of the more conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives. Very interesting thing about Collin Peterson, his district was carried by President Trump by 31 points in 2016. The other thing that's interesting about Collin Peterson, there's only two Democrats left in the House who voted for the impeachment inquiry in 1998 with President Clinton.

Why isn't the press involved? Why aren't all members of Congress being given these transcripts? Why aren't they allowed to ask questions? Why doesn't the president have representation behind closed doors? There's a lot of questions I have. But, Neil, you know what was so disturbing today was just how giddy the Democrats were when this vote passed. This should be a serious matter. This shouldn't be something that is celebrated.

I do have a have a sense that we -- with everything else going on, between Syria and impeachment investigations, we could be now moving toward a new crisis with North Korea. Kim has been saying since the collapse of the Hanoi summit in February with President Trump that, if the United States didn't introduce some new flexibility into its negotiating position with respect to easing sanctions on North Korea, that North Korea was going to take its policy in a new direction, which most people think is building up towards ending the nearly-two-year-old freeze on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, which, of course, the president has claimed as one of the important successes of his foreign policy during the first term."

In the meantime, you're looking live right now -- or will be soon -- at Fort Dodge, Iowa. The 2020 presidential hopeful Joe Biden, he is set to hold a town hall there. And to hear Republican Senator John Kennedy say it, on this very show, Democrats are already pre-positioning a very nice campaign gift for him, and it has to do with this impeachment thing. I will connect, then you decide."

All of them are going to be in the Senate six days a week Monday -- most of the day Monday through Saturday. Now, you don't have to be Mensa material to figure out who that helps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Republican Senator John Kennedy, always an interesting guest, taking a very interesting view of this impeachment thing, that it's going to be distracting for a lot of the presidential candidates, six of whom are U.S. senators, and would have to be back in Washington for much of the impeachment trial, if it comes to that. Lo and behold, the vice president would lead a group of non-working or regularly working and employed candidates, who would be able to take advantage of that by doing nothing but campaigning. The Washington Examiner's Tiana Lowe on that. I haven't heard it framed that way before, Tiana. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIANA LOWE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "So I think that Senator -- that the senator is correct, but for the wrong reasons. I don't think that there was some Machiavellian plot at the beginning to ensure this, especially considering that Democrats pushed up the rate of the impeachment inquiry, meaning that it will be cleared hopefully before the primaries for those candidates who would have to be on the Hill in order to vote. However, it clearly does benefit Biden, because it brings back the electability question that has been an issue for a candidate like Elizabeth Warren, who is doubling down on punitive wealth taxes and doubling down on a Medicare for all bill that abolishes private health insurance. So, in that way, with the focus on Trump and not on the unpopular Democratic agenda, then, yes, it does help a candidate like Biden, whose only message is that, I'm electable and I will continue the Obama administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, he's also been saying and trying to rein in the more aggressive spending plans of people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, i.e., those who are senators, who would have to be back in Washington for this, that, look, I'm your moderate alternative. They're distracted. I'm not. I'm focusing on you. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWE",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly. If you look at the polling for Medicare for all, I mean, a minority of Democrats want a bill that abolishes private health insurance. I mean, even the supposedly modern Mayor Pete's public option plan, that was too radical for Barack Obama. So Biden's pitch really is the return to normalcy campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWE",
      "utterance": "And especially with this impeachment inquiry that does put the focus on, was Trump -- was Biden a victim of Trump's corruption, that is a -- that's a positive selling line for him in a Democratic primary where he's been criticized for not being enough to the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And if you think about it, even Barack Obama, Tiana, I think he was the guy who said, health care for all. I didn't say Medicare for all. So we will see how it all plays out. Thank you very much."

You had a ghost outfit or whatever. I found them to be very fat -- very fattening, because just a white sheet, like -- anyway, that was it, and you got candy. It was a great time. People got together and all. Now it's getting a little morbid, with really kind of super kind of gruesome costumes and events and all. Maybe that is just the way of the world, and I got to get with it. But I want to get my young perspective from Kat Timpf, \"Sincerely Kat\" on FOX Nation, much, much more, FOX News contributor and all. She has her finger on the pulse of America.

Listen, when I was 3 years old, and all the other little girls were dressing up like puppies and princesses, I went as a bloodthirsty vampire, as in, I made my mom put blood on my face, and I insisted on creeping behind all the family photos. But guess what? I have grown up. I have never sucked anyone's blood. I'm still not a vampire. It's OK to have fun with this scary horror stuff. I don't think it has any larger implications."
