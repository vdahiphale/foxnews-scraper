But what about all of that? Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" Byron, I was struck by the election focus, there was a lot on election interference. Chris Wray saying that not only did Russia try in 2018, but they believe that Russia and China are really going to try to step it up in 2020. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think perhaps the scariest sentence in the whole report was the one that said China and Russia are more aligned than at any point in the mid-1950s. That is not good at all. And you are right about the election interference. On the other hand, I think we have been expecting this for at least for four years now. One of the things I thought was really striking about this report was that a lot of it just wasn't very surprising, given the news. When the report comes out and says that North Korea wants to build nuclear weapons and wants to build missile delivery systems to attack the United States or somewhere else, the shocking thing would've been if they weren't.

It is going to be a lot harder I think than maybe Donald Trump thought to get North Korea to make the kind of deal that he wants. But I think you heard the intelligence committee say this before. Remember right after Helsinki when they all came to the briefing room at the White House to say how seriously they took a Russian and other countries efforts to intervene in elections?

But historically speaking, what the U.S. has always tried to do is make sure that Russia and China are not in cahoots together.
