It's the couple that makes me ask, would World War III be such a bad thing? But we've been off for a few weeks. And for good reason, this is a news channel and war is news. Actually, it's breaking news. And it's breaking all the time. But you can't spell breaking news without a break. And sometimes we do need a break. But first, let's assess what we know.",

      "sentences": "You know, I love how she speaks to me. Like I have a head injury. Maybe I do. But it's true. Russia invaded Ukraine. And like Joe Biden reading a children's book, what assumed would take days is now nearly a month. And with every passing day, things just get more desperate. Meanwhile, my mother-in-law escaped from Ukraine to Poland. And no, she didn't write out on her broom. She got out with a help of some very amazing people, which I'll get into in a second. But now my wife is out there and Warsaw trying to figure out a way for her mom to get home. Which means I'm all alone. But I've been trying to keep busy. You know, it's been really tough. But I've managed to make some sympathetic friends. Look, I had to do something. Changing all the locks on the doors of the apartment only took about an hour. But in all seriousness, thanks to Fox, I was able to get my mother-in-law out of Kiev. It's a pretty amazing tale. They picked her up in a small village and drove for hours, days even and was able to get her out of danger in Poland. I believe they did this so I could use my new mother-in-law jokes. For example, my mother-in-law was stuck in Kiev and to pose the dilemma, get her out or blocker on Facebook. Yes. Dead silence. But seriously, my wife wanted me to send somebody in to get her, I would have but I have a one- star rating on Uber. My mother-in-law was stuck in Kiev, and to be honest, I'm not crazy about her. So, after hours of arguing about it, we came to an agreement. If rescued, I'm back in her will. Wow. But enough. In all honesty she made it insane trek across the country and made it out alive, thanks to a hearty band of Fox News employees who didn't even know her but off offered to help. I mean, who knew Dagen McDowell knew how to make Molotov cocktails out of hand sanitizer and a bottle of Purell? And who knew Kat could drink those? Here's my mother-in-law reunited with her daughter, my wife, Elena. I haven't seen my wife that happy since I moved into the guest room. But I have Fox News's Scott Wilder, Trey Yingst and Steve Harrigan among others to thank for this. So, it's obvious. The war in Ukraine is an ugly, bloody thing. It's also a war between competing narratives. Some are persuasive, but also confusing in this new fog of war. It's always two movies on one screen. Ukraine is fighting and winning, and Russia is about to crush them. You alternate between screens, often with the same visuals. They say truth is the first casualty of war, but it's really perspective. And you start to find yourself moving from one stage of hopeful belief to one of cynicism. First, you're naive. Did you hear about the Phantom of Ukraine shooting down jets? Did you hear about the Ukrainian sailors refusing to surrender? Did you hear about Gutfeld's mother-in-law killing her captors with a can of hairnet? Turns out a lot of these stories aren't quite true, but are just meant to inspire. They serve a purpose but they turn you from a naive consumer of news to a pissed off cynic like me. Problem is that is bad. That's as bad as being naive. Because for us, we want the truth. But in an era of social media and the internet, fables traveled to the sun and back before the truth puts on its crocs. My gardener said that. So, all we can do is watch and listen and hope for the best and the best we could hope for that this (BLEEP) stupid horrible thing ends as soon as possible.",

It's the couple that makes me ask, would World War III be such a bad thing? But we've been off for a few weeks. And for good reason, this is a news channel and war is news. Actually, it's breaking news. And it's breaking all the time. But you can't spell breaking news without a break. And sometimes we do need a break. But first, let's assess what we know."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You know, I love how she speaks to me. Like I have a head injury. Maybe I do. But it's true. Russia invaded Ukraine. And like Joe Biden reading a children's book, what assumed would take days is now nearly a month. And with every passing day, things just get more desperate. Meanwhile, my mother-in-law escaped from Ukraine to Poland. And no, she didn't write out on her broom. She got out with a help of some very amazing people, which I'll get into in a second. But now my wife is out there and Warsaw trying to figure out a way for her mom to get home. Which means I'm all alone. But I've been trying to keep busy. You know, it's been really tough. But I've managed to make some sympathetic friends. Look, I had to do something. Changing all the locks on the doors of the apartment only took about an hour. But in all seriousness, thanks to Fox, I was able to get my mother-in-law out of Kiev. It's a pretty amazing tale. They picked her up in a small village and drove for hours, days even and was able to get her out of danger in Poland. I believe they did this so I could use my new mother-in-law jokes. For example, my mother-in-law was stuck in Kiev and to pose the dilemma, get her out or blocker on Facebook. Yes. Dead silence. But seriously, my wife wanted me to send somebody in to get her, I would have but I have a one- star rating on Uber. My mother-in-law was stuck in Kiev, and to be honest, I'm not crazy about her. So, after hours of arguing about it, we came to an agreement. If rescued, I'm back in her will. Wow. But enough. In all honesty she made it insane trek across the country and made it out alive, thanks to a hearty band of Fox News employees who didn't even know her but off offered to help. I mean, who knew Dagen McDowell knew how to make Molotov cocktails out of hand sanitizer and a bottle of Purell? And who knew Kat could drink those? Here's my mother-in-law reunited with her daughter, my wife, Elena. I haven't seen my wife that happy since I moved into the guest room. But I have Fox News's Scott Wilder, Trey Yingst and Steve Harrigan among others to thank for this. So, it's obvious. The war in Ukraine is an ugly, bloody thing. It's also a war between competing narratives. Some are persuasive, but also confusing in this new fog of war. It's always two movies on one screen. Ukraine is fighting and winning, and Russia is about to crush them. You alternate between screens, often with the same visuals. They say truth is the first casualty of war, but it's really perspective. And you start to find yourself moving from one stage of hopeful belief to one of cynicism. First, you're naive. Did you hear about the Phantom of Ukraine shooting down jets? Did you hear about the Ukrainian sailors refusing to surrender? Did you hear about Gutfeld's mother-in-law killing her captors with a can of hairnet? Turns out a lot of these stories aren't quite true, but are just meant to inspire. They serve a purpose but they turn you from a naive consumer of news to a pissed off cynic like me. Problem is that is bad. That's as bad as being naive. Because for us, we want the truth. But in an era of social media and the internet, fables traveled to the sun and back before the truth puts on its crocs. My gardener said that. So, all we can do is watch and listen and hope for the best and the best we could hope for that this (BLEEP) stupid horrible thing ends as soon as possible."

There was all these things that were happening and we never get the straight and narrow from. They're given Emmys to their own. And then we eventually find out six months later, that we were on the wrong side of everything. Now, I'm not acquainting that to what's going on in Russia because Putin is what he is, and we all know what he is. But getting the information has been extremely difficult.

His greed and lust for fame made America's race relations worse and at the worst possible time. But I guess in pretending to be a victim while smearing others as violent racist means jail time, then we need to lock up millions of Democrats. Perhaps, this punishment, they could just make Jussie watch this."
