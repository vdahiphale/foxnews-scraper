      "sentences": "Well, and I think he should feel -- I think he should be aggressive in this. Look, what was the worst thing that came out of the hearing for him? That Comey called him a liar? The morning of there was a poll that 70 percent of American didn't believe him in regards to the Russian investigation and other related matters. So that's where he started at the beginning of the hearing, so I don't think Comey calling him a liar is going to do much more in terms of that number.  But I also think that everyone was discredited in the process as well. Comey was discredited. I think his motives should be a question from the hearing as well. The media as well. And Chris Matthews has said that the Russia-Trump narrative basically fell apart after the hearing. And also the Obama administration as well with Loretta Lynch and Comey's testimony that she instructed him to use the word \"matter\" as opposed to \"investigation.\" So I think everyone else is now in muddy waters as well. And three things that Comey said that I think should be brought into question. One, going back to his May 1st statement, his testimony the other day sure seems in contradiction to that. Also, Comey testified that he released in response to Trump's May 12th tweet. There was a New York Times article on May 11 which closely mirrors those memos, that was the day before Trump tweeted. So we already know that Comey leaked. Was that him? I think it's fair to question that. He also said that no reasonable prosecutor would have brought charges against Hillary Clinton. Senator Risch pointed out nobody has ever been prosecuted for hoping something. So I think there are a lot of things to also question the FBI director as well.",

Meanwhile, we're hearing when Donald Trump says he would love to be deposed under oath, you know, that's what Bill Clinton impeached. It's mindboggling. You have to think that poor, you know, Don McGahn must be mainlining black tar heroin at the thought his client is going to be deposed under oath. It's insane. There is not a lawyer out there who thinks that's a good idea. My guess is it's just bluster. And so I think what we are seeing here is this very strange argument where Donald Trump says, he literally says in tweets and a press conference today, he says simultaneously I'm 100 percent vindicated, and so much of what Comey said our lies. Well, those things are hard to square. You can't say he's lying about the inconvenient bits, but he's totally telling the truth about the parts that exonerate you.

I am also very much open to the idea that people get in trouble when they try to cover up things that aren't as serious as the cover-up becomes.  And I just have to -- I never thought I would say this. I'm disagreeing with Rush Limbaugh on your show. I think Jim Comey, and I'm disagreeing with Lisa as well. I think Jim Comey is not discredited in this. I think he came out of this looking fairly straightforward. He looked like -- admitting the leaking. First of all Donald Trump being upset by somebody leaking is a little bit rich. Let's just leave that there. This is a situation which I think Comey was quite forthcoming, and it's a situation in which the former director of the FBI called the president a liar under oath.

I don't think we came out of it with any clear answer. He essentially said I wish I could have been stronger, I wish I could have been more courageous. But particularly that meeting that he describes so vividly in the Oval Office where he talks about Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, lingering behind him, perhaps feeling like this was uncomfortable, Jared Kushner perhaps trying to stop the interaction. This seems like it's playing out over a period of minutes, perhaps, where he could've stepped in and said something, and he didn't. And I do think that is a weakness in his case.

      "utterance": "Well, and I think he should feel -- I think he should be aggressive in this. Look, what was the worst thing that came out of the hearing for him? That Comey called him a liar? The morning of there was a poll that 70 percent of American didn't believe him in regards to the Russian investigation and other related matters. So that's where he started at the beginning of the hearing, so I don't think Comey calling him a liar is going to do much more in terms of that number. But I also think that everyone was discredited in the process as well. Comey was discredited. I think his motives should be a question from the hearing as well. The media as well. And Chris Matthews has said that the Russia-Trump narrative basically fell apart after the hearing. And also the Obama administration as well with Loretta Lynch and Comey's testimony that she instructed him to use the word \"matter\" as opposed to \"investigation.\" So I think everyone else is now in muddy waters as well. And three things that Comey said that I think should be brought into question. One, going back to his May 1st statement, his testimony the other day sure seems in contradiction to that. Also, Comey testified that he released in response to Trump's May 12th tweet. There was a New York Times article on May 11 which closely mirrors those memos, that was the day before Trump tweeted. So we already know that Comey leaked. Was that him? I think it's fair to question that. He also said that no reasonable prosecutor would have brought charges against Hillary Clinton. Senator Risch pointed out nobody has ever been prosecuted for hoping something. So I think there are a lot of things to also question the FBI director as well."

      "utterance": "I know. In this case they're attacking the messenger in the form of Comey. But my guess is Mueller's day will come. Meanwhile, we're hearing when Donald Trump says he would love to be deposed under oath, you know, that's what Bill Clinton impeached. It's mindboggling. You have to think that poor, you know, Don McGahn must be mainlining black tar heroin at the thought his client is going to be deposed under oath. It's insane. There is not a lawyer out there who thinks that's a good idea. My guess is it's just bluster. And so I think what we are seeing here is this very strange argument where Donald Trump says, he literally says in tweets and a press conference today, he says simultaneously I'm 100 percent vindicated, and so much of what Comey said our lies. Well, those things are hard to square. You can't say he's lying about the inconvenient bits, but he's totally telling the truth about the parts that exonerate you. This is going to have a long half-life, and that's the bad news for Donald Trump."

That hatred is combined with daily affirmation that the best they've got to get rid of Donald Trump is not working. And that just infuriates them even more. We don't have any crimes. We haven't been told what crimes are being pursued. All we have been is lied to."

There is a lot of smoke and, you know, it's a cliche, but sometimes there is often fire. But I'm open to the idea that there is less here than meets the eye. I am also very much open to the idea that people get in trouble when they try to cover up things that aren't as serious as the cover-up becomes. And I just have to -- I never thought I would say this. I'm disagreeing with Rush Limbaugh on your show. I think Jim Comey, and I'm disagreeing with Lisa as well. I think Jim Comey is not discredited in this. I think he came out of this looking fairly straightforward. He looked like -- admitting the leaking. First of all Donald Trump being upset by somebody leaking is a little bit rich. Let's just leave that there. This is a situation which I think Comey was quite forthcoming, and it's a situation in which the former director of the FBI called the president a liar under oath. That is a very novel experience in American public life."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "It is. And that was a big moment in the beginning of that history especially as he laid that out outside of what he already testified turning in. I guess the question that kept on coming up, Julie, was that why did the FBI director, the same guy who under the Bush administration stood up to power and said, this does not stand, why did that same guy not say, Mr. President, this is inappropriate. We need to get the attorney general back in here. You can't do that. You may not know this, but, you can't do that."

    {
      "speaker": "PACE",
      "utterance": "I think that's where Comey actually was weakest in the testimony. It was a huge question going in given everything that had been reported about his interaction. I don't think we came out of it with any clear answer. He essentially said I wish I could have been stronger, I wish I could have been more courageous. But particularly that meeting that he describes so vividly in the Oval Office where he talks about Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, lingering behind him, perhaps feeling like this was uncomfortable, Jared Kushner perhaps trying to stop the interaction. This seems like it's playing out over a period of minutes, perhaps, where he could've stepped in and said something, and he didn't. And I do think that is a weakness in his case. Not to draw any conclusions that he may be misleading in what he said, but it does raise the question. Why didn't you say anything?"
