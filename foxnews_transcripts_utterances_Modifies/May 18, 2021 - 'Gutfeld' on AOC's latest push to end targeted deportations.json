      "sentences": "Yes. And the big victory for New York is when you finally leave. And yet another scoop missed by Woodward and Bernstein, Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig claims that Donald Trump didn't want any fat or short Secret Service agents on his detail. Now, that's hard hitting journalism. If these allegations proved true, not only was President Trump guilty of institutional fat shaming, he also singlehandedly crushed the lifelong dreams of a shy chunky young lad by the name of Brian Stelter. There's a long way for a joke. Now this is from a book on the Secret Service. But the only buzz being generated, it is about the most interesting man on the planet since that old guy who drinks those techies, Trump. According to the book, Trump once said, \"I want these fat guys off my detail.\" He added, how are they going to protect me and my family if they can't run down the streets? You don't even have to add anything to this. So, once again, someone's trying to sell a book based on a conversation that likely cannot be verified by someone on record. And what happens everyone in the press calls the same source to verify it. That's their confirmation, misinformation loop. But we don't do that here at GUTFELD. Mainly because we don't have the budget for a phone and I'm really lazy. But also there's no need to because I believe that quote is 100 percent factual. Of course, Trump would say he doesn't want that guys on his detail, because that's what we all say if we were the president, too. He is us. We are him. He is right. Only -- one of the only reasons to be president is the perks. This is not a great job. Half the country hates you. And you always have to wear a suit and a tie, even at bed. And unless you're a left-wing shill, the media despises you. And you can't even look at a woman without being accused of something. And even if you do get lucky, how can you be intimate when there are three men with guns nearby? I mean, I can't. I practice a lot in prison. And God forbid you want to have a drink. You'll have to put the whiskey in a juice box which is something I learned from the gals on outnumbered. Having Secret Service is priority number one. As president you can do anything. Hey, let's drive by my old guidance counselor's house and pelt is used Miata with rotten eggs. And if anyone comes for you, the Secret Service can shoot them in the face. I think that's in the constitution. I didn't check but I'm assuming. Look, when I become president I don't want an agent who looks like a coke machine with a head. I want him to -- I want him or her to look like, you know, Dolph Lundgren during the alleged steroid phase, alleged. Or Carl Weathers in the Action Jackson phase. What a body on that, huh? And he needed one to fight Craig T. Nelson. Nobody remembers Craig T. Nelson. So, you need a show of force, not a show of flab. You want Clint Eastwood, not Clint Howard. And remember, the movie was called In the Line of Fire, not In the Line of Dairy Queen. This is why Trump was so beloved. He'd say what you would say, he didn't lower -- he didn't lower any bar. He spoke like you do when you're at a bar. Of course Trump also didn't want short people there either. So, as a member of that community whose height has been historically underrepresented in law enforcement and also on dating shows, should I throw a tantrum? Should I drown myself in a teapot or hang myself from a bowling trophy? Now I get it. If you're supposed to take a bullet for the President, it's kind of unfair if the President is a taller target than you. That seems like a thing that should be on the checklist of human shields. Is he in reasonably good shape? Check. Does he owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses? Check. Is he taller than Peter Dinklage? Check. Of course, this service has fitted standards for agents in the field, you have to be able to run a mile in under 10 minutes and beat up 10 hippies while writing a black bear. But some agents they also have office jobs, and that's where I would work. I know my place. I can catch a typo, but not a bullet. I'll take one for the team as long it's a -- it has -- it's a spice latte with skim. Plus, I'd have a really cool secret code name like sorry ladies, he's married. But this excerpt is meant to portray Trump once again as intolerant claiming he tried to remove staff he deemed too fat or too short. Boohoo. No one minded when he enforced the same standards for the Miss Universe pageant, telling men who are too fat or too short that she didn't make the cut. That happens all the time. among women, it's known as dating. Kat, back me up. All right. Don't. Fine. I wonder what our angry white male thinks.",

Try Joe Biden's recent comments commemorating National Police Week, after a perfunctory expression of gratitude. He noted \"A deep distrust towards law enforcement, which has been exacerbated by the recent deaths of several black and brown people at the hands of law enforcement.\" He's like a guy with a sore tooth. He just couldn't leave it alone. Thanks for that, Joe. Remind me not to have you give the eulogy at my funeral. Of course the slandering of the police seems way worse to me anyway than wanting reasonably fit people to protect you in your country. And of course, it was Trump's insult, not Joe's that gets more coverage. Do you think Trump gives two rips about what the positive body image crowd thinks? Fat chance.",

So far, left Dems are pushing to end targeted deportations of criminal illegal immigrants, including suspected gang members like those from M.S.-13 who've been tied to brutal killings across the country, which I guess would make those felons anchor criminals. New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says like that's funny. Said this country is at a \"racial reckoning.\" I mispronounced her name. That's funny. She joins 34 Democrats and demanding an immigration overhaul including pulling back on targeting gang members for deportations. She's right. These undocumented felons are just coming here to commit felonies that Americans won't do themselves. AOC writes, \"The definition of an aggravated felony is a relic of the racist war on drugs.\" Adding the member Adam invites racial profiling by presuming that an immigrant is a public safety enforcement and removal priority if they've been convicted of an offense in which an element was active participation in a gang or someone older than 16, who intentionally participated in a gang. OK. Take a breath. The memorandum she's criticizing says that we should prioritize the deportation of convicted criminals who are also gang members. So, where's the racist part? Was the guy who wrote the memo wearing blackface at the time? I must have missed it. Keep in mind, these gang members mostly prey on other Central American immigrants with crimes including murder and child prostitution. We're not talking about mixing recyclables or misgendering a cashier, these are bad people doing bad things. So in a AOC's world, we can't put these felons in prison, and we also can't deport them.

      "utterance": "Yes. And the big victory for New York is when you finally leave. And yet another scoop missed by Woodward and Bernstein, Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig claims that Donald Trump didn't want any fat or short Secret Service agents on his detail. Now, that's hard hitting journalism. If these allegations proved true, not only was President Trump guilty of institutional fat shaming, he also singlehandedly crushed the lifelong dreams of a shy chunky young lad by the name of Brian Stelter. There's a long way for a joke. Now this is from a book on the Secret Service. But the only buzz being generated, it is about the most interesting man on the planet since that old guy who drinks those techies, Trump. According to the book, Trump once said, \"I want these fat guys off my detail.\" He added, how are they going to protect me and my family if they can't run down the streets? You don't even have to add anything to this. So, once again, someone's trying to sell a book based on a conversation that likely cannot be verified by someone on record. And what happens everyone in the press calls the same source to verify it. That's their confirmation, misinformation loop. But we don't do that here at GUTFELD. Mainly because we don't have the budget for a phone and I'm really lazy. But also there's no need to because I believe that quote is 100 percent factual. Of course, Trump would say he doesn't want that guys on his detail, because that's what we all say if we were the president, too. He is us. We are him. He is right. Only -- one of the only reasons to be president is the perks. This is not a great job. Half the country hates you. And you always have to wear a suit and a tie, even at bed. And unless you're a left-wing shill, the media despises you. And you can't even look at a woman without being accused of something. And even if you do get lucky, how can you be intimate when there are three men with guns nearby? I mean, I can't. I practice a lot in prison. And God forbid you want to have a drink. You'll have to put the whiskey in a juice box which is something I learned from the gals on outnumbered. Having Secret Service is priority number one. As president you can do anything. Hey, let's drive by my old guidance counselor's house and pelt is used Miata with rotten eggs. And if anyone comes for you, the Secret Service can shoot them in the face. I think that's in the constitution. I didn't check but I'm assuming. Look, when I become president I don't want an agent who looks like a coke machine with a head. I want him to -- I want him or her to look like, you know, Dolph Lundgren during the alleged steroid phase, alleged. Or Carl Weathers in the Action Jackson phase. What a body on that, huh? And he needed one to fight Craig T. Nelson. Nobody remembers Craig T. Nelson. So, you need a show of force, not a show of flab. You want Clint Eastwood, not Clint Howard. And remember, the movie was called In the Line of Fire, not In the Line of Dairy Queen. This is why Trump was so beloved. He'd say what you would say, he didn't lower -- he didn't lower any bar. He spoke like you do when you're at a bar. Of course Trump also didn't want short people there either. So, as a member of that community whose height has been historically underrepresented in law enforcement and also on dating shows, should I throw a tantrum? Should I drown myself in a teapot or hang myself from a bowling trophy? Now I get it. If you're supposed to take a bullet for the President, it's kind of unfair if the President is a taller target than you. That seems like a thing that should be on the checklist of human shields. Is he in reasonably good shape? Check. Does he owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses? Check. Is he taller than Peter Dinklage? Check. Of course, this service has fitted standards for agents in the field, you have to be able to run a mile in under 10 minutes and beat up 10 hippies while writing a black bear. But some agents they also have office jobs, and that's where I would work. I know my place. I can catch a typo, but not a bullet. I'll take one for the team as long it's a -- it has -- it's a spice latte with skim. Plus, I'd have a really cool secret code name like sorry ladies, he's married. But this excerpt is meant to portray Trump once again as intolerant claiming he tried to remove staff he deemed too fat or too short. Boohoo. No one minded when he enforced the same standards for the Miss Universe pageant, telling men who are too fat or too short that she didn't make the cut. That happens all the time. among women, it's known as dating. Kat, back me up. All right. Don't. Fine. I wonder what our angry white male thinks."

But remember this, Trump may not be a fan of imperfect physiques but he never denigrated the working guy in law enforcement. You want to contrast? Try Joe Biden's recent comments commemorating National Police Week, after a perfunctory expression of gratitude. He noted \"A deep distrust towards law enforcement, which has been exacerbated by the recent deaths of several black and brown people at the hands of law enforcement.\" He's like a guy with a sore tooth. He just couldn't leave it alone. Thanks for that, Joe. Remind me not to have you give the eulogy at my funeral. Of course the slandering of the police seems way worse to me anyway than wanting reasonably fit people to protect you in your country. And of course, it was Trump's insult, not Joe's that gets more coverage. Do you think Trump gives two rips about what the positive body image crowd thinks? Fat chance."

So far, left Dems are pushing to end targeted deportations of criminal illegal immigrants, including suspected gang members like those from M.S.-13 who've been tied to brutal killings across the country, which I guess would make those felons anchor criminals. New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says like that's funny. Said this country is at a \"racial reckoning.\" I mispronounced her name. That's funny. She joins 34 Democrats and demanding an immigration overhaul including pulling back on targeting gang members for deportations. She's right. These undocumented felons are just coming here to commit felonies that Americans won't do themselves. AOC writes, \"The definition of an aggravated felony is a relic of the racist war on drugs.\" Adding the member Adam invites racial profiling by presuming that an immigrant is a public safety enforcement and removal priority if they've been convicted of an offense in which an element was active participation in a gang or someone older than 16, who intentionally participated in a gang. OK. Take a breath. The memorandum she's criticizing says that we should prioritize the deportation of convicted criminals who are also gang members. So, where's the racist part? Was the guy who wrote the memo wearing blackface at the time? I must have missed it. Keep in mind, these gang members mostly prey on other Central American immigrants with crimes including murder and child prostitution. We're not talking about mixing recyclables or misgendering a cashier, these are bad people doing bad things. So in a AOC's world, we can't put these felons in prison, and we also can't deport them. So what should we do with them? Give them their own shows on CNN, I hear they're hiring."

According to information uncovered by an independent researcher, whatever the hell that means, for $2.99 a month, Twitter is considering a new service called Twitter Blue, which includes an undo button allowing subscribers to unsend a tweet for a few seconds after posting it, or who accidentally retweeted anything from Christy Tegan. Where would she go? A useful tool if you accidentally use your real account for a tweet that should have come from your anonymous Steve Doocy fan account. Hypothetically. Twitter Blue would also allow users to organize favorite tweets into folders, which definitely sounds like a thing you should do instead of getting some fresh air. Dr. Drew has there ever been a tweet that you wish you could unsend?"

I've been, I've been thinking a lot about some Abraham Lincoln said recently, recently, I've been thinking that recently. Which was that, if the, if you call an elephant's trunk a leg, how many legs does an elephant have? Four, because calling it a trunk doesn't make it -- calling it a leg doesn't make the trunk a leg. And we are so busy trying to control language these days that we are just preoccupied with words, and Twitter, and messaging, and it's a big mess. We should be getting off Twitter not paying them more."
