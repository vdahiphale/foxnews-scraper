But if you want to prove a need for that wall, send a thousand people to our border as a political stunt. I mean, are we sure Trump didn't plan this? He'll never get a better visual aid for his argument. Thanks, Honduras.  Fact is, all societies frown on line cutting, without a line you have chaos. The exception: dire need. At the E.R., a heart attack trumps a flu, even if the flu got their first. And that's why the caravan backfired. It was political, calculated, designed to challenge the idea of a border. And it hurts everyone who really wants to come here. Just ask anyone who did it legally. And you wonder why Trump's approval climbs. Yes, there are daily shifts, but the story is the long-term trend, not the absolute level of approval. So why the rise, even as the media pushes collusion, Stormy and chaos? Could it be that America loves the underdog and the media has made Trump into that very thing by relentlessly demonizing him? Controversies become background noise to other things in life. The other thing being job numbers, tax cuts, terror, progress with a looming nuclear threat that is North Korea, and, yes, immigration.  So despite a panicky press, issues seem to matter more to you than the media's mud. And perhaps those obsessing over the latest rumor may actually be helping Trump out. How hilarious. The same network that elected Trump, CNN, may end up reelecting him.   We've said this before, Jesse, every time something happens, immigration wise, it's not about the wall. It's about Trump. They actually canceled the caravan. So, the caravan was coming here. They canceled it. Why? Because of Trump's reaction. Ergo, which I think is the correct word, Ergo Trump is the.",

And then, Trump sends National Guard to the border and he's considered racist. Same thing with Syria. I mean, look, Obama said OK, let's pull out all the troops from Iraq, he was considered very intelligent. And then, President Trump considering pulling out troops from Syria, and he's considered reckless. I think the reason his popularity is going up is because he's defending the country with strength. If you look at what's happening on the border, all he's doing is defending the country. He's defending worker's wages. He's defending our safety. He's defending the territorial integrity of the country. He's defending national security.  The border patrol agents themselves want the wall. Let's give the workers what they want. I thought that's what Democrats wanted, Juan. And, if you're anti-wall and if you're anti-troops on the border, you must be pro- cartel. Because I'll tell you what, all the heroin coming across the southern border from Mexico to the United States, the cartels are sending it. Every time a migrant pays a coyote, the coyote then pays the cartel. The only people making money on the border are the cartels. The only thing that's going to stop the cartels are a wall and troops. How else are you going to fight the cartels? Not with the Peace Corps. Illegal immigration costs this country a hundred million dollars a year. The wall costs 200 billion. The wall cost 20 billion. I'm not very good at math, but to spend 20 to save a 100, that makes sense to me.",

It's the first time in many years that young people, now a majority of them, 61 percent believe that they will be better off than their parents. From about 2009, till maybe in the last year, that number was almost below 50 percent, and people started really worrying about the American dream, because every generation had done better.

The way they went after Mike Flynn was with the Logan Act, which was started in 1799, it was obscure law that's never, ever been used before on anybody. And it's to say that if you're a private citizen, you can't conduct foreign policy. So Flynn is incoming national security advisor. He hops on the phone with the Russian ambassador about sanctions. Surveillance picks it up, and Sally Yates, the Obama holdover and Trump hater, comes in and sends Peter Strzok, the Trump FBI hater -- or the Trump-hating FBI agent, to go interview Mike Flynn without a lawyer present. And then Flynn says what he says, and Comey comes back and says, \"I don't even think the guy lied.\" But Mueller turned the screws to him so hard, and he was going to go bankrupt. He ended up pleading guilty to one count of perjury, and now that plea is under investigation. You add the dirty dossier to that. And then, as the president is coming into office, Comey then briefs him on it with the other intelligence chiefs under Obama. Literally hours later, it leaks to CNN.

And they have partnered with the NBA to make the New York City NBA store the first sensory inclusive retail store in the world. It includes training staff to interact with sensory sensitive customers, having sensory bags available with noise-canceling headphones and fidget tools, as well. So young NBA fans living with autism were treated to a special NBA shopping spree, experiencing alongside Kyle O'Quinn from the New York Knicks. This is incredible this week. You see all the pictures from it. And it's impacted the lives of so many. I worked with Tiki Barber and his wife, Tracy, and Geraldo and Dr. Julian Manas and his wife, Michelle, that started this.

And you wonder why Trump's approval climbs. Yes, there are daily shifts, but the story is the long-term trend, not the absolute level of approval. So why the rise, even as the media pushes collusion, Stormy and chaos? Could it be that America loves the underdog and the media has made Trump into that very thing by relentlessly demonizing him? Controversies become background noise to other things in life. The other thing being job numbers, tax cuts, terror, progress with a looming nuclear threat that is North Korea, and, yes, immigration. So despite a panicky press, issues seem to matter more to you than the media's mud. And perhaps those obsessing over the latest rumor may actually be helping Trump out. How hilarious. The same network that elected Trump, CNN, may end up reelecting him. We've said this before, Jesse, every time something happens, immigration wise, it's not about the wall. It's about Trump.

I mean, look, Obama said OK, let's pull out all the troops from Iraq, he was considered very intelligent. And then, President Trump considering pulling out troops from Syria, and he's considered reckless. I think the reason his popularity is going up is because he's defending the country with strength. If you look at what's happening on the border, all he's doing is defending the country. He's defending worker's wages. He's defending our safety. He's defending the territorial integrity of the country. He's defending national security. The border patrol agents themselves want the wall. Let's give the workers what they want. I thought that's what Democrats wanted, Juan. And, if you're anti-wall and if you're anti-troops on the border, you must be pro- cartel. Because I'll tell you what, all the heroin coming across the southern border from Mexico to the United States, the cartels are sending it. Every time a migrant pays a coyote, the coyote then pays the cartel. The only people making money on the border are the cartels. The only thing that's going to stop the cartels are a wall and troops. How else are you going to fight the cartels? Not with the Peace Corps. Illegal immigration costs this country a hundred million dollars a year. The wall costs 200 billion. The wall cost 20 billion.

One thing to the poll numbers that I wanted to bring up, is that Gallup had one the other day that -- it wasn't specific to President Trump, but it is about this moment in time if you take the last couple of years. It's the first time in many years that young people, now a majority of them, 61 percent believe that they will be better off than their parents. From about 2009, till maybe in the last year, that number was almost below 50 percent, and people started really worrying about the American dream, because every generation had done better. And so, the economy, I think, is part of that. Perhaps, law & order as well, but the fairness issue is one that everybody can understand."

You want a conversation with result. If you look at something like at The Five, we've been talking about a database. We've been talking about civil tags for people, felons, or people who are unstable, and that's happening. New York is doing a red flag policy on domestic abusers. Libertarians, they don't like me when I talk about this, but this is an actual -- you're targeting the person and not the system. And it actually could have prevented things like this. We know the police had contacted this woman after the parent called and said she might be a threat. And they -- that needle was placed back in the haystack. And I think -- you can have a conversation about actual solutions, but you've got to be rational about it. And that's how they got to these civil tags for domestic abusers. That's when we have a conversation."

So, why don't these people, and the CEO's at Silicon Valley, and everywhere else, actually provide for safe environments for their employees to work and have proper security, et cetera, just like we need proper security at schools, and at movie theaters, and other places, venues, whether it's like the Bataclan in Paris, any place that is a soft target.

I wouldn't know who he was if he jumped in and said let's have lunch. But I will tell you this, this is what he wrote, he said I assume nothing about the shooter's motives or affiliations. But I assert that easy access to firearms in this country makes the NRA an accessory to what happened. Now, to me, this is the important point, that we have too easy access to guns. So, you've get someone who's crazed, or someone who's disturbed, or someone who's mad at their wife or mad at their husband. And by the way, in the case of Texas, some very famous shootings like at the University of Texas many years ago, shootings happen everywhere and it's because guns are just plentiful. You get a gun."

But, you generally don't tell people that you're not under investigation because you don't know what the next witness is going to say. This is such a weird hybrid of criminality and politics that I think he felt a special obligation to say, look, you're not the target of the investigation.

The weird thing is, in New York, if you're living in New York or D.C., if you're not surviving and living off every Mueller rumor, there has to be something wrong with you, you know. I try to maintain a rational detachment, but that's like being a Dodger's fan in a Yankee's bar. I mean, I feel so out -- I look at this stuff and I just go, so let this thing roll-on.

It's actually -- there's nothing different from a month ago to today, to three months ago, to perhaps three months from now. Although, to that point, I do think that -- if you remember last May, when the investigation started under Mueller, there was indication that they wanted to wrap it up in three months, right? So, now, we're almost a year into it. And I do think that at some point, probably in the fairly near future, may be the end of June, this got to be wrapped up because, otherwise, it will look like it's trying to influence the midterm election, and we don't need any more questions about election integrity."

And I'll just summarize it quickly for you. I know you're very interested in this. The way they went after Mike Flynn was with the Logan Act, which was started in 1799, it was obscure law that's never, ever been used before on anybody. And it's to say that if you're a private citizen, you can't conduct foreign policy. So Flynn is incoming national security advisor. He hops on the phone with the Russian ambassador about sanctions. Surveillance picks it up, and Sally Yates, the Obama holdover and Trump hater, comes in and sends Peter Strzok, the Trump FBI hater -- or the Trump-hating FBI agent, to go interview Mike Flynn without a lawyer present. And then Flynn says what he says, and Comey comes back and says, \"I don't even think the guy lied.\" But Mueller turned the screws to him so hard, and he was going to go bankrupt. He ended up pleading guilty to one count of perjury, and now that plea is under investigation. You add the dirty dossier to that. And then, as the president is coming into office, Comey then briefs him on it with the other intelligence chiefs under Obama. Literally hours later, it leaks to CNN. I mean, you don't think this looks like a set up from the beginning?"

I'm going to try to get some answers about all of that when I sit down with Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg on Friday.

Thanks to social networks and to the cable news, the outrage machine is 24/7. So Facebook will undoubtedly overreact. So what they'll do is, it will be a cascade of virtue signaling. I know you hate that word. But it will be a cascade of virtue signaling to reduce their bad press and go after conservatives, because they're being portrayed in the press as helping the right and helping Trump get elected. So they're going to have to get the media to think that they're not liberal [SIC] anymore, so they're going to start targeting smaller conservative outfits and perhaps larger ones, as well."

The question is why has Facebook been so reticent in coming forward and telling us what happened, especially in terms of relationships with the Russians. And you know what's interesting to me is, I didn't -- I'd never come across this word until today, scrape. That they scrape your Facebook site for information on you. And they scrap and get not only, like, your religion and where you work but thinks you like and dislike, your opinions. And this is available, then, to create what they call the psychographic profile intended to influence how you vote. And I think lots of people don't appreciate how much we are being manipulated in the modern era by that kind of device. I mean, this is new and different, and we've got to think about this as Americans. In terms of your question, though, I think she's the No. 2 person at Facebook and, typically, people see her as the stand-up person. So Zuckerberg, like, went into a bunker for four days. Now, he's supposed to testify, I think, next week."

When the memorial opened, FOX asked me to take my sons, both of them, to visit, and I've got to tell you, it was a powerful, incredible generational transfer of history and memory.

This is their first postal drone making its maiden flight. It's actually trying to mail a letter. All the officials are out there. They're placing the letter onto the drone, and there it's going up. And I think it's going to be a success to find the actual place to mail it. And it hits a wall. Well, so for now, no worries about those postal drones coming from Russia."
