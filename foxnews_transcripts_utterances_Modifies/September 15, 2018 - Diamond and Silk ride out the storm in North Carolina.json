Tropical storm Florence is still pounding the Carolinas with torrential rain and gusty winds, almost two days since it made landfall near Wrightsville Beach. Widespread flooding is being reported throughout much of North Carolina, at least 12 people have died, and more than a million homes are without power. Hundreds of homes have been destroyed, and officials here, the worst may not be over yet. We'll have live coverage from the hardest hit spots coming up. But first, here's a look at the catastrophic storm as it came ashore yesterday morning.",

We are expecting another one of those heavy squalls to blow through here. Wilmington is in the dark tonight. They have been to restore some power, but not in the historic district which we will pan off and show you one of these dark streets which are littered with down trees. We'll show you some of that in just a minute.   But first, I wanted to tell you about an unfortunate situation here earlier that we drove up on, which was some people taking advantage of the storm by looting a Dollar Store just a few minutes from this beautiful neighborhood. There were folks going into that store and walking out with armfuls of stuff that they didn't pay for. The Wilmington police actually put out a tweet saying that they weren't going after the looters because the store had asked them not to, but that happened, and after a lot of people started to get pretty upset about the whole situation, the police did move in and we're told they made at least half a dozen arrests. So, we've got that going on. We also have some pretty bad destruction as I mentioned around here. This neighborhood, the historic district littered with downed trees now, Jesse, including one area that looked like it was hit by a twister where a roof was ripped off and the debris littering the street in front of it and then just down from there, a massive tree ripped up by the roots with the sidewalk all torn up around it.   And then we could see a block down the road where more trees were splintered. Clearly, there was something that touched down and blew through that area and this entire area has seen a lot of trees come down just like that. Big old trees and Clark Hipp and Susan Dillard have been living in this neighborhood for more than 30 years and they are sitting in two of the most comfortable chairs we've ever sat in, that I guess are for your grandmother?",

The rain here really didn't come in until yesterday afternoon, and you can see right now, it's relatively light. Right now, there wasn't evacuation order for Florence, South Carolina, but officials lifted that earlier today.  There is still a curfew in place. It's supposed to go into effect at 8:00. But you could see there are still some people out and about. The big concern for officials here of course is the rain and the potential for flooding, and the biggest worry right now is about an hour and hour and a half away from us in Horry County, that's Georgetown, South Carolina near the water there. Officials - emergency officials say that they are working on two temporary flooding structures to try to keep a highway into that county open. The evacuation orders there are still in effect. Here though, people seem to be spending a lot of time at this Waffle House. This Waffle House has been open for the past couple of days. He talked to one worker who said she has been working from 6:00 a.m. into the night for the last couple of days.  They are going to close right now and the only reason is because of that curfew. So Waffle House, a lot of people have been talking about the last couple of days, there's this thing they called the Waffle House Index. Back in 2011, FEMA officials started using it since Waffle Houses are all over the place, and usually open 24 hours. They said they could see if you a Waffle House was open, full menu, or partial. This one obviously, still open.  We've tried to get people to talk to us tonight, for most part, they are passing because they are worried about the curfew.

We begin with fake news in \"The Washington Post.\" Take a look at this headline. Another hurricane is about to batter our coast. Trump is complicit. The newspaper clearly attempting to blame the President for the hurricane before the hurricane. The reason? Trump pulled out of the Paris climate deal. Now, here is a fact for The Washington Post. In 2017, Donald Trump's first year in office, the United States led the world in CO2 reductions. Look at that, while China and India, and Canada and the EU, they are just emitting like crazy and we are reducing. Speaking of hurricanes, President Trump tweeted this about the death toll in Puerto Rico from last year's storms. \"3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the island after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by, it did not go up by much. Then a long time later, they started to report really large numbers like 3,000.\"  I don't think it's advantageous for the President of the United States to debate hurricane death tolls with the media. Even if he is right, the media is never going to give him credit. For example, five independent studies estimate the death toll to be around 1,000, not 3,000. But the real point is the Federal government did the best job it could do for Puerto Rico. It was the Puerto Rican government and the bankrupt utility company that should be held accountable.  And the Puerto Rican governor admitted the island was only prepared for a Category 1 hurricane, not the Category 5 that hit. \"Watters' World\" feels very deeply sorry for Puerto Rico and hopes the island recovers quickly. And this is probably the most ridiculous thing you will hear tonight, a Coast Guard member assisting with hurricane rescues was accused of flashing a white power sign. See right there. He says he was simply scratching his head. Now ,who knows what's going on? But here are some other famous people holding up what could look like white power signs. Kanye West, President Barack Obama, definitely white power there, and President Bill Clinton. It's got to be a white power symbol. Unbelievable. The \"New York Times\" showing their liberal bias printing a headline that falsely accuse the UN Ambassador Nikki Haley of charging the taxpayers more than $52,000.00 for curtains in her house. The headline read, \"Nikki Haley's view of New York is priceless. Her curtains? $52,701.00.\" The problem is, Haley had no say in the curtain purchase.  The money was put aside by the State Department in 2016 during the Obama administration. The New York Times issued a correction, it was in very small print in the way back of the paper the next day that no one saw. Last but not least, President Trump's infamous fist bump on September 11th, en route to the Shanksville Memorial Now, this is what you saw the liberal media play. Trump fist bumping as he walked along the tarmac. The media apoplectic that he would fist bump on 9/11. Now, what you didn't see Trump hugging a young cancer patient. When he left, gave him a fist bump. It had nothing to do with his reaction to the September 11th anniversary. Before we get to the real news, let's get a reaction from former campaign manager of Donald Trump, Corey Lewandowski. All right, Corey, what did you think of that run we just did there? I mean, a really bad week for the news media.",

We are expecting another one of those heavy squalls to blow through here. Wilmington is in the dark tonight. They have been to restore some power, but not in the historic district which we will pan off and show you one of these dark streets which are littered with down trees. We'll show you some of that in just a minute. But first, I wanted to tell you about an unfortunate situation here earlier that we drove up on, which was some people taking advantage of the storm by looting a Dollar Store just a few minutes from this beautiful neighborhood. There were folks going into that store and walking out with armfuls of stuff that they didn't pay for. The Wilmington police actually put out a tweet saying that they weren't going after the looters because the store had asked them not to, but that happened, and after a lot of people started to get pretty upset about the whole situation, the police did move in and we're told they made at least half a dozen arrests. So, we've got that going on. We also have some pretty bad destruction as I mentioned around here. This neighborhood, the historic district littered with downed trees now, Jesse, including one area that looked like it was hit by a twister where a roof was ripped off and the debris littering the street in front of it and then just down from there, a massive tree ripped up by the roots with the sidewalk all torn up around it. And then we could see a block down the road where more trees were splintered. Clearly, there was something that touched down and blew through that area and this entire area has seen a lot of trees come down just like that. Big old trees and Clark Hipp and Susan Dillard have been living in this neighborhood for more than 30 years and they are sitting in two of the most comfortable chairs we've ever sat in, that I guess are for your grandmother?"

The rain here really didn't come in until yesterday afternoon, and you can see right now, it's relatively light. Right now, there wasn't evacuation order for Florence, South Carolina, but officials lifted that earlier today. There is still a curfew in place. It's supposed to go into effect at 8:00. But you could see there are still some people out and about. The big concern for officials here of course is the rain and the potential for flooding, and the biggest worry right now is about an hour and hour and a half away from us in Horry County, that's Georgetown, South Carolina near the water there. Officials - emergency officials say that they are working on two temporary flooding structures to try to keep a highway into that county open. The evacuation orders there are still in effect. Here though, people seem to be spending a lot of time at this Waffle House. This Waffle House has been open for the past couple of days. He talked to one worker who said she has been working from 6:00 a.m. into the night for the last couple of days. They are going to close right now and the only reason is because of that curfew. So Waffle House, a lot of people have been talking about the last couple of days, there's this thing they called the Waffle House Index. Back in 2011, FEMA officials started using it since Waffle Houses are all over the place, and usually open 24 hours. They said they could see if you a Waffle House was open, full menu, or partial. This one obviously, still open. We've tried to get people to talk to us tonight, for most part, they are passing because they are worried about the curfew. But officials are saying, even though things are light here right now, people do really still need to be careful and they are urging people to stay inside. But when you need eggs, I guess you need eggs."

      "utterance": "Hurricane Florence obviously the big story all week. So we thought we would take a break from that and share some other news making headlines. We begin with fake news in \"The Washington Post.\" Take a look at this headline. Another hurricane is about to batter our coast. Trump is complicit. The newspaper clearly attempting to blame the President for the hurricane before the hurricane. The reason? Trump pulled out of the Paris climate deal. Now, here is a fact for The Washington Post. In 2017, Donald Trump's first year in office, the United States led the world in CO2 reductions. Look at that, while China and India, and Canada and the EU, they are just emitting like crazy and we are reducing. Speaking of hurricanes, President Trump tweeted this about the death toll in Puerto Rico from last year's storms. \"3,000 people did not die in two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the island after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by, it did not go up by much. Then a long time later, they started to report really large numbers like 3,000.\" I don't think it's advantageous for the President of the United States to debate hurricane death tolls with the media. Even if he is right, the media is never going to give him credit. For example, five independent studies estimate the death toll to be around 1,000, not 3,000. But the real point is the Federal government did the best job it could do for Puerto Rico. It was the Puerto Rican government and the bankrupt utility company that should be held accountable. And the Puerto Rican governor admitted the island was only prepared for a Category 1 hurricane, not the Category 5 that hit. \"Watters' World\" feels very deeply sorry for Puerto Rico and hopes the island recovers quickly. And this is probably the most ridiculous thing you will hear tonight, a Coast Guard member assisting with hurricane rescues was accused of flashing a white power sign. See right there. He says he was simply scratching his head. Now ,who knows what's going on? But here are some other famous people holding up what could look like white power signs. Kanye West, President Barack Obama, definitely white power there, and President Bill Clinton. It's got to be a white power symbol. Unbelievable. The \"New York Times\" showing their liberal bias printing a headline that falsely accuse the UN Ambassador Nikki Haley of charging the taxpayers more than $52,000.00 for curtains in her house. The headline read, \"Nikki Haley's view of New York is priceless. Her curtains? $52,701.00.\" The problem is, Haley had no say in the curtain purchase. The money was put aside by the State Department in 2016 during the Obama administration. The New York Times issued a correction, it was in very small print in the way back of the paper the next day that no one saw. Last but not least, President Trump's infamous fist bump on September 11th, en route to the Shanksville Memorial Now, this is what you saw the liberal media play. Trump fist bumping as he walked along the tarmac. The media apoplectic that he would fist bump on 9/11. Now, what you didn't see Trump hugging a young cancer patient. When he left, gave him a fist bump. It had nothing to do with his reaction to the September 11th anniversary. Before we get to the real news, let's get a reaction from former campaign manager of Donald Trump, Corey Lewandowski. All right, Corey, what did you think of that run we just did there? I mean, a really bad week for the news media."

And they said, \"Whoops, actually, we don't want to actually tell you what really took place that Nikki Haley had nothing to do with it.\" The American people have seen this time and time again.

Mike Pompeo quoted him which is that he told Dana Perino, I told the Iranians and others, wait out Donald Trump. So yes, he is right that former secretaries like Henry Kissinger, they have been given speeches and having meetings for years and years. But what's different is that he's trying to undermine the current administration. By the way, he went on Bill Maher, I think last night, and said that President Trump has the insecurity of a teenage girl. I'm waiting for Madonna and others to call that out as sexist, have another women's march, get out the pink hats and go after John Kerry."

I believe I saw at least one text message where Strzok is saying, \"No, we don't agree with the CIA, that's BS.\" And so to his credit, he was trying to change somethng.

She wants to please the left. And she had a one-on-one meeting with Brett Kavanaugh and didn't raise it. Why doesn't she have the guts to say it? Here is the other thing.

They shut all parts of I-95. That's taken care of. Curfews have been put in place. They are asking everyone to stay inside.

      "utterance": "Right, so one of the best ways to exchange information especially if you know you're going to have surveillance and you want to meet your asset, I'm a spy, you're my asset is called a brush pass. It's a super-fast spy maneuver to exchange information hopefully without being seen. And in a crowded place, it works really well. So we're going to try and exchange this. Here we go. Are you ready?"
