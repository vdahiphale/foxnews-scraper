Plus, Trump throws the NFL for a loss, and ESPN suspends the host who called the president a white supremacist, this time for tweeting against the Dallas Cowboys. Why are some critics saying the punishment is racially motivated? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" First, Harvey Weinstein was fired by his own company after The New York Times reported sexual harassment allegations against him over three decades, which he denies. Then came Ronan Farrow's devastating New Yorker article in which three women on the record say the movie mogul raped them, which again he denies.

I mean, even his first ridiculous letter said I'm going to focus my attention now on the NRA. Like they (ph) said, you know, we want him with us in any way whatsoever. To a larger point here, I think that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were late to the game. And I think that more the issue is not what we're going to do with the money, but what are we going to do actually with the ideology because I believe strongly in the values of the Democratic Party and being champions of women. I believe our policies are better for women across the board. And if we are not the first to fire on issues like this, I think that it is hard for us to stand up there and say that."

He gathered a lot of factual reportable information on this story over many months. Eight women on the record. The push back he got internally from NBC is shocking and we've seen the drips and drabs coming out from within the building.

So clearly there are some problems there at the top at NBC with their decision, you know, to not go forward with these huge stories and stories that American people need to hear about, whether it's the president of the United States of America or someone who is running Hollywood. MCPIKE: I worked at both NBC and CNN, both of their news departments. The \"Access Hollywood\" tape -- I don't know that we can say that the actual news department knew of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. I think that's up for debate. But, look, networks kill stories all of the time. It is frustrating at every network. CNN does not have a leg to stand on to go after NBC for not running that story. And my suspicion is that it has a lot more to do with the fact that they thought oh, Ronan Farrow grew up in Hollywood and he is young, and they probably wanted to make him a star, but didn't necessarily believe in his journalistic chops. There's a lot of that that could have been going on."

In fairness, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim told his staff and the network put this out, that it was offensive anyone would think NBC was covering up for a powerful person and that in his view, Ronan Farrow's story wasn't ready for prime time at the time he was dealing with NBC. But of course, weeks later, this incredibly well-documented piece shows up in The New Yorker. All right. So, do you think that too many journalists have perpetuated the myth of Harvey Weinstein, the mighty movie mogul, the guy who makes stars, the guy who wins Oscars while basically looking away from conduct that we're hearing more and more was an open secret in New York and Hollywood? BENSON: Yes, and you know, one element of the story that I've been fascinated by is the late-night comedians who jumped all over stories about -- oh, I don't know, people at our network who got into trouble along these lines and --"

      "speaker": "Some of the excuses now from Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers explaining why they pulled their punches, to me, do not hold water at all.

      "utterance": "By the way, NBC has business relationships with NBC Universal Pictures and with Weinstein Company and that sort of thing. Now, it is hard though to nail down and document these kinds of things, were talking two people in the room. And I'm not being critical in any way of the women, particularly those who were young aspiring actresses for not speaking out, but you have to have people who are willing to go on the record before you can report these kind of assault (ph) charges."

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",

And yes, it took some of them a few years to make sure that they had established their careers and they had a leg to stand on to do it. The audio came out from Courtney Love back in 2005, saying don't work for Harvey Weinstein, this was going to happen to you, and CAA banned her, a lifetime ban. So when people blame the women and I have been on other panels about this where my opponent has come out and said, these women knew, Meryl Streep knew, Jane Fonda knew a year ago, don't you dare talk about those women and put them down for what they did when we see what happened to Courtney Love."

MCPIKE: Well, that's right, and look, a lot of very wealthy entities or people, when they foresee a crisis happening will bring on a public relations firm so that they can fend off that sort of thing, which obviously we know happened with Harvey Weinstein before he was trying to stop The New York Times story."

Let's start with your remarkable interview with Bob Weinstein published yesterday in which he said his brother, Harvey, is depraved, that he's going through a waking nightmare, that he barely talk for the last five years, that he knew his brother was philandering but not coercing, and then he himself was physically assaulted by Harvey Weinstein.

And, you know, he's making a distinction, believe him or not, between what everyone in the company knew, which was that he was a philanderer, he was traveling around the world, trying to sleep with women at all times of the day, but they weren't in the room with him, they say, so they don't know what actually happened in that room."

      "speaker": "BELLONI",
      "utterance": "Well, I would speak with Harvey every once in a while, sort of par for the course in my job, and he was often threatening, sometimes charming. My last interaction with him after the Canned Film Festival, we had an item about how the police had accosted him outside of a party, he was late, and he sort of passive aggressively insinuated that he could buy my magazine and replace me as editor. It was one of those like, you know, Harvey -- you kind of -- are taken aback and like, did you just threaten to buy my magazine and have me fired? But that was the way he operated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That doesn't sound passive, that sounds aggressive. So, how this question is now swirling about? How many journalists knew, suspected, heard rumors in your town, in your circle, at the Hollywood Reporter, that Harvey Weinstein was a sexual predator?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELLONI",
      "utterance": "I think that's a difficult question because you are asking what do we know, what do we know? We heard the stories, we investigated it. In fact, about two years ago, we actually put a team of people on trying to find people who would tell us on the record what had happened to them. We even had a big white board in the news room with all the different people who had worked at Miramax, in the Weinstein Company. We had a list of actresses with stories that kind of floated around Hollywood. We tried to confirm it on the record as many, many, many outlets did. And it wasn't until this breakthrough in The New York Times where actresses came forward and spoke on the record that the floodgate is opened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. We were saying a moment ago that without those on the record testimonies, it's very difficult to publish these kinds of accusations. But after cases that we have now all been through following Bill Cosby, Roger Aisles, Bill O'Reilly, all the Silicon Valley companies, do you think the climate has changed from the media in reporting on this and perhaps also made it easier for women who were traumatized by this, even got out of business because of Harvey, to speak on the record?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELLONI",
      "utterance": "I definitely think the culture has changed and because of the examples you cited, that more women are feeling more comfortable to come forward. It certainly a risky thing to do, it's a brave thing to do, and there are potential repercussions for women who do it. The Courtney Love story is heartbreaking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But, it is a change in the culture that has happened, I think, and we would not have these women coming forward about Harvey Weinstein had the others not come before it. As far as the media goes, you know, it's still a risky proposition to level accusations at a powerful figure, but I do believe that media is more likely to do these stories because of the place we are in the culture right now.

If I were advising the White House, generally, I would advise him to do more of this, because we get all these stories weekly, at least daily often on palace intrigue, and who's frustrated and who's on the brink of being out or whatever? And a lot of the times there's bad information, according to Kelly, the fact that they sent him out directly to respond in person and then answer a bunch of questions, giving new information to the press, I think it diffused a lot of it. He commands the room. I would love to see more of him and more top principals within the administration face the press frequently."

So I agree with you they should do that more often, but also I would say he did note in that briefing that he has done three off the records and some of the reporters in the room had violated the terms of those off the records meetings. What I would say is they don't put out a number of these principles as often as they should, but they do have very high-level principles doing off the record meetings all the time. And I would venture to say probably more than in the Obama administration was doing this early."

I think it was certainly a success and that you watch General John Kelly and you believe him and you believe in his service to this country which he is continuing now and being part of this administration, a role that I don't think he certainly takes lightly or one that I don't think that he wanted in the first place. There was a political piece a little while ago about he doesn't talk to former chief of staff. He's the first one actually who is not part of that club. He wants to go about his business and get an incredibly tough job done. I think that what happened was just similar to what happened with Tillerson last week after the maybe moron comment, this morning I think was totally a moron comment, from what he said on the Sunday morning show, is that the president of the United States marches these guys out there and make something for their supper."

But you don't think that President Trump said to his chief of staff, hey, everyone saying that you hate it here and that you're gonna quit, maybe you could go out there and do a press conference, I'd really appreciate it.

They were saying he should deal -- why doesn't he fight Jerry Jones or like push back with his owner. What she was saying is trying to explain why it's difficult for a quarterback to do that."

      "speaker": "LEITCH",
      "utterance": "Well, it's true, but she's hired to have commentary. I know we'd love to pretend that politics and sports are separate, clearly the president doesn't feel that way. So the idea that like she's not supposed to comment on this major issue, I think ESPN is putting her and frankly other commentators there in this weird kind of straight jacket. Their job is to comment on what's going on. What is a bigger story than the NFL right now than what's going on with the protests and what's going on with Trump? The idea that she's not supposed to comment on that or more to the point kind of guess until afterward where the line is. I think that's a pretty tough spot for her and I think it's not just a tough spot for her but I think everybody there."

      "utterance": "Let me move along here. So President Trump got kicked around by many in the media for going after the NFL over protesting players. Now Roget Goodell says their players are going to have to stand for the anthem. So, fair to say the president put some points on the board?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEITCH",
      "utterance": "I certainly think he believes he puts some points on the board. He did put some pressure on him. Goodell actually did push back against the statement and say that I think there's going to be a vote among owners this week. Goodell met with the Dolphins. They kind of talked about some of their social justice protest, but there's nothing like sort of like, there's not been actual edict yet. Now, there could be one this week --"

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, but don't you think that it's just spin on the part of the NFL commissioner. When this first happened, he came out and issued a statement criticizing President Trump for pushing this issue. Now, you know, you can argue whether it's technically a rule change or not, but now, he's changed his tone at the very least."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEITCH",
      "utterance": "I think certainly, listen, he didn't come out like hey, go protest, fight Trump in the beginning and he's not saying no one can do it. Now, listen, you're not going to find someone like me eager to defend Roger Goodell. Certainly his messaging has always been an issue for him. He never quite gets it right and I think this is a good example of him getting it wrong on both ends by not coming out strong either before or after the statement. It's kind of wishy-washy and frankly it allows both sides to claim victory. It allows Trump to say, yes, I got it. It allows the players to say he stood up for us. It's generally kind of the muddy problem that Goodell has."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I've got half a minute. Do you think the media underestimated the resonance of President Trump taking on this issue with kneeling players, the way in which it would resonate with many Americans?"

    {
      "speaker": "LEICHT",
      "utterance": "I think that they thought it was silly to be honest and I think there's clearly an idea that there should be larger issues to focus on. But yes, you know, I also think part of this is ESPN ratings are down, NFL ratings are down. I would argue these things are independent of this but it certainly makes a convenient data point for people to argue the other direction."

Zuckerberg later apologizing, \"I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realized this wasn't clear, and I'm sorry to anyone this offended.\" I'm glad Facebook has added a dislike button for this sort of thing.
