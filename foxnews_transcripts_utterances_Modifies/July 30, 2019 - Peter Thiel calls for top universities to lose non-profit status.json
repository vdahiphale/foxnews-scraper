      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” We want to begin this evening with a quiz. Quick. What does the Democratic Party stand for? That used to be an easy question to answer. For a hundred years, the answer was higher wages and better benefits. That was back when the Democratic Party was run by people who worked for a living. They cared about how much voters got paid at the end of the week. But that's not a subject that interests the decadent rich very much. The private equity billionaires who fund today's Democratic Party could care less about other people's wages. What they care about most other than making themselves even richer, is feeling virtuous, feeling like a deeply good people, much better than you are.  And that's why they're so committed to something called diversity, a concept that nobody is willing to explain, but that nonetheless, we must celebrate enthusiastically and perpetually. Listen to Nancy Pelosi explain.",

      "sentences": "Okay, got it? \"Diversity is our strength.\" They made that part crystal clear. What is still unclear is what exactly diversity is. What is it?   Well, for one thing, diversity is the reason that Allison Jaslow was forced to resign her job in disgrace. Until 24 hours ago, Jaslow was the Executive Director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then yesterday she quit in tears. She asked her colleagues to forgive her as she packed her things. What did Jaslow do wrong? Well, nothing actually. She didn't hurt anyone. She didn't say anything awful. She didn't mismanage the office. Nobody claimed she did. Jaslow's only sin was having the wrong skin color. On Sunday, two congressional Democrats, Vicente Gonzalez and Filemon Vela demanded that Jaslow be fired from her job and replaced by a person of a different hue. Not a more competent person, they didn't mention that. That was irrelevant. Just a different colored person. That's all that mattered to them. So, they forced a person out of her job for having the wrong genes.  Apparently, none of this set off any alarm bells over at the Democratic Party HQ. Apparently, nobody could think of any other time in history where something like this had happened. It didn't seem ominous to them or creepy or racist, it just seemed like diversity, which we must celebrate because it's our strength. That actually happened.   The Democratic Party has gone insane. Now, you may think you already knew that, but even if you think you knew it, it's hard to appreciate just how real it is, just how crazy the party has become. The party of ordinary Americans has become a poisonous identity cult obsessed with questions of racial purity. It's terrifying, but it's entirely real. How real is it?  Well, Al Sharpton is now a hero on the left. That kind of sums it up. For 40 years, Sharpton chased one hustle after another -- race pimp, F.B.I. informant, corporate shakedown artist, tax cheat. If you told Al Sharpton in 1995 that someday he'd be the moral conscience of the Democratic Party, he would have laughed in your face. And yet here we are, and here he is sermonizing on MSNBC.",

There's a lot about the Democratic Party's economic platform that ordinary voters might like. But this kind of garbage, it's a deal killer, and not just conservative white voters. No normal person of any color will vote for stuff like this. Whatever his many faults, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel does understand that. This week, Emanuel published a memo aimed at the party's presidential candidates. He begged them to return to reality immediately.  Here's part of it. Quote. \"Before our party promises healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants -- a position not even Ted Kennedy took -- let's help the more than 30 million Americans who are a single illness away from financial ruin. Before we start worrying about whether the Boston Marathon bomber can vote, let's stop states that are actively trying to curtail voting rights of citizens. And before we promise a guaranteed minimum income to healthy adults who prefer to stay home and play video games, let's increase the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit to the benefit of the millions of people who still work hard and live near poverty.\" End quote.  There were times in the memo that Emmanuel sounded like Donald Trump in 2016. For example, quote, \"American taxpayers has spent the last 20 years both in blood and treasure building roads, schools and hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. All the while American wages continued to stagnate. People are tired of being treated as chumps. It's time to invest in America again.\" It goes on like this. Emanuel's memo is full of good advice and not just good advice for Democrats. The man wasn't right about everything, obviously, but at least he focuses on the right things.  Most Americans actually aren't obsessed with race. They don't want to memorize 60 new genders, there aren't 60 new genders, there are two genders and everyone knows it. They don't think it's their duty to give American citizenship to everyone on the planet, along with healthcare. Come on. Instead, they have a more basic hope, and it's the hope of people everywhere. They want to feel that the country they were born in is their home. They want leaders who put their interests first, leaders who actually care about their wellbeing.   And yet weirdly, for decades, Washington has refused to supply leaders like that. That's why Donald Trump won in 2016. It's why he could very easily win again in 2020. Because in the end, Americans will always pick a flawed leader over a leader who openly hates them -- every single time.

He called Aristotle and Socrates Greek homos. You know, he said -- and he got his start with the first of the modern racial hoaxes, the Tawana Brawley scandal. This girl, teenage girl, stayed out past her curfew, decided to tell her angry father that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted by a white mob, including a young Assistant District Attorney. It was a giant story in New York, and it was a total racial hoax. And there were two people involved, Sharpton and a black lawyer by the name of C. Vernon Mason, and he ended up getting disbarred. But Tucker, as you well know, a man of God is protected by the First Amendment. They couldn't disbar Al Sharpton and he just went on his merry way. And that's when he had his radio show with the white interlopers remark, six people ended up dead on 125th Street up in Harlem, none of whom were white, by the way. And, you know, he used to run around New York, in a Velour jumpsuit, jumping -- a running suit, he weighed 400 pounds, and he always spoke through a bullhorn. And you know, as you said, he was he was a character in Tom Wolfe's famous novel, \"The Bonfire of the Vanities.\" He was the race hustler. He was Reverend Bacon, he was into steam control. You know, if there was a pressure building up in the community, you could apply the valve through Reverend Bacon. And the most famous incident of steam control with Al Sharpton was -- remember when Comcast was trying to buy NBC for billions of dollars and Al Sharpton said that was bad for the community.

It's the latest chapter in the national debate over the fairness of college admissions, and appears to be another example of wealthier parents gaming the system.

The WSJ reports the case of one Chicago area woman who said she and her husband lived in a home valued at $1.2 million, had a household income of more than $250,000.00 a year but had put little aside for their 17-year-old daughter's education, so they transferred guardianship to the woman's business partner. As a result, the teenager only had to declare $4,200.00 in income from a summer job and ended up getting a $27,000.00 Merit Scholarship and $20,000.00 in need-based aid. The case is being investigated, they are all in Illinois and the University of Illinois says it is looking into the practice saying it quote, \"Takes away resources from middle and low-income students,\" and adding quote, \"This is legal, but we question the ethics.\" Some college consultant companies are allegedly advising parents on how to take advantage of this apparent loophole.

And what sort of business is doing something great for its customers, and doesn't increase the number of its customers? That's a really weird business.

You know, this isn't the only search results they've done this on. Back in January, Breitbart News reported that they did exactly the same thing in search results for abortion, another mainstream political debate in American politics. And again, it was exactly the same thing.

That used to be an easy question to answer. For a hundred years, the answer was higher wages and better benefits. That was back when the Democratic Party was run by people who worked for a living. They cared about how much voters got paid at the end of the week. But that's not a subject that interests the decadent rich very much. The private equity billionaires who fund today's Democratic Party could care less about other people's wages. What they care about most other than making themselves even richer, is feeling virtuous, feeling like a deeply good people, much better than you are. And that's why they're so committed to something called diversity, a concept that nobody is willing to explain, but that nonetheless, we must celebrate enthusiastically and perpetually. Listen to Nancy Pelosi explain."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Okay, got it? \"Diversity is our strength.\" They made that part crystal clear. What is still unclear is what exactly diversity is. What is it? Well, for one thing, diversity is the reason that Allison Jaslow was forced to resign her job in disgrace. Until 24 hours ago, Jaslow was the Executive Director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and then yesterday she quit in tears. She asked her colleagues to forgive her as she packed her things. What did Jaslow do wrong? Well, nothing actually. She didn't hurt anyone. She didn't say anything awful. She didn't mismanage the office. Nobody claimed she did. Jaslow's only sin was having the wrong skin color. On Sunday, two congressional Democrats, Vicente Gonzalez and Filemon Vela demanded that Jaslow be fired from her job and replaced by a person of a different hue. Not a more competent person, they didn't mention that. That was irrelevant. Just a different colored person. That's all that mattered to them. So, they forced a person out of her job for having the wrong genes. Apparently, none of this set off any alarm bells over at the Democratic Party HQ. Apparently, nobody could think of any other time in history where something like this had happened. It didn't seem ominous to them or creepy or racist, it just seemed like diversity, which we must celebrate because it's our strength. That actually happened. The Democratic Party has gone insane. Now, you may think you already knew that, but even if you think you knew it, it's hard to appreciate just how real it is, just how crazy the party has become. The party of ordinary Americans has become a poisonous identity cult obsessed with questions of racial purity. It's terrifying, but it's entirely real. How real is it? Well, Al Sharpton is now a hero on the left. That kind of sums it up. For 40 years, Sharpton chased one hustle after another -- race pimp, F.B.I. informant, corporate shakedown artist, tax cheat. If you told Al Sharpton in 1995 that someday he'd be the moral conscience of the Democratic Party, he would have laughed in your face. And yet here we are, and here he is sermonizing on MSNBC."

      "utterance": "There you have it, the modern Democratic Party so distorted by race guilt that Al Sharpton seems like a moral leader. This is nuts. It's also a recipe for an electoral wipeout. There's a lot about the Democratic Party's economic platform that ordinary voters might like. But this kind of garbage, it's a deal killer, and not just conservative white voters. No normal person of any color will vote for stuff like this. Whatever his many faults, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel does understand that. This week, Emanuel published a memo aimed at the party's presidential candidates. He begged them to return to reality immediately. Here's part of it. Quote. \"Before our party promises healthcare coverage to undocumented immigrants -- a position not even Ted Kennedy took -- let's help the more than 30 million Americans who are a single illness away from financial ruin. Before we start worrying about whether the Boston Marathon bomber can vote, let's stop states that are actively trying to curtail voting rights of citizens. And before we promise a guaranteed minimum income to healthy adults who prefer to stay home and play video games, let's increase the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit to the benefit of the millions of people who still work hard and live near poverty.\" End quote. There were times in the memo that Emmanuel sounded like Donald Trump in 2016. For example, quote, \"American taxpayers has spent the last 20 years both in blood and treasure building roads, schools and hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. All the while American wages continued to stagnate. People are tired of being treated as chumps. It's time to invest in America again.\" It goes on like this. Emanuel's memo is full of good advice and not just good advice for Democrats. The man wasn't right about everything, obviously, but at least he focuses on the right things. Most Americans actually aren't obsessed with race. They don't want to memorize 60 new genders, there aren't 60 new genders, there are two genders and everyone knows it. They don't think it's their duty to give American citizenship to everyone on the planet, along with healthcare. Come on. Instead, they have a more basic hope, and it's the hope of people everywhere. They want to feel that the country they were born in is their home. They want leaders who put their interests first, leaders who actually care about their wellbeing. And yet weirdly, for decades, Washington has refused to supply leaders like that. That's why Donald Trump won in 2016. It's why he could very easily win again in 2020. Because in the end, Americans will always pick a flawed leader over a leader who openly hates them -- every single time. Luis Miranda is a former DNC Communications Director, and he joins us tonight.

He called Aristotle and Socrates Greek homos. You know, he said -- and he got his start with the first of the modern racial hoaxes, the Tawana Brawley scandal. This girl, teenage girl, stayed out past her curfew, decided to tell her angry father that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted by a white mob, including a young Assistant District Attorney. It was a giant story in New York, and it was a total racial hoax. And there were two people involved, Sharpton and a black lawyer by the name of C. Vernon Mason, and he ended up getting disbarred. But Tucker, as you well know, a man of God is protected by the First Amendment. They couldn't disbar Al Sharpton and he just went on his merry way. And that's when he had his radio show with the white interlopers remark, six people ended up dead on 125th Street up in Harlem, none of whom were white, by the way. And, you know, he used to run around New York, in a Velour jumpsuit, jumping -- a running suit, he weighed 400 pounds, and he always spoke through a bullhorn. And you know, as you said, he was he was a character in Tom Wolfe's famous novel, \"The Bonfire of the Vanities.\" He was the race hustler. He was Reverend Bacon, he was into steam control. You know, if there was a pressure building up in the community, you could apply the valve through Reverend Bacon.

And he is the one guy who says, \"Wait, this is unacceptable.\" You know, what the racism is? They say, you know, this is him talking about vermin and that it's an attack on the city. The attack on the city is ignoring this condition. It is this passive racism of every one of all colors, who just look away, because it is the status quo and yet, some people somewhere are making money. A lot of people have power, they want to be in power, and anything that rocks the boat is disturbing, and that is the President's crime. Now, in this case, you've got the media. If the media actually was interested in Baltimore, they would go there. We have Lawrence Jones of Fox Nation. And of course, Fox News, going there interviewing people on the street. And they agree with the President. And they are shocked at the decline of this amazing, powerful American city, because politicians, the Democratic Party, of course, liberal policies, but also the Republicans, not just for Baltimore, but Detroit, and Flint, and Chicago and New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco, city after city that the Republicans have abandoned because they don't feel like explaining the conservative ideal to people who, I don't know, maybe they think won't understand it. Americans regardless of the amount of melatonin in their skin want freedom, they want a future for their families and they've been abandoned by both parties. In comes President Trump saying, \"Wait, what is this going on over there?\" And oh, my gosh, you can't have that. But this is the first step. Finally, some attention. People talking about an infestation of actual rats, of American citizens who probably mostly are Democrats, who deserve better, and who've been abandoned by their own people, because you want people to just be living paycheck to paycheck because otherwise they might actually want something more from government."

I can't even count them on one hand, possessing the firearm in a gun free zone. None of those laws did anything to prevent that shooting.

And they just don't understand that banning guns is going to have nothing to do to solve the problem and everything that it was infringing on people's rights. And we just need to educate them. And as time has gone on, I've just been more and more convinced that they don't care that it's going to do nothing to stop mass shootings. And I can prove it. In this Gilroy, California shooting, this horrible event. We already saw the call for gun control from every anti-gunner out there. They already called for gun control without first even knowing what gun the shooter had, how he got the gun, any of the details of the event, which means they were calling for gun control, well before they knew the efficacy of their current laws, or even what their proposal would even solve. So, that right there was a clear, clear sign to me that they don't care anymore. They're calling for gun control with zero respect for what it would do to solve anything.

They are have something in common and that is they're stripping the ability of the everyday American to defend themselves. That's exactly what happens. We know what happens if you take guns away. People cannot defend themselves, and then other people, we call them criminals. You know, those that don't obey laws, no matter what the law is.

It's the latest chapter in the national debate over the fairness of college admissions, and appears to be another example of wealthier parents gaming the system. But this time, it's not about those parents paying for access, but trying to save themselves money by pretending their children are poor. \"The Wall Street Journal\" was the first to report that the Education Department is now looking into the scam in which parents transfer legal guardianship of their children to relatives or friends, thus enabling the kids to claim financial aid. The WSJ reports the case of one Chicago area woman who said she and her husband lived in a home valued at $1.2 million, had a household income of more than $250,000.00 a year but had put little aside for their 17-year-old daughter's education, so they transferred guardianship to the woman's business partner. As a result, the teenager only had to declare $4,200.00 in income from a summer job and ended up getting a $27,000.00 Merit Scholarship and $20,000.00 in need-based aid. The case is being investigated, they are all in Illinois and the University of Illinois says it is looking into the practice saying it quote, \"Takes away resources from middle and low-income students,\" and adding quote, \"This is legal, but we question the ethics.\" Some college consultant companies are allegedly advising parents on how to take advantage of this apparent loophole. And while all the cases so far uncovered are Illinois based, it seems if it's happening there, it is likely happening right across the country -- Tucker."

They claim it's a meritocracy, but that's a crock and anyone who knows Chelsea Clinton knows it's fake. I mean, keep in mind, Chris Cuomo went to Yale. It's not a real meritocracy. But it's made Harvard and schools like it very rich. Harvard's endowment is almost $40 billion. Princeton, Stanford and Yale are over $20 billion. These endowments currently go completely untaxed. Billionaire Peter Thiel says it's time for that to change. In a recent speech, he said that Harvard and similar schools ought to lose their tax exempt status. We spoke to him shortly after that speech. Here's the conversation."

      "utterance": "Well, I think it used to be that education was seen as something charitable. It used to have a religious basis. It was linked to the exemption for churches. It -- so I think there was a history to this when these were seen as fundamentally, fundamentally charitable institutions. And when they are educating, they are doing a public service. And I think what's changed, what is very different that you alluded to in your intro, is that today, it is -- it's not a positive. Somehow, you're imparting knowledge and you're growing the pie. It is a zero sum tournament, where if you get into a top college, you've won this very exclusive tournament. If you don't, if you go to a lesser college, the diploma is often nothing more than a dunce hat in disguise or something like that. And so the way to think of the -- you know, if the elite colleges were educating people; if Harvard or Stanford were educating people and giving them a great education, they should be just doubling or tripling the enrollment. And what sort of business is doing something great for its customers, and doesn't increase the number of its customers? That's a really weird business. But the closest analogy to business I can come up with is that it's something like the Studio 54 nightclub. You have an incredibly long line outside, only a few people get in and the value comes from being exclusionary. They're not inclusive, they're exclusionary, and that's where the value comes from."

The fact it's more prestigious, and if you're not actually teaching people, you're not adding any value, then you have to do all the selecting up front. Right? If you let in way too many people, it might turn out that you're not actually educating people, and they're no better off than they were before. If you select people who are, you know, incredibly talented up front, or, you know, will get through the gates up front, then you can do that on a smaller scale.

Students can't pay off their debt, if they go to a lesser college especially, you can go bankrupt. If you haven't paid off your college debt by the time you're 65, your Social Security wages are going to get garnished to pay it off. So, there is this big problem with student debt. And, and so if we pretend that all the colleges are like Stanford or Harvard, we're feeding into this debt bubble. And we have to -- and that's why I think it's important for the integrity of the system as a whole to describe the elite colleges for what they are, exclusionary institutions where a few people win a tournament, but they're not sort of somehow representative of the health of the whole university."

      "utterance": "Well, it's ominous enough that Google uses its power of the internet to control how people think. Now, it turns out the company's ideology is being influenced by -- and we're not making this up -- Chris Hayes on MSNBC. Google may be the only entity in the world influenced by Chris Hayes. According to a new report from Breitbart, Google deliberately altered searches on YouTube to suppress certain ideas due to Hayes's complaints. In the fall of 2018, Chris Hayes attacked Google on Twitter, because if you searched Federal Reserve on YouTube, it produce several videos critical of the Federal Reserve and criticizing the Federal Reserve is not allowed, according to Chris Hayes. Well, somebody at Google took note. Soon, Federal Reserve went on YouTube's internal blacklist along with other terms like abortion. So the search algorithm would give priority to certain Google approved news outlets that Chris Hayes favored because again, you're not allowed to criticize the Federal Reserve Bank, according to Chris Hayes. Allum Bokhari is a reporter at Breitbart. He broke this amazing story and joins us tonight. Thanks a lot for coming on. So, did I over simplify that? Google is taking its cues from Chris Hayes?"

      "utterance": "No, that's absolutely correct, Tucker. I mean, we've known for a long while now that Google wants to control what everyone thinks. We now know, thanks to this story, and others like it that left-wing media pundits control what Google thinks. And it's an insane standard they have here. It takes just two or three tweets from a journalist like Chris Hayes to get the most influential video hosting platform on the entire internet controlled by the most powerful company in the world to change its search results. And you know, YouTube says they're just doing this to crack down on conspiracy theories. It's a word they like to use to describe content they don't like. But even if we -- even if we give them that and say that's true, and I see no reason to give them the benefit of the doubt on this, imagine what that says about their users. They're basically saying that their users are morons that can't tell the difference between legitimate news and conspiracy theories, that can't tell fact from fiction. It just speaks of the broader problem of an elite that treats ordinary people with absolute contempt and thinks they are total morons."

      "utterance": "Well, it's not even a left-right divide, it's any challenge to the status quo, whether it's what the Federal Reserve or vaccines -- that's another topic that they don't want you to think outside the lines on that question. It is not allowed at all. Why is YouTube, Google and Chris Hayes? Why are they suddenly guardians of the status quo?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOKHARI",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a total reversal in what the internet was supposed to be. It was supposed to mean an end to gatekeepers. YouTube was supposed to be this platform, its old motto was \"Broadcast Yourself.\" A platform where anyone, you know, just ordinary people had a voice. Instead, it's evolving into this platform that's, you know, run by Chris Hayes and run by left wing journalists, who get to decide what you can see and ultimately, what you can think. You know, this isn't the only search results they've done this on. Back in January, Breitbart News reported that they did exactly the same thing in search results for abortion, another mainstream political debate in American politics. And again, it was exactly the same thing. First, a left-wing journalist from Slate complained to Google and within a few hours, they had gone into their search results and remove all pro-life videos from the top 10 results. It's amazing."
