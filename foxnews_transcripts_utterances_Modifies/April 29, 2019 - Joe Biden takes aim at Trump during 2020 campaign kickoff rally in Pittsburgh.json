The union vote is an interesting one. He talks about getting those endorsements. But President Trump has a point in a lot of ways because, as we have seen over the past decade, we have seen a movement of right to work laws being placed all around the country, state legislatures, because people don't want to be forced into unions, and right-to-work states have actually won that argument.   And so unions actually have a lot less political capital than they used to. Now, that doesn't go to say that President Trump doesn't have to make sure that he campaigns to try to get those voters, but Joe Biden has to make the case that an 100 counties that President Trump flipped from President Obama, who Joe Biden of course served under, deserve to be back in Democratic hands. Joe Biden talks about things like bringing coal jobs back, or unions, he's going to actually have to answer for some of the policies that he stood by and watched President Obama when it came to overregulation, coal industry going out of power, 51,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, for example, manufacturing going way while the Trump administration has bought 5,000 of those jobs back. So when it comes to the unions, they have less power now than they did, but they are trying to get at the same voter when it comes to tussling for the ones that flipped from blue to red in 2016.",
