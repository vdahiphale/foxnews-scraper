      "sentences": "All right. Well, welcome to “Hannity.” Yes, the crazy Democrats exposed. Let not your heart be troubled.  Breaking news, multiple fronts tonight -- oh, the great one Mark Levin, I just checked in with him, he is fired up and he will be joining us tonight. Lara Trump joins us tonight.  So many of you have been asking -- we have the history -- two days after President Trump is elected, impeachment, impeachment started. All through 2017, ‘18, ‘19 -- we got it all covered. We've got the long version but we can't play it every night because it takes too long. Anyway, that's coming up.  Plus, mystery surrounding the identity of the non-whistleblower, hearsay whistleblower who kicked off this insane new Ukrainian witch hunt. One report, Paul Sperry, \"Real Clear Investigations\" of \"Real Clear Politics\" claiming a Trump-hating deep state operative with close ties, oh, to Joe Biden, oh, and Trump hater, former CIA director, the corrupt Brennan and the staffers working for the compromised, corrupt congenital liar Adam Schiff. Shocking. And Sperry reports that he also has ties to the very same DNC operative that helped the Clinton campaign, went to the Ukrainian embassy to get dirt on Donald Trump and his associates and coordinated and colluded with Ukraine to impact the 2016 election.  Now, we are now looking down the barrel of yet another national crisis clearly orchestrated by the deep state, a hit job that will not go unchallenged. Let me be very clear here tonight, because on this program - - now, we're going to wait, we always give due process and presumption of innocence, we're not going to reveal a person's identity that everybody in Washington is talking about until we can independently confirm the facts. That's just fairness. Also breaking moments ago, another star witness in -- yes, the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Schiff's secret Soviet-style coup impeachment coup attempt just again obliterated the Democrats' narrative. That's why they are doing it behind closed doors. They're getting a crap beat out of them every night.  I talked to my sources, another disastrous day for Democrats and that's why they are staying behind closed doors. That's why they are using the Soviet-style impeachment proceeding and Democrats are all giddy -- remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's interpretation of the call? We don't need his interpretation.   Well, his boss testified today and literally obliterated and blasted his interpretation and a story out of the water today and more importantly, destroyed the phony lie and narrative that the mob and media has been pushing with the transcript was changed. Top national security official, yes, he was the boss -- his name is Tim Morrison. He testified nothing illegal took place during the president's call with Ukraine. Quote: I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed. He also interestingly said the transcript accurately and completely reflects the substance of the call. Wow, that blows the whole thing out of the water. And, Morrison reportedly testified he was concerned the contents of the call would be leaked to the media, shocking for pretty good reason because only this president has already had multiple conversations -- let's see, with prime ministers, presidents, heads of state -- leaked. This has not happened to any other president, so, of course, he was suspicious.   You would think this testimony from a key top official would cause at least some of the so-called moderate Democrats -- they say they're moderate -- to put the brakes on the impeachment madness and psychosis and rage against Trump, but not a chance, because today, despite Morrison's remarks, only two Democrats voted to give a green light to the corrupt compromise and that's who Adam Schiff is, congenital liar -- he has been lying to us for three years, Adam Schiff. So, with the exception of one congressman named Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew, who we told you about last night, every other Democrat, take a look at that list. Those from swing districts, districts that Trump won, they voted to go along with this madness with zero due process, none, a compromised corrupt congenital liar leading the lawless, unconstitutional witch hunt. Many of the lawmakers on your screen, they all ran on a partisan platform, a bipartisan platform. They want to reach across the aisle and work together and focus on fixing and helping the lives of Americans. And some even said impeachment is a really bad idea but they went along anyway.  When push came to shove and their arms were twisted by Pelosi and company and the squad, they caved, every one of them -- take a look.",

      "sentences": "Words are cheap, they all folded, they all lied to their constituents, because the people you saw -- yes, they gave into the pressure. They're con artists. They're not working for their constituents. Instead, they always toe the party line or whatever Schiff and Pelosi in the squad wants, that's what they are going to vote for.  That's why they all caved and voted to give this incredible impeachment- obsessed, compromised, congenital liar. Remember, he has total control that nut, that lunatic. He's been lying for three years.   They did this despite having no public access to any evidence, no hearings, no transcripts, nothing, no due process. These are the rules. Under Newt Gingrich during Bill Clinton's impeachment, Newt Gingrich afforded Bill Clinton -- the House openly debated, they held an official vote, the president had the ability to call witnesses, his attorney did submit evidence, build a case, and a chance to talk to every witness. But the corrupt, compromised Schiff -- he just has full, complete veto power, like a dictator. He can control the witness list, the rules, the evidence, and there's nothing you can do. No fair hearings, no ability to mount any defense, no rights of the accused.  In fact, we don't even know what the charges are. And Schiff, we know, lying to us for all these years, psychotic Trump hater. He's a judge, jury, and executioner, and what is only a public show trial to decide to convince the American people the president deserves to be impeached for what we don't know.  We're told the majority of witnesses had heard nothing wrong with the call that we have a transcript to, but they're not going to be asked to testify publicly. Wait, watch and see, that's how corrupt he is and Pelosi is. This is the Soviet Union style on steroids, and so far, it's all been conducted in secret by a guy that is a fact witness and compromised in the very case caught in more lies and I could even ever count. A guy is a totally compromised individual himself, because his office, remember, we know they were coordinating with the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower from the very beginning.   Now, that's just a fact. We'd like to know what was said, where they met, did he offer him an attorney, he did advise to go to the inspector general? Because like we said, there are reports revealing that this whistle- blower's name and identity was anti-Trump, pro Biden, a deep state operative, friends with Brennan with a penchant for leaking. On this program, we are going to independently verify all of the information but what we do know already it's chilling. Partisan Democrat colluded with Schiff's office. We need to know what happened. That also, this individual supports Biden and worked for the -- yes, Brennan -- we are going to learn a lot about Brennan. Trust me, we're learning a lot about Brennan in the days and weeks to come.  So, Republicans now must demand answers. They must demand to know the extent of this person's contact with Schiff's office. They must demand to know if he abused his power while in government. They must demand answers on his relationship with Biden, Brennan, the DNC, and while they are at it, America needs -- we are going to have transcripts released, I want the transcript of every call with sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe Biden. That was the guy who was involved with a real quid pro quo in Ukraine.  We want every call between Barack Hussein Obama and Vladimir Putin after Obama promised more flexibility after his election. I'd also like the transcripts of the calls between Obama and Iranian leaders leading up to Obama making the dumbest deal in the history of mankind, and giving the radical mullahs of Iran the chant \"Death to America, death to Israel\", $150 billion. It's time now for fairness. We now need to demand those transcripts, because what's fair is fair, right? And regardless of the whistle-blower's identity, the ongoing witch hunt conducted by Schiff, supported now by all but two Democrats, it's only the latest in what has been a three-year lawless, unconstitutional, bitterly partisan coup attempt. They have never accepted the election results, nor did they accept four separate investigations that proved in spite of what they were telling the American people there was Trump-Russia collusion. And they ignored the dossier of Hillary the whole time, the dirty Russia dossier. Devoid of any justice, totally attached from reality.   Americans are fair-minded, that I can say tonight for certainty. They will see this for what it is, the corruption. Frankly, this is the filthiest and most repulsive raw, political act that in my 31 years of doing talk radio and my 24th year here at Fox that I have ever seen.  Just a few months ago, Speaker Pelosi actually told \"The Washington Post\" - - kind of ironic -- \"impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there is something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, it will divide the country. Oh, Adam Schiff said at the time, if the evidence isn't sufficient to win bipartisan support for this, putting the country through a failed impeachment is not a good idea. He is doing it.  Jerrold Nadler: Impeachment should not be partisan. It's partisan because every single Republican today in the House of Representatives stood united and strong against the psychosis and injustice, and the witch trial.  Everyone as it turns out, Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler, they lied again. They are major-league hypocrites controlled by the radical socialist base. Let me tell you how this will likely play out. Without any due process at all, the psychotic rage-filled Trumpeting Democrats will vote to impeach Donald Trump and the president will be vindicated in the Senate by probably almost all the senators, if not all of them. Without due process, now the U.S. Senate needs to send a very loud message to their corrupt House colleagues and teach them a lesson about the Constitution. If you're not going to allow due process, we will dismiss this on day one. So far, that's every indication of what will happen.  And the best part is today, we are one year and three days away from the election. That's right, and that means that we the American people, you, the American people, not Schiff, not Pelosi, not Adler -- Nadler, not the squad, not AOC, you get to decide and you get to reelect Donald Trump. The people will get their say. Now, who knows what they are capable of in the next year? We know what they did before the last election and after the last election, but the cold hard truth is anything between now and November 2020, it is political noise and political theater. They have done nothing for you the American people. They have done nothing, they have just tried to hate Trump harder and harder every day and they have been frustrated because they haven't been able to get what they want.   But sad reality is, Democrats, the mob and the media, their allies in the swamp, they have never sunk so low. It should be a sad day for America, I'm not so sad because I think all they are doing is helping Donald Trump. They are becoming the biggest contributor to the Trump campaign, the reelection campaign.  Now, they have completely and totally detach themselves from reality, their sole mission surrounds this irrational, psychotic, never-ending hatred of President Trump, the mere name of which triggers them all. And, by the way, there is also a deep hatred for we the people, the smelly Walmart shoppers, the irredeemable deplorables that cling to God, I believe in, our guns, our Second Amendment rights, our bibles and religion. Yes. There is a deep contempt for Americans. Now, this vote, by the way, this is just the latest coup attempt, one middle finger, one more deranged scream and yell from a group of people throwing a temper tantrum because they lost and never accepted the results of the 2016 election and were let down by four separate Russian investigations. They were counting on Robert Mueller to do this for them. Now, they are going to do it themselves and make it up as they go. We'll have more of my monologue in a moment, first, joining us with all the details of what happens next -- in others, the hitchhikers guide to this impeachment coup attempt. Anyway, FOX News senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram is with us.   All right, Chad, you know all things Washington. Let's go through the process, so everybody knows.",

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER",
      "sentences": "Sure, Sean. So, let's look under the hood and the mechanics of the vote today in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided from the chair on the dais in the House chamber at the start of the debate. Pelosi also announced the result at the end. Pelosi's participation was emblematic of how important the speaker thought the vote was, no Republicans backed the measure, the united front sent a message to President Trump that Congressional Republicans stand behind him for square. But the unanimous GOP vote also sent a message to the U.S. Senate, a few defections could have indicated there were cracks in the GOP rearguard ahead of a possible Senate impeachment trial.   Meantime, the Democrats only lost two of their own, moderate Democrat Jeff Van Drew, a freshman, and also, Minnesota's Collin Peterson, both represent battleground districts which the president won in 2016.  But House majorities have the majority so they can lose a few members and still prevail on big votes. Now, today's vote codifies the impeachment road map. But what's remarkable about this is just how little we know regarding what's next. We don't know the timeline, we also don't know if the president would ever have the opportunity to defend himself. Now, Doug Collins is a top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, he argued that his panel may try to call House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. With President Clinton's impeachment in 1998, the Judiciary Committee heard from independent counsel Ken Starr, the president's accuser. Then, Mr. Clinton's counsel, David Kendall, questioned Starr in the Judiciary Committee. Collins argues that Schiff is essentially the accuser, Republicans would like to question Schiff the same way President Clinton's council challenged Ken Starr.  Democrats crafted the resolution so that Schiff has ball control right now and may never cede to the Judiciary Committee until the end. Now, sometime, in the next couple of weeks, the House will likely release transcripts of the depositions. That will be the first public peek into what is going behind closed doors, and it will be a sprint to write articles of impeachment before Christmas. Notably, Sean, that matches the Clinton timeline in 1998. The House impeached President Clinton on the Saturday before Christmas.  Back to you.",

Election interference and whether they like it or not, Joe Biden is corrupt and so is his son. LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN 2020: Sean, that was quite a montage there, you're right it does take up a lot of air time. We can probably do an entire 24 hours on Fox News of their impeachment obsession. Here's the bottom line here, they are so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump because in their minds he should have never won in 2016, they're still upset about that. They know that there is no way to beat him at the ballot box in 2020 and the problem they have is that Donald Trump doesn't play by their rules. He's the ultimate outsider, and instead of going in there and playing with the good old boys club and lining the pockets of corrupt politicians like has been done for years, Donald Trump is there and he's not buying into any of that. He's there working for the American people and he threaten their way of life. It has been really good for them in Washington for so long but the swamp is being drained by Donald Trump every day so they have to do something. They are so desperate Sean, this is it. They are so desperate to get him out of office. They know this is the only shot they have. And it's kind of sad you know you heard Nancy Pelosi back in March say that the only way she would bring impeachment forward as if it was a bipartisan effort, if it had bipartisan support. We saw today Sean, there was bipartisan support against impeachment though. No Republicans voted for impeachment and in fact two Democrats voted against impeachment yet here we are. And I think it's very obvious to the American people. But the good news is that despite all of this, Donald Trump every single day is doing the opposite of what Congress is doing, he's working for the American people.",

You are right, this is a gift for us and in fact our internal polling shows that Donald Trump's support has gone up thanks to the impeachment inquiry, since Nancy Pelosi called for this we have seen numbers go up since June in a head-to-head matchup with Joe Biden, we have increased ten points with women alone Sean.

Author of the next \"The New York Times\" best seller \"Unfreedom of the Press,\" I call him \"The Great One\" he hosts \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" right here on the Fox News Channel Nationally Syndicated Radio Talk show host. You, Great One, I said this to you privately to you the other day and I'm going to say it publicly. This is where you shine, this is your wheelhouse. You know this law backwards and forwards. I turn it over to you because I talk to you before the show and I know you've got a lot to say. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS' AUTHOR: Well, thank you. Here's what I want to start off by saying. What exactly is the issue here? What exactly is the impeachable issue here? The Ukrainian President said \"no pressure, no quid pro quo\" He didn't know military aid was temporary withheld, and the President has every right to temporarily withhold military aid for any damn reason he wants to and it has done before by other Presidents. The phone call itself, we have the phone itself. The President declassified it, you can't find a single tie between military aid and a request for the 2016 investigation and even if you do, it's perfectly legal. But there isn't there isn't. You can't ask the Ukrainian government to assist you in the 2016 criminal investigation that is being led by the Attorney General? Of course you can. Even though it might get to the bottom of the Hillary campaign and the DNC that worked with Ukraine and the Obama Administration, President of the United States is free to do that and if he did do that, good for him. You can't mention the Biden's? Why because Joe Biden is running for office for the 412 time? Well, Mueller got assistance from 13 governments in his Special Counsel investigation I don't remember hearing a single complaint from anybody, just because somebody is running for office doesn't mean they are immune from investigations. The President of the United States said it as passively as possible. Meanwhile, Ukraine got the military aid and the Bidens are still running free. You want to talk about interfering with an election, Biden is interfering with an election - he supports impeaching the President, does that help the election? The Democrats are interfering with the election, that's a whole purpose of what they are doing? They are trying to reverse the 2016 election and influence of 2020 election, how do I know? This is the first time in American history a process like this so Baxter dies in the impeachment clause has ever been used against a President, a federal judge or any official in the United States government. So there is no issue of impeachment, high crimes and misdemeanors, treason, bribery, no issue of criminality when it comes to the President, so what's the issue? Now we have found the rats nest, it's in the National Security Council. The whistleblower according to a number of reports as you have been saying here tonight comes off the National Security Council, an Obama holdover - a Democrat. Somebody who worked with Biden, somebody who worked with Brennan, an Obama holdover who didn't like Trump, who met with one of the active figures in the Ukraine efforts to undermine the President of the United States in 2016. We have two others who now were hired by Schiff, Obama holders who were in the Trump National Security Council, now they work for Schiff and how much you want to bet one of them was the one that he colluded with. And of course Schiff doesn't know anything about it. If you want to know why the President of the United States had trouble bringing in his own people into the National Security Counsil and getting clearances, now you know why? Because it's a rats nest. And by the way, I think U.S. Attorney Durham and the Attorney General of the United States ought to have an investigation of these three National Security Council former staffers, what role if did they have in the Ukraine 2016 matter interfering with the election? What role did they have pushing the Russia collusion matter? Where they leaker's? I think the criminal investigation - the Hill with Schiff - he ought to get into these three and find out exactly what they did and there may be more of them. Then we have Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. You can trash Mike Flynn, you can trash Holly North and you can trash anybody who served in the military but not Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. Deep inside that \"New York Times\" piece Sean, it said that Colonel Vindman had provided advice to the Ukrainian government mostly in English - what the hell does that mean? He's working for the Commander in Chief of the United States. He is on the National Security Council. He's an active duty Lieutenant Colonel, why are you giving advice to Ukraine? Nobody is following up on that. I'm just curious, what was that all about? Adam Schiff, you are a key fact material witness. You hired those two Obama staffers, your staffers are one of them met with the Former National Security staffer to the President of the United States, you are trying to protect your staffers and protect this phony whistleblower and you are trying to protect the Democrats from 2016 and what they tried to do to candidate Trump. It's all in \"POLITICO\" and it's all in \"The New York Times\" even though they don't want to admit it. Now Donald Trump has been investigated by the Southern District of New York, by the Special Counsel, he's been investigated by multiple Committees in Congress, hundreds of subpoenas have been issued against him, his businesses, his taxes, his bank accounts, his family members, but Joe Biden - you can't interfere with the election, Joe Biden is running for office again, he's been running for office since he was nine years old, now he's 103. Joe is running again, you're not allowed to look into Joe Biden, that's interfering in a foreign election - sure it is. And by the way you can't ask foreign governments for help? How do you get help in investigating somebody when the events occurred overseas? The FBI does this all the time we investigate people for drug prosecutions, investment prosecutions, money laundering with the assistance of foreign governments all the time. The President of the United States hasn't done anything at all. Why do the Democrats keep lying? Here is with they passed today, seven and half pages of B.S. Here's what they did in 1998, a long discussion of the President's rights. The President has a right to counsel, to cross-examine, to have his own witnesses and so forth and so on. You know what they said today? They said the Chair of the Committee including such procedures has allowed the participation of the President and his Counsel, how did they get to participate? We don't know, this is the biggest disgusting scandal and it is all on the Democrat Party that has hijacked the impeachment process, our tax dollars, the House of Representatives to push their 2020 election. That is what it's going on, that's it.",

Breaking news, multiple fronts tonight -- oh, the great one Mark Levin, I just checked in with him, he is fired up and he will be joining us tonight. Lara Trump joins us tonight. So many of you have been asking -- we have the history -- two days after President Trump is elected, impeachment, impeachment started. All through 2017, ‘18, ‘19 -- we got it all covered. We've got the long version but we can't play it every night because it takes too long. Anyway, that's coming up. Plus, mystery surrounding the identity of the non-whistleblower, hearsay whistleblower who kicked off this insane new Ukrainian witch hunt. One report, Paul Sperry, \"Real Clear Investigations\" of \"Real Clear Politics\" claiming a Trump-hating deep state operative with close ties, oh, to Joe Biden, oh, and Trump hater, former CIA director, the corrupt Brennan and the staffers working for the compromised, corrupt congenital liar Adam Schiff. Shocking. And Sperry reports that he also has ties to the very same DNC operative that helped the Clinton campaign, went to the Ukrainian embassy to get dirt on Donald Trump and his associates and coordinated and colluded with Ukraine to impact the 2016 election. Now, we are now looking down the barrel of yet another national crisis clearly orchestrated by the deep state, a hit job that will not go unchallenged. Let me be very clear here tonight, because on this program - - now, we're going to wait, we always give due process and presumption of innocence, we're not going to reveal a person's identity that everybody in Washington is talking about until we can independently confirm the facts. That's just fairness. Also breaking moments ago, another star witness in -- yes, the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Schiff's secret Soviet-style coup impeachment coup attempt just again obliterated the Democrats' narrative. That's why they are doing it behind closed doors. They're getting a crap beat out of them every night. I talked to my sources, another disastrous day for Democrats and that's why they are staying behind closed doors. That's why they are using the Soviet-style impeachment proceeding and Democrats are all giddy -- remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's interpretation of the call? We don't need his interpretation. Well, his boss testified today and literally obliterated and blasted his interpretation and a story out of the water today and more importantly, destroyed the phony lie and narrative that the mob and media has been pushing with the transcript was changed. Top national security official, yes, he was the boss -- his name is Tim Morrison. He testified nothing illegal took place during the president's call with Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Quote",
      "utterance": "I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed. He also interestingly said the transcript accurately and completely reflects the substance of the call. Wow, that blows the whole thing out of the water. And, Morrison reportedly testified he was concerned the contents of the call would be leaked to the media, shocking for pretty good reason because only this president has already had multiple conversations -- let's see, with prime ministers, presidents, heads of state -- leaked. This has not happened to any other president, so, of course, he was suspicious. You would think this testimony from a key top official would cause at least some of the so-called moderate Democrats -- they say they're moderate -- to put the brakes on the impeachment madness and psychosis and rage against Trump, but not a chance, because today, despite Morrison's remarks, only two Democrats voted to give a green light to the corrupt compromise and that's who Adam Schiff is, congenital liar -- he has been lying to us for three years, Adam Schiff. So, with the exception of one congressman named Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew, who we told you about last night, every other Democrat, take a look at that list. Those from swing districts, districts that Trump won, they voted to go along with this madness with zero due process, none, a compromised corrupt congenital liar leading the lawless, unconstitutional witch hunt. Many of the lawmakers on your screen, they all ran on a partisan platform, a bipartisan platform. They want to reach across the aisle and work together and focus on fixing and helping the lives of Americans. And some even said impeachment is a really bad idea but they went along anyway. When push came to shove and their arms were twisted by Pelosi and company and the squad, they caved, every one of them -- take a look."

      "utterance": "Words are cheap, they all folded, they all lied to their constituents, because the people you saw -- yes, they gave into the pressure. They're con artists. They're not working for their constituents. Instead, they always toe the party line or whatever Schiff and Pelosi in the squad wants, that's what they are going to vote for. That's why they all caved and voted to give this incredible impeachment- obsessed, compromised, congenital liar. Remember, he has total control that nut, that lunatic. He's been lying for three years. They did this despite having no public access to any evidence, no hearings, no transcripts, nothing, no due process. These are the rules. Under Newt Gingrich during Bill Clinton's impeachment, Newt Gingrich afforded Bill Clinton -- the House openly debated, they held an official vote, the president had the ability to call witnesses, his attorney did submit evidence, build a case, and a chance to talk to every witness. But the corrupt, compromised Schiff -- he just has full, complete veto power, like a dictator. He can control the witness list, the rules, the evidence, and there's nothing you can do. No fair hearings, no ability to mount any defense, no rights of the accused. In fact, we don't even know what the charges are. And Schiff, we know, lying to us for all these years, psychotic Trump hater. He's a judge, jury, and executioner, and what is only a public show trial to decide to convince the American people the president deserves to be impeached for what we don't know. We're told the majority of witnesses had heard nothing wrong with the call that we have a transcript to, but they're not going to be asked to testify publicly. Wait, watch and see, that's how corrupt he is and Pelosi is. This is the Soviet Union style on steroids, and so far, it's all been conducted in secret by a guy that is a fact witness and compromised in the very case caught in more lies and I could even ever count. A guy is a totally compromised individual himself, because his office, remember, we know they were coordinating with the non-whistle-blower whistle-blower from the very beginning. Now, that's just a fact. We'd like to know what was said, where they met, did he offer him an attorney, he did advise to go to the inspector general? Because like we said, there are reports revealing that this whistle- blower's name and identity was anti-Trump, pro Biden, a deep state operative, friends with Brennan with a penchant for leaking. On this program, we are going to independently verify all of the information but what we do know already it's chilling. Partisan Democrat colluded with Schiff's office. We need to know what happened. That also, this individual supports Biden and worked for the -- yes, Brennan -- we are going to learn a lot about Brennan. Trust me, we're learning a lot about Brennan in the days and weeks to come. So, Republicans now must demand answers. They must demand to know the extent of this person's contact with Schiff's office. They must demand to know if he abused his power while in government. They must demand answers on his relationship with Biden, Brennan, the DNC, and while they are at it, America needs -- we are going to have transcripts released, I want the transcript of every call with sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe Biden. That was the guy who was involved with a real quid pro quo in Ukraine. We want every call between Barack Hussein Obama and Vladimir Putin after Obama promised more flexibility after his election. I'd also like the transcripts of the calls between Obama and Iranian leaders leading up to Obama making the dumbest deal in the history of mankind, and giving the radical mullahs of Iran the chant \"Death to America, death to Israel\", $150 billion. It's time now for fairness. We now need to demand those transcripts, because what's fair is fair, right? And regardless of the whistle-blower's identity, the ongoing witch hunt conducted by Schiff, supported now by all but two Democrats, it's only the latest in what has been a three-year lawless, unconstitutional, bitterly partisan coup attempt. They have never accepted the election results, nor did they accept four separate investigations that proved in spite of what they were telling the American people there was Trump-Russia collusion. And they ignored the dossier of Hillary the whole time, the dirty Russia dossier. Devoid of any justice, totally attached from reality. Americans are fair-minded, that I can say tonight for certainty. They will see this for what it is, the corruption. Frankly, this is the filthiest and most repulsive raw, political act that in my 31 years of doing talk radio and my 24th year here at Fox that I have ever seen. Just a few months ago, Speaker Pelosi actually told \"The Washington Post\" - - kind of ironic -- \"impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there is something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, it will divide the country. Oh, Adam Schiff said at the time, if the evidence isn't sufficient to win bipartisan support for this, putting the country through a failed impeachment is not a good idea. He is doing it."

      "speaker": "Jerrold Nadler",
      "utterance": "Impeachment should not be partisan. It's partisan because every single Republican today in the House of Representatives stood united and strong against the psychosis and injustice, and the witch trial. Everyone as it turns out, Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler, they lied again. They are major-league hypocrites controlled by the radical socialist base. Let me tell you how this will likely play out. Without any due process at all, the psychotic rage-filled Trumpeting Democrats will vote to impeach Donald Trump and the president will be vindicated in the Senate by probably almost all the senators, if not all of them. Without due process, now the U.S. Senate needs to send a very loud message to their corrupt House colleagues and teach them a lesson about the Constitution. If you're not going to allow due process, we will dismiss this on day one. So far, that's every indication of what will happen. And the best part is today, we are one year and three days away from the election. That's right, and that means that we the American people, you, the American people, not Schiff, not Pelosi, not Adler -- Nadler, not the squad, not AOC, you get to decide and you get to reelect Donald Trump. The people will get their say. Now, who knows what they are capable of in the next year? We know what they did before the last election and after the last election, but the cold hard truth is anything between now and November 2020, it is political noise and political theater. They have done nothing for you the American people. They have done nothing, they have just tried to hate Trump harder and harder every day and they have been frustrated because they haven't been able to get what they want. But sad reality is, Democrats, the mob and the media, their allies in the swamp, they have never sunk so low. It should be a sad day for America, I'm not so sad because I think all they are doing is helping Donald Trump. They are becoming the biggest contributor to the Trump campaign, the reelection campaign. Now, they have completely and totally detach themselves from reality, their sole mission surrounds this irrational, psychotic, never-ending hatred of President Trump, the mere name of which triggers them all. And, by the way, there is also a deep hatred for we the people, the smelly Walmart shoppers, the irredeemable deplorables that cling to God, I believe in, our guns, our Second Amendment rights, our bibles and religion. Yes. There is a deep contempt for Americans. Now, this vote, by the way, this is just the latest coup attempt, one middle finger, one more deranged scream and yell from a group of people throwing a temper tantrum because they lost and never accepted the results of the 2016 election and were let down by four separate Russian investigations. They were counting on Robert Mueller to do this for them. Now, they are going to do it themselves and make it up as they go. We'll have more of my monologue in a moment, first, joining us with all the details of what happens next -- in others, the hitchhikers guide to this impeachment coup attempt. Anyway, FOX News senior Capitol Hill producer Chad Pergram is with us. All right, Chad, you know all things Washington. Let's go through the process, so everybody knows."

      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER",
      "utterance": "Sure, Sean. So, let's look under the hood and the mechanics of the vote today in the House of Representatives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided from the chair on the dais in the House chamber at the start of the debate. Pelosi also announced the result at the end. Pelosi's participation was emblematic of how important the speaker thought the vote was, no Republicans backed the measure, the united front sent a message to President Trump that Congressional Republicans stand behind him for square. But the unanimous GOP vote also sent a message to the U.S. Senate, a few defections could have indicated there were cracks in the GOP rearguard ahead of a possible Senate impeachment trial. Meantime, the Democrats only lost two of their own, moderate Democrat Jeff Van Drew, a freshman, and also, Minnesota's Collin Peterson, both represent battleground districts which the president won in 2016. But House majorities have the majority so they can lose a few members and still prevail on big votes. Now, today's vote codifies the impeachment road map. But what's remarkable about this is just how little we know regarding what's next. We don't know the timeline, we also don't know if the president would ever have the opportunity to defend himself. Now, Doug Collins is a top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, he argued that his panel may try to call House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. With President Clinton's impeachment in 1998, the Judiciary Committee heard from independent counsel Ken Starr, the president's accuser. Then, Mr. Clinton's counsel, David Kendall, questioned Starr in the Judiciary Committee. Collins argues that Schiff is essentially the accuser, Republicans would like to question Schiff the same way President Clinton's council challenged Ken Starr. Democrats crafted the resolution so that Schiff has ball control right now and may never cede to the Judiciary Committee until the end. Now, sometime, in the next couple of weeks, the House will likely release transcripts of the depositions. That will be the first public peek into what is going behind closed doors, and it will be a sprint to write articles of impeachment before Christmas. Notably, Sean, that matches the Clinton timeline in 1998. The House impeached President Clinton on the Saturday before Christmas. Back to you."

So, hopefully, we'll get the transcripts at some point. They said they were going to have public hearings but, look, when you do this in secret, in the bunker, in the basement of the capitol, where the American people can't see it, I think -- I think they understand this is a flawed process to the nth degree, and the American people get it. It's unfair. It's partisan and I don't think they're going to stand for it.

Okay, they started two days after he was elected, 2017, 2018, 2019, they still don't have a reason, the transcript isn't a reason, the transcript frankly shows the President doing his job. Election interference and whether they like it or not, Joe Biden is corrupt and so is his son. LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISOR FOR TRUMP CAMPAIGN 2020: Sean, that was quite a montage there, you're right it does take up a lot of air time. We can probably do an entire 24 hours on Fox News of their impeachment obsession. Here's the bottom line here, they are so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump because in their minds he should have never won in 2016, they're still upset about that. They know that there is no way to beat him at the ballot box in 2020 and the problem they have is that Donald Trump doesn't play by their rules. He's the ultimate outsider, and instead of going in there and playing with the good old boys club and lining the pockets of corrupt politicians like has been done for years, Donald Trump is there and he's not buying into any of that. He's there working for the American people and he threaten their way of life. It has been really good for them in Washington for so long but the swamp is being drained by Donald Trump every day so they have to do something. They are so desperate Sean, this is it. They are so desperate to get him out of office. They know this is the only shot they have. And it's kind of sad you know you heard Nancy Pelosi back in March say that the only way she would bring impeachment forward as if it was a bipartisan effort, if it had bipartisan support. We saw today Sean, there was bipartisan support against impeachment though. No Republicans voted for impeachment and in fact two Democrats voted against impeachment yet here we are. And I think it's very obvious to the American people. But the good news is that despite all of this, Donald Trump every single day is doing the opposite of what Congress is doing, he's working for the American people."

The timing is probably now going to be perfect. So I actually see this as you are in charge of Trump 2020, to me they are giving you the biggest campaign donation possible. The American people see this for what it is this has been three years of doing nothing for the American people and obsessing over this."

You are right, this is a gift for us and in fact our internal polling shows that Donald Trump's support has gone up thanks to the impeachment inquiry, since Nancy Pelosi called for this we have seen numbers go up since June in a head-to-head matchup with Joe Biden, we have increased ten points with women alone Sean. With independent voters and young voters, we'd gone up even more than that. We can let them keep going with this because the American people are not distracted by this. The American people feel every single day with this President has done for them and they are not going to be swayed by some nonsensical sham impeachment, some coup against the President because I think they see this for what it is and I agree with you, I think it only helps us every day.

      "utterance": "And remember Baghdadi dead and we have record low unemployment for every demographic. Lara Trump, thank you I appreciate you being with us. Author of the next \"The New York Times\" best seller \"Unfreedom of the Press,\" I call him \"The Great One\" he hosts \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" right here on the Fox News Channel Nationally Syndicated Radio Talk show host. You, Great One, I said this to you privately to you the other day and I'm going to say it publicly. This is where you shine, this is your wheelhouse. You know this law backwards and forwards. I turn it over to you because I talk to you before the show and I know you've got a lot to say. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS' AUTHOR: Well, thank you. Here's what I want to start off by saying. What exactly is the issue here? What exactly is the impeachable issue here? The Ukrainian President said \"no pressure, no quid pro quo\" He didn't know military aid was temporary withheld, and the President has every right to temporarily withhold military aid for any damn reason he wants to and it has done before by other Presidents. The phone call itself, we have the phone itself. The President declassified it, you can't find a single tie between military aid and a request for the 2016 investigation and even if you do, it's perfectly legal. But there isn't there isn't. You can't ask the Ukrainian government to assist you in the 2016 criminal investigation that is being led by the Attorney General? Of course you can. Even though it might get to the bottom of the Hillary campaign and the DNC that worked with Ukraine and the Obama Administration, President of the United States is free to do that and if he did do that, good for him. You can't mention the Biden's? Why because Joe Biden is running for office for the 412 time? Well, Mueller got assistance from 13 governments in his Special Counsel investigation I don't remember hearing a single complaint from anybody, just because somebody is running for office doesn't mean they are immune from investigations. The President of the United States said it as passively as possible. Meanwhile, Ukraine got the military aid and the Bidens are still running free. You want to talk about interfering with an election, Biden is interfering with an election - he supports impeaching the President, does that help the election? The Democrats are interfering with the election, that's a whole purpose of what they are doing? They are trying to reverse the 2016 election and influence of 2020 election, how do I know? This is the first time in American history a process like this so Baxter dies in the impeachment clause has ever been used against a President, a federal judge or any official in the United States government. So there is no issue of impeachment, high crimes and misdemeanors, treason, bribery, no issue of criminality when it comes to the President, so what's the issue? Now we have found the rats nest, it's in the National Security Council. The whistleblower according to a number of reports as you have been saying here tonight comes off the National Security Council, an Obama holdover - a Democrat. Somebody who worked with Biden, somebody who worked with Brennan, an Obama holdover who didn't like Trump, who met with one of the active figures in the Ukraine efforts to undermine the President of the United States in 2016. We have two others who now were hired by Schiff, Obama holders who were in the Trump National Security Council, now they work for Schiff and how much you want to bet one of them was the one that he colluded with. And of course Schiff doesn't know anything about it. If you want to know why the President of the United States had trouble bringing in his own people into the National Security Counsil and getting clearances, now you know why? Because it's a rats nest. And by the way, I think U.S. Attorney Durham and the Attorney General of the United States ought to have an investigation of these three National Security Council former staffers, what role if did they have in the Ukraine 2016 matter interfering with the election? What role did they have pushing the Russia collusion matter? Where they leaker's? I think the criminal investigation - the Hill with Schiff - he ought to get into these three and find out exactly what they did and there may be more of them. Then we have Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. You can trash Mike Flynn, you can trash Holly North and you can trash anybody who served in the military but not Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. Deep inside that \"New York Times\" piece Sean, it said that Colonel Vindman had provided advice to the Ukrainian government mostly in English - what the hell does that mean? He's working for the Commander in Chief of the United States. He is on the National Security Council. He's an active duty Lieutenant Colonel, why are you giving advice to Ukraine? Nobody is following up on that. I'm just curious, what was that all about? Adam Schiff, you are a key fact material witness. You hired those two Obama staffers, your staffers are one of them met with the Former National Security staffer to the President of the United States, you are trying to protect your staffers and protect this phony whistleblower and you are trying to protect the Democrats from 2016 and what they tried to do to candidate Trump. It's all in \"POLITICO\" and it's all in \"The New York Times\" even though they don't want to admit it. Now Donald Trump has been investigated by the Southern District of New York, by the Special Counsel, he's been investigated by multiple Committees in Congress, hundreds of subpoenas have been issued against him, his businesses, his taxes, his bank accounts, his family members, but Joe Biden - you can't interfere with the election, Joe Biden is running for office again, he's been running for office since he was nine years old, now he's 103. Joe is running again, you're not allowed to look into Joe Biden, that's interfering in a foreign election - sure it is. And by the way you can't ask foreign governments for help? How do you get help in investigating somebody when the events occurred overseas? The FBI does this all the time we investigate people for drug prosecutions, investment prosecutions, money laundering with the assistance of foreign governments all the time. The President of the United States hasn't done anything at all. Why do the Democrats keep lying? Here is with they passed today, seven and half pages of B.S. Here's what they did in 1998, a long discussion of the President's rights. The President has a right to counsel, to cross-examine, to have his own witnesses and so forth and so on. You know what they said today? They said the Chair of the Committee including such procedures has allowed the participation of the President and his Counsel, how did they get to participate? We don't know, this is the biggest disgusting scandal and it is all on the Democrat Party that has hijacked the impeachment process, our tax dollars, the House of Representatives to push their 2020 election. That is what it's going on, that's it."

She's already being portrayed as bitter and boring, three times is definitely not the charm for Secretary of State Clinton. I hope she does not do it, I hope she preserves what is left of her legacy. You talk about trust, I mean, how many times you have mentioned the 30,000 deleted emails, she will have to answer that question."

      "utterance": "Oh, by the way, that now is reopened. Charles Grassley is getting to the bottom of it and listen, it all started with her cheating Bernie Sanders. They rigged that whole primary. Then she did violate the Espionage Act, she had top secret classified emails and Geraldo, as good a lawyer as you are - if Dan Bongino had subpoenaed emails and he deleted them, clean the hard drive with acid in bleach bid and busted up devices and removed Sim cards, you couldn't keep Dan Bongino out of jail no matter how good of an Attorney you are, Dan Bongino could he? DAN BONGINO, \"EXONERATED\" AUTHOR: Probably not Sean, I don't think any American other than Hillary Clinton could have gotten away with that. I have argued from the start to the real scandal and why they are covering for Hillary, it's not for Hillary is because she emailed Barack Obama and Barack Obama I think lied about it. He said on national television, I learned about the email scandal from the news - really? She was emailing you, how did you figure that one out Barack? I think that what they really had to cover. But let me present just a bit if I may of a contrarian view here, why shouldn't she jump in? Candidly Sean, this field sucks it's the worst field ever. They are three lanes for the Democrats right now all occupied by hapless candidates. You have the establishment laid occupied by Biden who can't get out his own way they're hiding him. You have the liberal wing occupied by a communist, who is at a vacation in Soviet Union Bernie Sanders, and then you have the outsider lane occupied by Buttigieg who not even an outsider, he's a terrible Mayor in a city he has already failed. So really, they have a real problem and I would say that Hillary, why not? It's the worst field I have ever seen, she might as well jump in."

I'm very dismayed by what happened in the House of Representatives today. I mean, these people are using the Democrats using the sanctimonious language of the hollowed constitution to justify their preordained, one-sided, partisan - hyper-partisan decision, I'm so glad that the Republicans held tight and not a single one defected. I think that spells out to the American people what this is? This is a political exercise, an assassination attempt, a hatchet job. I'm glad that it came down the way it did and the President will benefit I believe from this."

RUSH LIMBAUGH, \"THE RUSH LIMBAUGH SHOW\": As every one of their plans blows up, they are going to have a new one that everybody will react to like they did Trump-Russia. This is the thing that bugs me. At what point does and everybody say enough? You tried with Russia and you bombed outcome you tried with this phone call, and it's a nothing burger. It's enough! But nobody reacts that way. With every new, never before heard about revolution, what does Washington do? They stopped, they gulp, and they go, oh, my God, Trump might have done that. It's been three years, and Donald Trump hadn't done anything. Donald Trump hasn't done a single thing. For which he has been accused - of which."
