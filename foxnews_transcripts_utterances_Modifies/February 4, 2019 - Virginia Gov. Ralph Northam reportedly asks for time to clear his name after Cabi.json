But I think this is a different situation in part because he's the governor. He's in a singular position and he's clearly lost moral authority in part because -- and I don't see this as a pond, but dance or board dancing that he did at that news conference where he comes out and apologizes, then it looks like he's not apologizing, and he says, oh, it wasn't me, but, of course, he apologized and left the clear impression that it was him.  And then the whole thing about black face with the Michael Jackson thing, I mean, that was -- that could have been Saturday Night Live, right? So, it's the idea that he has totally done a bad job of representing himself, but I think on a larger scale, there's so much politics involved here. The people who broke the story, a far-right wing website, clearly was given a tip because of the position that he had taken on pro-choice issues. And then secondly, that Northam himself seems to have a lack of appreciation for exactly how awful this was because he says, oh, this happens in the 1980's. Hey, this is like so many years after the Civil Rights Act, after the civil rights movement. He's acting like, oh, well, you know, something a teenager -- he wasn't a teenager.

And then, if he does get impeached, Trump could actually run as a Democrat and be -- can you imagine those debates with Trump on the Democratic stage beating the crap out of all of them or the third thing could be just pick a winner, like pick a persuasive person --",

OK, question for you Juan. When everything this President does is absolutely picked apart by the media and especially the Left, do you begrudge him having a bit of an opaque schedule that he can kind of have a bit room to breathe when obviously he's being productive in those spaces or do you think that the transparency needs to be afforded top to bottom to the American people?",

I think lots of people, including on this panel said, hey, maybe the Democrats have some regret over Al Franken. Remember how quickly people pushed him over. But I think this is a different situation in part because he's the governor. He's in a singular position and he's clearly lost moral authority in part because -- and I don't see this as a pond, but dance or board dancing that he did at that news conference where he comes out and apologizes, then it looks like he's not apologizing, and he says, oh, it wasn't me, but, of course, he apologized and left the clear impression that it was him. And then the whole thing about black face with the Michael Jackson thing, I mean, that was -- that could have been Saturday Night Live, right? So, it's the idea that he has totally done a bad job of representing himself, but I think on a larger scale, there's so much politics involved here. The people who broke the story, a far-right wing website, clearly was given a tip because of the position that he had taken on pro-choice issues. And then secondly, that Northam himself seems to have a lack of appreciation for exactly how awful this was because he says, oh, this happens in the 1980's. Hey, this is like so many years after the Civil Rights Act, after the civil rights movement. He's acting like, oh, well, you know, something a teenager -- he wasn't a teenager.

You're always criticizing Steve King or Barack -- or Donald Trump, whenever they're charged with something that's potentially racist. How can you allow this to go on in your own midst?

I mean, if you look at, obviously, Bird was in the KKK and Barack Obama eulogized him, I believe. So, I mean, people can change. And things that we might be doing now is something I always think about that half a century from now, we may be seen as, like, I can't believe people did that or said that. It just happens that -- sometimes we aren't aware of how time changes. And I'm with Juan that this is in the '80s, so it's kind of strange. But, OK, I want to forgive him but I don't think I can. And the only reason I think I can is because he has smeared people racially before. He's gone out -- I mean, Gillespie is a case of it. I mean, he didn't, you know --"

Number one, to me the irony is that the largest lapse of judgment that I see beside, obviously, those horrible photos, but his management and reaction to this entire thing. Like, to me, the largest demonstration of his inability to serve the people would be this bungling entire situation. And like you said, you know, is this how he reacts? Exactly.

I think that would be a really bad move. And for my understanding, after Clinton's impeachment failed, not only -- not only did two-thirds of Americans hate the impeachment process and basically feel like it was a waste of time in their taxpayer dollars. But you know, his job performance approval ratings rose, but his moral character approval declined. And so, apparently that was the largest factor in the election of Bush, subsequently, was his honesty and moral character.

On Biden, he doesn't have the machine, he doesn't have the money, he doesn't have the electricity, he has -- he's just has no base within the party. So that, as Dana said before, all name recognition. He doesn't want to run because I think he knows he's not going to win. And I think the president is previewing his whole strategy right now. The Democrats are open borders, pro-infanticide, tax and spend, socialists, you know, take away your healthcare, and that's how he's going to run and that's a pretty stark contrast strategy that's going to get a lot of eyeballs."

Did you really say that? Democrats at the starting line, they have a choose your own adventure. One, they can go way left and energize the loudest voices, the base, embrace identity politics full on intersectionality or they can choose impeachment which will create the Trump folk hero thing and Pence will become president. And then, if he does get impeached, Trump could actually run as a Democrat and be -- can you imagine those debates with Trump on the Democratic stage beating the crap out of all of them or the third thing could be just pick a winner, like pick a persuasive person --"

The five points that they put out so far include things like infrastructure. Like, you know what, hey, both sides, we can work on this. We can get something done, right? And so he wants -- I think, especially in the aftermath of the declining poll numbers that were caused by the shutdown fiasco, say, hey, listen, I am trying to work with these Democrats. They're the ones that aren't doing right and put the pressure on the Democrats. So that's what he'll try to do.

I think that President Trump will keep his cool and maybe make a little joke about it and he'll, you know, win hearts and minds back at home. I think that when he is praising troops or certainly talking about the economy and job numbers and unemployment rates, imagine the camera shot then of Senators Harris, Warren, Gillibrand, Booker. There's Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. I don't know -- whoever else is running for president. And if they're sitting boot face, you know, looking like they're unhappy, that's not going to be necessarily good for them. But they have a choice to make right now because they have to see if they can stand out from one another. I also think the two big bipartisan pieces tomorrow night will be infrastructure once again around that loop. But Pelosi and Trump has actually talked that they could agree on that. But the other big one is going to be prescription drugs and some sort of a plan to deal with the high cost of prescription drugs. It is not a conservative position, but it is one that you can get bipartisan agreement."

All this neat stuff that basically when you take a look at it, the Left should love this guy. He's walking around the planet reducing our military footprint.

Of course, Dana took a picture of this bucket of hideous bumbling doom and tweeted it, which is basically making your own kick me sign and taping it to your back. It's going to live forever.

But you know who's really grateful for Dana's queso? Yes, this guy at Maroon 5's Adam Levine, who is usually the cheesiest thing on earth. Not last night.

Press Secretary Sarah Sanders attributes the timetable to Trump's different leadership style and says, \"while he spends much of his average day in scheduled meetings, events and calls, there is time to allow for a more creative environment that has helped make him the most productive President in modern history\". OK, question for you Juan. When everything this President does is absolutely picked apart by the media and especially the Left, do you begrudge him having a bit of an opaque schedule that he can kind of have a bit room to breathe when obviously he's being productive in those spaces or do you think that the transparency needs to be afforded top to bottom to the American people?"

But this is called executive time. So, I was intrigued by the response from the White House, Sarah Sanders saying, this allows him to be more creative. Creative? Really? That's very creative. I think other people would have a much more derogatory term for people who aren't at work when they're supposed to be at work."

And this is just another really scary and dangerous series of leaks from people on the inside that are trying to either embarrass the President or pump up their own stature. And he really needs to do something about it. They have not yet gotten a handle on people resisting within the administration and they believe they're resisting for the good of the country.

And I think there obviously there is people within this White House who will do that. I think it's disgusting. They're to work. You don't just work for the President. You work for the United States of America. You work for the people. And so that your responsibility is to us, not to embarrass the person that you are working for. That is - if that's inappropriate.

He's seen - I've said this before, TV Fox News, it's his conduit to the American people. The way he sees the American people, his voters. So, he looks, and he sees what's going on and then he tweets.
