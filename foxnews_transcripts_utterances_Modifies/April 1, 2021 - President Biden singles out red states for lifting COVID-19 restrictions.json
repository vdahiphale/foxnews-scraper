I know they probably had good intentions. I'm sure they did. But Texans that made the decision. We shut down for two weeks, as they told us. We went past two weeks. It's time to open up.

That was working. Number two, catch and release, they replaced that. OK. Well, what does that happen? If you get if you get to America, you if you're caught, we'll release you. Number three was no deportations. OK. And then you have the Department of Homeland Security Secretary saying we will not deport any children. So all of those are pull factors, right? So you could talk about the push factors, the poverty, the violence, the hurricanes, all of those things, those are bad.

It was the Biden administration who said this week that they expect tens of thousands of more children to come through next September. So what are they going to do just keep on opening new facilities?  And right now they're using convention centers across the country. Why are they able to do that, because businesses are closed, there are no conventions. But at some point, I'm assuming that people in business are going to want to get back to doing conventions. And a last point about this video, I don't think it's just heartbreaking. It's absolutely outrageous. I want to know what they're going to do to tackle the cartels, because those guys, those are criminals. And we should be doing something to go after them. Now in America, if you were a parent, and you and -- you gave your child to a smuggler to drop over the other side of the border, you would be charged with child endangerment. Instead, what's happening is they're so desperate they want to get their children here. I know they want them to be safe. I know that mother has been anguished. But look that those little girls could have died. And so yes, I think they need to swallow their pride and do something.",

This is horrific policy from the Biden administration, and all of the death, all of the rape, all the slavery sits at the feet of Harris and Biden, because it's their policy, as Dana mentioned, that has been the pull to bring these kids to our border. And Dana's right, go back to some policy where, I mean if you want to let people in the country which I disagree with that have a process in place that can bring people in, that doesn't get them raped and sold into sex slavery, that just that just makes sense. That's humanitarian. That's what parents would do. And Dana mentioned this point. You can't say these are great parents that are letting their kids come on these horrific jury journeys with these criminals and say they're doing the right thing because it is a lifelong sentence.

But Juan to your question about the asylum issue with Congress. The remain in Mexico policy was an asylum policy, it forced people to wait for their asylum claims to be processed in Mexico. And keep in mind, the majority, the vast majority of these, quote, asylum claims are actually bogus asylum claims. And the Biden administration has enabled people to use certain terms to say that they claim asylum, and that gets them into the country.  But back to the video. The reason this video is so compelling is because we hear about smuggling, you hear about these stories, but now we're seeing what the smuggling looks like. And we're seeing the ruthlessness of the cartels. And you can watch that. And unfortunately, those little girls getting dropped over the fences is probably the least horrific thing that happened to them when they were being smuggled. And the Biden administration is engaging in human trafficking, because they're enabling this to happen. And then they're taking these kids and delivering them to unvetted, quote, sponsors in the United States. And when that happened under Obama, we found out a lot of those people were actually sex offenders, themselves. So they are enabling and they are part of this third leg of this human trafficking process from Central America. And the way that you stop that is by re implementing the remain in Mexico issue and saying, you have to claim asylum if it's a real asylum claim in your home country, not when you get into the United States.",

We know government can lock things down. So we need two weeks to slow the surge is easy. Just get the National Guard, have them -- have actual body, forget about the wall, have actual bodies, be at the border, if they're good enough for Congress, then they're good enough for our border, putting up the border and stop the criminal enterprise until our legislators can come up with legislation to solve the problem. But this back and forth, it looks like Democrats aren't interested in this. Even Obama wasn't crazy enough to just allow open borders. I mean, they call them Deporter-In Chief, we'll talk about that later in the program. So what we see now is the Democratic Party has gone so far left, that now they don't believe that the nation has a border.  So the only way to implement this and get something right since you guys don't like walls, let's have a human wall.

That is -- that is the new position of the Democratic Party?  So, I think there's a lot of people in Georgia in Atlanta specifically, because when people come to Georgia, they come from Atlanta. That's where all the businesses are going, the modern-day Black Wall Street. So, if that's the position that Democrats want to go, OK, let's take it.

And I warned people this in the past election. I went on air every single day and said, there is this surge going on right now with voters, and Black voters are showing up for the Democratic Party. So, the Republicans have to provide alternative for Black America. You got all these entrepreneurs there that believe in a free market, right?

Stacey Abrams had bought the Jim Crow 2.0 domain name before they even knew what the final bill was going to be. So, this was all telegraphed. How the Republicans got surprised that this was going to be the play is beyond me. And why they didn't provide any air cover to people like, you know, companies like Delta.

But they didn't -- they sent him away and he was eligible for parole. It was denied twice. And then he was released, given release. I don't understand it. I don't think it was right. He's apparently insane and violent. So, this is damaging to the country. But to blame it on soft on crime policies or defund the police, that's not true. I mean, do you Giuliani and Bloomberg, those were tough on crime mayors. This is something that we have to deal with in term -- because this will damage the fabric of society to see that man get away with it and people stand by. That's terrible.",

Why they canceled the game? Because somebody on the Nationals got COVID. So now they have to do the tracing they're involved in a lot of, you know, ways to try to prevent this from spreading certainly to the New York Mets who were the opponent tonight. But overall when you look at a place like Texas and think that they're going to allow and 40,000 people in one stadium who are going to be screaming and shouting and rooting for the home team, to me this is a big strikeout.

This is same guy that told us don't worry about the spread and everything was going to be OK. So I think there needs to be a little bit of humility from the scientists as well. I know they probably had good intentions. I'm sure they did. But Texans that made the decision. We shut down for two weeks, as they told us. We went past two weeks. It's time to open up.

      "utterance": "OK. What could they do? First of all, they could swallow some pride. Because what they wanted to do when they first got here was to overturn anything that President Trump had done. And, OK, so what did they did? The remain in Mexico policy was a great win, not just for President Trump, for the American people pay in Mexico to take care of people while they waited to hear their cases in the United States. That was working. Number two, catch and release, they replaced that. OK. Well, what does that happen? If you get if you get to America, you if you're caught, we'll release you. Number three was no deportations. OK. And then you have the Department of Homeland Security Secretary saying we will not deport any children. So all of those are pull factors, right? So you could talk about the push factors, the poverty, the violence, the hurricanes, all of those things, those are bad. But if at the same time they're pushing, and we are pulling by saying, we're not going to send your children back, everything will be fine. If they swallow their pride and said, we're going to go back and do these things, that would certainly help. It was the Biden administration who said this week that they expect tens of thousands of more children to come through next September. So what are they going to do just keep on opening new facilities? And right now they're using convention centers across the country. Why are they able to do that, because businesses are closed, there are no conventions. But at some point, I'm assuming that people in business are going to want to get back to doing conventions. And a last point about this video, I don't think it's just heartbreaking. It's absolutely outrageous. I want to know what they're going to do to tackle the cartels, because those guys, those are criminals. And we should be doing something to go after them. Now in America, if you were a parent, and you and -- you gave your child to a smuggler to drop over the other side of the border, you would be charged with child endangerment. Instead, what's happening is they're so desperate they want to get their children here. I know they want them to be safe. I know that mother has been anguished. But look that those little girls could have died. And so yes, I think they need to swallow their pride and do something."

We don't see Congress taking action to set new rules in terms of the asylum laws in the country, rules on dreamers, rules, you know, dealing with the fact that we've got. I think it's 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. It's like Congress's AOL, when it comes to immigration reform."

If you actually secure the border and then you deal with people on the inside, there should be bipartisan agreement, but it seems like both sides like this fight and can't get anything done. It's and it's a problem. But what I wonder is, we saw that video, how many other scenarios like that are out there that we didn't have video for? I mean, there's no videos of little girls getting raped or sold into slavery, the number of kids who catch COVID, the number of, you know, kids that die in the Rio Grande in the desert. This is horrific policy from the Biden administration, and all of the death, all of the rape, all the slavery sits at the feet of Harris and Biden, because it's their policy, as Dana mentioned, that has been the pull to bring these kids to our border. And Dana's right, go back to some policy where, I mean if you want to let people in the country which I disagree with that have a process in place that can bring people in, that doesn't get them raped and sold into sex slavery, that just that just makes sense. That's humanitarian. That's what parents would do. And Dana mentioned this point. You can't say these are great parents that are letting their kids come on these horrific jury journeys with these criminals and say they're doing the right thing because it is a lifelong sentence. If you've been sexually assaulted. You'll deal with it forever till the day you die. This is horrible."

Could she get the left to buy in to some strong border security policies as part of an immigration deal?"

Or we can listen to her and so far what we know about what she thinks of what's going on, and she laughed about it. So that's what we know about what the Vice President is doing. But Juan to your question about the asylum issue with Congress. The remain in Mexico policy was an asylum policy, it forced people to wait for their asylum claims to be processed in Mexico. And keep in mind, the majority, the vast majority of these, quote, asylum claims are actually bogus asylum claims. And the Biden administration has enabled people to use certain terms to say that they claim asylum, and that gets them into the country. But back to the video. The reason this video is so compelling is because we hear about smuggling, you hear about these stories, but now we're seeing what the smuggling looks like. And we're seeing the ruthlessness of the cartels. And you can watch that. And unfortunately, those little girls getting dropped over the fences is probably the least horrific thing that happened to them when they were being smuggled. And the Biden administration is engaging in human trafficking, because they're enabling this to happen. And then they're taking these kids and delivering them to unvetted, quote, sponsors in the United States. And when that happened under Obama, we found out a lot of those people were actually sex offenders, themselves. So they are enabling and they are part of this third leg of this human trafficking process from Central America. And the way that you stop that is by re implementing the remain in Mexico issue and saying, you have to claim asylum if it's a real asylum claim in your home country, not when you get into the United States."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "No, the wall is supposed to slow the spread. But it also is supposed to prevent -- it's a wall system. It's not just about -- it's only Democrats that are concerned about the physical barrier. But it's the wall implement with a policy where the border agents have the funding to go there and get the people once they come across the board. But this is a simple fix. We know government can lock things down. So we need two weeks to slow the surge is easy. Just get the National Guard, have them -- have actual body, forget about the wall, have actual bodies, be at the border, if they're good enough for Congress, then they're good enough for our border, putting up the border and stop the criminal enterprise until our legislators can come up with legislation to solve the problem. But this back and forth, it looks like Democrats aren't interested in this. Even Obama wasn't crazy enough to just allow open borders. I mean, they call them Deporter-In Chief, we'll talk about that later in the program. So what we see now is the Democratic Party has gone so far left, that now they don't believe that the nation has a border. So the only way to implement this and get something right since you guys don't like walls, let's have a human wall. Let's give our National Guards the resources they need so they can start the criminal enterprise because this is not just a bodies issue and a humanitarian crisis. There are drugs flooding in across the border, and now it's become aiding and abetting."

My favorite part about the Washington Post article was when they pose the question, they break down every single thing that Biden said, and they left with the question, where did Biden get this from? And the article says, we have no clue. In other words, he just lied about it. But the Democrats are in a big pickle right here now because now the talking points have shifted to this boycott. You're going to boycott Atlanta, the modern day black Wall Street. You're going to come after them Tyler Perry and all the black entrepreneurs, businesses that are in Atlanta? That is -- that is the new position of the Democratic Party? So, I think there's a lot of people in Georgia in Atlanta specifically, because when people come to Georgia, they come from Atlanta. That's where all the businesses are going, the modern-day Black Wall Street. So, if that's the position that Democrats want to go, OK, let's take it. But the Republicans have a problem also, because although the Democrats are factually wrong when it comes to the legislation, the Republicans have a problem with the ground game in Georgia. And I warned people this in the past election. I went on air every single day and said, there is this surge going on right now with voters, and Black voters are showing up for the Democratic Party. So, the Republicans have to provide alternative for Black America. You got all these entrepreneurs there that believe in a free market, right? If you really believe in Liberty, then go out there and sell it to those people. Because changing this legislation is not going to help you in the next election if they get more people to show up and vote."

In fact, most Democrats seem to agree with that. So, I don't see why they're hanging their hat on this one. Stacey Abrams had bought the Jim Crow 2.0 domain name before they even knew what the final bill was going to be. So, this was all telegraphed. How the Republicans got surprised that this was going to be the play is beyond me. And why they didn't provide any air cover to people like, you know, companies like Delta. And I'm not -- I'm not going to give Delta a pass either. They were participants on the bill, they had no problem with the bill until three or four days after the bill was passed, and the Twitter mob came, and they were like, oh, oh. And now, they're in a pickle as well. So, it's a mess. And let it just be a warning to all states. This is coming for you because every state is working on redistricting, they've got the gerrymandering things because it's after the census. They're working on tightening up voter laws. However, that's all been framed as voter suppression all across the country. So, from the communication standpoint, I'm like, you better take a shot of espresso and get out there and explain things. They could have explained that so much better. My last thing is President Biden repeated word for word what he had said before, but in the middle of that the Washington Post gave him four Pinocchios. I would be so embarrassed. I'd be so ashamed if I ever got a Pinocchio, let alone four. I would never say it again. But then they repeated it at the White House briefing today."

And now, there's no argument -- there's no factual argument about the idea that the Georgia legislature has now removed strict power from the secretary of state that they now have power to absolutely undo local boards of elections in Georgia counties when they think that something is wrong. When they think, you know, we shouldn't have lost this election, all of a sudden they're -- they have the power to overturn elections. To me, this is awful.

So, if I go to her and say listen, you're too stupid because you're Hispanic to get a license or an ID and I can't because I'm White, guess what's going to happen to my marriage. It's not going to go very well. This is -- this is so ridiculous and so racist that Democrats say we can't get IDs because of the color of our skin. And one last point. I can't wait for Coca-Cola and Delta at the next shareholder meeting to say, we're not going to verify people who are owners of the company when they vote on shareholder proposals and for the board of directors. Anyone can come in and vote. I guarantee you, they'll get their pantsuit off. What's good for Delta and Coke and the way they run their corporations is as good for Georgia and for America. Voter ID works and it works for Coke and it works for Delta."

      "utterance": "Beautiful skyline there. A soft-on-crime approach being blamed for a horrific attack in New York City. The New York Post turned into laws that allow a man who had killed his own mother to be out on lifetime parole. Now, the convicted murderer is charged with a hate-crime for a vicious attack on a 65-year-old Asian-American woman on her way to church. And what's worse, two workers in a building lobby nearby, they did absolutely nothing to stop it. Dana, I'm going to bring this out to you first. Obviously, this man needs help because if you killed your own mama at 19 years old, maybe you shouldn't be out there to begin with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, it's so hard to watch that, you know, and I've seen it - - I've seen it 100 times today. But I think it's important that we see it. You know, Asian-Americans have a right to be worried, concerned, and they deserve our support. Less Police, fewer police, not the right answer. I would say, more police is the right answer and more consequences and consequences that stick. We've talked about this idea that, you know, we all do -- we can support judicial reform. That doesn't have to mean losing common sense like what happened here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, Juan, let me go to you because that's my concern about that. I've been fighting for criminal justice my entire life. My first job was in a juvenile courtroom. And when you say these type of attacks, it hurts the calls for criminal justice reform because those that are true advocates do not want violent offenders back on the street. So, why is cities like this continuing to let these type of people out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, let's hold on a second. I'm not sure this has anything to do with criminal justice reform, Lawrence. Remember, when this man killed his mama, as you said, this was between I think Giuliani and Bloomberg. So, these are tough on crime mayors, and they sent him away. But they didn't -- they sent him away and he was eligible for parole. It was denied twice. And then he was released, given release. I don't understand it. I don't think it was right. He's apparently insane and violent. So, this is damaging to the country. But to blame it on soft on crime policies or defund the police, that's not true. I mean, do you Giuliani and Bloomberg, those were tough on crime mayors. This is something that we have to deal with in term -- because this will damage the fabric of society to see that man get away with it and people stand by. That's terrible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Yes. Right. Well, Lawrence, you say this guy needs help. I think that he needs the electric chair. And he was released in 2019, which was not under Giuliani or Bloomberg. As you mentioned, the parole officers are appointed. He was let out. He should have never been let out. He killed his mother. And now he has severely injured this woman who is elder -- an elderly woman. And the police are sparse because New York City has decided to tie their hands and not allow them to respond in a way that is proper when they are seeing and witnessing violent crime like this. So, there are victims and there are consequences for soft-on-crime policies and letting violent people like this out of prison. And they're lucky that woman didn't die."

    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, I was a prosecutor for 10 years. And we do believe in redemption for low-level first-time offenders. But when you have violent criminals like this or repeat offenders, the system works when you lock them up and lock them up for a very long time. This is a failing of the system and I think this progressive liberal idea that everyone, no matter what you've done, you get a second chance. No, there's some people who belong behind bars and should stay there for the rest of their lives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "That's a failure of the system and the citizens as usual pay for it. It's a crazy story. Up next, you won't believe who was getting counseled now and why the woke left is going after the Obamas, next on THE FIVE."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to THE FIVE. No one is saved from cancel culture. Activists are now going after the Obamas and appalled at renaming a school after them. They say the former president is the deporter in chief and they're even calling him an oppressor. So, Juan, I want to come to you because Obama did deport three million people. Do you think he is the deporter in chief? Do you think he is an oppressor? Is this fair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, I didn't like the policy but it's not -- I don't think he's in the oppressor. I think this is stupidity, you know, cancel culture out of control. You know, it's not as big as trying to cancel his presidency by saying he wasn't born in the USA. I remember that canceling."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly the next logical step in cancel culture was canceling the Obamas. And I think we have peaked cancel culture. It's really too bad that Greg Gutfeld's new show is not starting tonight because that would have been some great material for him to go after. Yes, I do think that at some point it's like are we being punked here? I mean, I can't even take it seriously anymore. It's completely absurd."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I know it is. And you know, Lawrence, I only know of one perfect human being. He lived, you know, 2000 years ago here in Holy Week, right? Is anybody immune from cancel culture, because again the Obamas, everybody can get canceled, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's why you saw former President Obama speak out against this a couple of years ago and this year frankly talking about it because I think he saw it coming. You can only keep the record that he had for so long. I mean, he wasn't as progressive as we would like to see, you know, as we seen from the Democratic Party of today. Right now, he would be considered a moderate with the changes that they're making right now. And so, I think he kind of predicted this coming for him and he wanted to get out front of it. I don't think anyone is safe. That's the part of the reason cancel culture is so bad they have no barometer. It changes as the day goes and the minute goes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "There's no rules to cancel culture. Everyone is subject to it. And so, Katie, I told you. I hate cancel culture. But the only way I think conservatives can fight back and push back against cancel culture is if they actually cancel those who are canceling us. Like, in my family, we canceled Disney Plus. We've canceled Netflix. I've moved from Google to DuckDuckGo. Is that the only way we can push back, give them a financial loss to stop the left from doing all this canceling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "I don't think that you have to laugh at it. Like, I think this is hilarious. You know, cancel, woke culture, wokeism eats everyone eventually. And I actually saw this coming because two years ago, President Obama gave a speech and he quoted the Founding Fathers and refer to them in a positive light. And I remember him saying, not woke enough, not woke enough. So, I just think it's ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUFFY",
      "utterance": "He's a sinner. That's true according to the Founding Fathers. But you know what, when you're as powerful as Barack Obama, that's one thing. But if you're low on the totem pole and you lose your job and you don't have any savings, it is cataclysmic. But with that, up next, we have \"ONE MORE THING.\""

But unfortunately, this year, the event had to be canceled due to the pandemic. But take a look at these wooden Easter Eggs from last year's event. They were sent to me by Richard Rovsek, the chairman of the Spirit of Liberty Foundation. And of course, there's no canceling the fun of making Easter Eggs at home. Here my grandchildren showing off their creations. That's Pepper, Wesley, and Eli painting their eggs very artfully. So, Happy Passover, Happy Easter to everyone.

It's drop down a little bit, but went back up the bestseller list. It's sold out but you can get it -- it's coming back into stores and also the audiobook I recorded. And then I'm also really excited about this. So, when the book went to print, I still had this idea. And so, I wrote a chapter about how faith has informed my life and benefit -- certainly helped me in my life and I've given that to FoxNews.com exclusively. So, that is there. It's not available in print. It is now available just to FoxNews.com. So, you can go there and read that chapter. It's not too long, but it I think it's pretty good. You could check it out.
