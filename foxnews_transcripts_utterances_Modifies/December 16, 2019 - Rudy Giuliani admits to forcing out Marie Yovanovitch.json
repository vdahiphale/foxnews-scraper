      "utterance": " I'm Laura Ingram and this is \"The Ingram Angle\" from Washington tonight.  More games from the Democrats in the middle of the night.  Yeah, Andy Biggs, Byron York, Bob Barr are all here.  And in moments they will explain Jerry Nadler's desperate eleventh-hour vote.  Also, Senator Josh Hawley.  He'll join us on how Chuck Schumer has positioned himself front and center on impeachment.  And he'll also preview another Senate hearing with DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz.  Plus, Rudy Giuliani has drawn the ire of both the left and some on the right. So, he has to be asked a question, is he helping or hurting the president and what new stuff has he found out in his latest travels?  The former New York City mayor, Rudy Giuliani, returns exclusively to make his case.  And the Democrats' impeachment ship is taking on water.  My Angle a little later tonight examines Democrat defections in both halls of Congress and also on the streets of middle America.  Dan Bongino, Victor Davis Hanson and more react to all of it.  But first, House Judiciary Dems are up to their usual hijinks, this time dropping a nearly 700-page impeachment report in the middle of the night, a week before Christmas.  Democrats are now accusing Trump of committing bribery and wire fraud. Oh, throw something else in.  Two crimes curiously left out of the articles of impeachment heading to the floor for a vote this week.  Joining me now is Bob Barr, former Clinton impeachment manager as well as former federal prosecutor and Georgia congressman.  Also here is Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner and Fox News contributor; and Andy Biggs, House Judiciary Committee member who had to endure last week.  So, we’re just going to say, Congressman, I’m glad you’re okay after a nightmarishly long series of proceedings.  But before we begin, I want you all to listen to what Senator Pelosi said -- do we call her Senator?  Congresswoman Pelosi -- Speaker Pelosi said when asked why charges they’re not entertaining against Trump were not in their articles."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.",

      "utterance": " Well, it’s sort of an alternative universe and an alternative memory that we have here.  Chuck Schumer, back in 1999, was among those who wanted nothing whatsoever to do with impeachment, no witnesses, nothing.  They wanted to just rush it through and unfortunately, we had a Republican majority at the time under Trent Lott that caved in to pressure from Schumer and others.  But this notion that you were talking about a few moments ago with your other guests, Laura, about throwing in terms like “bribery” and “extortion” and so forth, it makes clear that what this document is, this, you know, this large lump of coal that deposited itself in the House last evening, late last night, is simply a document to allow every Democrat out there who wants to find something on which to run against Trump or say bad about him can do so.  The ultimate though, it is absolutely outrageous for this document, an official document of the U.S. House of Representatives, to say that this president is a threat to national security and is a danger to the country.  I mean, that’s just over the top and ought to have no place in any public document --"

      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " Congressman Biggs, it’s embarrassing.  This whole thing, this entire process, I’ve tried to, like, treat it seriously when I can.  But half the time, I just want to burst out laughing because they are taking a baseball bat and knowing it’s going to hurt when they hit themselves in the face, and they just go ahead and smash, smash, smash.  “Oh, maybe it won’t hurt this time.”  And then they’re basically just going to be on the floor unconscious soon.  This is what it -- this is what it looks like.  I can’t believe they keep doing this."

      "speaker": "Andy Biggs",
      "utterance": " This is just self-abnegation to the highest degree, you know?  And it is comical in one sense, because you see them rushing around.  And let’s face it, Nadler had to write a longer one than Schiff because he was left out.  So, they’re going to keep piling on and who knows what’s going to happen next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " Bob, we’re going to talk to Senator Hawley in a moment.  But this moves on to the Senate.  Given what you’ve seen, and the abuses, and FISA, and the politicization of all of this from the beginning with surveilling the Trump administration, and they were spied on, what do you think should happen next in the Senate?  Just a quick motion to dismiss and try to get this done quickly?  Or should witnesses be called and really put a stake through the heart of this type of bias?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bob Barr",
      "utterance": " The Senate majority, the Republican side is they should go to Senate to President Trump and do what he wants.  It is his reputation.  It is his legacy on the line, not Mitch McConnell’s, not anybody else over there.  I think this is the only opportunity, that is a Senate trial for the president to clear the air and present a full and complete context in which his policy decisions were made.  None of that came out in the House.  They didn’t allow it.  So, I think that there needs to be a full, robust trial in the Senate.  And the president needs to be very adept at picking a good team.  He ought to follow, for example, to be honest with you, the team that President Clinton chose back in 1999, which did a very good job of presenting his case, his defense --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Josh Hawley",
      "utterance": " Well, he knows that they have nothing.  I mean, listen, the House impeachment articles are a joke, Laura.  As you pointed out, they don’t even charge a crime.  Let’s remember what an impeachment is.  An impeachment is, like, an indictment and then it comes to the Senate for a trial.  If you had the evidence for a crime, they would have charged the crime.  They would have put it in the articles of impeachment.  They didn’t because they don’t have anything.  This whole thing is a joke.  And it’s time to get the president exonerated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " And they are already claiming, Senator Hawley, from the House Judiciary Committee, that the Senate has already cooked the books on this, that this is rigged.  Zoe Lofgren, watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.",
      "utterance": " Some of the things I’m hearing from the senators looks like they plan to rig the trial.  Senators announced that they’ve already made up their minds; they don’t need to look at the facts.  That doesn’t clear the president if he’s not convicted in the Senate.  That’s just a political endeavor to protect a man who’s guilty of abusing his power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " So, Senator, the Democrats are saying the Republicans are politicizing, I guess, the defense of the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.",
      "utterance": " Yeah.  The facts are is that the House has no evidence of any impeachable offense.  They put their evidence out there.  They’ve issued their reports.  We’ve all seen the hearings.  And look, there’s nothing there.  And they didn’t even charge a crime, Laura.  I mean, this comes back to they’ve had their chance.  They had their kangaroo court.  They’ve had their show, their circus for weeks and weeks, and months and months, and there just isn’t anything there.  So, listen, it’s going to come over to the Senate.  We’re going to execute our constitutional -- or I am, my constitutional responsibility.  But I can tell you there’s no way I’m voting for impeachment for somebody who hasn’t committed any impeachable offenses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " Senator, the debate rages on about what should happen in the Senate.  You know, the process is governed by the rules of impeachment that were developed some time ago.  But what about this idea of putting witnesses on?  The president obviously has said, “Where’s Biden?  Where’s the whistleblower?  Where’s Hunter?” and Adam Schiff’s role in all of this.  Is it important that those individuals be heard from so this kind of thing doesn’t happen again?  It’s almost punitive toward the people who started this whole thing if the witnesses are called."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Josh Hawley",
      "utterance": " Well, I’ve said that I’d like to hear from the whistleblower.  I said some time ago, Laura, that I think that that person, whoever it is, is absolutely relevant, absolutely material.  I think Hunter Biden, the same thing.  Hunter Biden is absolutely relevant and material.  So, if we’re going to call witnesses, they absolutely should be called, and I think the president is entitled to due process.  He is entitled to a full and fair defense.  He has been denied that at every turn.  The House Democrats denied him the ability to meaningfully participate in their ridiculous show trial over on their side, departing, by the way, from all of the procedures and precedents of the past.  So, the president deserves a full defense in the United States Senate, and I’m confident he will get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " And, Senator, finally, Horowitz is on his way back to Capitol Hill this week for more testimony.  I mean, I think he testified for nine hours or something last week.  I mean, what more can you possibly learn from him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Josh Hawley",
      "utterance": " Well, I think it’s important we drill down here on what happened before the court in particular, the FISA court, Laura.  And as you know, to see the Democrat National Committee buy itself an FBI investigation, feed this fake report to the FBI, and then the FBI to go and deliberately mislead a court not once, not twice, but at least three times -- I want to know exactly how that happened.  I want to know exactly who signed off on it.  And by the way, are you telling me that the Attorney General of the United States and the president of the United States at the time, Barack Obama, didn’t know that the FBI was asking the FISA court for warrants for a presidential campaign?  I mean, really?  Is that what we are to believe?  I just find that very, very hard to fathom.  I’d like to get some answers to that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",

      "utterance": " Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " All right, Rudy Giuliani; a lot of the Democrats are saying, “Oh, he has so much explaining to do” as questions about what he’s up to pour in from the left, and even a few on the right.  The former New York City mayor is here exclusively to make his case next."

      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": " It’s easy to get lost with all of the twists and the turns in the Ukraine-gate saga, and a lot of you just have tuned it out, but no matter what road you go down, they all lead back to one person: Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.  His investigations into corruption and what the Bidens were up to in Ukraine are what sparked much of this in the first place.  Moreover, Giuliani was in Ukraine earlier this month continuing his investigation.  That drove the left crazy.  And while he’s touting new evidence, he says will vindicate the president, some critics allege that Giuliani is actually hurting the president more than he’s helping.  Can that be true?  Joining us now, the man of the moment, Rudy Giuliani.  We thought we’d ask you personally, Rudy, what is your reaction to those critics who say, “Oh, my gosh, Rudy has got to stop while he’s behind?”  They don’t even say “ahead,” Rudy, they’re so critical of you."

    {
      "speaker": "Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer",
      "utterance": " Well, I don’t know.  Maybe they don’t believe that there was, in fact, substantial corruption in Ukraine that went on for years, and that the president of the United States, when he asked for an investigation, was doing his duty as the president of the United States.  Maybe they buy into some form of the Democratic criticism."

Jeff Van Drew won’t be just voting against impeachment.  He’s voting against the entire Democrat Party because he’s becoming a Republican.  Now, some of his top staffers immediately resigned.  And the impeachment enforcer, Congressman Cohen, said it was like rats jumping off a Schiff.  “Off a Schiff,” I love that.  Ship.  All right.  Just as with the crew of the Titanic, though, the impeachment cheerleaders were clueless until it was too late."

Schumer and others, I mean, look at some of the footage you’ve seen earlier today, Elissa Slotkin from Michigan at a town hall.  I mean, they’re getting wrecked in their districts with this.  It’s -- I mean, it’s really -- it’s so incredibly naïve.  I used to think the Democrats were smarter than this, but clearly, they’re not."
