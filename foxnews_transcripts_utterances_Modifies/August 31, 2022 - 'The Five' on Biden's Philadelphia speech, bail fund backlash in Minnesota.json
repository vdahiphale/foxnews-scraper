Deplorables. That was really a defining moment for Hillary Clinton and people wanted something new. And if he is going to run again, you have to run on something new, even President Trump, right? He had to go from make America great again to keep America great. Even though MAGA stuck, but there was a need to say, OK, I still have something new. I have still have something good coming.

And the DEA is issuing an urgent warning about rainbow abode covered fentanyl. It looks like skittles. It's to kids, but don't worry, the White House claims they're doing something about it.",

But he's never been -- we always thought, well, he still is just a nice guy, but then we forget this is the guy that said that Mitt Romney would put black people in chains. Do you remember that? So, he -- the thing about Joe is, if you look at his past, he operated on the most memorable hot take. If you said something, he would go to further out there and just say, well, he's going to put you in chains or you're -- but you know, you try to come against us. I got an M-15.

That's not like primetime viewing. OK? I think this is a trial balloon by the staff to see if he can make this messaging stick. And then they're if he does, they're going to try it because they must have some sort of polling or something that tells them that this works. But the polls that really mattered, let's look at 2016. Deplorables. That was really a defining moment for Hillary Clinton and people wanted something new. And if he is going to run again, you have to run on something new, even President Trump, right? He had to go from make America great again to keep America great. Even though MAGA stuck, but there was a need to say, OK, I still have something new. I have still have something good coming. You have to stay tuned for the next thing. And it -- all that they have is to be against the Republicans.

Right now, I hear Republicans saying some things and most of the things I hear them saying they're going to do is they're going to investigate Hunter Biden.

You see local news up there, every single presidential candidate in 2015, when they went to New Hampshire for a town hall when they're running the primaries, the first question they -- all of them were asked every single time was about opioid crisis. And now you have fentanyl, which I'm sure Greg can help us understand even more about how it is more addictive and it's also just made in a lab. The other thing is, I really encourage people to read this Wall Street Journal piece today about the two Mexican drug cartels that are fighting and trying to, well, they get the drugs, the precursor stuff, the chemicals from China.

There are some red hats there, they'll take that -- you know, that day is far worse. But this is when you realize that the virtue signaling has a body count. You put a little sticker on your car that says BLM, that's fine. But to free killers, to feel -- so you could feel enlightened, that causes problems. We need to drop the fried felons off in front of the houses of the people who freed them. And if you object to that, you have to ask yourself, why? Why do you have a problem with that?

He's got him freed and he killed someone. That happens every day in America. People are being freed with no bail, or being freed even though they've had guns, they go out and get another gun, they go out and they kill somebody. Or this guy who did the sucker punch, the level three sex offender, they took it down from attempted murder to misdemeanor. The whole concept, I mean, think about what's going on in this country. What's going on is that we are minimizing the victim and we are celebrities rising and puffing up the criminal saying we have to take care of them. We coddle the criminals, and we ignore the victims.

The other thing is, the numbers is supposed -- must be undeniable. Harold, you're the most experienced along with the judge in politics. I'm sorry, everyone except me and Greg. They run for office. But the numbers must be horrific for the president of the United States to try to be a law and order President all of a sudden. And it's not just the Squad, they have ignored and not spoken out when it was defund the police. And it used to be that -- you didn't say, Mr. President -- you didn't stop your party from saying it. And by the way, ask Cori Bush to defund the police, she'll tell you right now she wants to defund the police. You can't come out and say now, you want to crack down when your own history as you said nothing during those riots. You weren't horrified when cities abandoned because of the pandemic were wrecked and livelihoods were destroyed, especially on this block, the other block, and maybe your city block. So, I think the points between law and order between Republicans and Democrats are like, 15 points. And the President's got to close that gap or he's going to get -- his party is going to get slammed on election day. But I think people don't have short-term memory loss. I think people remember if the party was a law and order. And the former president went crazy about this. He wanted to use Special Forces to go out there and grab our streets back. So, you can't say that the President of the United States was asleep at the switch. He was desperately trying to get these mayors to crack down on these criminals and these rioters."

There was a teacher at this school who would travel every day on a bus to get to school. So, the school put on a fake assembly in the gym before bringing Raul Castro into the gym and handing him a pinata. And inside the pinata were keys to a car. He -- they raised $30,000 over the summer for the gift. And if that's not enough, they also gifted him with a year's supply of insurance and gas. Now, that's great. Students who pay it forward and surprised a teacher with the car."

Also am going to be in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Newark, New Jersey as well as Brandon, Mississippi. Greg might be on all these appearances. But I'll see you next Thursday, everybody. VIP tickets available. Next, my belief is that Aaron Judge will be the single-season homerun champion. This is homerun number 51. He was on pace to get 63. The all-time record is held by Bonds. The second is McGwire. They both took steroids. Therefore if he beats Roger Maris, he is the single-season homerun leader. Does anyone wanted to dispute that?"
