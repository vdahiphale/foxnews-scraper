      "sentences": "Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD. I'm Jesse Watters. Permanent pandemic: That's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. Fear gives them power. That's what Democrats do. They make you so scared that they can control you. They want to keep us in a forever pandemic. So, the left isn't doing the one thing they always tell you to do -- follow the science. The C.D.C. issuing guidance this week telling vaccinated Americans to wear masks indoors, in public places with high cases. Do average Americans follow case counts county by county? No. Case counts are kind of irrelevant at this point. If you're vaxxed, this virus isn't deadly anymore. Your chance of catching COVID is small, and there is more than a 99 percent chance you won't die from it or even go to the hospital. Out of 161 million Americans who have been vaccinated, just a little over 1,000 have died. These are C.D.C. numbers. And almost all these deaths were older Americans with health problems. Now, any death is one too many, but big picture, you have a 0.0007 percent chance of dying from COVID if you are vaxxed. Low risk there is an understatement. You have a bigger chance of dying from a car crash whose death rate is point 0.0009 percent, but we still get in the car every day, don't we? But the left is hysterical. They are just being absolute Karens about all this, and they can't stop yelling about how some people aren't getting vaxxed. So, they're just deciding to punish everybody. The left keeps talking about COVID cases are up. But they're not talking about the low number of deaths. The average is just a couple hundred deaths a day in the U.S., this is the least deadly month since the pandemic began. We're talking about cases now because deaths are so low. The left overreacts because that's what they do. It's not possible for the country to function if Americans aren't willing to put up with the tiniest amount of risk. But again, back to masks. They want you to be like Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin here. Can you believe that? Wearing a face shield and a mask? How embarrassing. First they said, don't wear a mask. Then they said wear one. The left shamed everybody and everyone that didn't.",

Without freedom, we have nothing. The U.S., our Constitution, our entire social fabric is not going to be permanently changed by a virus that we nearly defeated. We basically beat this thing in a year. Daily deaths at an all-time low and COVID-19 isn't even in the top five leading causes of death in America right now. But we're stuck acting like every day is D-Day. No, we're in mop up mode, basically. Everything is open and has been for months. More than half the country is vaccinated and more continue to get shots every day. Everyone is flying, eating, making out, and enjoying their lives. If this was Ebola, then yes, you push hard for a hundred percent vaccination. But COVID, even before vaccines had a 98 percent survival rate. And now that is even higher, if you're vaxxed. Americans have all this information, they know the risks. You can only push so far, but the left won't stop. They are pushing and keeping us in this permanent pandemic. The left is always saying the right wing is moving towards authoritarianism, but they are the ones that want to force injections into Americans arms, then censor you for speaking out against it. What's more authoritarian than that? Joining me now to react, author of \"The Authoritarian Moment: How the Left Weaponized America's Institutions against Dissent,\" Ben Shapiro. All right, Ben, before we get to the book, which is great, what is your reaction to this craziness regarding masks? BEN SHAPIRO, AUTHOR, \"THE AUTHORITARIAN MOMENT\": It is madness. And it's not rooted in anything resembling logic or data, and the simple fact of the matter is that as you mentioned, Jesse, if you have had the vaccine, you're essentially safe from this virus. And if you haven't had the vaccine at this point, it's been out there for months, you've had every ability to get it, you can get it today if you want it, but you are a rational adult, you can make your own risk assessment. And now whatever happens is on you. The notion that we have to mask up everybody who is vaccinated to protect the unvaccinated, or that whatever Joe Biden says about masking is going to be effective anyway across the country is asinine on its face. Beyond that, the undermining of confidence in the vaccine is the big takeaway, I think, for a lot of Americans who are sort of on the fence. If you go out there and you keep saying over and over and over, that people who are vaccinated are still transmitting, people who are vaccinated are still creating risk, a lot of people out there are going to say to themselves, that their big takeaway is the vaccine is not working the way that you said it was working, which of course, is not true. The vaccines are working, they are working to prevent hospitalization. They're working to prevent death. But at a certain point, you have to say to the American people, you're on your own now. Go back to regular life. The movement of the goalposts here has been astonishing. At the beginning, it was two weeks to slow the spread, don't overwhelm the hospital system. So we did that. Then it was, wait until the vaccines are available, then we did that. And then it was wait until all adults have had the opportunity to get the vaccine and we did that. So, what are the goalposts now other than something that is utterly impossible, zero COVID and yet, that's what the Democrats and the White House seem to be focused in on.",

They want to keep us in a forever pandemic. So, the left isn't doing the one thing they always tell you to do -- follow the science. The C.D.C. issuing guidance this week telling vaccinated Americans to wear masks indoors, in public places with high cases. Do average Americans follow case counts county by county? No. Case counts are kind of irrelevant at this point. If you're vaxxed, this virus isn't deadly anymore. Your chance of catching COVID is small, and there is more than a 99 percent chance you won't die from it or even go to the hospital. Out of 161 million Americans who have been vaccinated, just a little over 1,000 have died. These are C.D.C. numbers. And almost all these deaths were older Americans with health problems. Now, any death is one too many, but big picture, you have a 0.0007 percent chance of dying from COVID if you are vaxxed. Low risk there is an understatement. You have a bigger chance of dying from a car crash whose death rate is point 0.0009 percent, but we still get in the car every day, don't we? But the left is hysterical. They are just being absolute Karens about all this, and they can't stop yelling about how some people aren't getting vaxxed. So, they're just deciding to punish everybody. The left keeps talking about COVID cases are up. But they're not talking about the low number of deaths. The average is just a couple hundred deaths a day in the U.S., this is the least deadly month since the pandemic began. We're talking about cases now because deaths are so low. The left overreacts because that's what they do. It's not possible for the country to function if Americans aren't willing to put up with the tiniest amount of risk. But again, back to masks. They want you to be like Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin here. Can you believe that? Wearing a face shield and a mask? How embarrassing. First they said, don't wear a mask. Then they said wear one. The left shamed everybody and everyone that didn't."

They want to control you, what you put on your face, what you say, how you run your business. They don't have the facts, so they push the fear. They are devoted to dividing Americans into bitter camps for political gain. The vaxxed and the unvaxxed. It's like the new race hustle. D.C. is going crazy. They re-impose their indoor mask mandate, even if you're vaxxed, anybody over two years old. Ready? There's been one COVID death in July, all of D.C. -- one, which has a population of 700,000 people. There were more homicides in that time frame in July. And yet, they decided, let's punish those who actually got the shot. The White House says D.C. is a hot zone. Yet, there were 21 COVID patients at D.C. hospitals as of Monday. It gets worse though. Now, if you're visiting the Capitol and not wearing a mask, you'll be arrested. But across the border with COVID illegally, and you get a free bus ticket to any city you want. By the way, who brought COVID to the Capitol in the first place?

He closed the Canadian border, but not the Mexican one. Canada cases are down, while Mexico's cases, way up. It's ridiculous. Why should we take anything he says about COVID seriously?

      "utterance": "Although I got the vaccine myself and encourage everybody to, you can't punish Americans for not injecting themselves with a brand new vaccine. Encourage, but you can't punish. Without freedom, we have nothing. The U.S., our Constitution, our entire social fabric is not going to be permanently changed by a virus that we nearly defeated. We basically beat this thing in a year. Daily deaths at an all-time low and COVID-19 isn't even in the top five leading causes of death in America right now. But we're stuck acting like every day is D-Day. No, we're in mop up mode, basically. Everything is open and has been for months. More than half the country is vaccinated and more continue to get shots every day. Everyone is flying, eating, making out, and enjoying their lives. If this was Ebola, then yes, you push hard for a hundred percent vaccination. But COVID, even before vaccines had a 98 percent survival rate. And now that is even higher, if you're vaxxed. Americans have all this information, they know the risks. You can only push so far, but the left won't stop. They are pushing and keeping us in this permanent pandemic. The left is always saying the right wing is moving towards authoritarianism, but they are the ones that want to force injections into Americans arms, then censor you for speaking out against it. What's more authoritarian than that? Joining me now to react, author of \"The Authoritarian Moment: How the Left Weaponized America's Institutions against Dissent,\" Ben Shapiro. All right, Ben, before we get to the book, which is great, what is your reaction to this craziness regarding masks? BEN SHAPIRO, AUTHOR, \"THE AUTHORITARIAN MOMENT\": It is madness. And it's not rooted in anything resembling logic or data, and the simple fact of the matter is that as you mentioned, Jesse, if you have had the vaccine, you're essentially safe from this virus. And if you haven't had the vaccine at this point, it's been out there for months, you've had every ability to get it, you can get it today if you want it, but you are a rational adult, you can make your own risk assessment. And now whatever happens is on you. The notion that we have to mask up everybody who is vaccinated to protect the unvaccinated, or that whatever Joe Biden says about masking is going to be effective anyway across the country is asinine on its face. Beyond that, the undermining of confidence in the vaccine is the big takeaway, I think, for a lot of Americans who are sort of on the fence. If you go out there and you keep saying over and over and over, that people who are vaccinated are still transmitting, people who are vaccinated are still creating risk, a lot of people out there are going to say to themselves, that their big takeaway is the vaccine is not working the way that you said it was working, which of course, is not true. The vaccines are working, they are working to prevent hospitalization. They're working to prevent death. But at a certain point, you have to say to the American people, you're on your own now. Go back to regular life. The movement of the goalposts here has been astonishing. At the beginning, it was two weeks to slow the spread, don't overwhelm the hospital system. So we did that. Then it was, wait until the vaccines are available, then we did that. And then it was wait until all adults have had the opportunity to get the vaccine and we did that. So, what are the goalposts now other than something that is utterly impossible, zero COVID and yet, that's what the Democrats and the White House seem to be focused in on."

So, every major institution that impacts our lives has now been re-normalized by a group of very aggressive radical leftists who have taken those institutions and weaponized them against us, whether you're talking about the entertainment sphere, or whether you're talking about education. Whether you're talking about the institutions of science, or whether you're talking about the media. Whether you're talking about social media or whether you're talking about the corporation you work for, there is a feeling by most Americans that if they say what they think that they could be ostracized from everyday society, fired from their job, excised from the body politic. You are not wrong to think that.

To understand what you have to do, you have to understand that what the left really has done is they've taken about 20 percent of each institution, and then they've been very aggressive and very intransigent, and they've waited for all the people in the middle to just collapse out of fear, or risk aversion, or conflict aversion. Well, you can do the same thing from the other side. If you can get 20 percent of your company to write the bosses and say, listen, these guys over here, they want us to have Ibram X. Kendi in here to indoctrinate us about the evils of whiteness, we're not going to do that. Perhaps your boss says, in response, okay, you know what, we're not. We're just going to be neutral on these issues.

I want to see full choice in the State of West Virginia. The money is attached to the child's backpack. It goes wherever the child goes -- public school, private school, Catholic school, homeschooling. You don't like what's going on? The teachers don't show up, school isn't open. You don't like what they're teaching, you go somewhere else, and more options are opening up.

I have my own podcast, I write books, I make documentaries, I go on tour, and I play at clubs and theaters. So it's a little tough to pull the plug on me. Now, if I just worked for the Disney Corporation, then I would absolutely be punished. Now, none of my documentaries make it into Sundance, which is the biggest film festival in the world, so I'm punished that way. But it's a small price to pay for speaking your mind."

And everybody should be able to laugh at that, no matter what your political background. I just want to thank Corolla for having me on his podcast. Hopefully, I didn't ruin your brand too significantly. I had a good time and I hope everybody goes and check out that podcast. Adam, thanks so much for coming on."

Home surveillance video in Baltimore capturing a woman trying to run over a man, probably the ex. I think it's the ex. He wasn't hit, but not for lack of trying. The guy dodged the car like it was an Olympic sport. Joining me now on this, FOX News contributor, Raymond Arroyo. That's how women act when they break up with you, Raymond. They're just so passionate. They want to hit you with their car."

You know, I mean, the poor Honda got the hell beat out of it. But look, they broke my first cardinal rule of female-male relationships. You never break up with a woman if she is behind the wheel. Very dangerous. I mean, and I guess it was his car. So, she had no qualms about smashing it into the neighborhood. The insurance rates are going through the roof. She didn't care. She bashed the whole block. It's unbelievable."

When you look at this guy, his motto on the side of the shack there in the wilderness of Mamou, Louisiana. He writes, \"Bring your house and share your spouse.\" Now looking at this guy, you're safer sharing the house, Jesse. Okay. This is kind of like campgrounds of America for the STD set. You get a plug-in and a vial of penicillin and you know, he shows you to the \"Chainsaw Massacre\" suite. I mean, who would want to go in the woods with this guy?"

But then I thought, it looks like the green room of \"The Five\" when catering doesn't show up, Jesse. With all the mauling and yelling over each other. I've seen it. But no, this is what happens when animals don't eat. They need to feed these poor things. The best part was the end. Thank goodness, when Dr. Fauci came out, and he called all the unvaccinated monkeys back into the C.D.C. to get their masks, so then they could go out and terrorize the populace. That was a -- that's my favorite part of this redemptive video that you help me opine on."

And unfortunately, the event is sold out, maybe you can sneak in. But don't fret, you can still catch me in Northvale, New Jersey on Wednesday. Wednesday around 7:30 in the evening, right after \"The Five.\" I'm just going to bike up there, a little motor scooter. Get your tickets now. And I'll be signing books, I'll be shaking hands, and kissing babies. Maybe you can even touch me. I could let you touch me. This past week, I was at the Nixon Library and thank you, guys so much for supporting my book. It's doing really well, and that's thanks to you. That's all for tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. \"JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE\" is next and remember, I'm Watters, and this is my world.
