      "sentences": "Do any of you of a certain age remember this image, Sputnik October 1957? The then-Soviet Union stuns the world, announcing that it had launched a satellite into space, and that adding insult to injury, at least for American pride, just a few years later, indicating that it had launched the first human being into space, Yuri Gagarin. Well, don't look now, but we have had another Sputnik moment on a Financial Times story that was, well, kind of put in perspective by The New York Post that we're reliving China's Sputnik moment, that it has an advanced technology here that is so unusual, people are starting to say, where did they come up with this low-missile technology that completely defies what we thought they were able to come up with on their own? The big question right now isn't whether that's hypersonic missile, that can fly in a low orbit and not be traced, just the fact that they have it, but that we had no idea they were anywhere close to it. Let's get the read right now from Lieutenant Colonel Danny Davis on the significance of this. Danny looking at this and our surprise that they have it, even though China is backing away from talk that they have it, but they clearly have something, what do you make of it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, honestly, I'm a little puzzled at why everybody's acting like this is some surprise, when this is not a Sputnik moment. Sputnik was -- they were -- Russians were the first one up into space. At the very best, China's third in line here already. And they're just trying to catch up, because Russia has already got a hypersonic missile. We have tested a hypersonic missile just within the last number of months. And it's also important to point out that, as long -- as far back as 2016, the DOD report that they produce for Congress every year has been warning about and every year since that China's working on a hypersonic missile. So there is no surprise here. But, Neil, the most important thing is that this doesn't change anything in capacity, because China's already had ICBMs that were faster than anything we could deflect anyway. So it doesn't change the capacity. It just shows that China is a developing, modernizing country that we have to take seriously.",

But, look, this doesn't add anything, and I mean nothing, to our security risk, because the Soviet Union -- or the Russians have had these same capabilities, much more advanced. And we deter them all the time. We have a 20-fold nuclear advantage over China even with all of this, so this is just for them to enhance their deterrent, but in no way does it add the ability for them to strike first, because they know we would annihilate them.

So Chinese companies can afford to invest in places where they will never make a profit, because there are political advantages to be gained. Then, of course, it also helps out Chinese R&D.

The Chinese military steals commercial secrets in a way that no other country's military is charged with doing. But another part of this is that Chinese companies are very flexible, they are able to turn on a dime, to start production in very short order. And that, in turn, is in part because they face a lot fewer regulatory aspects. It takes forever to start a new factory in the United States. We haven't built a new oil refinery in years. China's building 30-plus coal-fired power plants, nuclear power plants, oil refineries. You can be pretty sure that they don't go through all the regulations that an American company would have to.",

It's the fact that this thing went into orbit. It didn't just go up and come down. It went around the Earth at least once. What that means is that we now have to look at every Chinese satellite as a possible nuclear delivery system. This is something we and the Russians both agreed on during the Cold War. This was highly destabilizing, very dangerous. So both sides said we will not develop what's called a fractional orbital bombardment system. This Chinese system that they have tested, if it is correct that it's actually gone into orbit before coming down, is a game-changer, in the sense that now we have a much less stable world and much more potential threats.",

He told union members at the White House that a lot of the provisions were thanks to Bernie Sanders. Joe Manchin, though, he didn't provide much of a lift for the president during the campaign.

      "utterance": "Do any of you of a certain age remember this image, Sputnik October 1957? The then-Soviet Union stuns the world, announcing that it had launched a satellite into space, and that adding insult to injury, at least for American pride, just a few years later, indicating that it had launched the first human being into space, Yuri Gagarin. Well, don't look now, but we have had another Sputnik moment on a Financial Times story that was, well, kind of put in perspective by The New York Post that we're reliving China's Sputnik moment, that it has an advanced technology here that is so unusual, people are starting to say, where did they come up with this low-missile technology that completely defies what we thought they were able to come up with on their own? The big question right now isn't whether that's hypersonic missile, that can fly in a low orbit and not be traced, just the fact that they have it, but that we had no idea they were anywhere close to it. Let's get the read right now from Lieutenant Colonel Danny Davis on the significance of this. Danny looking at this and our surprise that they have it, even though China is backing away from talk that they have it, but they clearly have something, what do you make of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LT. COL. DANNY DAVIS (RET.), U.S. ARMY",
      "utterance": "Yes, honestly, I'm a little puzzled at why everybody's acting like this is some surprise, when this is not a Sputnik moment. Sputnik was -- they were -- Russians were the first one up into space. At the very best, China's third in line here already. And they're just trying to catch up, because Russia has already got a hypersonic missile. We have tested a hypersonic missile just within the last number of months. And it's also important to point out that, as long -- as far back as 2016, the DOD report that they produce for Congress every year has been warning about and every year since that China's working on a hypersonic missile. So there is no surprise here. But, Neil, the most important thing is that this doesn't change anything in capacity, because China's already had ICBMs that were faster than anything we could deflect anyway. So it doesn't change the capacity. It just shows that China is a developing, modernizing country that we have to take seriously."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "Well, it is a clear technological advancement. There's no question about that, which is why we're pursuing it so heavily, because even a lot of the missile defenses that are in the process right now of being developed, not yet on the board, cannot take care of even the ICBMs. But this will now mean even what they're working on, if they get it, it's not going to be sufficient. So we have to develop new ones, new capabilities to defend against this. So, it is an advancement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, why is that, Colonel? Does -- is it difficult to track? Is it, it has more flexibility? How would you describe it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is so much faster than anything else, which is why they call it the hypersonic glide vehicle, and many of them can maneuver, which makes it even harder to do. So it's much faster than even the already very fast ICBMs that we know of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Colonel, if you think about this, along with their very advanced space program -- they just launched three individuals into space who are going to stay up there for six months, not in the International Space Station, their own space station -- they have aggressively got a rover on Mars as we speak right now. They have explored the moon on the dark, far side of the moon as well. They have already brought lunar samples back on these lunar vehicles, unmanned vehicles. You could say, oh, well, there's still way behind us in the space program. But that's a little more than a couple of years. They're investing more in space than every other country combined. What do you make of all that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVIS",
      "utterance": "Yes, they are. There's no doubt about it. But I think what this really illustrates is that we have just become accustomed to China to being like this third-rate power that's way beyond - - that they're not even a near-peer competitor, and they're now demonstrating that they are. But, look, this doesn't add anything, and I mean nothing, to our security risk, because the Soviet Union -- or the Russians have had these same capabilities, much more advanced. And we deter them all the time. We have a 20-fold nuclear advantage over China even with all of this, so this is just for them to enhance their deterrent, but in no way does it add the ability for them to strike first, because they know we would annihilate them. Correctly, they think that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we will watch it very, very closely. For those wondering, that came after I spoke about these developments. We were showing you in that quad box all the latest space initiatives that China has embarked on right now, including these three astronauts who are going to be up at their own Chinese space station for the better part of six months, and some of these others on the moon and on Mars. So, Colonel, thank you very, very much. We appreciate that."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, the implications of all of this for a country that has a lot of money to spend. Keep in mind that China runs a surplus, not only with this country, to the tune of about half-a-trillion dollars, but with almost every other country on Earth. And that is the currency that they seem to be tapping for these big initiatives. Let's get the read from Dean Cheng, the senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Dean, where are they coming up with all this money? Because this is serious money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEAN CHENG, HERITAGE ASIAN STUDIES CENTER",
      "utterance": "Well, this is serious money because the Chinese, one, they have a high savings rate. Two, they do have a state-run banking system, and they have a lot of state-owned enterprises. So Chinese companies can afford to invest in places where they will never make a profit, because there are political advantages to be gained. Then, of course, it also helps out Chinese R&D. It's important to note China has a very substantial, robust R&D program of its own, but it's supplemented by intellectual property theft, which has been the focus of why the U.S. has imposed tariffs on China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, part of that alleged theft is the supersonic missile technology, to say nothing of the rover that is right now driving around on Mars that almost mimics to a T. our own. Where in hell do they manage to get this stuff so quickly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENG",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a combination of things. On the one hand, they have a massive, extensive cyber economic espionage program. The Chinese military steals commercial secrets in a way that no other country's military is charged with doing. But another part of this is that Chinese companies are very flexible, they are able to turn on a dime, to start production in very short order. And that, in turn, is in part because they face a lot fewer regulatory aspects. It takes forever to start a new factory in the United States. We haven't built a new oil refinery in years. China's building 30-plus coal-fired power plants, nuclear power plants, oil refineries. You can be pretty sure that they don't go through all the regulations that an American company would have to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, I'm just wondering what they're building here. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENG",
      "utterance": "So, I think one of the most important things -- and I agree with Colonel Davis that the issue isn't the hypersonic glide vehicle aspect. It's the fact that this thing went into orbit. It didn't just go up and come down. It went around the Earth at least once. What that means is that we now have to look at every Chinese satellite as a possible nuclear delivery system. This is something we and the Russians both agreed on during the Cold War. This was highly destabilizing, very dangerous. So both sides said we will not develop what's called a fractional orbital bombardment system. This Chinese system that they have tested, if it is correct that it's actually gone into orbit before coming down, is a game-changer, in the sense that now we have a much less stable world and much more potential threats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Dean, this comes with the context of their provocative moves in and around Taiwan, including invading Taiwanese airspace, and now not too far offshore even threatening with their own fishermen looking for squid. I just thought all of that and I said, is there a way to piece all this together? Are they assuming or amassing something and challenging the United States thinking that it won't do anything or should do anything?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHENG",
      "utterance": "Well, the Chinese are pushing against all of their neighbors. They're pushing Taiwan. They're pushing Japan. They're pushing India. There's been deaths along the Sino-Indian border, be -- as the border forces fought each other. But we're also seeing a China that looks at what happening Kabul in Afghanistan, looks at John Kerry saying that we should lift sanctions on Chinese solar panels because solar panels and climate change is more important than human rights. And, yes, they're seeing an America that seems to be in retreat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

But some of the technology and images saying, OK, proprietary to the F.T., seem to confirm a sentiment that's been building that China has rapidly been accelerating its high-tech defense end of the program just as it as its Martian initiatives, which, by the way, it didn't have a little more than 18 months ago. Meanwhile, another development to follow in what's going on in Afghanistan right now, the effort to get people who are trapped there out of there, even though our soldiers have long left their.

And thus came the subject matter of 24/7, which I have referenced a couple years back, as we look forward to the volume that was to come here. So, I think one of the things that we're doing is, again, extending the hours. We have a 24/7 pilot project. That's not going to be an immediate cure. There are challenges. Everybody has to be on board. And, of course, that includes the trucking community."

So, again, I think, again, it is problematic for an immediate turnaround on this in terms of how you flip that switch. But the good news, I believe, is the collaboration that is being had with everybody in the supply chain, being truckers, the warehouses, the beneficial cargo owners and, of course, the port authorities. There's a lot of robust discussion with regard to what needs to be done in the short term."

That begs the question, then, if we knew that was going to happen, demand would spike to the degree it has, why not move earlier to go 24/7?"

But to that point, Neil, I think that's why, back in 2018, I mentioned to this industry about the fact of we needed to move to a 24/7 mind-set. So I think that for those who may question that, obviously, there's legitimate concerns in terms of how fast you do that. But, on the other hand, had we been 24/7, I believe we would have substantially mitigated the situation we have today. And, of course, e-commerce, we can't escape the fact that Americans have elevated at a double-digit percentile the use of e-commerce."

And because of that, Neil, some of their social programs may get cut down. That's leading to some bad blood out there. Let's take climate change, for example, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia opposing a $150 billion clean energy initiative that would have targeted coal and gas plants like those in his state. Well, on Friday, Senator Bernie Sanders published an op-ed in West Virginia blasting Manchin for not siding with Democrats. And Manchin hit back, saying -- quote -- \"I will not vote for a reckless expansion of government programs. No op-ed from a self-declared independent socialist is going to change that.\" Democrats, though, other Democrats, remain hopeful something will get done."

And so now that there's some sort of agreement that this is going to be in the $2 trillion dollar neighborhood, I think what we're seeing is, you have a lot of members who are not having the most high-minded, principled discussions amongst themselves, but instead are doing old-fashioned log rolling, pitting parochial interests against parochial interests.

I mean, Bill Clinton had come up with them back in the '90s with Newt Gingrich.

You don't see Democrats going after Republicans. Republicans are not the boogeyman here. Instead, they're kind of out of the picture. Instead, this is an interesting fight between Democrats. And the interesting thing here is, again and again, you have seen Joe Biden praise Bernie Sanders, his former opponent on the campaign trail. He told union members at the White House that a lot of the provisions were thanks to Bernie Sanders. Joe Manchin, though, he didn't provide much of a lift for the president during the campaign. And, instead, he is representing the state that the former president won. And yet he's the one who is sort of holding things up. At the moment, the question doesn't seem to be whether or not progressives are going to bolt like they did before in the House. The question seems to be whether or not the moderate president, who promised on the campaign trail that he was certainly more moderate than the opposition, can get the other moderates on board."

These officers do not have the right to dictate to the city the manner in what -- in which they are going to work. They can bargain with it, as unions do all the time. But get the vaccine.

In the meantime, no guessing about gas prices, still rocketing, but there's a major Wall Street firm that says we could get up to $200 oil. And I have already done the math.

That means we are relying on some nefarious characters that could stick it to us. Gas prices have been up 20 straight days here. And if one brokerage firm is right, predicting more than $200-a-barrel oil, $200 a barrel, you do the rough math on gasoline prices, you could be at $12, $15, $20 a gallon.

And, boy, do we need the voice that Colin Powell just used talking to you from years ago in the public domain right now, really class act. And he was always a class act. I first met him in 1983, when I worked for President Reagan at the White House and got to know Colin Powell then, obviously worked closely with him when I worked with President George H.W. Bush, and then I was secretary of transportation when he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and then as chief of staff to George W. Bush. And Colin Powell is the -- he was the real deal, I mean, grounded, had the courage to speak truth to power, was a phenomenal listener. He empowered everyone. He lifted people up. And his work in the military is legendary. His work in the White House is legendary as a national security adviser. And his work as secretary of state, he proved to be one of the greatest diplomats in the world and greatly respected. And -- but what he actually did even beyond that was amazing, because he was the ultimate point of light in terms of making a difference. He led America's Promise and the Little Red Wagon campaign."

      "utterance": "He's mentoring literally hundreds of people, and just done so much. And he and Alma Powell are the prime definition of what it means to be a supportive couple. They were a great complement to each other. And, boy, do we -- we are going to miss them. And I respected Colin Powell very, very much. I had tough conversations with him when I was chief of staff and he was secretary of state. That's kind of the job that we both had."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, he didn't like the political thing. But I wonder, Andy, if -- and I know we're tight for time. I apologize for that. But he left the Republican Party, it seemed, frustrated with the party, particularly when Donald Trump became president, saying; \"We have a Constitution. We have to follow the Constitution. And the president has drifted away from it.\" He had a lot stronger things to say that I can't repeat on a family show. But what did you make of that?"

    {
      "speaker": "CARD",
      "utterance": "Well, it was the truth. Colin Powell entered service, came from New York, Queens, New York. He entered the service, served in Vietnam. He wasn't a Republican or a Democrat. He was a soldier. And then he became a Republican later on. He supported George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush."

      "speaker": "CARD",
      "utterance": "He made a huge difference in diplomacy. But he was never a strong partisan. And September 11, he rallied, but he was just a great leader, getting the rest of the world to be with the United States in the coalitions that worked in Afghanistan and then in Iraq. And then let's not forget what happened on January 6. On January 6, Colin Powell had tears in his eyes."

      "utterance": "Got it. Got it. Andy, I'm sorry very much for the tightened time, but thank you for your reflections on that. I will just remember a man who was kind enough to always write a note. I would write a note to him and a prominent guest when they appeared on this show. He was one of the few to write a note back over my note. Remarkable. Just remarkable. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
