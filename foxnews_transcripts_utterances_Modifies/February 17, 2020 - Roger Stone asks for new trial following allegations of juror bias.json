The president set to hold a big rally in Vegas on Friday. This is getting to be a pattern, isn't it? All this and concerns that the Nevada caucus could be a repeat of Iowa. They claim, no, it won't be. Is there a disaster in the making with some, well, smart apps? We will see.  Welcome, everybody. Happy Monday to you. I'm Neil Cavuto.  To Ellison Barber now in Henderson, Nevada, where they are bracing for, well, what they hope to avoid, caucus chaos.  What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil.  Yes, there's -- without a doubt the cloud of Iowa is hanging over this state, but candidates they are proceeding as normal. They are on the ground. They are meeting with as many people as they can, trying to make sure that their supporters not only get out and caucus Saturday, but also go out and vote early. Senator Elizabeth warren is holding a rally inside this building behind me to try and get her voters to do exactly that. We have seen all of the front-runners in Nevada in the last few days going to rallies, meeting with supporters at campaign offices, trying to get them to go out and knock on as many doors as they can.  Senator Bernie Sanders actually walked with some of his supporters to a polling location on the first day, when early voting began. Nevada Democrats say that over 18,000 people voted on the first day of early voting. As you mentioned, Nevada is an incredibly important state for a number of reasons.   One, it is the first test of how these candidates will do among a more diverse electorate. But also there's the situation of what happened in Iowa, New Hampshire had a primary. We have not seen caucuses since Iowa. This is the first state where those will be taking place. And there is some pressure as to whether or not any of the issues that occurred in Iowa will happen again here. Party officials say absolutely not, that they are ready for this. They had plans to use the same results recording app that was used in Iowa, but they got rid of that app and changed course after the issues in Iowa. And they say they are now using technology that is off-the-shelf technology, not technology that has been newly developed, for people to electronically record the results, technology that Google has created and they have overseen. And they have run through it with all of them, as well as backup paper records.   The real test, of course, will be Saturday, but for now party officials say that they are ready. I did speak to a couple people that are involved in different caucuses over the weekend. And for the most part, they seem pretty optimistic here that things will be OK. But, as you mentioned, there's still certainly some fears and, without a doubt, pressure that would happen in Iowa doesn't happen again. And party officials say they're doing everything they can to avoid that. And we will see soon -- Neil.",

I'm a conservative Catholic. but Bernie has a message, a vision of the good society.  I may disagree with much of it, but it's an idea. And so does President Trump. And then you have this kind of technocratic middle, the likes of Mayor Bloomberg. And Hillary would represent the return of that as well. And it's just so insulting. The fact that he's not campaigning in any of the early states, he's not shaking hands, he's not bothering with any of that, and just is rolling in with vast amounts of money, it should offend anyone, whether right or left, your democratic sensibility.",

But now we're going to see that really continue on all the way to convention, where people don't have that motivation. They can hang around. Maybe somebody stumbles. Maybe someone has a bad gaffe or some old reports come up, and they're able to hang through. I think the bigger test is going to be, what do you do for those people who are more, as was mentioned, those center-left folks? Where do they really fit, those that are more in that pragmatic category, maybe more the Amy Klobuchar types of folks? It's clear, though, that Hillary Clinton is not the answer. Even amongst those Americans who dislike President Trump, over half of those folks think it would be worse if Hillary were in office. And so that doesn't really help any kind of momentum.

That's basically the definition of a winning candidacy for president. Are you better off than you were three years ago? That's what Reagan said. And it did well for him. What I'm -- what you do need to -- when you break down the numbers, you do have to give President Obama some credit. The last three years of his presidency, he produced 8.1 million jobs, new jobs. Now, in the first three years of Trump's presidency, you have 6.1 million jobs. Those are the estimates. And so you do have a slower recovery going on now.

This is most assuredly a crisis communications issue, given all the considerations involved. In that sense, no, it was a colossal failure, the Thursday rollout, and the 72 hours that followed. Ironically, this is both good and bad for baseball. OK? We're still six weeks out from opening day. NFL is over. We're still a couple of weeks away from March Madness. This is a slow time in the sports year, yet there's interest and discussion around baseball. OK? On the bad side, there's a lot at stake. I mentioned the revenue a moment ago. Secondly, we have already seen the first lawsuit by a pitcher who was essentially shown the door because he gave up four runs, four hits and three walks in just 29 pitches, which is crazy. And now you're even possibly going to see increased punishment against opposing pitchers that might pick off an Astros batter. So, ostensibly, an opposing pitcher could get punished more for hitting an Astros batter than a potentially an Astro could have for this whole cheating scandal.

They are meeting with as many people as they can, trying to make sure that their supporters not only get out and caucus Saturday, but also go out and vote early. Senator Elizabeth warren is holding a rally inside this building behind me to try and get her voters to do exactly that. We have seen all of the front-runners in Nevada in the last few days going to rallies, meeting with supporters at campaign offices, trying to get them to go out and knock on as many doors as they can. Senator Bernie Sanders actually walked with some of his supporters to a polling location on the first day, when early voting began. Nevada Democrats say that over 18,000 people voted on the first day of early voting. As you mentioned, Nevada is an incredibly important state for a number of reasons. One, it is the first test of how these candidates will do among a more diverse electorate. But also there's the situation of what happened in Iowa, New Hampshire had a primary. We have not seen caucuses since Iowa. This is the first state where those will be taking place. And there is some pressure as to whether or not any of the issues that occurred in Iowa will happen again here. Party officials say absolutely not, that they are ready for this. They had plans to use the same results recording app that was used in Iowa, but they got rid of that app and changed course after the issues in Iowa. And they say they are now using technology that is off-the-shelf technology, not technology that has been newly developed, for people to electronically record the results, technology that Google has created and they have overseen. And they have run through it with all of them, as well as backup paper records. The real test, of course, will be Saturday, but for now party officials say that they are ready. I did speak to a couple people that are involved in different caucuses over the weekend. And for the most part, they seem pretty optimistic here that things will be OK. But, as you mentioned, there's still certainly some fears and, without a doubt, pressure that would happen in Iowa doesn't happen again.

And the numbers, Boyd Matheson, seem to indicate to him he's got to do everything possible to avoid Bernie Sanders winning on a first ballot. When I raised that with Jane Sanders this past weekend, she was more or less saying, in the past, we have had nominees get to a convention, not necessarily with a majority of the delegates, or, in this case, the 1,991 you would need to be nominated, but darn close. In other words, most should cinch it. What do you think of that argument?"

It used to be there were only one or two tickets out of Iowa, one or two tickets out of New Hampshire, possibly. But now we're going to see that really continue on all the way to convention, where people don't have that motivation. They can hang around. Maybe somebody stumbles. Maybe someone has a bad gaffe or some old reports come up, and they're able to hang through. I think the bigger test is going to be, what do you do for those people who are more, as was mentioned, those center-left folks? Where do they really fit, those that are more in that pragmatic category, maybe more the Amy Klobuchar types of folks? It's clear, though, that Hillary Clinton is not the answer. Even amongst those Americans who dislike President Trump, over half of those folks think it would be worse if Hillary were in office. And so that doesn't really help any kind of momentum. And I actually think Bloomberg's biggest challenge is, he's not connecting with the people individually. You have to actually invite people to do something, which is what Bernie Sanders does better than anyone. He invites them to be part of a movement."

How is he going to do that, with a magic wand? And, of course, here we are three years later with a million-and-a-half more of these blue-collar jobs. One other point. When I was on the campaign in 2016, and we would go to states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Iowa and West Virginia and Kentucky, and when you would ask people -- I would always ask people, how's that Obama recovery going for you? And you know what, Neil, people would say? What recovery are you talking about? Because it was a good economy if you lived in Silicon Valley or Hollywood or Wall Street or in Washington, D.C., but in the rest of the country, not so much; 36 percent of the American people rated the economy good or great during the Obama presidency. Today, almost 70 percent rate the economy as good or great."

In the last three years of his administration, to hear the Obama folks tell it, eclipse the three years of job gains under this president. We could play fast, loose with the numbers on either side, by the way. I'm not meaning to disparage Steve at all. But this notion that maybe both men can take a bow, what do you think?"

I mean, you had a Gallup poll out, recent Gallup poll out saying 90 percent of Americans, a record high, are happy with their personal lives, including their financial personal wealth, and their prospects, and 61 percent are -- feel like they're better off and more satisfied than they were three years ago. That's basically the definition of a winning candidacy for president. Are you better off than you were three years ago? That's what Reagan said. And it did well for him. What I'm -- what you do need to -- when you break down the numbers, you do have to give President Obama some credit. The last three years of his presidency, he produced 8.1 million jobs, new jobs. Now, in the first three years of Trump's presidency, you have 6.1 million jobs. Those are the estimates. And so you do have a slower recovery going on now. But the issue is, I think, is, he's building on an already stable economy. So this is like more growth. And people are already satisfied, and you're over that recession."

And all demographic groups, all groups of Americans, from whites, to Hispanics, African-Americans, women, are looking at record low unemployment levels. And Americans in a Gallup poll seem to give this present the tip on that one. Where do you think this goes? Like, when people sort of crunch it down, how -- what will be the winning argument?"

I just think that's -- it's hard to square with the facts. The other thing, Susan, the problem your analysis on the jobs is the big boost that has happened under Trump has been what's happening with wages and income. So, in three years, median household income has gone up over more than $4,000 under Trump, whereas, in eight years under Obama, they went up only $1,000.

Should she have even been on the jury in the first place? Not much talk about that. Former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky on the implications of all of this. I guess -- and you know the legal process far better than I -- that there are Republicans who are saying, you know what? Just throw out the whole case. Where does this go, this particular aspect, with the jury foreperson having clear biases and a record of social media attacks on the president and those around him, including Roger Stone?"

So, yes, it's possible that there could be cause for a new trial altogether. But that comes down to how the voir dire, how the jury selection process took place, what was disclosed, and how the attorneys decided to seat that panel."

I don't know about the ones that called him a white supremacist racist who supported him were shared, but nevertheless did. And let's say they did allow her on because she might have similarly said, yes, but I can be a neutral observer here. Would that fly? And, ultimately, is that even her fault? They went ahead and both sides approved her to join the jury pool."

And that does happen in certain cases. So the question you really have here is, did these prosecutors really run this recommendation all the way up the flagpole to the DOJ before they offered that? And, again, these are just recommendations from the prosecutors. These are just DOJ employees offering their opinion of the case. And from what it looks like, they're claiming that Barr's interaction or interference was political.

So here you have this divisive figure that's 0-2 in presidential campaigns that about one-third of the country likes, and you want to bring her on board, a fellow New Yorker, so it doesn't even give you any sort of electoral advantage?

That's who they're going to back? I don't know. Maybe he's seen as the safest choice. But, right now -- I thought he was a formidable candidate going into this because of his record in New York.

      "utterance": "No. I tweeted days ago that I wanted the U.S. government to stay out of it. Our greatest desire at this point is to maintain the quarantine that the Japanese health officials have established, and then get a test for the virus after the end of that quarantine, so we can establish with relative certainty that we are not infected and could be even free to go."

They can move around. They have a little bit more freedom and flexibility. And they'd much rather that than the unknown of going to the United States, being re-quarantined. They just didn't want to put up with it. From what we understand, he remains or they remain on that ship and have not taken the U.S. up on that offer to be flown back home. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Health Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the director there, Dr. Anthony Fauci, with us now, Doctor, did they make a mistake? Do you think that couple made a mistake by not taking the U.S. on the offer to come back home?"

      "utterance": "You know, I don't want to judge whether they made a mistake or not. But I could tell you, if I were in their shoes, I would want to get on a plane and get back here. Clearly, on the ship, there was transmission of infection. Whether or not it was post the quarantine process or not is unclear. But I think that the thing that we felt strongly about is that we wanted to get our people off that ship as safely and as comfortably as possible back to the United States to complete their 14-day quarantine and, for those who are infected, to be shipped, as several of them were, to Nebraska to be able to be taken care of, under the conditions of experienced people. So my choice certainly would have been to get off the boat, to get on the plane and to come back home."

There's a report coming out of Taipei, via The Taiwan News, sir, that says it is possible to get infected by the coronavirus a second time, and it could lead to death from heart failure in some cases, with much more dangerous and provocative symptoms. I mean, in the rare possibilities of getting reacquainted with the disease, how, first of all, of a threat, how much of a threat is that?"

There are a lot of reports that are coming out that are not peer-reviewed, that they are just trying to get information out as quickly as possible, and then, on reexamination, it turns out that, under scrutiny, it may not be the case. So, I don't want to pass any judgment on that, but I would be really be careful that we don't draw any conclusions based on a single report that's not peer-reviewed by scientific evaluation."

Or are people getting ahead of themselves here?"

I hope that it is correct that we're seeing a trend in the number of cases that are coming down. But until I see a consistent trend, day after day after day, I wouldn't jump to any positive conclusions. I hope they're right. But I'm not absolutely convinced.

And now he's had really two devastating losses. He didn't come in second place or bunched up in a third place. It was fourth and fifth, Iowa, New Hampshire. Beating expectations is fine for Iowa, New Hampshire. He's got to win South Carolina. That was his firewall. That is the African-American support, 60, 61 percent of the vote that he needs. And that's slipping right now."

And Eugene McCarthy was a strong number two. The next thing we know, Lyndon Johnson is stepping out of the race. I'm not comparing the two, other than to say it's about expectations. And the expectations, I guess, to your point, have been very high for the former vice president in this state. What would be a disappointment, in your eyes, John?"

But the thing is that we're seeing already a division among younger African-Americans and older African-Americans. Older African- Americans over the age of 45 or so, he is soaring, but under 45 or so, he's just barely hanging on against Bernie Sanders and, surprisingly, Tom Steyer as well."

    {
      "speaker": "DOUG ELDRIDGE, DLE AGENCY",
      "utterance": "Look, Neil, from a traditional public relations standpoint, you have to remember MLB is now a multibillion-dollar entity. Last year, they did $10.7 billion in revenue for the 17th consecutive year that they saw record growth. So when we talk about this, we're not talking about a general public relations issue. This is most assuredly a crisis communications issue, given all the considerations involved. In that sense, no, it was a colossal failure, the Thursday rollout, and the 72 hours that followed. Ironically, this is both good and bad for baseball. OK? We're still six weeks out from opening day. NFL is over. We're still a couple of weeks away from March Madness. This is a slow time in the sports year, yet there's interest and discussion around baseball. OK? On the bad side, there's a lot at stake. I mentioned the revenue a moment ago. Secondly, we have already seen the first lawsuit by a pitcher who was essentially shown the door because he gave up four runs, four hits and three walks in just 29 pitches, which is crazy. And now you're even possibly going to see increased punishment against opposing pitchers that might pick off an Astros batter. So, ostensibly, an opposing pitcher could get punished more for hitting an Astros batter than a potentially an Astro could have for this whole cheating scandal. So, there's a little bit of a paradoxical effect."

When he was ultimately banned from cycling for life, the Tour de France essentially erased his name. Now, they never rotated up number two or number three or number four. And there's a very good reason for that, because it was really pervasive at the time. But, by way of analogy, there's not really an apples-for-apples comparison within MLB. That would be unprecedented. So I definitely don't foresee that happening."

That would be the difference in a ballpoint pen scraping over that beautiful blue dress shirt you're wearing today, vs. leaving the cap off of a felt tip and having an ink spot that bleeds and ruins the shirt altogether. What's my point? The point is, right now, it's contained, and eventually they're going to move on to spring games. Then we're going to see opening day and fanfare and pageantry and excitement at the ballpark."

But let's be honest, Neil. By any objective metric or measurement, they didn't. Not only were they reactive and responsive, as opposed to proactive. There was no narrative control. And now you have an absolute echo chamber on social media rampant with conspiracy theories, even to the possibility of a buzzer that was worn underneath the jersey and theories about why he did it or didn't the jersey torn off."

Then they can save the shirt, scrub the stain, save the shirt, and move forward with baseball, because their bottom line has supported 17 straight years of growth. They're playing with the big B's now."
