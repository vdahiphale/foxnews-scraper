I give the Democrats a little credit for trying to play a brand of politics that may or may not work by shifting some of the responsibility. Here are the facts. There are some serious people who had some really dumb ideas about defunding the police a year ago. I was not one of them. I made clear that any person speaking that book obviously does not care about the people he or she represents, nor do they live in a community that needs policing. And I might add all communities do. Good policing roots out violence. Good policing roots out gun violence and the awful things that happen, and they're happening in many cities. I might add, the great political affirmation we have this evening about Democrats, if you look at the top two Democrats that finished in the mayoral race, both were against defunding the police. One is a former captain of the police department, and that was in a Democratic primary. Democrats are going to have to get away from this issue, though, for all of the obvious reasons. I think Secretary Bennett is right about the political predicate, and your polling confirms it, Bret, that if Democrats are seen being weak on crime, weak against violence in communities, big cities, small cities alike, we're going to lose. I might add Republicans need to come around on this ghost gun issue. Biden is right about that. But the optics and the messaging, Democrats are going to have to shift and shift dramatically to get this right.",

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, yes, and it's why you see Republicans expressing some optimism about their chance because, look, politics is local. We talked about this a lot. You showed that poll, and people are seeing crime in their cities. And that is something that really, really resonates with. And one of the remarkable things here is why it has taken so long for the White House to come around on this, because Harold is right, starting last summer it was only a few voices. But it's the silence that has really hurt the rest of the Democratic Party. And even in the wake of last year's midterm, there were a number of Democrats who lost their seats who came back to the party and said we did because of the defund the police argument. We have got to stop it. And, yet, it's continued on. So we'll see what kind of damage control, where this damage control gets them.

I thought Secretary Granholm was trying to answer a question. And there's no doubt we have not heard much about climate change, but we have heard salt water could have played a role, and we'll learn more and we'll have more definitive answers soon. But while we are having this debate, China continues to make huge advancements in quantum computing, advanced manufacturing, advanced medicine making, and even the advance in next generation energy products that will be consumed around the globe. I would agree with Kimberley, this first bill should focus on physical infrastructure. I think the electric vehicle battery powering stations should be a big part of that certainly as a part of physical infrastructure, energy, those airports, roads, and bridges should make up the first part. And anyone concerned about the second phase or second chapter or second state may be of what the president may do, remember Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, Kyrsten Sinema said they are not going to support breaking the rules that many fear could be broken here.

      "utterance": "So politics, you're going to have politics. I give the Democrats a little credit for trying to play a brand of politics that may or may not work by shifting some of the responsibility. Here are the facts. There are some serious people who had some really dumb ideas about defunding the police a year ago. I was not one of them. I made clear that any person speaking that book obviously does not care about the people he or she represents, nor do they live in a community that needs policing. And I might add all communities do. Good policing roots out violence. Good policing roots out gun violence and the awful things that happen, and they're happening in many cities. I might add, the great political affirmation we have this evening about Democrats, if you look at the top two Democrats that finished in the mayoral race, both were against defunding the police. One is a former captain of the police department, and that was in a Democratic primary. Democrats are going to have to get away from this issue, though, for all of the obvious reasons. I think Secretary Bennett is right about the political predicate, and your polling confirms it, Bret, that if Democrats are seen being weak on crime, weak against violence in communities, big cities, small cities alike, we're going to lose. I might add Republicans need to come around on this ghost gun issue. Biden is right about that. But the optics and the messaging, Democrats are going to have to shift and shift dramatically to get this right."

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, yes, and it's why you see Republicans expressing some optimism about their chance because, look, politics is local. We talked about this a lot. You showed that poll, and people are seeing crime in their cities. And that is something that really, really resonates with. And one of the remarkable things here is why it has taken so long for the White House to come around on this, because Harold is right, starting last summer it was only a few voices. But it's the silence that has really hurt the rest of the Democratic Party. And even in the wake of last year's midterm, there were a number of Democrats who lost their seats who came back to the party and said we did because of the defund the police argument. We have got to stop it. And, yet, it's continued on. So we'll see what kind of damage control, where this damage control gets them. But once that people has sunk in to a lot of voters' minds, it can be very difficult to reverse that trajectory."

On the crime issue, again, they have to remind people, really remind people of what people already know. You are not going to persuade people that the Democrats are tough on crime. I used to defend Donald Trump on a lot of things, but if someone said he's abrasive, don't you think? I wouldn't say well, no, he isn't. Yes, he was. Just swallow it, live with it, and say we made a mistake there. Now we are back on track."

Also, the number of unaccounted has dropped to 149 as they continue what is still a search and rescue effort, but over time is feared that it will transition to a search and recovery effort, obviously, as time goes by here in south Florida. We'll continue to monitor that. Meantime, the president was in Wisconsin today, trying to pitch the infrastructure package and possibly the second package that deals with much bigger things, including climate change initiatives that they want to pitch. This issue about the building down in south Florida actually came up while talking about all of that. Take a listen."

But the issue about resiliency and making sure we adapt to this change in climate, that's going to mean levees need to be built, that mean sea walls need to be built, that means infrastructure needs to be built. There is so much investment that we need to do to protect ourselves from climate change, but also to address it and mitigate it.

The bipartisan negotiators that got together in the end for the most part rejected that and demanded that the money be focused on physical infrastructure, probably the right definition because of the actual definition. But now you have Democrats really trying to gin up some kind of enthusiasm momentum for this second reconciliation bill which they intend to stuff everything into that they didn't get into the bipartisan bill. And they do have a challenge there because you are seeing a lot of cracks emerge within their own party."

      "utterance": "So I think a few things. We can squabble over some of the edges here and some of the comments made by politicians and do it day by day. I thought Secretary Granholm was trying to answer a question. And there's no doubt we have not heard much about climate change, but we have heard salt water could have played a role, and we'll learn more and we'll have more definitive answers soon. But while we are having this debate, China continues to make huge advancements in quantum computing, advanced manufacturing, advanced medicine making, and even the advance in next generation energy products that will be consumed around the globe. I would agree with Kimberley, this first bill should focus on physical infrastructure. I think the electric vehicle battery powering stations should be a big part of that certainly as a part of physical infrastructure, energy, those airports, roads, and bridges should make up the first part. And anyone concerned about the second phase or second chapter or second state may be of what the president may do, remember Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, Kyrsten Sinema said they are not going to support breaking the rules that many fear could be broken here. So let's get on with the first one."
