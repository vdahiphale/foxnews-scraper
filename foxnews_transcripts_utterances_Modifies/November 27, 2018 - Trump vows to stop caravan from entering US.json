And it's completely backwards because this president believes in America first, and the left believes in blame America first. It's an underdog mentality. They're uncomfortable with being the world superpower. So whenever an underdog or a third world country or anybody not as powerful as America has any sort of assault on this country, the immediate thought is, hmm, what did we do to provoke this? Why are we to blame? How can we, you know, accept this assault in a polite way? Because we're so powerful we can just take it on the chin all the time. And that's the wrong way to think about it.

What we've done is at the moment, we've funneled them all in to one place and then we tell them to wait on the other side and, of course, there are long delays in terms of the processes that we were talking about.

So, politically, you know, all we're seeing is -- because the media has decided it's politically correct to be on the side of the immigrants so we're seeing images of children and babies which is terrible. I could also take you to every region of the world. I could take you to Syria. I could take you to Afghanistan. I could take you to the Middle East.

He's said there's going to be violent clashes.

This comes on the heels of new developments in the Russian investigation. First, Paul Manafort's legal team pushing back against the special counsel, saying that he torpedoed his plea deal by repeatedly lying to investigators. Also, Manafort and WikiLeaks are hammering The Guardian over a report the former Trump campaign chair met with Julian Assange, Manafort slamming the story as totally false. And constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz is warning about a biased and potentially damaging report coming from Mueller."

And the people at the place never logged the visits. There was no substantiation of the -- they have cameras all over London. None of the video footage shows him going in. They're saying it's totally false, this repost. What do you think?"

On the other hand, The Guardian says that they have seen, you know, evidence of Manafort flying from Ukraine into -- I think it's through Frankfurt to London. So, I don't know. I mean, that -- they put their credibility on the line. We'll have to judge when we find out more, Jesse.  But what is clear here is that if it was true, is it still -- does it still make a difference because it's early in the process. I think the last time they have him visiting is March of '16, which is before we know exactly about the relationship of the hacking of the Democratic emails, you know, and the like. So, if you have that, then do we really know that there was anything more than just chit-chat? Was it directly related to having Assange release the hacked emails in a way that undermines the Clinton campaign by playing into the whole Russian propaganda thing that said, you know, oh, Hillary is a thief. That's the real news of the day, as opposed to anything to do with Donald Trump."

We're not going to be able to show you why. You have to show why. So, when he does that you can judge whether or not it's just fake or if it was real.

Manafort -- I love the Manafort -- I agree with you, Juan.  The Manafort meeting is just to me hilarious that he met Assange in 2013 because he really thought there was a possibility of a Trump presidency.  He might have been the only person on the planet who believed there would be a Trump presidency in 2013. That would then -- a president who wouldn't extradite him. That makes absolutely no sense. Either that or Assange truly is a genius. I think that no matter what comes out of this while thing, it will be delicious chum for the mainstream media, but I don't think any of it will have legal conferences for Trump. And meanwhile, you got to have to look at these metrics which is war, compared to the past, not bad. Crime is declining globally. Poverty, eradicated most part of the world.

And the big thing that I'm looking for is will there be an Assange indictment coming out as well? We had that story a couple of weeks ago. That's in there.

It can toss anyone it wants. If I own a bar and you're being a jerk in that bar, you're gone. The question here though is who stays and who goes? If this guy was kick off for being a jerk, then let's kick off all the jerks, right? But then there goes twitter. But if the guy actually harassed someone, twitter should have said so.

I don't harass people on there. I don't do any of those ugly things that some people do. So, twitter is going to become what they are.

It's part of a larger think culture where groupthink monitors and activist mainstream media websites and social justice mobsters target dissenters. And this attack typically goes in one direction, left to right. The right rarely titles, so twitter think they don't matter.  So, make a bad joke, use the wrong pronoun, God help you. You'll get doxed, annoyed at home, fired from Google, kicked off twitter. What's the solution? Well, to paraphrase writer Walter Kern, as twitter seems to limits expression, it started to feel like tacit approval to stay, so maybe it's time to move on and starts some freedom of our own. So, I do think -- I'm ambivalent about this, Dana, because when I say like get off twitter, it's because we all have The Five. So we have a place that we can express our opinions. And so I say I hate twitter. Get off of it. But, like, if someone like Jesse Kelly is kicked off twitter, he doesn't have a place to go and shout like I do or you do."

And I think over 90 percent of donations in the 2016 presidential cycle from twitter and other social media companies went to Hillary Clinton.
