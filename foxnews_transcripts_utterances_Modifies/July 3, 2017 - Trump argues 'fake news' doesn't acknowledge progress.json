Does that mean families who watch this together are going to go out and tackle somebody the next morning? And -- the CNN media analysts at CNN, when he said leaders like Hugo Chavez, Vladimir Putin, Recep Ergogan, uses this type of language -- I'm sorry, they don't just use language, they use death squads. They use hit squads. I mean, so the hyperbole from the American media is silly and totally out of proportion. And I think it's sort of a chicken-little thing because who's going to be listening to them anymore? I mean, Gallup just found -- just a couple of months ago, that, in fact, the public has more trust in Donald Trump then they do the mainstream media."

So they feel a connection. Their connection with President Trump actually gets deeper with something like this. And the only thing I would say is, it's not about, hey, either or. He shouldn't tweet or he should. But I do think that last week in addition to the things you were talking about, there were some major positive things with the economy. Manufacturing, which, by the way, the Chicago area was at a three year high, the number match the day. The market rocketed to a new all-time high.

No, but I don't think it's right what the media is doing. We have to have respect for the office. We have to have respect for the man.

But in terms of getting his actual message out, I think it might make it harder for the larger America. All right. Well, amidst all this uproar, President Trump tried to bring some focus back to his agenda today, tweeting, quote, at some point the fake news will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers, strong economy, success with ISIS, the border, and so much else.

So he's resetting and I think this is the week to do it. We've got job reports on Friday. So, again, what we're seeing going on in this country, today, when the Dow was up almost 200 points, I bet you not a single one of those mainstream media outlets talked about it, even though people's 41K's are as healthy now as ever in the history of America.

And Jess, I'm going to turn to you, because frankly, this comes up quite a bit. Just at a local level, I ran for local office. And there had been some allegations, some voter fraud irregularities, where dead people were voting in the election. It was very simple. Voter laws are there. You ask for the information, and you retrieve that information, whether through subpoena, through litigation.

So releasing that information, these dates are not even allowed to do that.

And I think some of these states are just naturally, it's a knee-jerk reaction, defiant. You know, the state of Mississippi normally would cooperate with the Trump administration but I think there's a sense of defiance there. But here's the irony. If they pay the right political consultant, they probably can get all of this information out there. It's probably all for sale for the right consultant anyway.

Of course not, because as we all know, there is a certain segment of the population who all they have to hear his Trump wants to do this in order to decide, well then, \"No way on my end.\" Just because it's a personal thing.

President Trump putting new pressure on China to help confront North Korea and its nuclear ambitions, the president calling China's President Xi Jinping to stress the urgent, growing threat from the rogue state. The outreach comes after a $1.4 billion U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the U.S. Treasury sanctioning a Chinese bank with alleged ties to North Korea. But will all these hardball tactics finally get China to truly step up against Kim Jong-un? Kat, will this work?"

But I do like the way that President Trump is dealing with this by at least trying. Our sanctions are certainly not enough. This is a guy who doesn't care if his people starve. But when you talk about a military action, that would just be guaranteed mass carnage."

South Korea gets a new president, and the first thing he does is stop us from deploying the THAAD missile system onto the auspices he wants to do an environmental study.

You can't bury your hand in -- bury your head in the sand and think that this is a conflict between the U.S. and North Korea. If there is a conflict between these two, it is going to affect everyone on the planet, including China, who has such good ties to the United States of America. And -- and going after that bank that had ties to North Korea, go -- providing weapons to Taiwan is a good -- it's not a threat. It's a good motivation for them to wake up."

And speaking of belligerence, they're still developing those man-made islands in the South China Sea. They're militarizing them, and they're putting weapons on them. So you know, they get to hide behind Kim Jong-un's ignorance, but they're sort of guilty themselves."

But don't forget, though, North Korea is a nuclear-armed country with the madman you know, at the head of it; and he's been threatening that he's going to try to develop a missile that will come across the Pacific Ocean and hit California. So this isn't just a problem for South Korea. I had a chance to chat with Gordon Chang, an expert on China, and what the president is doing is exactly right. Which is Chinese money laundering, going after their banks. He's like, look, if you put the financial squeeze on the Chinese, then all of a sudden, you might start to see some cooperation. What we already know, though, is that China has already agreed that they are going to limit their energy exports to North Korea, to put the screws on."

Since then, I think there have been at least five missile launches, including not too long ago this rocket that shows that now they're getting intermediate ballistic capabilities. At some point, they'll have long-range capabilities of hitting in mainland America. So if they have nukes already, than they have the missiles to put the nukes on. At some point, it's going to trigger us to take offensive action."

And the problem is, yes, what we have right now is Japan and South Korea saying, \"We will come to you in the event of some sort of escalation,\" but it's China, the chief trading ally and ally of North Korea, that you have to go after. And what does he want? What does Kim Jong-un want? He wants everything. He wants there to be no more United States of America. He wants to wipe us off the face of the planet. He wants to be in control. I mean, it's pretty -- when you're the head of your own regime, and no one is talking back to you, your notions of what right and wrong in global politics change."

They actually caught a politician being where he said he was going to be with the people he said he was going to be with. His wife and his children and their friends. So it's really a bit of -- I'm sure they're going to get a Pulitzer for this one, because they proved -- they caught me doing what I said I was going to do with the people I said I was going to be with."

A million people have left New Jersey in the last 10 years, because we've got the highest property taxes. We've got high taxes.
