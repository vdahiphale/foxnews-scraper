But the real truth is very dark and very sinister. The Left's core issues: abortion, gender fluidity, the diversity obsession, open borders, and COVID mandates, just to name a few, actually add up to a war on children. From the more than 62 million babies lost to abortion since 1973's Roe vs. Wade, to the current fad of glamorizing transgenderism in our schools. We're witnessing a sustained assault on life and innocence by adults who themselves are spiritually lost. Over time, it's become kind of fashionable to see children as burdensome, inconvenient, even sometimes harmful to the environment. School aged children who are coaxed into early Left wing activism, they're celebrated and rewarded. But those who sit on the sidelines, those who resist the indoctrination on race or gender victimology, they're sidelined or silenced. Too many school boards and activist teachers are trying right now to turn our children into race obsessed, America hating whiners. Melanie Meren: We have great stuff going on with our social studies curriculum. And - but we, if want to talk about all the other things and the components that really will create an anti-racist school system, we have to look at it systemically.",

Now, of course, all of this is viciously anti-child, but part of a larger mindset that's been cultivated for decades now. It's no secret that our culture has a selfishness problem. We all can be selfish, no doubt. And hedonism didn't begin in the 60s, but it certainly, ended up getting a big boost with the free love generation. Remember, it was all sex without consequences. That was one of the biggest lies ever told, especially to women. God was kicked to the curb in the schools, and the religiously minded became increasingly caricatures in film. Now, when I was a kid, there were a lot of families that had a lot of kids. And we all kind of figured it out, we helped each other out, we were neighbors. But at some point, big families were suddenly considered weird and selfish, fringe. But, of course, the opposite is true. Children require sacrifice, children are love. And as Mother Teresa said, they're our most precious treasures. Before I adopted my three kids, I focused way too much on myself. Frankly, I'm not that interesting. It wasn't good.

We've seen it at school board meetings across the country where parents are refusing to allow their children to be pandemic lab rats for indoctrination and experimentation. And we also see hope in the faces of the 1000s of young people, including my two sons, who gathered today in Washington for the annual March for Life. It's not necessarily convenient, or even fun to march in freezing dreary Washington every year. But it is a powerful statement for the rights of the unborn. And it's a statement to a world that seems so comfortable with the act of discarding the children and that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is Matt Walsh, Host of the Matt Walsh Show podcast and bestselling children's book author. Matt, I don't think people fully understand how demonic this all is. But we saw it this week with that report about teachers and school officials in California grooming children for a transgender activism and transgender identity. Your thoughts on all of this? MATT WALSH, HOST \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, well, first of all, thanks for that monologue. That was quite powerful. And I think you're correct to tie it into begin with, with the fact that we're a society - modern American society is built on the mass grave of 60 million children. So we've gotten accustomed to seeing children as a burden that we can just toss to the side. We're kind of stepping on the - many people in our society, walking in the blood of our children, and not hardly even noticing. You drive by many people on your way to work or just doing errands, you drive by a Planned Parenthood and there are people going in there every single day and killing kids. You grow - people grow accustomed to it after a while. And then it conditions you to see kids in a certain way. And then that's why it's no surprise that when the pandemic comes along the health of children - I mean, like the psychological health, because their physical health was never really at any serious risk because of COVID. Their psychological health was just - it wasn't even a concern. It wasn't even talked about. It was never even factored in. And now we're told that's the media reporting, oh, there's a there's an epidemic of mental illness among our children. They're you know going to the emergency room for suicide and they're depressed. No, that's not that's not mental illness, that's reacting in an understandable way, in a tragic way to what we have done to them for the last two years. If there's mental illness, it's in the adults who have done this to kids. But this is all a cover, of course, because we can't admit - the adults can't admit what they've done, so they look for excuses, mental illness, or they blame it on COVID itself. And say, Oh, COVID has caused this problem. Again, no, it's not COVID, it's our reaction to COVID, which was a reaction that did not even take into account our children at all.",

So if that's what you mean by adapt, then sure, we could call it adaptation. I would call it damage. I mean, kids that - the normal thing is for a kid to refuse to wear a mask - something on their face. If you try to put a hat on a young child, it's impossible to keep it on them. That's a healthy, normal child. If your child gets to a point where they wear the mask without any complaints at all, without fidgeting, without doing anything, then that just means that they've been broken down, their brains have been broken, their spirits have been broken. And all of this is being done, by the way. It's not like this is some misguided effort to protect the kids. What infuriates me the most is that, this is being done to protect the adults. It's being done to the adults feel safer around the kids. And that's the most disgusting thing about it.",

It's the same thing he's done with the Taliban, which is he's shown weakness. He's surrendered to Vladimir Putin. Just last week, I forced a vote in the U.S. Senate to impose sanctions on Russia to stop the Russian pipeline from Russia to Germany, Nord Stream 2. That was sanctions legislation, bipartisan legislation. I authored. We passed into law. Donald Trump signed it into law. We shut that pipeline down. When Joe Biden got elected, he waived those sanctions, gave a multibillion dollar gift to Putin. And it is why there are Russian troops and Russian tanks on the border of Ukraine right now, because Biden has been so weak, he has surrendered essentially to Putin. And that's why he didn't want to answer questions on it. Because you can't defend - when Biden stands up and essentially says, Well, maybe a little invasion to Ukraine.

He served as a senior government official in the Treasury Department in the National Security Council. He was CEO of a big company in Pittsburgh, creating over 1,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.

Bush, and he was quite unpopular when he ran for reelection in 92. Nobody believed the message. This is the problem when you are unpopular as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are.

The last thing we should be doing is subsidizing with taxpayer dollars -- NBC's contract alone with the IOC is $7.5 billion. Think of the tax bill just there. And half of the IOC's revenue comes from American corporations who, by the way, themselves are completely hypocritical and are drunk on Chinese money.

We're witnessing a sustained assault on life and innocence by adults who themselves are spiritually lost.

School aged children who are coaxed into early Left wing activism, they're celebrated and rewarded. But those who sit on the sidelines, those who resist the indoctrination on race or gender victimology, they're sidelined or silenced.

Now, of course, all of this is viciously anti-child, but part of a larger mindset that's been cultivated for decades now. It's no secret that our culture has a selfishness problem. We all can be selfish, no doubt. And hedonism didn't begin in the 60s, but it certainly, ended up getting a big boost with the free love generation. Remember, it was all sex without consequences. That was one of the biggest lies ever told, especially to women. God was kicked to the curb in the schools, and the religiously minded became increasingly caricatures in film. Now, when I was a kid, there were a lot of families that had a lot of kids. And we all kind of figured it out, we helped each other out, we were neighbors. But at some point, big families were suddenly considered weird and selfish, fringe. But, of course, the opposite is true. Children require sacrifice, children are love. And as Mother Teresa said, they're our most precious treasures. Before I adopted my three kids, I focused way too much on myself. Frankly, I'm not that interesting. It wasn't good.

We've seen it at school board meetings across the country where parents are refusing to allow their children to be pandemic lab rats for indoctrination and experimentation. And we also see hope in the faces of the 1000s of young people, including my two sons, who gathered today in Washington for the annual March for Life. It's not necessarily convenient, or even fun to march in freezing dreary Washington every year. But it is a powerful statement for the rights of the unborn. And it's a statement to a world that seems so comfortable with the act of discarding the children and that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is Matt Walsh, Host of the Matt Walsh Show podcast and bestselling children's book author. Matt, I don't think people fully understand how demonic this all is. But we saw it this week with that report about teachers and school officials in California grooming children for a transgender activism and transgender identity. Your thoughts on all of this? MATT WALSH, HOST \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": Yes, well, first of all, thanks for that monologue. That was quite powerful. And I think you're correct to tie it into begin with, with the fact that we're a society - modern American society is built on the mass grave of 60 million children. So we've gotten accustomed to seeing children as a burden that we can just toss to the side. We're kind of stepping on the - many people in our society, walking in the blood of our children, and not hardly even noticing. You drive by many people on your way to work or just doing errands, you drive by a Planned Parenthood and there are people going in there every single day and killing kids. You grow - people grow accustomed to it after a while. And then it conditions you to see kids in a certain way. And then that's why it's no surprise that when the pandemic comes along the health of children - I mean, like the psychological health, because their physical health was never really at any serious risk because of COVID. Their psychological health was just - it wasn't even a concern. It wasn't even talked about. It was never even factored in. And now we're told that's the media reporting, oh, there's a there's an epidemic of mental illness among our children. They're you know going to the emergency room for suicide and they're depressed. No, that's not that's not mental illness, that's reacting in an understandable way, in a tragic way to what we have done to them for the last two years. If there's mental illness, it's in the adults who have done this to kids. But this is all a cover, of course, because we can't admit - the adults can't admit what they've done, so they look for excuses, mental illness, or they blame it on COVID itself. And say, Oh, COVID has caused this problem. Again, no, it's not COVID, it's our reaction to COVID, which was a reaction that did not even take into account our children at all."

      "utterance": "Yes, they adapt in the sense that they get used to it. It's like a child who suffers physical abuse at home, he \"adapts\" to it, in the sense that he gets used to it. He gets, he's literally beaten down and accustomed to being treated this way, to the point where after a while, he starts to believe that he deserves it. So if that's what you mean by adapt, then sure, we could call it adaptation. I would call it damage. I mean, kids that - the normal thing is for a kid to refuse to wear a mask - something on their face. If you try to put a hat on a young child, it's impossible to keep it on them. That's a healthy, normal child. If your child gets to a point where they wear the mask without any complaints at all, without fidgeting, without doing anything, then that just means that they've been broken down, their brains have been broken, their spirits have been broken. And all of this is being done, by the way. It's not like this is some misguided effort to protect the kids. What infuriates me the most is that, this is being done to protect the adults. It's being done to the adults feel safer around the kids. And that's the most disgusting thing about it."

Everybody I know is getting it. You will be inoculated one way or another, but it's not going to be from big pharma, you're going to be inoculated by nature. And what we found is the natural infection - you may not want it, and people unfortunately still will die from it. But if you get it and survive, it is giving profound immunity and then giving an immunity better than the vaccine, because the disease is now evading the vaccine for the most part."

They measure immunity from the two - from the 1918 Spanish flu, and they discovered that people are still living, 90 years later still had immunity. So immunity works. It's largely long lasting. Doesn't prevent infection entirely, but it's just like getting the Omicron. You're going to have some immunity and resist hospitalization and death."

He offered, Senator Paul, a doomsday prediction, the other day, saying that the worst case scenario is we're on our way there and we get hit with another variant that actually eludes the immune protection.

The bottom line is, this pandemic will end when we quit telling people to get tested who are not sick, that's the first thing that has to happen. And it's also going to end when people economically resist. They've shut down D.C. They've unilaterally just ruined the city of D.C. You can't come there as a tourist, you can't tour the Capitol. Now, you can't go to restaurants. Well, guess what, when the restaurant owners finally pushed back, when they march in the streets, when we all tell people to take a flying leap, not going to come in my restaurant and force any mandate, that's when this will end. But it's going to take resistance - economic resistance by restaurant hotel owners in these Blue cities where Democrats are forcing these mandates."

We also know that the disease - the death rate is closer to one in a million. We also know that the more you get the vaccine, the higher your risk of myocarditis. So 90 percent of the myocarditis came with a second vaccine. What do you think it happens when you give them a third vaccine? I think universities like Chicago, Princeton, Yale, that are mandating young males get a third vaccine, I think they're going to be open to liability if any of these boys, these young men or women get myocarditis, and God forbid dies, they're going to be open to liability because they're going against the science. But you have such Left wing academics whose head are in the sand and just to go, Dr. Fauci wants us to do it, we should do it. They're not thinking about this, but they're going to be open to big time liability for forcing this vaccine on kids."

It's the same thing he's done with the Taliban, which is he's shown weakness. He's surrendered to Vladimir Putin. Just last week, I forced a vote in the U.S. Senate to impose sanctions on Russia to stop the Russian pipeline from Russia to Germany, Nord Stream 2. That was sanctions legislation, bipartisan legislation. I authored. We passed into law. Donald Trump signed it into law. We shut that pipeline down. When Joe Biden got elected, he waived those sanctions, gave a multibillion dollar gift to Putin. And it is why there are Russian troops and Russian tanks on the border of Ukraine right now, because Biden has been so weak, he has surrendered essentially to Putin. And that's why he didn't want to answer questions on it. Because you can't defend - when Biden stands up and essentially says, Well, maybe a little invasion to Ukraine. I mean, what's a few tanks between friends. That's really sad to see an American president demonstrate that much weakness."

I'm grateful that President Trump started Operation Warp Speed and developed these vaccines. But I believe in individual choice. It ought to be your choice, whether or not to get a vaccine. And the idea that Biden and petty democratic tyrants across the country would order you, would order your children to get a vaccine, it's wrong.

He was a high school wrestler. He was a high school football player. He got appointed to West Point. He was the captain of the wrestling team at West Point. And I got to say, Laura, you and I are lawyers and geeky supreme court clerks. This guy's a badass. He was an Army Ranger who was a combat veteran in Iraq. He served as a senior government official in the Treasury Department in the National Security Council. He was CEO of a big company in Pittsburgh, creating over 1,000 jobs in Pennsylvania. And when it comes to China, he has stood up to China over and over again, on behalf of the National Security Council, on behalf of the Treasury Department. President Trump wanted Dave to serve in in the cabinet. And I know Dave firsthand. He's strong, he's got a backbone, he's got principle. And to win this race we need a fighter, we need someone who will go bare knuckles, who will go into the trenches and will fight for the people of Pennsylvania. And I'm confident - I think there's some good people in the race, who I like and respect.

Bush was running for reelection in 1992 and the campaign cut a series of ads all of which were poll tested, fantastic messages, until people heard it was for George H.W. Bush, and he was quite unpopular when he ran for reelection in 92. Nobody believed the message. This is the problem when you are unpopular as Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are. People don't want to see that. The only silver lining I can see for the Biden team is that going into a midterm election, their only appeal is to the most partisan of partisans. They need to get the base out who is not tired of him yet. And so that's the only sliver that makes sense.

The last thing we should be doing is subsidizing with taxpayer dollars -- NBC's contract alone with the IOC is $7.5 billion. Think of the tax bill just there.

I'm wearing the new camouflage hoodie, which is the Freedom Matters hoodie. So it's new gear, USA made, at LauraIngraham.com. It is very cozy. It's cold here in Washington, D.C. And this month all the proceeds will be going to the Center for American Liberty founded by Harmeet Dhillon, doing great work for freedom. That is that for us tonight. Have a great weekend with your friends and family. You're blessed to live in this country, let's all remember that. And Greg Gutfeld and all the fun with him is up next.
