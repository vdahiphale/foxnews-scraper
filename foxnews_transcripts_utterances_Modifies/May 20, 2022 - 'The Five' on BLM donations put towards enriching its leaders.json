Nancy Pelosi is the leader of the party in the House, she's not going to come out there and say you know, we are hoping for 30 lost seats and not 60, that when Republicans lose in a wave, they don't come out there and say that as well. But switching what you are talking about is something obviously people should start doing and if we look at the results from Tuesday, there were some progressives who didn't win their seats, but generally speaking moderate Democrats really the ones who prevailed. And you even saw in Pennsylvania with the biggest kind of upset for the progressive wing against the establishment, John Fetterman had actually pivoted his campaign halfway through to stop talking as much like Bernie Sanders and to talk a little bit more like Conor Lamb and then lo and behold he wins every single county in Pennsylvania. Katie mentioned the Hispanic vote. It's not just Texas. This was so jarring out of the A.P. poll that Biden is less popular among Hispanics than any other demographic. So, the only two groups where Biden is over water, over the 50 percent mark in terms of approval are with black voters at 65 percent and white college educated women, which I think is about 58 percent. You cannot win an election with just those two groups.

Joe Biden was - restore the heart of America. He didn't have to focus on the issues that much because 56 percent of Americans, according to Gallup said they were better off under Trump than they would be under Biden. So, there wasn't really much that he could say was going bad for the country, but the tone of the country, I mean, when you got Donald Trump that's going in there fixing all the stuff, he came in with a wrecking ball, he didn't create a lot of friends in Washington. Here's going to be the problem for Joe going in the problem. You have the luxury to think about tone when everything is going well financially for you. But when mamas can't get stuff at the store for their babies, when gas prices are going up, when the border is out of control, when people don't feel safe in their communities, I mean, I guess he could run on promises made, promises kept.

She doesn't know what she's doing. These problems are real, they are palpable. They're not some kind of abstract that you can deal with wokeism. And it's amazing how many of these problems have developed under Biden that were supposed to develop under Trump. Because Trump was inexperienced, right, he was a buffoon, perceived buffoon and then what happens, everything that was supposed to happen is now happening under Biden. It's like you were worrying about monkeypox and then you get hit by a truck and that truck happens to be Joe Biden. We always hear from addicts you have to hit rock bottom before you change, so what the hell is the rock bottom right now for Democrats. We are just watching the gas prices go up. Watching crime still spiral out of control, we're watching high illegal immigration. There's no solutions, right. They are not offering any solutions. So, we don't know what the new bottom is, we don't know what the new low is. We could have $20 gas if we don't think about it. The problem with Joe, and then I'll stop, is that it's a double-barreled problem. You have an empty vessel, which is Joe, who is in a natural state of decline, let's be honest, that's not to be mean, just observing what we see, but what it has raised to fill that void is wokeism. So, you have -- it's a compounded problem. So, you are basically fighting these problems in a hole because Biden wasn't surrounded by moderate voices. He's only been surrounded by wokesters who can't solve any problems. Hence, it's getting worse. And we will, I don't know what the bottom is anymore, I wish I did.",

But as we know already, the border patrol and ICE are already having to release a number of individuals already into the country depending on where you are from. And also, until the asylum rules are changed, and you can say something other than I'm afraid to go home, that's what gets you your ticket to any city in the country, really, if you are not a single adult male, the flow will continue.

Obviously, border patrol agents and Texas DPS, this is going to be welcome news to them, but really, all it's going to do is kick the can down the road. Title 42 is going to have to drop at some point in the future, but that's just not going to be on Monday. But even with Title 42 in place we've still seen an explosion in numbers. We just had more than two, you know, well over 230,000 migrant apprehensions this last year in April, the highest in DHS history. We had more than 200,000 the month before. We had more than 1.3 million illegal crossings since the start of the fiscal year on October 1st. So, even with Title 42 in place, we've seen an explosion of numbers. And what this means now, is for certain countries, for certain demographics, the U.S. government will still be able to expel them back to Mexico, meaning that you know, we have shown this video where once people come across and they are detained by border patrol, rather than having to take them into the processing center and do paperwork for hours, they're able to essentially just put them right back onto a bus, drop them off at the port of entry and expel them back into Mexico. The whole process can take less than an hour. They've used it more than 1.7 million times since March of 2020, that being both the Trump administration and the Biden administration. But I can tell you, front line border agents they will be happy to hear this news because I've been texting with them for the past several weeks, ever since news came down that they were planning to get rid of this on May 23 and they were basically saying buckle up, because it's going to be total anarchy and chaos down here at the border. DHS is on projections were saying upwards of 18,000 illegal crossings a day could have happened if Title 42 were to drop. You do the math on that, that's about 540,000 crossings in one single month, mMore than half a million. And just to put that in perspective that would be more than double what we just saw last month in April, which was the highest in U.S. history. So, probably a little bit of a sigh of relief for border agents and Texas law enforcement, but not too much because, again, these numbers have been exploding even with Title 42 in place. You don't have well over 200,000 apprehensions at the border month after month without there being a serious surge at the border and we've been showing the video all day long. We keep getting these massive groups of 150 to 200 crossing every single day. So, what does this mean big picture, it means that the administration cannot get rid of Title 42 on Monday as planned, they have to keep enforcing it while this litigation plays out. We'll send it back to you.",

We would put them on flights or we would just kick them back to Mexico. We would do the same thing with Mexicans. Then along the way, you know, once the administration's changed, deals changed with countries in the Northern Triangle. Nicaraguans, for instance, they're, for the most part, just release once they're encountered by border patrol, because for the most part, they won't take their citizens back unless they have a passport. Cubans are mass released. We don't enforce Title 42 with them, and Venezuelans are released. We don't have a Title 42 agreement with them.

I mean, they know that they can get across and that -- this is why you don't see a lot of people running away at the border. Most of the runners that you see are single adult males because they realize that they can't come into the country under Title 42. So, this is going to put our border patrol agents yet again in a bad position but again, it's going to put these kids and these women in a bad position as well. Joe Biden needs to understand this. This is going to be a terrible issue for those Democrats that are on the border areas. They are Democrats at heart. But what they are saying if they cannot do this, they understand the voters are putting a lot of pressure on them because of this issue.

We have a media problem that people are not publicizing the stories necessarily from the beginning to say, this is who those people are.

Obviously, it's not what everyone is talking about at the kitchen tables. They are talking about inflation, they are talking about the cost of food, their wages, all those kinds of things. Nancy Pelosi is the leader of the party in the House, she's not going to come out there and say you know, we are hoping for 30 lost seats and not 60, that when Republicans lose in a wave, they don't come out there and say that as well. But switching what you are talking about is something obviously people should start doing and if we look at the results from Tuesday, there were some progressives who didn't win their seats, but generally speaking moderate Democrats really the ones who prevailed. And you even saw in Pennsylvania with the biggest kind of upset for the progressive wing against the establishment, John Fetterman had actually pivoted his campaign halfway through to stop talking as much like Bernie Sanders and to talk a little bit more like Conor Lamb and then lo and behold he wins every single county in Pennsylvania. Katie mentioned the Hispanic vote. It's not just Texas. This was so jarring out of the A.P. poll that Biden is less popular among Hispanics than any other demographic. So, the only two groups where Biden is over water, over the 50 percent mark in terms of approval are with black voters at 65 percent and white college educated women, which I think is about 58 percent. You cannot win an election with just those two groups. And when you look at the enthusiasm gap and Karl Rove was on with Jesse last night talking about this and he had his whiteboard, and you could see the differences the uptick in Republicans coming out, and this happens in the first midterm of a presidency, it's undoubtedly concerning."

Joe Biden was - restore the heart of America. He didn't have to focus on the issues that much because 56 percent of Americans, according to Gallup said they were better off under Trump than they would be under Biden. So, there wasn't really much that he could say was going bad for the country, but the tone of the country, I mean, when you got Donald Trump that's going in there fixing all the stuff, he came in with a wrecking ball, he didn't create a lot of friends in Washington. Here's going to be the problem for Joe going in the problem. You have the luxury to think about tone when everything is going well financially for you. But when mamas can't get stuff at the store for their babies, when gas prices are going up, when the border is out of control, when people don't feel safe in their communities, I mean, I guess he could run on promises made, promises kept.

She doesn't know what she's doing. These problems are real, they are palpable. They're not some kind of abstract that you can deal with wokeism. And it's amazing how many of these problems have developed under Biden that were supposed to develop under Trump. Because Trump was inexperienced, right, he was a buffoon, perceived buffoon and then what happens, everything that was supposed to happen is now happening under Biden. It's like you were worrying about monkeypox and then you get hit by a truck and that truck happens to be Joe Biden. We always hear from addicts you have to hit rock bottom before you change, so what the hell is the rock bottom right now for Democrats. We are just watching the gas prices go up. Watching crime still spiral out of control, we're watching high illegal immigration. There's no solutions, right. They are not offering any solutions. So, we don't know what the new bottom is, we don't know what the new low is. We could have $20 gas if we don't think about it. The problem with Joe, and then I'll stop, is that it's a double-barreled problem. You have an empty vessel, which is Joe, who is in a natural state of decline, let's be honest, that's not to be mean, just observing what we see, but what it has raised to fill that void is wokeism. So, you have -- it's a compounded problem. So, you are basically fighting these problems in a hole because Biden wasn't surrounded by moderate voices.

That comes as border apprehensions hit a new record in April with 234,000 migrant encounters. OK, you can see it right up there, 2,034 -- 234,000. What do you say about this?

So, this is something that was put into place during COVID to keep that issue at bay. But as we know already, the border patrol and ICE are already having to release a number of individuals already into the country depending on where you are from. And also, until the asylum rules are changed, and you can say something other than I'm afraid to go home, that's what gets you your ticket to any city in the country, really, if you are not a single adult male, the flow will continue. So, I think that law enforcement officers will be happy about this decision, but they will say that they still have major challenges. Because a lot of these numbers that you've seen, most all the numbers have been under Title 42 and it hasn't been a total deterrent."

Obviously, border patrol agents and Texas DPS, this is going to be welcome news to them, but really, all it's going to do is kick the can down the road. Title 42 is going to have to drop at some point in the future, but that's just not going to be on Monday. But even with Title 42 in place we've still seen an explosion in numbers. We just had more than two, you know, well over 230,000 migrant apprehensions this last year in April, the highest in DHS history. We had more than 200,000 the month before. We had more than 1.3 million illegal crossings since the start of the fiscal year on October 1st. So, even with Title 42 in place, we've seen an explosion of numbers. And what this means now, is for certain countries, for certain demographics, the U.S. government will still be able to expel them back to Mexico, meaning that you know, we have shown this video where once people come across and they are detained by border patrol, rather than having to take them into the processing center and do paperwork for hours, they're able to essentially just put them right back onto a bus, drop them off at the port of entry and expel them back into Mexico. The whole process can take less than an hour. They've used it more than 1.7 million times since March of 2020, that being both the Trump administration and the Biden administration. But I can tell you, front line border agents they will be happy to hear this news because I've been texting with them for the past several weeks, ever since news came down that they were planning to get rid of this on May 23 and they were basically saying buckle up, because it's going to be total anarchy and chaos down here at the border. DHS is on projections were saying upwards of 18,000 illegal crossings a day could have happened if Title 42 were to drop. You do the math on that, that's about 540,000 crossings in one single month, mMore than half a million. And just to put that in perspective that would be more than double what we just saw last month in April, which was the highest in U.S. history. So, probably a little bit of a sigh of relief for border agents and Texas law enforcement, but not too much because, again, these numbers have been exploding even with Title 42 in place. You don't have well over 200,000 apprehensions at the border month after month without there being a serious surge at the border and we've been showing the video all day long. We keep getting these massive groups of 150 to 200 crossing every single day. So, what does this mean big picture, it means that the administration cannot get rid of Title 42 on Monday as planned, they have to keep enforcing it while this litigation plays out. We'll send it back to you."

    {
      "speaker": "MELUGIN",

It would be Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. At that time, we had agreements with those countries that we would repatriate the migrants back to those countries. We would put them on flights or we would just kick them back to Mexico. We would do the same thing with Mexicans. Then along the way, you know, once the administration's changed, deals changed with countries in the Northern Triangle. Nicaraguans, for instance, they're, for the most part, just release once they're encountered by border patrol, because for the most part, they won't take their citizens back unless they have a passport. Cubans are mass released. We don't enforce Title 42 with them, and Venezuelans are released. We don't have a Title 42 agreement with them. And one of the criticisms has been that the Biden administration can just, you know, put them on a bus and send them back to Mexico. But for some of these demographics, they have preferred to put them on an airplane and send them back, you know, they're called repatriation flights."

Because a lot of the folks keep asking well, why are they bringing the children across the border, because it's a ticket. I mean, they know that they can get across and that -- this is why you don't see a lot of people running away at the border. Most of the runners that you see are single adult males because they realize that they can't come into the country under Title 42. So, this is going to put our border patrol agents yet again in a bad position but again, it's going to put these kids and these women in a bad position as well. Joe Biden needs to understand this. This is going to be a terrible issue for those Democrats that are on the border areas. They are Democrats at heart. But what they are saying if they cannot do this, they understand the voters are putting a lot of pressure on them because of this issue. And I'll just note this, because I know Jess is going to hop in on this. These are Latinos too, as well. There are 50 percent, over 50 percent of the border patrol agents are minority.

So, there is a longer-term consequence to allowing this type of lawlessness to continue and once it's in those systems, we start looking a lot like the Mexican corruption and that's a lot of the reason why this is happening as well and once you get to that point, it's really difficult to go back."

But you know what, what's most interesting about this, is that the nation's political culture has played a role in the crime that occurred during the pandemic and right after George Floyd's murder because we know that in Democrat-leaning cities more African Americans were killed, victims of murder, than there were in white-leaning, you know, Republican cities. So, with the same time the crime is going up in the black communities you've this Patrisse Cullors, who is no better than a two-bit scammer that I prosecuted for years. Who is out there saying I want to take money for Black Lives Matter? You know, you people, whether she wants to call it white guilt doesn't matter, she used it to enriched herself, her baby daddy, her brother. She gave more than five times the money for the Trayvon Martin Foundation to her baby daddy, OK? And I think that these people have to be prosecuted. Forget about the corporations. You know what? They got suckered. They get suckered all the time, and I'm disgusted with them. But that's not the big issue. The big issue is that this woman is now complaining that it's been weaponized against her. You know what, let me show you the penal code. That's being weaponized. When they bring the justice system against you for the scamming the way they just did to an activist BLM leader in Boston who faces fraud charges for laundering 2020 donations for personally enriching themselves. This is where we need the hand of justice to come in and start prosecuting these people. It's not your piggy bank. And how dare you cause division because you just want to make money for yourself."

So, when the cameras leave and the rioters leave, these communities, these Black communities have been devastated for decades, and there's no one there. There's no economic influence to go in as a result of the damage that's been done. And so the question is, how did the same people who donated all this money to BLM, the white guilt money, now make up for the fact that they were supporting a movement that has destroyed entire communities for at least a generation?"
