They will go back to their districts, maybe a little less infighting, though, of course, on Twitter, anything can happen. And you had AOC's chief of staff actually insulting Nancy Pelosi on Twitter. So I don't expect the fireworks will end. But I think both of them -- I'm sure Nancy Pelosi made a very good argument as to why Democrats need to stand together.

You had two new members come out just today, Neil, for impeachment, Annie Kuster, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Mike Levin, a Democrat, a freshman from California.

Just came out of the Oval Office after spending almost 20 minutes with the president, the acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, and the minister of government for Guatemala, Enrique Degenhart. Earlier this week, it looked like any hope of signing what's called a safe third agreement for Guatemala to agree to allow people who were from El Salvador, Nicaragua or Honduras to apply for asylum in the United States there wasn't going to happen. But then we were called into the Oval Office, and, lo and behold, there was the president with the secretary and the minister. And they were signing what's known as a safe third agreement in Guatemala. So now what will happen in the future is that, rather than these asylum seekers coming up from Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua through Guatemala into Mexico and then on up to the U.S. border, they will now apply for asylum in Guatemala, where they will wait out while their asylum claims are adjudicated. So the president is hopeful that this will really begin to stem the tide of Central American migrants flowing through Mexico and toward the United States, and could even act as a deterrent for people in some of the Northern Triangle countries, as they're known, thinking that they will not be able to come right to the United States, they will have to go to Guatemala first. The president also issued an order a couple of weeks ago, saying that unless you apply for asylum in a country that you're transiting before you get to the United States, you will not be allowed to claim asylum. That one's tied up in the courts. But this is an actual agreement between countries. This is not just a presidential memorandum or a presidential executive order, Neil. So, this one's going to carry a lot more weight. And we will see how it goes going forward. The president also talked about a lot of other things as well, if you want to go into that.",

Really, what's happened is, South Korea received a couple of the F-35s they have ordered from the United States, and also potentially has planned more exercises. And this is Kim Jong-un sort of lashing out and saying, wait a minute, I thought we were headed down a different path. And then, with Iran, what you have got is this continuing escalation of them demonstrating and making political statements with their military, which is, of course, the strongest arm of Iran. So, what we have -- I think it's coincidence that both of these happened in 24 hours. But these are our two biggest thorns in our side right now is Iran and North Korea. And I think the president is smart to keep the Persian Gulf presence we have. And Iran's sanctions have led to more presence with the U.K. and the U.S. And with North Korea, that's going to continue to bump along until there's another meeting, and then perhaps we can make some progress there.",

Not a fan, he says, of the chairman who was responsible for five rate hikes since he chose him a little bit more than a year ago. Two of the rate hikes that were also under administration was by the former Fed chief, Janet Yellen. Just wanted to put that out there. Also wanted to say he was technically incorrect in stating that China is paying these tariffs. Obviously, you are. So that cost goes on to you for goods that come into the country from China.

And I'm sure Nancy Pelosi wishes she could choose her members. But, yes, I think it is for optics. And I think it's served them both well, in a way. But, of course, they did it right before the break, which I thought was interesting. Perhaps that means that they're less likely to start another feud. They will go back to their districts, maybe a little less infighting, though, of course, on Twitter, anything can happen. And you had AOC's chief of staff actually insulting Nancy Pelosi on Twitter. So I don't expect the fireworks will end. But I think both of them -- I'm sure Nancy Pelosi made a very good argument as to why Democrats need to stand together. And perhaps she mentioned the 31 Democrats who won in the midterms in 2018 in districts that President Trump won in 2016 and perhaps explained to AOC why those members matter just as much, if not more, than the four with all the..."

And the whole Squad could just take over. But I assume she's aspiring to be a career politician, just like Nancy and friends. So she probably won't do that. But, of course, they're doing this to look as though that they are together, that there's unity, that they're not divided before the break. And they have to do some kind of damage control after the Robert Mueller hearings. That, I think, did hurt the Democrats. So I applaud them for trying. I guess this is what leaders do.

And you have to establish a narrative. And if Republicans can take this and run and say, well, everybody must be for impeachment, if they're calling that, people -- calling it that -- people aren't getting the nuance. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says they're going to try to do three things to -- quote -- \"own August.\" And she said those three things are legislate, investigate and litigate. You had two new members come out just today, Neil, for impeachment, Annie Kuster, a Democrat from New Hampshire, and Mike Levin, a Democrat, a freshman from California.

Weird political things happen in the month of August, if you go back historically, and this could be a make- or-break month either way, for impeachment, against impeachment, where one size seizes the narrative, and that's where this goes come September when they return to session."

Both of those averages hit records today. In case you are keeping track here, this is getting to be an almost routine event, where we have the NASDAQ and the S&P both up about north of 20 percent on the year. So, again, not exactly shivering in the face of all these developments. Then there was a very big report on the economy in the latest quarter.

That's something that economist Steve Moore has mentioned once or twice on this show, Kingsview Asset Management's chief investment officer Scott Martin here with us as well.

So, that tells you the Fed has it wrong. Now, what I think we have to be careful of, folks, though, is, do we get this rate hike -- or rate cut, rather, next week, and that's it, because data has started to look better again?

So, to me, this is long-term progress that is going to be made, if there is any short-term pain, which, to your point earlier, though, Neil, I think the Fed is paying very close attention to.

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. Just came out of the Oval Office after spending almost 20 minutes with the president, the acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, and the minister of government for Guatemala, Enrique Degenhart. Earlier this week, it looked like any hope of signing what's called a safe third agreement for Guatemala to agree to allow people who were from El Salvador, Nicaragua or Honduras to apply for asylum in the United States there wasn't going to happen. But then we were called into the Oval Office, and, lo and behold, there was the president with the secretary and the minister. And they were signing what's known as a safe third agreement in Guatemala. So now what will happen in the future is that, rather than these asylum seekers coming up from Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua through Guatemala into Mexico and then on up to the U.S. border, they will now apply for asylum in Guatemala, where they will wait out while their asylum claims are adjudicated. So the president is hopeful that this will really begin to stem the tide of Central American migrants flowing through Mexico and toward the United States, and could even act as a deterrent for people in some of the Northern Triangle countries, as they're known, thinking that they will not be able to come right to the United States, they will have to go to Guatemala first. The president also issued an order a couple of weeks ago, saying that unless you apply for asylum in a country that you're transiting before you get to the United States, you will not be allowed to claim asylum. That one's tied up in the courts. But this is an actual agreement between countries. This is not just a presidential memorandum or a presidential executive order, Neil. So, this one's going to carry a lot more weight. And we will see how it goes going forward. The president also talked about a lot of other things as well, if you want to go into that."

Kim Jong-un, in concert, it seems, with exactly what the leader of around is trying to do, launch missiles just of various ranges. But this is sort of like a poke in the eye and provocative act. The read from retired General Anthony Tata. General, good to have you. What do you make of the timing of both countries doing this within 24 hours?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIG. GEN. ANTHONY TATA (RET.), U.S. ARMY",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, let's remember that North Korea and Iran have worked closely together, bypassing U.N. sanctions and that kind of thing. So it's not surprising to me. I think it's probably more coincidence. What you have got is North Korea posturing before any talks that might come up. Really, what's happened is, South Korea received a couple of the F-35s they have ordered from the United States, and also potentially has planned more exercises. And this is Kim Jong-un sort of lashing out and saying, wait a minute, I thought we were headed down a different path. And then, with Iran, what you have got is this continuing escalation of them demonstrating and making political statements with their military, which is, of course, the strongest arm of Iran. So, what we have -- I think it's coincidence that both of these happened in 24 hours. But these are our two biggest thorns in our side right now is Iran and North Korea. And I think the president is smart to keep the Persian Gulf presence we have. And Iran's sanctions have led to more presence with the U.K. and the U.S. And with North Korea, that's going to continue to bump along until there's another meeting, and then perhaps we can make some progress there."

And perhaps he can, because, let's face it, for the last 18 months or so, there has been no nuclear test, and there were four on President Obama's watch. So that's -- that's real progress."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the president taking on any and all questions. In case you tuned into that late, the president says that Guatemala is finally doing what it should be doing, signs that agreement to restrict the U.S. asylum applications from Central America. Made quick references to the GDP report that was out today, and blaming a lot of that on Jerome Powell. Not a fan, he says, of the chairman who was responsible for five rate hikes since he chose him a little bit more than a year ago. Two of the rate hikes that were also under administration was by the former Fed chief, Janet Yellen. Just wanted to put that out there. Also wanted to say he was technically incorrect in stating that China is paying these tariffs. Obviously, you are. So that cost goes on to you for goods that come into the country from China. Now, those who get the goods or send them to you can absorb a lot of the costs, but the cost ultimately are borne by you, not by governments. All right, let's get the read on all this from RealClearPolitics' Susan Crabtree. We have got our own Charlie Gasparino as well. Both of you, thank you very much for your patience."

The House Blue Dog Coalition, the more conservative part of the caucus, was very concerned about the impact that the bill would have. They couldn't get the progressives and the Blue Dogs on the same page with the speaker. So they pulled the bill and they're not going to do anything. Well, that's a surprise this. Have you heard this before? Congress cannot get on the same page of immigration. We have seen this time and time and again. We have the president coming out today. He's taking his initiative with Guatemala. He had threatened them on Wednesday to clamp down on any travel from that country, impose some sanctions. We saw this as a successful strategy with Mexico earlier this year, that he got them to put 6,000 members of their military on the border. He is saying now that has had an impact, that the immigration numbers are down of people trying to cross into our country. And so he's..."
