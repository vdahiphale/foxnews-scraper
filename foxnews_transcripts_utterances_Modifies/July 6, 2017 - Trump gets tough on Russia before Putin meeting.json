It is 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" As world leaders are converging on Germany tonight, getting ready for the big G20 Summit there, President Trump is flexing his muscle on the world stage today receiving a huge reaction from folks in Poland while delivering a powerful speech there.  We have every angle of the President's big address in Warsaw covered for you this hour, beginning with Mr. Trump's direct warning to Moscow. Less than 24 hours, before his first sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, a day that was like filled from the beginning to the end. And that's what you really want to do on a presidential trip. You want to basically still the airwaves and dominate all the way through. Because it wasn't just the speech today which as you say was well-regarded. It was also the fact that he'd met with the South Korean president and the Japanese prime minister.  Notably absent was the President of China trying to basically that symbolism there, saying, you don't want to get isolated from us. We are the good guys. We are on the side of western civilization. We are on the side of peace and prosperity. And China was not there at the table. They will probably have a chance to meet at the G20 at some point. But he also I think in that, what he was talking about, in regards to the Russian meeting, there are so many complex issues to talk about including Syria and Iran in particular.   The most pressing one especially because we have actual soldiers on the ground. And that deconfliction issue in that area as ISIS basically losses more territory gets more complicated as it goes forward. The other thing that the President talked about which many presidents have done for decades is trying to explain to Europe, you have to become more energy independent. You cannot be dependent on Russia for your energy. Because they will starve you or they will basically freeze you out in the winter. And so, there is a movement by some in Europe, headed by the polls to try to do that. So, the President I think basically ran the gamut today all of the different things. I agree with Charles Krauthammer that this speech today, when it comes to freedom and liberty and America leading in the world with our Western values, it's really different from the inauguration speech. And there's something that for few have been following Ronald Reagan for years, if you listen to the speech today that President Trump gave, you're like, okay, I agree with that. I loved it.",

Because pulling on a lot of this other Eastern European countries get a lot of the natural gas from the Russians and if we can start exporting our natural gas, it's a little bit more expensive that that really wins them off Russia and takes a lot of the Russian clout away.

I first found out about Siobhan just because I picked up a book of hers called, \"You Know When the Men Are Gone\" which was about a deployment at Fort Hood. She's a military wife herself. This book is excellent and I hope you pick it up. And her whole family loves \"The Five\" and Fox News so, hello to you up in upstate New York.",

It is 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" As world leaders are converging on Germany tonight, getting ready for the big G20 Summit there, President Trump is flexing his muscle on the world stage today receiving a huge reaction from folks in Poland while delivering a powerful speech there. We have every angle of the President's big address in Warsaw covered for you this hour, beginning with Mr. Trump's direct warning to Moscow. Less than 24 hours, before his first sit down with Russian President Vladimir Putin."

      "utterance": "Yes. So, a day that was like filled from the beginning to the end. And that's what you really want to do on a presidential trip. You want to basically still the airwaves and dominate all the way through. Because it wasn't just the speech today which as you say was well-regarded. It was also the fact that he'd met with the South Korean president and the Japanese prime minister. Notably absent was the President of China trying to basically that symbolism there, saying, you don't want to get isolated from us. We are the good guys. We are on the side of western civilization. We are on the side of peace and prosperity. And China was not there at the table. They will probably have a chance to meet at the G20 at some point. But he also I think in that, what he was talking about, in regards to the Russian meeting, there are so many complex issues to talk about including Syria and Iran in particular. The most pressing one especially because we have actual soldiers on the ground. And that deconfliction issue in that area as ISIS basically losses more territory gets more complicated as it goes forward. The other thing that the President talked about which many presidents have done for decades is trying to explain to Europe, you have to become more energy independent. You cannot be dependent on Russia for your energy. Because they will starve you or they will basically freeze you out in the winter. And so, there is a movement by some in Europe, headed by the polls to try to do that. So, the President I think basically ran the gamut today all of the different things. I agree with Charles Krauthammer that this speech today, when it comes to freedom and liberty and America leading in the world with our Western values, it's really different from the inauguration speech. And there's something that for few have been following Ronald Reagan for years, if you listen to the speech today that President Trump gave, you're like, okay, I agree with that. I loved it."

Russia is not going to like that, either. And Dana touched on it too. This Castile that they are working on is a very big deal. Because pulling on a lot of this other Eastern European countries get a lot of the natural gas from the Russians and if we can start exporting our natural gas, it's a little bit more expensive that that really wins them off Russia and takes a lot of the Russian clout away. And I think that's probably the most substantial accomplishments if he comes away from this afterwards."

They cannot deal with Russia effectively and they didn't deal with Russia effectively on the Ukraine because of the threat that they had financial interests in addition to the oil interest. So, that's a real point. But let me just say, I heard something a little different there today and the rest of you. Because what I heard him again do was again point out sort of this nationalistic view. The United States and Western civilization under threat. Whoa! But the second thing again what struck me was, he goes after the press. He went after the press big time in this speech. And then he also goes after President Obama."

I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries and I won't be specific. Barack Obama, when he was president, found out about this. In terms of if it were in Russia. He found out about it in August. Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it. Why did he do nothing about it? I think what happened is, he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way, he would have done something about it."

But anyway, he also wants to leave room at the negotiating table with Russia, with Putin, so he has more room to operate with Syria or North Korea or Ukraine. He doesn't want to poison the well with this b.s. So, he's also sang, you know, President Obama, it was that big of a deal, if it was that huge of interference, he didn't do anything. Because it probably wasn't that big of a deal."

So, I'm not exactly sure where to start. I do think that the President, he has said last week, well, then President Obama didn't do anything about it and he knew about it. So, that is basically saying that the Russians, he agreed that the Russians tried to interfere in our election. Okay. There's an investigation. Mueller is working on it. There are not any of these leaks that are in our investigation. The integrity of it is set. Set that aside. We are really looking at is tomorrow. The first face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. It looks like it will be a very small meeting with only Rex Tillerson and probably Lavrov on the Putin side and interpreters. That means that there's very little room for leaks. Both sides will come out and tried to basically spend their side about what happened in that meeting. There will be some, a little bit of press but not a lot.

It's the best and I love the fact that our country has a First Amendment because I think it's made us so fabulous and I do think that's one of the things the country -- that we should be talking about around the world. But that doesn't mean that journalism can't actually hold itself up to a higher standard, which it should do. The complaint also about that David Martosko who got the question, the truth is, any of those reporters that want to make the news, you would have asked that same question because that was the top story yesterday. They always want to talk about themselves. They've been after him because he interviewed -- he says he interviewed the press secretary when they were talking back then about making a change.

What alternatives do these people offer? These are people who happily use free markets to purchase their Nike's and iPhones and their Levi's, but they offer nothing but self-serving chaos and noise.

I first found out about Siobhan just because I picked up a book of hers called, \"You Know When the Men Are Gone\" which was about a deployment at Fort Hood. She's a military wife herself. This book is excellent and I hope you pick it up. And her whole family loves \"The Five\" and Fox News so, hello to you up in upstate New York."
