Breaking tonight, consumed by hate and a twisted ideology, that's how federal prosecutors described the man now officially charged in the first deadly terror attack in New York City since 9/11. And in a chilling confession, Sayfullo Saipov says he specifically chose Halloween so he could hit the maximum amount of people. Within the last hour, Saipov appeared in a New York courtroom in a wheelchair, handcuffed, and shackled.  Right now, the 29-year-old Uzbekistan immigrant is charged with providing material to ISIS and destruction of motor vehicles. Also, late tonight, prosecutors revealing some shocking statements, Saipov made, while lying in his hospital bed, including that he asked investigators to hang in ISIS flag in his hospital room, and that he \"felt good about what he did.\" And there's more, listen.",

And Mirandized interview statements with law enforcement last night and today, Saipov allegedly admitted that he was inspired to commit the attack by the ISIS videos he watched and had been planning this attack for two months. He also admitted that he had rented a truck on October 22nd in practice -- to practice the turns he would make on his Halloween Day attack.",

Saipov also gave authorities a timeline of what led up to the attack saying he was inspired by ISIS videos that he watched on his cell phone, some 90 videos found, along with nearly 4,000 ISIS pictures and pages of propaganda.   The suspect went on to tell investigators, he began planning the attack a year ago, and two months ago decided to use a truck to inflict the most damage. Then eight days before the attack, Saipov told authorities he rented a Home Depot truck to conduct a dry run, so to speak, so he could repeatedly drive by the attack area and practice making turns. He said he chose Halloween for the attack because he thought there would be more civilians on the street. Yesterday afternoon, he rented the Home Depot truck for two hours, although he had no intention of returning it, and after plowing down people on the bike path, his plan was then to continue on to the Brooklyn Bridge and further his attack. Initially, he wanted to display ISIS flags on the front and back of the truck, but he did not want to attract attention to himself. Here's more from the U.S. Attorney.",

These are serious -- again, guys who have very, very radical Islamist views, and he was involved with him, he was associated with them. He also -- my understanding was when he had his wedding, everybody invited to the wedding from Uzbekistan was denied a visa. So, certainly, his associations back in Uzbekistan also raised serious questions. So, as we go forward, I think it's important to find out who those people were that he was involved with, associated with, and whether or not they had anything on him at the time. I heard they didn't, but what were these people up to? What have they done since, what are they doing now?

The terror suspect in this case entered the U.S. from Uzbekistan during the Obama administration from this program. It's been in place for over 20 years offering a small number of visas to people from parts of the world that has small numbers of immigrants in America. The idea of diversity driving this leads the president to charge it is all about political correctness.

And in a chilling confession, Sayfullo Saipov says he specifically chose Halloween so he could hit the maximum amount of people. Within the last hour, Saipov appeared in a New York courtroom in a wheelchair, handcuffed, and shackled. Right now, the 29-year-old Uzbekistan immigrant is charged with providing material to ISIS and destruction of motor vehicles. Also, late tonight, prosecutors revealing some shocking statements, Saipov made, while lying in his hospital bed, including that he asked investigators to hang in ISIS flag in his hospital room, and that he \"felt good about what he did.\" And there's more, listen."

And Mirandized interview statements with law enforcement last night and today, Saipov allegedly admitted that he was inspired to commit the attack by the ISIS videos he watched and had been planning this attack for two months.

And two, the cold-blooded candor of terrorist suspect Sayfullo Saipov saying he's proud of the attack, telling investigators he feels good about what he's done. Saipov also gave authorities a timeline of what led up to the attack saying he was inspired by ISIS videos that he watched on his cell phone, some 90 videos found, along with nearly 4,000 ISIS pictures and pages of propaganda. The suspect went on to tell investigators, he began planning the attack a year ago, and two months ago decided to use a truck to inflict the most damage. Then eight days before the attack, Saipov told authorities he rented a Home Depot truck to conduct a dry run, so to speak, so he could repeatedly drive by the attack area and practice making turns. He said he chose Halloween for the attack because he thought there would be more civilians on the street. Yesterday afternoon, he rented the Home Depot truck for two hours, although he had no intention of returning it, and after plowing down people on the bike path, his plan was then to continue on to the Brooklyn Bridge and further his attack. Initially, he wanted to display ISIS flags on the front and back of the truck, but he did not want to attract attention to himself. Here's more from the U.S. Attorney."

In fact, he passed the Uber background check and did not have any passenger complaints.

      "speaker": "REP. PETER KING, R-N.Y., HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Sandra, one thing I can say is that there's a lot of smoke here and that people I've spoken to say this is going to get worse as the investigation goes forward. First of all, people that he was involved with -- several people he was involved with for serious subjects of investigations by the FBI, these were bad guys. These are serious -- again, guys who have very, very radical Islamist views, and he was involved with him, he was associated with them. He also -- my understanding was when he had his wedding, everybody invited to the wedding from Uzbekistan was denied a visa. So, certainly, his associations back in Uzbekistan also raised serious questions. So, as we go forward, I think it's important to find out who those people were that he was involved with, associated with, and whether or not they had anything on him at the time. I heard they didn't, but what were these people up to? What have they done since, what are they doing now? And also, I think the FBI will have to say, you know, why they stopped the investigations of the others? And if they weren't, wasn't he on the radar screen."

      "speaker": "SMITH",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "I guess, all I would say -- we have to wait for all the facts, remember. I think the people who he was associated with were bad people, he used that term. He himself -- I guess there was nothing on him per se, but to me if you're associated with people like that, that should put you on people's radar screen. And so, yes, we'll have to see what happened here, why, you know, more was not done, was there any reason why it was closed out, or is it just the fact that you can only continue an investigation for so long? So, these are all the issues and everything that has to be determined. But this is not somebody you would call a lone wolf who just happened to act on his own. He obviously had deep ISIS beliefs, and the people he associated with were really bad characters from Uzbekistan."

      "utterance": "If you take up arms against the United States in the name of radical Islam, you should be treated as a terrorist. So, what I hope the Trump administration will do is break from the Obama administration's view that all terrorists are common criminals. The law does allow you to treat the terrorist differently than a common criminal. Declaring this man as an unlawful enemy combatant would allow the government to hold them, and it doesn't have to be at Gitmo."

I would have to analyze the law carefully on that and see if it would delay the process, but I have no moral objection, I have no constitutional objection to it, and if it can be done I would say yes. Really, right now it comes down to what's most efficient, what's most effective. That to me is what would influence me, not the fact that I have any problem with him being declared an enemy combatant, it's whether or not that would slow the process down. And you know, which is easier for us to get the result we want. And that's to find out who else could be involved, who else is part of his network, and also getting the most evidence of him, even though I think we have enough evidence now to put him away forever."

And it was just so beautiful that his mother and I came home from the hospital with him on Thanksgiving Day. You know, it doesn't really get a lot more beautiful than that. And, you know, he had a typical, normal upbringing, you know, going to preschool and then becoming a boy scout, then going to high school, playing football, and then going to college on scholarship. He is getting ready for Rutgers, and then he went into the corporate world, and he worked (INAUDIBLE), and then he went a long ways' away.

I mean, of course, there's a war going on between America and ISIS and Al Qaeda, of course, there's a war going on. But you know, I just think that vetting should be a lot more difficult, you know, to allow these people to come into the country, especially a single man. You know, I understand he was married living in Paterson, but I think that when he came in, he came in as one person, but I'm not sure about. We have Syrian neighbors across the street, I love them. I love the lady like my sister, they wouldn't hurt a fly. But you get these, you know, these radicals, you know, my son is the victim.

And then as the day went on, and we didn't hear from him and his cell phone went dead, and his office phone, he didn't answer, and then around 5:00 he normally calls, you know, and asked me what he wanted for dinner, and we just realized as longer the night went on he wasn't coming home anymore. So, what we did was we called around and we found out that Bellevue picked up some victims and also Columbia down in the Wall Street area. And as the day went on -- as a matter fact, that lady right there that's on the screen right now with the FBI, the lady with the black uniform one, she was with us in Bellevue. What a sweetheart.

Thanks to both of you for being here tonight. Doctor Pate, I want to start with you first, because you have done such in- depth analysis, specifically of ISIS terrorists in the U.S. dating back to 2014.

      "utterance": "What we're seeing is almost a paradigm case of ISIS recruit that has been almost by remote control recruited by ISIS from overseas. We don't see ISIS trying to punch through fighters through immigration cracks in our immigration system. What we see are ISIS orchestrating through social media, online propaganda and especially video propaganda, detailed attack plans, and also detailed and targeted recruitment appeals. Uzbek had been specifically targeted by ISIS and multiple videos to glorify would be Uzbeks who would become martyrs in the service of ISIS. And what you're seeing with Saipov is somebody who took ISIS' lead."

      "speaker": "PAPE",
      "utterance": "It's even more aggressive than that. You see, ISIS, unlike past terrorist groups, is really targeting its videos to very specific sub- audiences; very specific parts of a population. And what they're doing is producing videos within the case of Uzbeks, Uzbek speakers with Uzbeks who have traveled to Syria, who have died in Syria, coming to life in these videos. And then, essentially, calling for others to come and follow their footsteps."

If we know the playbook, as officials are saying, he followed it to a T, you're saying they went even further, Dr. Pape, in this scenario. How do we combat it? If we know the playbook, why can't we fight it and stop attacks like this?"

And when I say we're not willing to fight it, I say as a society, we often are scared of calling out the Islamist ideology for what it is my name. The president before this one was even unable to name the threat, to call it Islamist Extremism for fear of fear of offending Muslims; weren't actually -- surely if Muslims are the first to say this is nothing to do with us, they also would be standing side-by-side with those who are able to name this threat and isolate it from mainstream Muslim communities. And so, we have this problem that we are, for various reasons for fear of racism, fear of whatever political correctness, we're unable to even name and isolate and then challenge the threat. And then we've got a separate problem, which is that if we can't name something, we simply don't even have the ability to begin to challenge the propaganda about --"

This man, who was in Florida, he had -- I mean, incredibly privileged to come from Uzbekistan to one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and he's in Florida. And for him to turn against the country that was so hospitable to him, it tells us something, it tells us that the strength of the narrative that he subscribes to got to him before the American dream got to him. And that tells us that something's gone wrong with the way in which we are advocating are smaller, liberal, secular democratic principles. We've become scared to say that this is a better way of life than the dictatorship that is in Uzbekistan."

I know because I meet with such leaders here in Chicago and I study the propaganda. And even though leaders may think they would like to talk people out of it, if they don't know what ISIS is doing, this is a major problem."

Now that she was on the other foot as Democrats today expressed outrage that the president is already talking about extreme vetting measures hours after this terror attack. It started last night when he started tweeting about how he had ordered the homeland security department to step up extreme vetting of refugees. Then at a meeting today with his cabinet, the president said government officials have grown so politically correct in recent years that they're afraid to act to stop terrorist, citing specifically that diversity visa lottery program. The terror suspect in this case entered the U.S. from Uzbekistan during the Obama administration from this program. It's been in place for over 20 years offering a small number of visas to people from parts of the world that has small numbers of immigrants in America. The idea of diversity driving this leads the president to charge it is all about political correctness. The president also jumping on the fact that as a house member in 1990, now-Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer sponsored the bill that helped create this program. The president tweeting, quote, that terrorist came in to our country to what is called a diversity visa lottery program, a chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit- based. That led Schumer to fire back that the president is politicizing this tragedy."

Look, I have no objection to the president bringing this up. I didn't have any particular objection to the Democrats bringing up the gun issue. You know, this is the way we talk about things in Washington. We turn them into political issues. And that's sometimes the way we solved questions. So let's not be so offended by that. The president's instincts here are right. But let me just say analytically we need to get smarter about this. The problem is not identifying countries where this trouble. The problem is not identifying countries where there's trouble. The problem is identifying individuals and sometimes it's not hard. The question is whether these people are Sharia supremacists. Do they believe in the supremacy of Sharia over the rule of law, over the rule of the constitution? And I would suggest if they do, they don't come in. And if you're not sure, they don't come in. I think the president instincts are right on this. Look, we have all these police cars out there. We have these guys in the suits on the indictment, all fine. We're going to have the teddy bears and the candles, but can we cut out the baloney and just do what's obvious, Sandra? The guy first name is Sayfullo which I'm told translates as sword of Allah. Let's not let anybody in whose first name is sort of Allah, or whose first name translates as I want to kill Americans. Remember the car that Nidal Hasan had, the psychiatrist in San Antonio who killed everybody, the business card said soldier of Allah. These people are not embarrassed about it, they're out there telling us. So let's just be clear and let's be clear in our policy on immigration. And if they can't pass that test, Sharia supremacists over the constitution, they don't get in. That program, the lottery visa program."

I will tell you this, the longer -- in many places in America, the longer you stay in school and the more education you get, the more likely you are to have an unfavorable view of America. That's just the way it is. There was a study done years ago, Sandra, of people before they started high school, people whose kids were born in another country. Before they started high school, they identified themselves as Americans. When they finish high school a majority of them identified themselves as hyphenated Americans. We're not doing our assimilation job by our own citizens, people who were born here and raised here. And for these people come over -- and again, this is not rocket science. The guy lives in this nest, as I think Catherine Herridge called it, next to the mosque with a lot of other sympathizers of ISIS.

You can see what police thought was a handgun at the time. Here now, Rob O'Neill, former Navy SEAL and Fox News contributor. Buck Sexton, former NYPD intelligence officer, and former CIA officer.

      "utterance": "That this thing is going exactly the way it should according to the ISIS handbook. He did what he wanted to do, he rehearsed it, he had a vehicle, preferably, a truck they say to mow people down. He had ISIS inspired material inside, either a flag or a picture of a flag, a handwritten note about this is for ISIS, and then he had knives in there. Once the truck was stopped, which it will be, get out and inflict as much damage as you can until you're martyred, which is you have to be killed and then go to paradise. I believe that's what he had the fake guns because he knew he could die by suicide by cop. So he would try to get out and stab people, but he did drop the knives in the chaos, and then he ran with the guns knowing the NYPD with their quick response would be there and inevitably shoot him, but they didn't kill him."

And in fact, part of this is that the Islamic state in -- which is its online magazine has put out exactly how to pull off, not just a terrorist attack, but this terrorist attack, meaning the site, the vehicle, all the different aspects of it, all the different components. And then people want to know what could we do to prevent this? The problem with vehicle assault specifically is because they require no skill, they require no ability, and they're so omnipresent in our day-to-day lives that it really weaponized the environment around us. And it doesn't allow for the red flags, the tripwires, what law enforcement and intelligence agents and intelligence officers do to try and prevent these attacks from happening. A lot of those barriers of getting explosive, learning explosives, those are no longer present by the vehicles."

      "speaker": "O'NEILL",

They're adapting, they're realizing that the bombs don't always go off. They will get caught trying to buy the stuff to make it. They can get away with doing this. And we keep reacting, but they're being proactive. And they're realizing they've done it over in Europe a bunch of times. They can take something very, very simple, like Buck was saying with very little training and just mass casualties, hurt a bunch, and not only what they do at the time, but there's always the thought people looking over there. How many people are going to avoid the marathon tomorrow? Who knows what's going to happen? They're going to keep evolving once -- like, they're not going after the airports per se right now."

And the reality is that sometimes law enforcements perspective, particularly, in this country, will know that somebody has radical ideas. We'll know that somebody has a hatred for America, wants to see U.S. troops failing overseas, once the body counts go up. That's not necessarily illegal and actionable for a legal perspective, and so."

So many news outlets knew about it. It then shows up, it's briefed to the president of the United States and briefed to congress, leaked by the intelligence agencies, the fact of that happening, so those are the things that I know.

So last minute -- all we're doing was sending two of our investigators down there to start to begin to go through the documents to ensure that the documents that we had subpoenaed were provided. When my investigators got there, they were four other staff from the other side of the aisle, including a member of congress, the ranking member from our committee, which seems to me to be very bizarre behavior since."
