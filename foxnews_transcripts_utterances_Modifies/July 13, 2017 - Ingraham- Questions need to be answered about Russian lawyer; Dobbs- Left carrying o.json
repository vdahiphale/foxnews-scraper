      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news tonight, an explosive report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr. It completely crushes Democrats, and of course, the destroy Trump media's talking points. It raises some very serious new questions about the Obama administration. John Solomon, who broke this story, will be here tonight with the stunning details. Also, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs are all here tonight with reaction. But first, a special \"Hannity\" investigation into stories and scandals that are all but being ignored by the mainstream media but must be investigated. This is something you will only see right here tonight on \"Hannity,\" and that's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, The Hill reporter John Solomon and his colleague are out with a bombshell report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last summer. Here's the headline. Quote, \"Exclusive. DOJ let Russian lawyer into U.S. before she met with Trump team.\"  Now, the report finds that the former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch allowed this Russian lawyer to enter the country under, quote, \"extraordinary circumstances\" and without a visa. And after a June 9th meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., guess what? The lawyer was spotted in the front row of a June 14th hearing of America's policies towards Russia!  The Hill is also reporting that this lawyer was part of a pro-Russian lobbying effort, went to an event in Washington. Remember the Magnitsky Act? That was the one attended by congressional staffers and State Department officials. Now, this new information is raising very serious questions if this lawyer is so sinister and nefarious, and whether or not it's connected to the Russian government, like the Democrats and the media have been trying to tell you. And why did the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, allow her into the country?  Why did the Obama administration allow her into the country? Why was she allowed to attend a congressional hearing and other events with government officials in Washington, D.C.? Now, there's also another report that says this Russian lawyer has ties to the Democrats. So meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., to try and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign -- it doesn't really make sense anymore, which, by the way, the lawyer says she never had any damaging information on Clinton. And Solomon and his colleague are breaking yet another story, major news tonight, with the headline, quote, well, \"U.S. Congressman got similar approach from Russian officials two months before Trump's son.\"  Now, John will be here in just a minute with all the details, but first, our \"Hannity\" investigation into a massive election interference scandal that the destroy Trump media is not reporting on and that Democrats don't want you to know about. They won't go near it, but we will continue to expose the truth until they have to cover this and tell you what's really going on.   Now, back in January, the Politico published a stunning report that had this headline. Here's the headline. \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\" Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with president- elect after quietly working to boost Clinton. Now, one-time DNC operative -- her name is Alexandra Chalupa. She led the effort, along with Ukrainian government officials. Why? They wanted to help Hillary Clinton and try and damage Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle. Now, according to Politico, Chalupa, who previously worked for the Clinton White House, was the key play (ph) in this plan and met with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy to discuss ways to, quote, \"expose\" former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. And Chalupa told Politico that those Ukrainian diplomats were, quote, \"helpful\" when it came to finding leads for digging up dirt. And then there's this shocking quote for (sic) the article about Chalupa. She occasionally -- she shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. So according to that report, Chalupa was working with Ukraine and also offering up information that she found to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Sound like collusion?   Well, it doesn't end there. Chalupa also said that she would assist, quote, \"a lot of journalists\" in writing stories about Manafort and the Trump campaign. Now, we reached out to Chalupa for comment on this explosive story. She hasn't gotten back to us. But there's one other thing. Enough is enough when it comes to this scandal. Tonight, we on this show are demanding answers, answers to questions that you, the American people, deserve to know about because the evidence that we have here points to a foreign power that actually did work to influence the election.  Alexandra Chalupa and the DNC operative at the center of the scandal -- she needs to be put under oath. She needs to tell Congress what she knew, when she knew it and who she told it to. And the same goes for the Ukrainian ambassador that Chalupa reportedly met with. And since Chalupa says that she met with the DNC and was employed and paid by them, by the way, maybe it's also time for Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- maybe she needs to answer questions under oath about Chalupa's exact role.   And by the way, that would include former Clinton campaign manager (sic) John Podesta. He needs to be called to testify since information was shared with the Clinton campaign. And Robbie Mook also. And by the way, that's not the only scandals we've been covering and searching for answers for here tonight on \"Hannity.\" Now, there's the fake news, of course, Christopher Steele's dossier -- remember that? -- that cited Russian sources. Now, that group, Fusion GPS -- they commissioned, they shopped around to the media all that information. And the Democrats routinely were citing it in public to you. Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote this fake document -- he needs to be subpoenaed. He did to be forced to talk about what he knows, when he knew it, how we (sic) obtained this information.  And we also need answers about the reports that the FBI, James Comey, offered to pay him as much as $50,000. Also speaking of James Comey, well, he's surrounded by controversy. He may have broken the law, remember, removing classified government property from the FBI. And Comey also admitted that he gave one of his memos to a friend so that they'd leak it to the press, in that case, The New York Times, because he wanted a special counsel. Well, that special counsel turned out to be a long-time BFF of James Comey, Robert Mueller. Now, this guy has more conflict of interest than we can count.  So it's time to start investigating the investigator. Why did he hire Hillary Clinton's attorney? Why did he hire Obama and Hillary donors? And Mueller, by the way, potentially -- did he break the law? Is he being unethical? Is he conducting an investigation where his friend, James Comey, is the star witness? Does that need to be a case of recusal?  And on top of that, all the handful of investigators that donated only to Democratic presidential candidates -- take a look at this chart. Donations totalling $32,000, over $13,000, and the list goes on and on. So can we expect people who donated this type of money to Obama, to Clinton, to Democrats that Mueller is now -- are they going to be fair? Are they going to be impartial? Of course not. And what's even more disturbing is that one of the lawyers working for Mueller worked for the Clinton Foundation. She didn't want you to know many things and she was trying to squash Freedom of Information Act requests.  Now, the special counsel is full of conflicts of interest. It's becoming more corrupt by the day. And it's time to expose who these people are.   And we've also found out that the former Obama attorney general, Loretta Lynch, influenced the investigation into Hillary's e-mail server. Remember? She told James Comey publicly it's a matter, it's not an investigation, and he listened to her. And then she met 40 minutes on a tarmac with Bill Clinton, just happened to be days before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook. Now, Congress is only beginning to touch the surface on these issues and examine this, but they've got to up the urgency and move faster, including revisiting Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation, so much evidence that, in fact, Lynch influenced the investigation. We know Hillary broke the law. Why? She had top-secret and she had classified, special access information program access information on her e-mail server. That's mishandling. That's a felony. And then she destroyed some of it. That's a felony also. That's breaking the law. Hillary Clinton needs to be held accountable. We're calling on that tonight. And then we have the Uranium One deal. As her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary was one of nine people to approve the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin the Russians, a real conspiracy! People involved in that deal -- they kicked back as much as $145 million to the Clinton Foundation! Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow.  Now, Democrats and the media in the country. if they care about the rule of law, the equal application of the rule of law, then it's time and we'll start here demanding justice and we'll start investigating these scandals, and these people need to be put under oath.  From Circanews.com, Sara Carter is a lawyer and investigator, FOX News anchor, and of course, legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and from The Hill, John Solomon. Guys, welcome back. Good to see you. John, let's start. Let's go back to your investigative work here. Tell us why this is so critical to all the Donald Trump, Jr., hype.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, if you go back to last Saturday, just six days ago, you know, the story was there was a Kremlin-backed lawyer who snuck into the Trump Tower and had a secret conversation with Donald Trump, Jr., that looked like collusion. People were even using the word \"treason,\" I think, on Monday morning. What we found out is that this lawyer was actually part of a lobbying campaign. She's a private attorney. It's a lobbying campaign that started before the Donald Trump meeting, in March in Moscow, when a congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, was approached and carried out all the way through June, when many members of Congress, some State Department officials, some staffers were all contacted by the same group, including this lawyer. to lobby about the Magnitsky act.  This was a classic lobbying operation, and as far as we can tell, no evidence that it was a collusion or campaign event, as it was originally portrayed to be...",

In the case of the Ukraine, you have a DNC-paid operative who was admitting she actually met with foreigners, in this case Ukrainian -- and a Ukrainian ambassador. And she's admitting she passed on, you know, detrimental information to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Now, on paper, that is far worse than anything we know about Trump-Russia collusion, but it's basically been ignored. How bad is it? And should these people, as I'm suggesting, be put under oath?",

I mean, being able to look at these e-mails of Chalupa's and being able to see for ourselves how deep it goes when political people, political operatives are trying to get information on their opponents.   It's fascinating. It doesn't necessarily make it illegal, though, Sean, but it does make it very concerning when you look at the long laundry list of e-mails and how she was trying to gather this information.  And as for Natalia Veselnitskaya, I think what's really fascinating here is that she was lobbying against for the Magnitsky Act, and -- against it, you know. And one thing that's interesting that we've left out is Fusion GPS was also lobbying against the Magnitsky Act. And remember, they came up with the Christopher Steele dossier against President Trump. So just think about that convoluted matter right there and those connections. These are all things that need to be investigated and they need to be looked into. And also, how she stayed beyond her special circumstances via from January, when it apparently ended, and she asked for that extension, and how she returned back, apparently, from Moscow sometime in early June. If you're to believe the Donald Trump, Jr., e-mails that go back and forth, she was actually in Moscow. So she got back into the United States.",

It's not conspiracy to defraud the government. It's not collusion, which only applies to anti-trust. It's not even a violation of the election laws.

You have the press conference doing a joint -- excuse me, the president doing a joint press conference with the president of France. You have him doing interviews with Reuters and CBN yesterday. You have Kellyanne Conway doing multiple interviews across the spectrum. Jay Sekulow I think for most records in one day in terms of interviews on ABC, CBS, NBC, and obviously Gorka has been active as well. So that's not a bunker mentality. But here's where I took issue with that interview. Anderson Cooper at one point scolded Sebastian Gorka and said, \"I'm just going to ignore the insults because I don't think it really gets us anywhere.\" And in the post interview analysis, after Gorka was off that interview where he couldn't defend himself, Anderson Cooper, who is an anchor, the face of that network and the highest-paid person there who should act like a professional, called Gorka the Hungarian Don Rickles. So that is where things are getting personal. It's no longer about anything else but hurling an insult where a guy can't defend himself.

MITCH MCCONNELL, R-KY., JUNE 28, 2012: There's only one way to truly fix ObamaCare, only one way, and that's a full repeal. A full repeal, that's been our goal from the start, that's our goal now, and we plan to achieve it. MCCAIN, DEC. 3, 2015: It's clear that any serious attempt to improve our health care system must begin with full repeal and replacement of ObamaCare, a mission I remain fully committed to fighting on behalf of the people of Arizona. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, R-MAINE, NOV. 14, 2013: Repealing ObamaCare's poorly crafted and misguided mandates and replacing the law with a fiscally responsible reform bill that contains costs and provides more choices is the best path forward.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity,\" and this is a Fox News Alert, major breaking news tonight, an explosive report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr. It completely crushes Democrats, and of course, the destroy Trump media's talking points. It raises some very serious new questions about the Obama administration. John Solomon, who broke this story, will be here tonight with the stunning details. Also, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs are all here tonight with reaction. But first, a special \"Hannity\" investigation into stories and scandals that are all but being ignored by the mainstream media but must be investigated. This is something you will only see right here tonight on \"Hannity,\" and that's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, The Hill reporter John Solomon and his colleague are out with a bombshell report about the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last summer. Here's the headline. Quote, \"Exclusive. DOJ let Russian lawyer into U.S. before she met with Trump team.\" Now, the report finds that the former Obama attorney general Loretta Lynch allowed this Russian lawyer to enter the country under, quote, \"extraordinary circumstances\" and without a visa. And after a June 9th meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., guess what? The lawyer was spotted in the front row of a June 14th hearing of America's policies towards Russia! The Hill is also reporting that this lawyer was part of a pro-Russian lobbying effort, went to an event in Washington. Remember the Magnitsky Act? That was the one attended by congressional staffers and State Department officials. Now, this new information is raising very serious questions if this lawyer is so sinister and nefarious, and whether or not it's connected to the Russian government, like the Democrats and the media have been trying to tell you. And why did the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, allow her into the country? Why did the Obama administration allow her into the country? Why was she allowed to attend a congressional hearing and other events with government officials in Washington, D.C.? Now, there's also another report that says this Russian lawyer has ties to the Democrats. So meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., to try and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign -- it doesn't really make sense anymore, which, by the way, the lawyer says she never had any damaging information on Clinton. And Solomon and his colleague are breaking yet another story, major news tonight, with the headline, quote, well, \"U.S. Congressman got similar approach from Russian officials two months before Trump's son.\" Now, John will be here in just a minute with all the details, but first, our \"Hannity\" investigation into a massive election interference scandal that the destroy Trump media is not reporting on and that Democrats don't want you to know about. They won't go near it, but we will continue to expose the truth until they have to cover this and tell you what's really going on. Now, back in January, the Politico published a stunning report that had this headline. Here's the headline. \"Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\" Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with president- elect after quietly working to boost Clinton. Now, one-time DNC operative -- her name is Alexandra Chalupa. She led the effort, along with Ukrainian government officials. Why? They wanted to help Hillary Clinton and try and damage Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle. Now, according to Politico, Chalupa, who previously worked for the Clinton White House, was the key play (ph) in this plan and met with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy to discuss ways to, quote, \"expose\" former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. And Chalupa told Politico that those Ukrainian diplomats were, quote, \"helpful\" when it came to finding leads for digging up dirt. And then there's this shocking quote for (sic) the article about Chalupa. She occasionally -- she shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. So according to that report, Chalupa was working with Ukraine and also offering up information that she found to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Sound like collusion? Well, it doesn't end there. Chalupa also said that she would assist, quote, \"a lot of journalists\" in writing stories about Manafort and the Trump campaign. Now, we reached out to Chalupa for comment on this explosive story. She hasn't gotten back to us. But there's one other thing. Enough is enough when it comes to this scandal. Tonight, we on this show are demanding answers, answers to questions that you, the American people, deserve to know about because the evidence that we have here points to a foreign power that actually did work to influence the election. Alexandra Chalupa and the DNC operative at the center of the scandal -- she needs to be put under oath. She needs to tell Congress what she knew, when she knew it and who she told it to. And the same goes for the Ukrainian ambassador that Chalupa reportedly met with. And since Chalupa says that she met with the DNC and was employed and paid by them, by the way, maybe it's also time for Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- maybe she needs to answer questions under oath about Chalupa's exact role. And by the way, that would include former Clinton campaign manager (sic) John Podesta. He needs to be called to testify since information was shared with the Clinton campaign. And Robbie Mook also. And by the way, that's not the only scandals we've been covering and searching for answers for here tonight on \"Hannity.\" Now, there's the fake news, of course, Christopher Steele's dossier -- remember that? -- that cited Russian sources. Now, that group, Fusion GPS -- they commissioned, they shopped around to the media all that information. And the Democrats routinely were citing it in public to you. Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote this fake document -- he needs to be subpoenaed. He did to be forced to talk about what he knows, when he knew it, how we (sic) obtained this information. And we also need answers about the reports that the FBI, James Comey, offered to pay him as much as $50,000. Also speaking of James Comey, well, he's surrounded by controversy. He may have broken the law, remember, removing classified government property from the FBI. And Comey also admitted that he gave one of his memos to a friend so that they'd leak it to the press, in that case, The New York Times, because he wanted a special counsel. Well, that special counsel turned out to be a long-time BFF of James Comey, Robert Mueller. Now, this guy has more conflict of interest than we can count. So it's time to start investigating the investigator. Why did he hire Hillary Clinton's attorney? Why did he hire Obama and Hillary donors? And Mueller, by the way, potentially -- did he break the law? Is he being unethical? Is he conducting an investigation where his friend, James Comey, is the star witness? Does that need to be a case of recusal? And on top of that, all the handful of investigators that donated only to Democratic presidential candidates -- take a look at this chart. Donations totalling $32,000, over $13,000, and the list goes on and on. So can we expect people who donated this type of money to Obama, to Clinton, to Democrats that Mueller is now -- are they going to be fair? Are they going to be impartial? Of course not. And what's even more disturbing is that one of the lawyers working for Mueller worked for the Clinton Foundation. She didn't want you to know many things and she was trying to squash Freedom of Information Act requests. Now, the special counsel is full of conflicts of interest. It's becoming more corrupt by the day. And it's time to expose who these people are. And we've also found out that the former Obama attorney general, Loretta Lynch, influenced the investigation into Hillary's e-mail server. Remember? She told James Comey publicly it's a matter, it's not an investigation, and he listened to her. And then she met 40 minutes on a tarmac with Bill Clinton, just happened to be days before Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook. Now, Congress is only beginning to touch the surface on these issues and examine this, but they've got to up the urgency and move faster, including revisiting Hillary Clinton's e-mail investigation, so much evidence that, in fact, Lynch influenced the investigation. We know Hillary broke the law. Why? She had top-secret and she had classified, special access information program access information on her e-mail server. That's mishandling. That's a felony. And then she destroyed some of it. That's a felony also. That's breaking the law. Hillary Clinton needs to be held accountable. We're calling on that tonight. And then we have the Uranium One deal. As her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary was one of nine people to approve the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin the Russians, a real conspiracy! People involved in that deal -- they kicked back as much as $145 million to the Clinton Foundation! Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. Now, Democrats and the media in the country. if they care about the rule of law, the equal application of the rule of law, then it's time and we'll start here demanding justice and we'll start investigating these scandals, and these people need to be put under oath. From Circanews.com, Sara Carter is a lawyer and investigator, FOX News anchor, and of course, legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, and from The Hill, John Solomon. Guys, welcome back. Good to see you. John, let's start. Let's go back to your investigative work here. Tell us why this is so critical to all the Donald Trump, Jr., hype."

      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, if you go back to last Saturday, just six days ago, you know, the story was there was a Kremlin-backed lawyer who snuck into the Trump Tower and had a secret conversation with Donald Trump, Jr., that looked like collusion. People were even using the word \"treason,\" I think, on Monday morning. What we found out is that this lawyer was actually part of a lobbying campaign. She's a private attorney. It's a lobbying campaign that started before the Donald Trump meeting, in March in Moscow, when a congressman, Dana Rohrabacher, was approached and carried out all the way through June, when many members of Congress, some State Department officials, some staffers were all contacted by the same group, including this lawyer. to lobby about the Magnitsky act. This was a classic lobbying operation, and as far as we can tell, no evidence that it was a collusion or campaign event, as it was originally portrayed to be..."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, we always talk, Sara, about selective moral outrage on this program. In the case of the Ukraine, you have a DNC-paid operative who was admitting she actually met with foreigners, in this case Ukrainian -- and a Ukrainian ambassador. And she's admitting she passed on, you know, detrimental information to the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Now, on paper, that is far worse than anything we know about Trump-Russia collusion, but it's basically been ignored. How bad is it? And should these people, as I'm suggesting, be put under oath?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CIRCANEWS.COM",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly think that they can be called to testify. I mean, being able to look at these e-mails of Chalupa's and being able to see for ourselves how deep it goes when political people, political operatives are trying to get information on their opponents. It's fascinating. It doesn't necessarily make it illegal, though, Sean, but it does make it very concerning when you look at the long laundry list of e-mails and how she was trying to gather this information. And as for Natalia Veselnitskaya, I think what's really fascinating here is that she was lobbying against for the Magnitsky Act, and -- against it, you know. And one thing that's interesting that we've left out is Fusion GPS was also lobbying against the Magnitsky Act. And remember, they came up with the Christopher Steele dossier against President Trump. So just think about that convoluted matter right there and those connections. These are all things that need to be investigated and they need to be looked into. And also, how she stayed beyond her special circumstances via from January, when it apparently ended, and she asked for that extension, and how she returned back, apparently, from Moscow sometime in early June. If you're to believe the Donald Trump, Jr., e-mails that go back and forth, she was actually in Moscow. So she got back into the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Gregg, let me just get pure legal analysis from you. If you're looking at facts as a lawyer and you look at the Ukrainian situation -- meetings with foreign entities that want to obviously influence the election, with paid DNC officials, information is transferred to the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and nary a word is discussed about this by the very people that have been all over in government and the media -- all over with no evidence -- a so-called collusion story with the Trump campaign that's nonexistent."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "What's troubling is the hysteria over the Donald Trump, Jr., meeting, which is not illegal in any shape, or form, and the lack of equivalency and attention to, you know, the Chalupa-Hillary Clinton campaign and the Ukrainian embassy. Now, I mean, I will say this. If the Ukrainian government and Chalupa and Hillary Clinton campaign colluded to undermine Donald Trump, that's not a crime, either. It's not treason. It's not conspiracy to defraud the government. It's not collusion, which only applies to anti-trust. It's not even a violation of the election laws. In both cases, the Donald Trump case and in the Ukrainian case, it's just not against the law. The 1st Amendment, that pesky little document, provides complete defense."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "OK, real quick -- we'll do a lightning round. John, where is this headed next, in your opinion? And do you see Congress, that they have an obligation now to put the same focus and attention into both the dossier issue and the Ukrainian influence issue as they are Russia?"

      "utterance": "Yes. And I think another thing to look for is law enforcement. You know, as the new FBI director takes his role at the FBI, there may be investigations that we haven't seen for a while reopen or light being shed on those, whether they have to do with Hillary Clinton and Uranium One and whether they have to do with other deals remains to be seen. But I think that's something that we need to look for, too."

It does appear there is evidence that Hillary Clinton used her government office to confer a benefit to a foreign government in exchange for money. That, if true, is a crime. And I do think you're right that a new investigation ought to be launched into the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal because she did what David Petraeus and John Deutch did. She stored classified documents at her home. That is a crime. And James Comey may have committed the exact same crime."

When we come back, more reaction to this explosive report that the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump, Jr., last year was let into the U.S. by the Obama Justice Department. Laura Ingraham is here. Also later tonight, during his joint news conference with the president of France, President Trump defended his son, Don, Jr. Lou Dobbs has reaction.

However, if, in fact, this woman is connected to the Russian government and is essentially acting as, you know, some type of Russian agent for the Russian government, then I think that's a different matter.

OK, if that's the case, then we need to get to the bottom of Ms. Veselnitskaya's immigration status, exactly what John McCain's, you know, connection to this dossier was. We want to get to the bottom of the leaks and whether the leaks are coming out of the National Security Council, leaks are coming out of the FBI, leaks are coming out of -- of course, from James Comey and how he delivered memos to his friend to deliver them to The New York Times -- I mean, we want answers to all of this.

You know, what happened with the integrity of those e-mails? We never even got answers to that. And so could it have been Russia? Could have been China, could have been -- could have been other bad actors? But she actually made her entire government filing system vulnerable.

Tomorrow they'll all attend the Bastille Day parade which this year falls on the 100th anniversary of the entry of the American troops into World War I. A Pennsylvania drug dealer confessing to killing four young men after selling them marijuana. There he is. A person with firsthand knowledge of his confession telling the Associated Press that he then burned their bodies at his family's Bucks County farm. The victims who went missing last week were between the ages of 19 and 22. Former President Jimmy Carter was taken to the hospital today as a precaution.

It is an effort by the deep state to roll over a duly elected president and a legitimate government, and to break the will of the American people. This is no longer about Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. This is about a full on assault by the left, the Democratic Party, to absolutely carry out a coup d'etat against President Trump, aided by the leftwing media. There's no -- the suggestion there's collusion between Trump and the Russians, when we have absolute evidence of collusion between the Clinton Foundation, Secretary of State Clinton and the Russians?

I think the only way this works is the deep state gets purged, number one. Obama holdovers get purged, that still has not happened. The next thing is the laws of the country that apply to every American watching us now, Lou, need to apply to Hillary, need to apply to Comey, need to apply to Attorney General Lynch, and anyone else who leaked information within the deep state. If we don't hold them accountable then it never stops."

Over the course of the last month we have watched those leaks accelerate in point of fact from the West Wing, the White House itself, instead of abate. And we have a Justice Department, where is Attorney General Jeff Sessions? This is a time for the attorney general to stand up and say this is not going to be tolerated, and this is what is going to occur. We are opening investigations into the Clinton Foundation to Uranium One and 20 percent of uranium production that was transferred ultimately to the Russians. That's collusion."

And this whole narrative of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russians saying -- Hillary Clinton actually has done things with our uranium, 20 percent at $140 million, tens of millions of dollars going into the Clinton Foundation, and those are facts.

      "speaker": "JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "In terms of the Gorka exchange with Anderson Cooper, well, Sean, the way I saw it was he was taking issue with the CNN report about the White House being in a bunker mentality. Here's where the White House has been in terms of a bunker mentality over the last couple of days. You have the press conference doing a joint -- excuse me, the president doing a joint press conference with the president of France. You have him doing interviews with Reuters and CBN yesterday. You have Kellyanne Conway doing multiple interviews across the spectrum. Jay Sekulow I think for most records in one day in terms of interviews on ABC, CBS, NBC, and obviously Gorka has been active as well. So that's not a bunker mentality. But here's where I took issue with that interview. Anderson Cooper at one point scolded Sebastian Gorka and said, \"I'm just going to ignore the insults because I don't think it really gets us anywhere.\" And in the post interview analysis, after Gorka was off that interview where he couldn't defend himself, Anderson Cooper, who is an anchor, the face of that network and the highest-paid person there who should act like a professional, called Gorka the Hungarian Don Rickles. So that is where things are getting personal. It's no longer about anything else but hurling an insult where a guy can't defend himself. And by the way, if you're going to insult somebody, don't bring up Don Rickles. He just died three months ago. He was beloved. Find another example besides a beloved entertainer like Mr. Rickles."

You don't want to be trailing episodes of \"Full House\" which is a show that came on the year 30 years ago, and the Olson twins are actually in their 30s, which makes you feel kind of old. So they're going to have to turn things around clearly and get the CNN that we had during the Gulf Wars and just doing that kind of reportage instead of focusing on one topic so much. Harvard study, Sean, I brought it up. I'll bring it up again, 93 percent of all coverage on CNN is negative toward the Trump administration. That is a number you cannot spin."

The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell has cancelled -- good start -- the first two weeks of the Senate's August recess, and he says he may vote on the bill next week. I'll believe it when I see it. Senator Ted Cruz said that he will support the bill as long as it drives down the cost of premiums, that's key. So will that happen? Some of the key provisions and revisions to the released bill included billions of dollars to combat opioid addiction, additional funding for insurers, covering a high risk pool. It also allows premiums to be paid with pretax health savings accounts. That's important. And still some senators are still skeptical that this revamped legislation will ever even see the light of day.

A full repeal, that's been our goal from the start, that's our goal now, and we plan to achieve it.
