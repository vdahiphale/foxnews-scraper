In fact, here is one Democrat, newly elected, Congresswoman Katie Hill, talking in January to Martha about the border. Congresswoman Hill said that she wanted to get some things done. Now, she's saying, president, committed impeachable offenses. She's here alive to explain all of that in a few moments.

Stormy Daniels was due to receive $800,000 over four payments for her memoir full disclosure, a tell-all about her alleged affair with President Trump. According to the indictment, the money was supposed to go from the publisher, to Daniels agent who would take a fee and then sent her the rest. But Avenatti allegedly told the agent to send the book money into his account those instructions complete with what appeared to be Daniel's signature. Over several months, Avenatti allegedly stole $300,000 of Daniels money and spent it on lease payments for his Ferrari, hotels and restaurants, even payroll checks to employees at his coffee company and law firm. Daniels asked Avenatti where her late money was telling him I'm sending publisher a certified letter demanding payment and firing agent one. Then I may post it online for fun. Prosecutors say Avenatti didn't tell Daniels he already had the money but told her not to fire the agent because she would need their help to sue for the payment. On other occasions, he allegedly suggested the funds hadn't come in because of poor book sales. Avenatti told Fox News today, I look forward to a jury hearing all of the evidence and passing judgment on my conduct. At no time was any money misappropriated or mishandled. I will be fully exonerated once the relevant emails, contracts, text messages, and documents are presented.  The former celebrity lawyer faces up to 69 years behind bars for wire fraud, identity theft, conspiracy, and extortion, but that's just for this case. He's facing a total of 42 counts in New York and California for allegedly extorting $20 million from Nike, stealing millions of dollars from his clients, as well as tax fraud. If he's convicted on all 42 counts, Avenatti faces a maximum possible sentence of 404 years in prison. Ed?",

Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE says that between 2010 and 2018, Quintana was deported three times. He would've been deported sooner, but starting in 2009, he spent 15 months in prison for assaulting Alec McKinney's mother and threatening her with a deadly weapon. In divorce papers filed by the mother in 2014, she testified that Quintana had been traveling illegally between Colorado and Mexico. His criminal history also includes kidnapping. ICE notes that, quote, \"an alien who reenters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted.\" We know Quintana was repeatedly cut for reentering the U.S. but for some reason, he was never charged. It's also unusual that in the case of the STEM cell -- STEM school shooting, Judge Theresa Slade decided to seal the documents, even though prosecutors wanted them public and the judge failed to show any cause or compelling need for secrecy. Bullying is being looked at as a motive for the school shooting, but not the only motive. At least one of the suspects had been in therapy and had a history of legal and illegal drug use.

Those are some of the big issues Democrats have vowed last November. They would be confronting if the American people gave them power in the House. Another major issue they've been promising to work on with the president for a couple of years now, rebuilding America's crumbling roads, bridges, and airports.

Remember the Department agreed to turn over some of the underlying Intel from the Mueller probe. That is on top of the over 400 pages of information the attorney general turned over weeks ago. Yet the subpoenas from House Democrats keep flying, and now even Democrats on the state level are getting in on the act. Lawmakers here in New York today gave their final approval to a bill that would enable officials to turn the president's state tax returns over to Congress. Wasn't it just a few months ago, Democrats were promising they'd reach across the aisle, and get some work done. In fact, here is one Democrat, newly elected, Congresswoman Katie Hill, talking in January to Martha about the border. Congresswoman Hill said that she wanted to get some things done. Now, she's saying, president, committed impeachable offenses. She's here alive to explain all of that in a few moments. But first, Congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, who has been investigating the investigators who started the Russia probe. Congressman, good to see you."

The problem is the president came -- the Mueller report came back, it did not show what they wanted, there is no collusion, no obstruction. And when they look at it, they look at an economy that is booming, they look at a president who is in control. And then they have to feed to different bases. One says impeach, one says, go after Trump, do everything they can to destroy the president. While the others in their caucus are saying, we don't want this. Our voters don't want this, and they want to move slowly. So, they -- look, they lose on the politics, they lose on the facts, and so now, the American people are the ones losing in the end because they're not doing anything with the majority they have in the aisle."

Not looked at the things that I've had the privilege to look at. And also look at it from the perspective of she had her mind made up a long time ago. She didn't like this president, she didn't like him as a candidate. And so, now they're trying to tell us that a president who's doing exactly what he said he was going to do, to do and work with an economy, to work with our -- with the House to -- in the last two years, to bring down deregulation, to bring down our businesses so that they can actually do that job. Again, this is the rhetoric that really frankly Americans are tired of. They're tired of hearing from talk-show host, who just spout off about what they ever wanted to believe in, instead of saying what is actually happening, and that's why the Democrats are torn up right now."

He wants to do business, he wants to try, but when you have people basically, kicking sand in his face, or accusing him of a crime, he's going to react. This president is passionate about the American people. He's passionate about putting Americans back to work. He's passionate about doing infrastructure. And what we've seen so far is the Democrats including this speaker is passionate about keeping her job and telling everybody else what they've done wrong, and that's just the wrong idea. They want to see him defeated in 2020, instead of actually having an agenda here in the House."

      "speaker": "HENRY",

You released another transcript of these closed-door interviews in the last 24 hours. Loretta Lynch, the former Obama attorney general, where she basically says that James Comey is not telling the truth, she did not tell him to call the Clinton e-mail investigation a matter. Was James Comey have a problem? Did he lie under oath?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I think, he's got a lot to answer for. And I think lately, he's been going around trying to tell everybody that he's OK and that his version is right because when this cuff comes out, you know -- really, for this matter, James Comey is 15 minutes or up. It's time for the people to see exactly what was going on, that he was a part of this cabal that was working against this president from day one. And he's trying to cover his tracks because what's happening is as we release transcripts, as more becomes when the attorney general is actually looking at how this got started. Jim Comey's version of Captain America is going to become very embarrassing, I think, to the American public as they see further what he actually did."

      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I think their time is running out. I think what they're finding is that the Mueller report was just the first of this, and now those of us who have been investigating what actually happened here as the inspector general's report comes out later is Mr. Durham continues his work, they're going to find out that there's a lot more at play here, and it was actually a concerted effort it seems to be at the candidate Trump, and then, President Trump in his early years just to derail his presidency."

I mean, we agree that we need to work on infrastructure. We agree that we need to work on get reducing the cost of prescription drugs. So, you know, the past is the past, I wasn't here for that, and --"

      "speaker": "HENRY",

That doesn't matter to you?"

I mean, the president and his allies have been masterful at findings something to redirect our attention to. And I think, this is exactly what we're seeing right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "OK. Let's get to the specific tweet I want to actually read it what you sent out today. You say, \"I was sent here to fight for accountability and the commander in chief can't even put our roads over covering his own ass. We could be progressing on the issues we all agree on, but Trump is holding the cost of your insulin and the quality of your water hostage. Don't forget it.\" How do you defend that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILL",
      "utterance": "I mean, I don't think there's anything to defend, but I think 100 percent accurate. And right now, what we've seen is that he is so hell- bent on refusing to get information out in the public. That he is even unwilling to deal with us on the issues that we are so close to being able to work together on."

I was sent here to work on the cost of health care. That I was sent here to work on infrastructure. I was sent here to work on housing costs, and on bringing transparency and accountability to Washington. And that is --"
    },
    {

      "utterance": "So, why you now saying that you believe the president committed impeachable offenses?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILL",
      "utterance": "Because I've read the 448 pages of the Mueller report, and I think that it is perfectly laid out there, and that's on top of the issues that I've independently witnessed. Not only through -- you know, the time that I've spent here in Washington, but through the behaviors that I think that we've all been able to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, you've said in your tweets, and now, here that he's been essentially leading a cover-up -- that he's covered up information. What did he cover up with Don McGahn when the president himself allowed Don McGahn, he's not allowing to testify to Congress but he talked to Robert Mueller for what is it, 30 or 40 hours? How is that a cover-up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILL",
      "utterance": "I Will, I think that he realizes that he made a mistake by letting Don McGahn speak to Mueller. Because if you actually read the 448-page report, you see over, and over, and over again that Don McGahn's testimony was completely damning. And that's why he doesn't want him to testify in front of Congress. He is making the bet, they very calculated bet that people don't read that report, and they have it. That's why they were able to put this very effective spin on the narrative that, oh, yes, it was exoneration, it was no collusion, no, no, everything like that. But the fact is in that report, and what McGahn says is that it is completely obstruction of justice, and without any doubt. So, I think that's exactly why you're seeing him not want to have him again -- show him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, let me give you the last 30 seconds because I promise to get to some of those issues. How do you get to infrastructure? And do you want immigration, which you promised Martha back in January, you wanted to get an immigration deal if you might spend the next six months, next year on impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILL",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I don't think that the two should be -- let me put one thing aside, I don't want to spend the next year on impeachment. None of us do. We want to spend the next year, two years, however, many years we're here focusing on those more important issues. The issue is that we can't leave -- we can't set aside our constitutional obligation of holding the president accountable. I mean, unfortunately, that's the oath that we took whether we like it or not. Whether it's convenient or not. And in this case, it is very much inconvenient, and the president knows it. That's why he wants us to force this into impeachment kind of process. But nonetheless, I ultimately have to live with myself at the end of the day as to whether I'm doing my job. And the American people elected me to do that job. So, we're going to work on these issues, I think that it's incredibly unfortunate that the president is frankly holding those issues hostage because he does not want the information about himself to be exposed. But we're going to continue to push for it, and hopefully, the American people will also put that pressure on him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",

    {
      "speaker": "HILL",
      "utterance": "I mean, listen, a cover-up is a cover-up. So, I think that it's a statement of fact. You know, if you -- if you want to talk about tax, I think we're well beyond that point with any of -- any of the parties that are involved. We've got issues on both sides there. But --"

Speaker Pelosi is saying -- you know, we're a co- equal branch of the government and he can't hold the government hostage, and we're going to conduct these investigations because we think these are there, there. Well, what do I wish? I wish Mrs. Pelosi hadn't had thrown gasoline on the fire, and I wish the president, et cetera. Let's just put the investigations aside for a few hours, and let's work on the project that we're here. Look, some things were about to happen that they will need to address. Pretty soon, the government's going to run out of its ability to borrow money. And they're going to have to either shut the government down again or raise the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling cannot be raised without a majority vote by both houses of Congress and the President's signature. So at some point events and the law will force the President to work with those two people out of a way from whom he walked today no matter what they're trying to do to him."

One, the Attorney General has a very unique what we call minority view of the obstruction of justice statute, and that is if you are factually innocent of the basis for the investigation, you can't possibly obstruct that investigation. The rest of the DOJ doesn't accept that but Bill Barr does. The other reason is Bill Barr's view that a sitting Attorney President of the United States cannot be indicted. If it were entirely up to Mueller and his crew, the indictments would have been voted on and sealed until the president leaves office."

      "utterance": "Well, Ed, federal prosecutors say Michael Avenatti took money that was supposed to go to Stormy Daniels for her book deal faking documents behind her back and then lied to her about where the money was. Stormy Daniels was due to receive $800,000 over four payments for her memoir full disclosure, a tell-all about her alleged affair with President Trump. According to the indictment, the money was supposed to go from the publisher, to Daniels agent who would take a fee and then sent her the rest. But Avenatti allegedly told the agent to send the book money into his account those instructions complete with what appeared to be Daniel's signature. Over several months, Avenatti allegedly stole $300,000 of Daniels money and spent it on lease payments for his Ferrari, hotels and restaurants, even payroll checks to employees at his coffee company and law firm. Daniels asked Avenatti where her late money was telling him I'm sending publisher a certified letter demanding payment and firing agent one. Then I may post it online for fun. Prosecutors say Avenatti didn't tell Daniels he already had the money but told her not to fire the agent because she would need their help to sue for the payment. On other occasions, he allegedly suggested the funds hadn't come in because of poor book sales. Avenatti told Fox News today, I look forward to a jury hearing all of the evidence and passing judgment on my conduct. At no time was any money misappropriated or mishandled. I will be fully exonerated once the relevant emails, contracts, text messages, and documents are presented. The former celebrity lawyer faces up to 69 years behind bars for wire fraud, identity theft, conspiracy, and extortion, but that's just for this case. He's facing a total of 42 counts in New York and California for allegedly extorting $20 million from Nike, stealing millions of dollars from his clients, as well as tax fraud. If he's convicted on all 42 counts, Avenatti faces a maximum possible sentence of 404 years in prison. Ed?"

Donald Trump Jr. tweeting about that today, \"Wait, with these new charges, are you saying he's no longer leading the field with 2020 Dem hopefuls.

And then when he said oh, I'm going to Iowa. I'm exploring a run for the presidency, there were hosts and anchors who took him very seriously. By the way, every time he was on, they would just run video of Stormy over him for obvious reasons. And so I think the media have a lot to answer for here.

So folks at CNN and MSNBC put him on in an endless loop, create him as a -- as a pundit if you will, and then say because you're such a big pundit, because you have such a presence, you're on cable T.V. so much you might actually run for president."

And then in addition to all this is a new Vanity Fair piece said quoting an ex- girlfriend on the record as saying that he both physically and emotionally abused her. He denies that but also telling her according to this ex- girlfriend that she shouldn't take a waitress job. He freaked out about that because she could be a future first lady if she stayed with him. But you know what the worst thing that the media did here in terms of (INAUDIBLE) it was during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings when Michael Avenatti represented the third accuser against the Supreme Court nominee, completely unsubstantiated allegations which totally blew up later and yet some news outlets took that seriously and gave him a platform for his empty promises."

They are going to be having abortions alone and without medical care. This provision also potentially victimizes girls. It says that you know longer have to record the age of -- the age of the woman or the girl seeking abortion, which as we know, sex traffickers, child sexual assault, that's how we catch them.

Our country has been divided since 1972 when Roe versus Wade was passed. And I believe that in my lifetime the only way this is going to be resolved is Roe versus Wade is going to be overturned. It's going to go back to the states because this issue is as fundamental as an issue was back in the middle of the 1800s called slavery.

McKinney's father is 33-year-old Jose Quintana, a convicted felon who was or is in this country illegally. I say was or is because we don't know his whereabouts. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE says that between 2010 and 2018, Quintana was deported three times. He would've been deported sooner, but starting in 2009, he spent 15 months in prison for assaulting Alec McKinney's mother and threatening her with a deadly weapon. In divorce papers filed by the mother in 2014, she testified that Quintana had been traveling illegally between Colorado and Mexico. His criminal history also includes kidnapping. ICE notes that, quote, \"an alien who reenters the United States after having been previously deported commits a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted.\" We know Quintana was repeatedly cut for reentering the U.S. but for some reason, he was never charged. It's also unusual that in the case of the STEM cell -- STEM school shooting, Judge Theresa Slade decided to seal the documents, even though prosecutors wanted them public and the judge failed to show any cause or compelling need for secrecy. Bullying is being looked at as a motive for the school shooting, but not the only motive. At least one of the suspects had been in therapy and had a history of legal and illegal drug use.

Because his dignity is going to be kind of hurt by virtue of being such a measly number in these polls. Again, I hope it's a signal to people in future elections, you can't just waltz in and say I will run, too. Look, the fact is, I think Biden is running better than even Joe Biden thought he would be by this point in the race. What that Quinnipiac poll did show, though, is that Trump at historically poor numbers. He is at 54 percent in May, the year before the election, saying they will absolutely not vote for him. That is 16 points more than anybody, going back to Jimmy Carter, at this point in the race May the year before the election saying they wouldn't vote for somebody."

Joe Biden has been around Washington for almost a half-century. He has been part of the problem for nearly 50 years and he hasn't fixed anything --"

In fact, \"I love Joe Biden, I think he has been wrong on most everything.\" He told Politico. And look, he is a Republican who supports President Trump, we should be fair and point that out. On the other hand, Richard, it reminds me what Bob Gates, who served a whole bunch of administrations, including Barack Obama's administration, who I believe in his memoirs who said that he thought Joe Biden was wrong about every single major foreign policy issue of the last generation or so."

People like Lindsey Graham and a lot of these people who serve in the Senate with Biden adore him and they don't agree with him on a lot of things. Certainly, the Republican senators, but I mean, it speaks to his humanity. There aren't a lot of people, frankly, who are Republican senators who say, I love Donald Trump. They are with him, but they don't respect him or love him. They may be fear him and they fear his base."
