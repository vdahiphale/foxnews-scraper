Remember, it was President Trump here at the White House in April who said, these charges that Susan Rice was involved in unmasking Trump advisers was a massive story that much of the media was ignoring. As you say now, Rice is firing back that this is an allegation that she says was made up out of whole cloth. She strongly suggests her race and gender played a role in the heat she faced, dating back to Benghazi, really. Rice, choosing to air this claim in the friendly venue of the New York magazine profile, in which the former National Security Advisor suggests other Obama aides got less scrutiny because they were white. She says at one point, \"Why me, why Jay Carney, for example, who was then our press secretary who stood up more?\" Rice asked. Rice then added she doesn't know if race and gender are the reason before, well, invoking it. \"I do not leap to the simple explanation that it's only about race and gender. I'm trying to keep my theories to myself until I'm ready to come out with them. It's not because I don't have any.\" Now, Rice left out of that, a major factor that sparked her central role in Benghazi, of course, was that she misled the public in five Sunday talk show appearances about whether in fact, it was a terror. And in terms of the unmasking of former Trump advisers like retired General Mike Flynn, the head of the National Security Agency, under oath, did not rule out recently that Rice played a role.",

The reason Susan Rice is being criticized is because she has been serially dishonest with the American people.

It continued in January when she said that Barack Obama had verifiably disarmed Syria of all of its chemical weapons, which we now know is untrue.  And then, it continued in this case when she was asked point-blank, you showed the video, she's asked point blank: do you know anything about this unmasking of Trump officials? And she said I know nothing about it. And then only later did it come out that she did know about it because she had done it. So, when you have this serial dishonesty with the American people.

And then some of the things that Republicans want that require new spending or keeping ObamaCare.

There are stark differences in the way how the GOP health care bill is being covered today versus how ObamaCare was covered eight years ago. For example, when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2009, the three major networks called it \"historic.\" When the GOP health bill passed the House last month, the same networks labeled it \"risky.\" Now, we're not saying the GOP bill is the magic potion for what ails the country, but it is also accurate to point out that ObamaCare is struggling and the numbers bear that out. In October, President Obama's own health and human services department estimated that premiums in 39 states would rise by an average of 29 percent. HHS said some states like Arizona would see rates jump 116 percent. Health pocket, which is nonpartisan consumer insurance comparison site, says nationwide, health insurance deductibles for the lowest level plans will jump 21 percent this year alone. And of course, when costs go up, insurers get out. A few weeks ago, Anthem announced it was pulling out of Ohio. And the Ohio department of insurance says that means, next year, 20 percent of the counties in the buckeye state will have zero insurers selling individual plans. But as an op-ed and the hill pointed out, quoting CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and ABC World News Tonight, we're left with the impression that ObamaCare was a popular law that was humming along.

Whether a universal basic income would replace the social safety net already provided by state and federal governments, or would supplement it is just one of the many critical aspects of this plan that arouses debate, but the concept of a guaranteed income is undeniably experiencing a revival of sorts.

With some credible projections forecasting 40 to 50 percent of all jobs in the U.S. today will be eliminated due to automation within the next 10 to 15 years. Futurists, labor market analyst, and leading CEO's are asking, what will become of all of those workers displaced by technology and whether society at large? Seeking stability in such a radically transformed economic environment, might not benefit from some orderly redistribution of wealth?

He uses this example as a way forward. He says, I'm grateful for the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who taught me that the bonds of friendship are stronger than any partisan poll. When I first joined the senate, I thought Teddy would be an adversary. Instead, we became the best of friends. Teddy and I were a case study and contradictions. He was born in privilege. I was brought up in poverty. He was an east coast liberal, I was a Reagan conservative. He was a catholic, I was a Mormon. Yet, time and again, we were able to look past our differences and find areas of agreement and forge consensus. My unlikely friendship with Ted Kennedy is a small example of what our nation can accomplish if we choose respect and comity over anger and discord. Only by doing so can we look beyond the horizon of our differences and find common ground. The rest of that piece is recommended reading tonight. That's his story. We would like to hear yours.

Remember, it was President Trump here at the White House in April who said, these charges that Susan Rice was involved in unmasking Trump advisers was a massive story that much of the media was ignoring. As you say now, Rice is firing back that this is an allegation that she says was made up out of whole cloth. She strongly suggests her race and gender played a role in the heat she faced, dating back to Benghazi, really. Rice, choosing to air this claim in the friendly venue of the New York magazine profile, in which the former National Security Advisor suggests other Obama aides got less scrutiny because they were white. She says at one point, \"Why me, why Jay Carney, for example, who was then our press secretary who stood up more?\" Rice asked. Rice then added she doesn't know if race and gender are the reason before, well, invoking it. \"I do not leap to the simple explanation that it's only about race and gender. I'm trying to keep my theories to myself until I'm ready to come out with them. It's not because I don't have any.\" Now, Rice left out of that, a major factor that sparked her central role in Benghazi, of course, was that she misled the public in five Sunday talk show appearances about whether in fact, it was a terror. And in terms of the unmasking of former Trump advisers like retired General Mike Flynn, the head of the National Security Agency, under oath, did not rule out recently that Rice played a role."

We know that there are people on both sides of the aisle who have said that the request to unmask individuals, not politically motivated, is completely appropriate. And we'll hopefully hear more on that front. But what I would say is that I don't believe this is about gender, I don't believe it's about race; I believe it's about partisanship.

The reason Susan Rice is being criticized is because she has been serially dishonest with the American people.

We know that a crime was committed here. Unlike the Russia probe, we know that a crime was committed. Mike Flynn was unmasked at Susan Rice's request and somehow, that information got him to the Washington Post. That is a crime. Now, she may not have leaked it, she said she didn't. But somehow, it made its way from her office in the West Wing, because she's not supposed to share that information, to somebody who leaked it to the Washington Post.

Second of all, in terms of what she just said, I think it's 100 percent right. I think that we have a -- I think what's shocking, quite frankly, is that our politics has descended so low that that's even a controversial statement, that the President of United States is working to advance American values. I think every president of the United States, whether they are Liberal, Conservative, Republican, Democrat, is doing their best to advance the American values as they see them. I think Barack Obama was probably the worst president our country has ever had, but I think he woke up every morning trying to do good for the country as he saw it. Same is true of Donald Trump.

And maybe, even all of branch to the other side saying, I know, he's not saying it in a way that you're comfortable with or that used to, but his heart is in the right place.

And this would be to separate this into two bills: one bill would be the spending bill that has the -- keeping ObamaCare spending and a lot of things, the moderate one; and the other bill would be more of a repeal bill. The repeal bill would be the budget reconciliation bill that only has a simple majority. The spending bill would be a bill that actually is something that many Democrats support, such as the S-CHIP program, and you put the spending requirements that many of the moderates want on one bill. And then, on the other bill, that's purely or more purely a repeal bill, you stick with repealing the taxes, the regulations, and some Medicaid reform, and it's a much more narrow repeal bill. And then some of the things that Republicans want that require new spending or keeping ObamaCare.

It will repeal a certain amount of taxes, and a certain amount of the regulations, and we'd also do some Medicaid reform. But then, there'd be a separate bill for all the people who want more spending programs. Some of the moderates in our caucus want more spending. We can put that on a bill, such as the S-CHIP, which is a bill that every Democrat in Congress typically supports. And if you separate the bills, I think you could actually get to a passage where you repeal on one bill and you actually have some of the replacement spendings on a separate bill that is one bill that Democrats would support."

We eliminate all of the mandates that mandated the people had to buy a government approved product; that's very popular. We're eliminating all of the taxes, many of which drove up the costs of ObamaCare. We're getting the decisions out of the hands of Washington and back into the hands of patients with decisions being made in the states. I would think that that is going to be very popular. And then, we make sure that with regard to Medicaid, we stabilize it in the long term for people who are most in need, also with people with pre-existing conditions.

There are stark differences in the way how the GOP health care bill is being covered today versus how ObamaCare was covered eight years ago. For example, when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2009, the three major networks called it \"historic.\" When the GOP health bill passed the House last month, the same networks labeled it \"risky.\" Now, we're not saying the GOP bill is the magic potion for what ails the country, but it is also accurate to point out that ObamaCare is struggling and the numbers bear that out. In October, President Obama's own health and human services department estimated that premiums in 39 states would rise by an average of 29 percent. HHS said some states like Arizona would see rates jump 116 percent. Health pocket, which is nonpartisan consumer insurance comparison site, says nationwide, health insurance deductibles for the lowest level plans will jump 21 percent this year alone. And of course, when costs go up, insurers get out. A few weeks ago, Anthem announced it was pulling out of Ohio. And the Ohio department of insurance says that means, next year, 20 percent of the counties in the buckeye state will have zero insurers selling individual plans. But as an op-ed and the hill pointed out, quoting CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and ABC World News Tonight, we're left with the impression that ObamaCare was a popular law that was humming along.

So when they were talking about it being historic, President Obama, if you recall, gave 53 speeches over that 16 month period, and he detailed it out and he would try to get his Democrats all to be with him. And this time, that is not actually been the case. And now the Republicans have benefited from ObamaCare at the ballot box. They won in 2010. In the congress, 14, and I think that ObamaCare, remember those rates that came out in October of 2016? So I do think the Republicans have benefited from ObamaCare failing. Now, they have to decide how they're going to sell this one. And I think that they'll probably feel like that they've talked about it a lot. But there is something about the president and his ability to reassure people and their anxiety, for example -- there's an example in my life, I see somebody a couple of times a week to work out.

And perhaps, what Mitch McConnell has done and said, I'm going to give this some breathing room, I'm going to figure out a way to get to yes before August 1st recess."

He says, Sarah Huckabee Sanders taking questions from reporters at a White House briefing. Video of this has been banned by the United States of America. I also want to put up a quote from Mike McCurry and Ari Fleischer, both former press secretaries at the White House, of course. And they wrote this in January, and very interesting. They said, we recommend the president, Trump, keep the press briefing but no longer make it a live televised event. The briefing today has become an occasion for too much posturing on both sides of the camera. The president spokesman should and must be available for questioning, especially in those days when the president schedule is not include a public appearance. Bipartisan press secretaries, Dana, saying, you don't need to do that, really."

I think that that's fine. I actually thought that the briefing was a good tool. And yeah, it's difficult and sometimes you've got to suck it up and do it because, you know, there are some showboaters in the room. But I actually think that everybody in the room, for the most part, tries their best and everyone can actually do a little bit better. These are jobs that are really wonderful. To be in the White House at the podium or in those seats, asking questions, America deserves a little better from everybody I think. Whether the videos are embargoed our life, I'm not sure it really matters. I hope the 2:00 anchor."

Following an op-ed that they ran, since retracted, that falsely linked her to the 2011 mass shootings that included former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Prior to the correction, this is how it read. The link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin's political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs. They since corrected that, in a way. So, does she have a case here? Bringing in Austan Goolsbee, former chief economist under President Obama, Charlie Hurt is political columnist for the Washington Times, and a Fox News contributor, say Charles on his bio, we call him Charlie. So welcome to you both. Austan, let me start with you. Do you think she has a case here?"

I publicly said that the New York Times editorial was a vast overstatement and that she deserves an apology. Eventually, she got one. They should have been more forthcoming with it at the beginning. But to move then to defamation, I think by the standards -- if this were defamation, then, Barack Obama, for sure, would have the grounds to sue Governor Palin for defamation for what she said about there being death panels in the ACA, or for what she said about his Hiroshima speech, that she claimed he had apologized for U.S. involvement in World War II. None of which were true. I think we all need to take a step back and recognize that in the marketplace of ideas, they're going to be people who say dumb things, offensive things, over statements like the one in this New York Times editorial. But that doesn't mean that we should engage in kind of snowflake lawsuits and say, you owe me hundreds of millions dollars because I was offended."

They didn't actually apologize to her. They retracted it and amended it, but there was never an actual apology, which might have saved them some of this lawsuit and some of this trouble perhaps. But then, there is the issue, Charlie, you know, you're a public figure, you go out there and you say all kinds of inflammatory things on both sides, do you have the ability given that reality in your life to actually sue someone when they come back at do?"

It's a political move. She's winning it very nicely. What she's trying to do is highlight the fact that the New York Times was horribly reckless with this editorial. And highlight, I think the unfairness that they show more often with Republicans than they do with Democrats. She's winning on all of that. There's purposefully a very high bar for suing public officials, especially politicians because we cherish a raucous and freewheeling press and that's a good thing. But I don't think it was a legal move. I think it was entirely designed to embarrass the New York Times and she succeeded."

No word on when President Trump will make his Disney debut. We'll keep you in suspense. We'll let you know as soon as we get more information on that breaking news story. So now, time for our back story tonight, last week, we told you about the robots that are on the rise at McDonald's, and they're likely, not the only company, definitely not the only company to be doing this, the growing trend now sparking a discussion on guaranteed income for Americans. Is that something that the country will need? Joining us now to explain, James Rosen, who I assure you is not a robot, he is a live human being, and he does not have mandatory compensation yet.

Whether a universal basic income would replace the social safety net already provided by state and federal governments, or would supplement it is just one of the many critical aspects of this plan that arouses debate, but the concept of a guaranteed income is undeniably experiencing a revival of sorts. Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, endorse the idea in his Harvard commencement address last month, and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, has spoken in favor of it twice in recent months. With some credible projections forecasting 40 to 50 percent of all jobs in the U.S. today will be eliminated due to automation within the next 10 to 15 years. Futurists, labor market analyst, and leading CEO's are asking, what will become of all of those workers displaced by technology and whether society at large? Seeking stability in such a radically transformed economic environment, might not benefit from some orderly redistribution of wealth? An additional question is whether federal agencies like DARPA, the Pentagon's advanced research projects agency should be using taxpayer funds to pursue robotics, and the very projects that will displace those taxpayers from their jobs."

He uses this example as a way forward. He says, I'm grateful for the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who taught me that the bonds of friendship are stronger than any partisan poll. When I first joined the senate, I thought Teddy would be an adversary. Instead, we became the best of friends. Teddy and I were a case study and contradictions. He was born in privilege. I was brought up in poverty. He was an east coast liberal, I was a Reagan conservative. He was a catholic, I was a Mormon. Yet, time and again, we were able to look past our differences and find areas of agreement and forge consensus. My unlikely friendship with Ted Kennedy is a small example of what our nation can accomplish if we choose respect and comity over anger and discord. Only by doing so can we look beyond the horizon of our differences and find common ground. The rest of that piece is recommended reading tonight. That's his story. We would like to hear yours. Tweet us at @thestoryFNC using the hashtag #thestory. Thanks for being with us tonight. We'll be back here tomorrow night at 7:00. We look forward to seeing you then. Tucker Carlson comes up next.
