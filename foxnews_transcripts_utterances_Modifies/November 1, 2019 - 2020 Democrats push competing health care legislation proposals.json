Former Vice President Biden weighing in, saying \"The mathematical gymnastics in this plan are all geared towards hiding a simple truth from voters. It's impossible to pay for Medicare for all without middle-class tax increases. To accomplish this sleight of hand, her proposal dramatically understates its cost, overstates its savings, inflates the revenue, and pretends that an employer payroll tax increase is something else.\" Other than that, it's fine. Let's bring in our panel, Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Jonah, this seems like the key battle as we head towards the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses in February.",

I know you said no math, but for some perspective, one million seconds is about 11 days -- 52 trillion seconds is 1,648,000 years.

That's the dishonest part about what she's doing. But there is an honest part about it, which is that Democrats do want government run health care. It was not long ago that we were told that Obamacare meant that you could keep your doctor and you could keep your health plan and this wasn't the camel's nose on the way to single payer health care, to government run health care. That wasn't true. Democrats do want this, and she is being a little more honest about how much she wants it relative to other people.",

This has got no chance, zero, of getting through. If you did a continuum of Elizabeth Warren's policies from basically impossible to she can do through executive action, this is right on the impossible side of the scale. You just saw the Speaker of the House, avowedly a liberal, Nancy Pelosi, puts herself forward as the tribune of progressivism in the House, pouring cold water all over the plan. Do you think Chuck Schumer in the Senate represents the financial sector and has a lot of business people who -- important donors to him, do you think he's going to endorse this plan?  And do you think if Elizabeth Warren does win the presidency, which she could -- she's got a very decent chance and people have to take her very seriously -- do you think that even if they flip the Senate to Democrats that a Chuck Schumer led Democratic Senate with people like Joe Manchin from West Virginia are going to support this plan? So it's never going to happen. The most interesting thing about it is Warren and Bernie Sanders -- I think Ezra Klein wrote this, and I agree with him. They're basically saying forget this idea of compromise. Forget this idea of trying to work with the insurance companies and do things in a sort of collaborative way.

To accomplish this sleight of hand, her proposal dramatically understates its cost, overstates its savings, inflates the revenue, and pretends that an employer payroll tax increase is something else.\" Other than that, it's fine. Let's bring in our panel, Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of \"The Dispatch.\" Jonah, this seems like the key battle as we head towards the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses in February."

      "utterance": "Yes. And it's preposterous. This health care plan, the bizarre thing, it's sort of like that scene in \"Jerry Maguire\" when he gets into all the trouble because he actually writes down what he's actually thinking. This thing is a pinata you can hit from any angle, but just the sheer scale of the money is mindboggling. I know you said no math, but for some perspective, one million seconds is about 11 days -- 52 trillion seconds is 1,648,000 years. It is a staggering amount of money, and to pretend that that it won't require raising tax on the middle class, to pretend that her plan is some sort of serious thing rather than just sort of a facade of something serious is an incredible insult to voters and to the journalistic class."

      "utterance": "The national debt, Mollie, is at $22 trillion and climbing. This is $52 trillion. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Right. And Jonah's right, the math is mindboggling. Even if she were to rob literally every bank in the country, she would only have a third of the amount of the money she needs. That's the dishonest part about what she's doing. But there is an honest part about it, which is that Democrats do want government run health care. It was not long ago that we were told that Obamacare meant that you could keep your doctor and you could keep your health plan and this wasn't the camel's nose on the way to single payer health care, to government run health care. That wasn't true. Democrats do want this, and she is being a little more honest about how much she wants it relative to other people."

      "utterance": "Jonathan, your thoughts? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": So the most interesting thing about this plan are the politics. This has got no chance, zero, of getting through. If you did a continuum of Elizabeth Warren's policies from basically impossible to she can do through executive action, this is right on the impossible side of the scale. You just saw the Speaker of the House, avowedly a liberal, Nancy Pelosi, puts herself forward as the tribune of progressivism in the House, pouring cold water all over the plan. Do you think Chuck Schumer in the Senate represents the financial sector and has a lot of business people who -- important donors to him, do you think he's going to endorse this plan? And do you think if Elizabeth Warren does win the presidency, which she could -- she's got a very decent chance and people have to take her very seriously -- do you think that even if they flip the Senate to Democrats that a Chuck Schumer led Democratic Senate with people like Joe Manchin from West Virginia are going to support this plan? So it's never going to happen. The most interesting thing about it is Warren and Bernie Sanders -- I think Ezra Klein wrote this, and I agree with him. They're basically saying forget this idea of compromise. Forget this idea of trying to work with the insurance companies and do things in a sort of collaborative way. They want to bulldoze over the corporations and everyone else and get this through."

The basic problem with Beto was that he more than anybody else believed his press coverage when he was running against Ted Cruz, when the national press really, really wanted to see Ted Cruz to lose. And so he actually believed he was this messianic, Robert F. Kennedy figure. And every time it was proven to him that he wasn't, he tripled and quadrupled down on his rapid onset woke dementia and went even crazier to the left. And it got no traction because he really wasn't a particularly serious candidate."

If you look at the economic changes since the president took office, GDP growth down a bit, unemployment rate down significant, consumer confidence up, hourly earnings up. You look at this picture, Jonathan, the White House has to look at it pretty positively as they start heading into the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses on the Democratic side."

He announced that they have killed the world's most wanted terrorist. You just put those economic figures out there. The impeachment hearing, I thought that vote was -- if nothing else comes out, this is now set up to be a party-line impeachment, which is the Democrats' worst nightmare. If Republicans stick together the way they did there with that signal to the Senate, Tim Morrison's testimony was a helpful -- from the White House's perspective -- a helpful counterweight to Colonel Vindman's. And then you line all that up together, things are actually looking pretty good for them."

But there is a figure in this latest \"New York Times,\" it's when you go inside the poll that it's really concerning.

As I told you earlier this week, my new book, \"Three Days at the Brink, FDR's Daring Gamble to Win World War II,\" debuted at number three on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list for combined print and e-books. Thank you for that. Saturday, I'll be at the Dallas, at the Highland Park United Methodist Church at 11:00 a.m. The reason we're there is because it's a temporary home for Interabang books which lost their store to a tornado last week here in Dallas, really levelled the store. The staff worked around the clock to try to keep up with the orders and all of the in and out and basically a virtual store. Fortunately, no one was hurt. This book signing will go on thanks to the folks at the church, at the Highland Park United Methodist Church. Thank you very much for that effort. And thank you for inviting us into your home. That is it for this \"Special Report,\" fair, balanced, and still unafraid. I'll be back in the D.C. studio Monday, back with the panel sitting there next to me. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now, with some extra time to spare, Martha.
