      "sentences": "Oh, look at that. You`re here. Welcome to the show. I`m Bruce Jenner. I kid but since Caitlyn isn`t using and I figured why not. It`s like a box seat at a ballgame if it`s empty might as well move in from the cheap seats. Anyway, but in all seriousness, you got to hand it to Caitlyn, because it took balls the size of weather balloons to criticize media darling and trans swimmer, Lia Thomas, saying biological boys should not compete against biological girls. Gender may not be on the cover of Wheaties anymore, but she should be the spokesperson for planters, because she`s got some major nuts on her. By the way, Wheaties is the worst tasting cereal ever. It makes Count Chocula tastes like a $60.00 steak. I think that`s why they put athletes on the box because no fat person would dare eat it. Now, Jenner says she has no beef with Thomas, but felt the NCAA wasn`t tough enough in allowing Thomas to compete in women`s races. And she`s right. Thomas just feed a bunch of biological girls in the 500- meter whatever. Honestly, I don`t follow it. Swimming is for people too lazy to bathe after exercising. Sorry, Trace. But in this controversy of letting biological males be biological females, there has to be a sane position to take. First, I don`t think a dude chooses to switch genders in order to beat girls in the sport that, you know, before he sucked at. Because cheating with steroids would be just much easier. But remember, as a dude, Thomas was ranked at 462, one spot ahead of a rusty anchor. And that was a chick, she`s number one. She should be the spokesperson for chlorine. Strong enough for a man but made for a woman. But I wonder if the controversy matters to her or does she try to ignore it?",

      "sentences": "OK. That`s weirdly selfish. It`s like me putting on a dress and doing The View and acting like it`s no big deal. The sad thing is I`d still be the hottest. But it also kick their butts. It`s not hard. It`s The View, they need tech support to count to 10. But it`s not about switching genders at all. That`s just a distraction. I doubt winning swim meets is the reason anyone would change their sex. Swimming is hard enough. I won`t go near a kiddie pool unless there`s a lifeguard on duty. But it`s about what you do after switching genders. It`s common sense. You might even call it common courtesy. Perhaps what Thomas is doing is a byproduct of masculine selfishness, like eating the entire pizza you were supposed to save for your spouse when she got home from work. That`s the striking part. A dude becomes a man and then kicks the crap out of girls of the sport. It`s just piggish. I mean, not many women are becoming men and doing the same thing. Or if they do they lose more often than Hillary Clinton. So the more Thomas wins as a chick, the more of a chauvinist she appears to be. I mean, you should see that even if your bangs are in your eyes. No one is saying it`s wrong for you to pursue the sport you love. But when you have a clear advantage and for some reason, you don`t care. It`s disrespectful and it`s narcissistic. But by sticking up for women, Jenner shows the respect she has for the fair sex, which seems missing with Lia, as she happily destroys the competition. And Jenner is doing it in the face of a media who condemns Caitlyn, while they desperately cling to the untenable woke position. An NBC op-ed actually compared Thomas to Jackie Robinson, which is weird. They don`t look at all alike, except maybe in size and muscle mass. Reka Gyorgy, not sure if I got that right. A Virginia Tech swimmer took issue with the NCAA rules allowing transgendered women to compete against biological females. After she missed the cut off for the constellation final in the 500 freestyles, he blamed Thomas -- Thomas`s dominance in the race. And a letter, she claimed their rules are harmful to biological females and that every event transgendered athletes competed in was one spot taken away from biological females, herself included. You know, it`s almost as though biological women should have their own league so they aren`t crushed by biological men. That`s crazy. Ron DeSantis isn`t he the commissioner of swimming or something? He`s also pretty ticked off.",

But in short, Lia crush the female competition, I`m not devastated, but then I`m not a woman who swam all her life competitively. I`m just a biological male who drinks competitively and I got the trophies and liver to prove it. Swimming is something I do when I need to pee at the beach. That`s true. I`m just warming the water for everybody else. But I`m looking at this and I can`t deny what I see. The NCAA seems weren`t interested in appearing woke that protecting its athletes. But to make this ideology work, you have to erase the distinction between trans and biological women. That means it`s not only women being erased from the record books of their own sports. They`re being erased, period. No pun intended, since men can have periods too. So, wait until the next Lia Thomas comes along and wants to play a contact sport like maybe women`s lacrosse and leaves a trail of injured women on the field. Maybe then the NCAA and their lawyers will finally say uncle, or should I say aunt?",

Because obviously transphobia is bad. I don`t doubt that Lia Thomas had to face transphobia and I think that`s wrong. Also, you mentioned the qualifications that, you know, you -- the USA swimming rules, there was new ones that were put into place not for -- not for NCAA but -- that she likely would not have qualified under those rules. So, there are legitimate reasons to have questions about this that have nothing to do with transphobia. And I think it`s bad to just blanket label. Anyone who says anything short of you go girl as transphobic, not just for the biologically female athletes, but also for people who want trans acceptance. Because there are a lot of people who have questions about this, who have concerns about this, think maybe this wasn`t fair, who are not allowed to say that. And that is not acceptance. If anything that can prevent acceptance, because it breeds a lot of resentment. It`s just fake.",

You`re going to have to take a second job to save up for that tuna sandwich. Since last March, the average price of wraps is up 18 percent. Sandwiches, 14 percent, salads, 11 percent. But who cares, right? Burgers, eight percent. Meanwhile, popular chains like Sweet Green and Potbelly have raised prices roughly six percent since the start of the year. And to save money, McDonald`s replaced special sauce with special report sauce. It`s made from Bret Baier`s aftershave. I can relate to this absurd price hike. By soup from Hale and Hardy was $17.00 yesterday. I`m not joking, which makes it far too expensive to dump on my assistant if it`s cold. It`s true.

First story, the historic Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is there, she discussed her judicial, her judicial philosophy as well as why she was defending Gitmo detainees. The second story, horny hot spring breakers wreaking havoc in Miami Beach, they`re causing so much mayhem. The city officials have actually declared a state of emergency. All right, times up. Voting is now closed. And surprise, it looks like sexy spring breakers win. Not even close. All right, so Miami Beach mayor`s issued a state of emergency because college kids are running amok. They might call in the National Guard or maybe a bigger beer bomb. The order includes a midnight to 6:00 a.m. curfew on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The city leaders hope it will quell attic control revelers along ocean drive after a string of recent shooting, likely fueled by drugs, alcohol and sex.

      "utterance": "Oh, look at that. You`re here. Welcome to the show. I`m Bruce Jenner. I kid but since Caitlyn isn`t using and I figured why not. It`s like a box seat at a ballgame if it`s empty might as well move in from the cheap seats. Anyway, but in all seriousness, you got to hand it to Caitlyn, because it took balls the size of weather balloons to criticize media darling and trans swimmer, Lia Thomas, saying biological boys should not compete against biological girls. Gender may not be on the cover of Wheaties anymore, but she should be the spokesperson for planters, because she`s got some major nuts on her. By the way, Wheaties is the worst tasting cereal ever. It makes Count Chocula tastes like a $60.00 steak. I think that`s why they put athletes on the box because no fat person would dare eat it. Now, Jenner says she has no beef with Thomas, but felt the NCAA wasn`t tough enough in allowing Thomas to compete in women`s races. And she`s right. Thomas just feed a bunch of biological girls in the 500- meter whatever. Honestly, I don`t follow it. Swimming is for people too lazy to bathe after exercising. Sorry, Trace. But in this controversy of letting biological males be biological females, there has to be a sane position to take. First, I don`t think a dude chooses to switch genders in order to beat girls in the sport that, you know, before he sucked at. Because cheating with steroids would be just much easier. But remember, as a dude, Thomas was ranked at 462, one spot ahead of a rusty anchor. And that was a chick, she`s number one. She should be the spokesperson for chlorine. Strong enough for a man but made for a woman. But I wonder if the controversy matters to her or does she try to ignore it?"

    {
      "speaker": "LIA THOMAS, AMERICAN SWIMMER",
      "utterance": "I try to ignore it as much as I can. I try to focus on my swimming. What I need to do to get ready for my races and just try to block out everything else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "OK. That`s weirdly selfish. It`s like me putting on a dress and doing The View and acting like it`s no big deal. The sad thing is I`d still be the hottest. But it also kick their butts. It`s not hard. It`s The View, they need tech support to count to 10. But it`s not about switching genders at all. That`s just a distraction. I doubt winning swim meets is the reason anyone would change their sex. Swimming is hard enough. I won`t go near a kiddie pool unless there`s a lifeguard on duty. But it`s about what you do after switching genders. It`s common sense. You might even call it common courtesy. Perhaps what Thomas is doing is a byproduct of masculine selfishness, like eating the entire pizza you were supposed to save for your spouse when she got home from work. That`s the striking part. A dude becomes a man and then kicks the crap out of girls of the sport. It`s just piggish. I mean, not many women are becoming men and doing the same thing. Or if they do they lose more often than Hillary Clinton. So the more Thomas wins as a chick, the more of a chauvinist she appears to be. I mean, you should see that even if your bangs are in your eyes. No one is saying it`s wrong for you to pursue the sport you love. But when you have a clear advantage and for some reason, you don`t care. It`s disrespectful and it`s narcissistic. But by sticking up for women, Jenner shows the respect she has for the fair sex, which seems missing with Lia, as she happily destroys the competition. And Jenner is doing it in the face of a media who condemns Caitlyn, while they desperately cling to the untenable woke position. An NBC op-ed actually compared Thomas to Jackie Robinson, which is weird. They don`t look at all alike, except maybe in size and muscle mass. Reka Gyorgy, not sure if I got that right. A Virginia Tech swimmer took issue with the NCAA rules allowing transgendered women to compete against biological females. After she missed the cut off for the constellation final in the 500 freestyles, he blamed Thomas -- Thomas`s dominance in the race. And a letter, she claimed their rules are harmful to biological females and that every event transgendered athletes competed in was one spot taken away from biological females, herself included. You know, it`s almost as though biological women should have their own league so they aren`t crushed by biological men. That`s crazy. Ron DeSantis isn`t he the commissioner of swimming or something? He`s also pretty ticked off."

      "utterance": "Now, the NCAA is basically taking efforts to destroy women`s athletics. They`re trying to undermine the integrity of the competition, and they`re crowning somebody else, the woman`s champion, and we think that`s wrong."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "So, he issued a proclamation declaring the second place finisher, Floridian Emma Weyant, the true champion. But in short, Lia crush the female competition, I`m not devastated, but then I`m not a woman who swam all her life competitively. I`m just a biological male who drinks competitively and I got the trophies and liver to prove it. Swimming is something I do when I need to pee at the beach. That`s true. I`m just warming the water for everybody else. But I`m looking at this and I can`t deny what I see. The NCAA seems weren`t interested in appearing woke that protecting its athletes. But to make this ideology work, you have to erase the distinction between trans and biological women. That means it`s not only women being erased from the record books of their own sports. They`re being erased, period. No pun intended, since men can have periods too. So, wait until the next Lia Thomas comes along and wants to play a contact sport like maybe women`s lacrosse and leaves a trail of injured women on the field. Maybe then the NCAA and their lawyers will finally say uncle, or should I say aunt?"

Because obviously transphobia is bad. I don`t doubt that Lia Thomas had to face transphobia and I think that`s wrong. Also, you mentioned the qualifications that, you know, you -- the USA swimming rules, there was new ones that were put into place not for -- not for NCAA but -- that she likely would not have qualified under those rules. So, there are legitimate reasons to have questions about this that have nothing to do with transphobia. And I think it`s bad to just blanket label. Anyone who says anything short of you go girl as transphobic, not just for the biologically female athletes, but also for people who want trans acceptance. Because there are a lot of people who have questions about this, who have concerns about this, think maybe this wasn`t fair, who are not allowed to say that. And that is not acceptance. If anything that can prevent acceptance, because it breeds a lot of resentment. It`s just fake."

You`re going to have to take a second job to save up for that tuna sandwich. Since last March, the average price of wraps is up 18 percent. Sandwiches, 14 percent, salads, 11 percent. But who cares, right? Burgers, eight percent. Meanwhile, popular chains like Sweet Green and Potbelly have raised prices roughly six percent since the start of the year. And to save money, McDonald`s replaced special sauce with special report sauce. It`s made from Bret Baier`s aftershave. I can relate to this absurd price hike. By soup from Hale and Hardy was $17.00 yesterday. I`m not joking, which makes it far too expensive to dump on my assistant if it`s cold. It`s true.

First story, the historic Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is there, she discussed her judicial, her judicial philosophy as well as why she was defending Gitmo detainees. The second story, horny hot spring breakers wreaking havoc in Miami Beach, they`re causing so much mayhem. The city officials have actually declared a state of emergency. All right, times up. Voting is now closed. And surprise, it looks like sexy spring breakers win. Not even close. All right, so Miami Beach mayor`s issued a state of emergency because college kids are running amok. They might call in the National Guard or maybe a bigger beer bomb. The order includes a midnight to 6:00 a.m. curfew on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The city leaders hope it will quell attic control revelers along ocean drive after a string of recent shooting, likely fueled by drugs, alcohol and sex.
