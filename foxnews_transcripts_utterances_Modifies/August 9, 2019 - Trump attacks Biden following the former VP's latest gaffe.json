Number one, there is obvious. There could be a chemical in there. Likely (inaudible), but it could happen and it's worthy enough that we shouldn't do. But secondly, their equipment is electronic. Their radios, some of their equipment -- has anybody thought of this? If you can dump water on cops, you can render a lot of their communications gear completely infective. Why would any sane person -- and I just say that and I thought (inaudible) cop story really pisses me off. You know, I say to anyone who objects to this, you know, get your butts out of the chair and get your butt in a uniform or go do a ride along with a cop one day and see the crap they have to deal with.

It's not just water, and we think that's harmless, it's not. Some of us who've been hit by a water bottle know it's not harmless. But they are also throwing rocks and concrete. So, this is clearly a crime. They've arrested some people. The question is, before Albany is, will these individuals be charged with a felony? And some of the Democrats oppose the, whatever, the sentence. They want it to be a misdemeanor. But the bottom line this is wrong, people! This is wrong. These are men and women that we pay to protect us, to be there when we need them. Not to throw water or concrete or bottles. So please, lighten up. Do not do this. This is bad.
