It never ends!\" The something he was working on, this executive order. The question is, what that does and where does it leave the legislation going forward.  Let's bring in our panel: Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president. Mara, the question is whether this executive order will stay about whether the judge will allow the altering of what was a decision.",

You had a policy that was very important to the policy, this zero tolerance policy, but it implemented in such a way that it left confusion and led to missed messages, and then led again to the president doing another policy, just like he did with the travel ban, that is likely to be challenged in court. Trump found himself on the wrong end of a 70-30 issue. But now the problem is for the Democrats, because separating families may be unpopular. Zero tolerance, however, is relatively popular.

And so by embracing action to take a -- Trump has done his part, what he can. It might not hold up. But the Republicans, if they say we are for keeping these families together, I think that puts the Democrats on the defensive."

You had the administration acting -- there wasn't any compassion coming from the administration, any of the officials there, and on the other side you had all emotion coming from Democrats and liberals. Trump, he hates to show weakness. This is the last thing he wanted to do. So the fact that he turned around and did it in such a quick timeframe shows you just how much pressure he was under and what a losing issue he thinks it's going to be. But he's going to keep pushing immigration, I think. Strong border, he's going to want the wall. He's going to push that all the way through November because he thinks that's a winning issue for his base."

In Peter Doocy's report earlier, we used a picture purportedly showing a child in a cage as part of the uproar over children separated from their parents along the border. We are told this picture is taken out of context. It was in fact staged as part of a protest for detentions. And we apologize for the error that ended up in that piece.
