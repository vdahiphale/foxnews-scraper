They're going to have hearings.  They are going to mark up a bill. And we will continue to advocate for the biggest reforms and the biggest reductions that we can possibly get. At the end of the day, the president doesn't get to make law. The House and the Senate do. So, we will be working with them, as we have, to try and get the best possible package that can pass. I just think what's being lost is how many things we agree on at this point in the tax policy. That two- or three- pager that the big six put out a couple of weeks ago was actually quite noteworthy in the number of places that we agreed on, and things that, for example, the border adjustment tax was out of the picture at that point. We all agree to try and get corporate rates down as much as we possibly can. So, I think it's better to start focusing on what we agree on and not the things that might divide us.

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Don't worry. I'm not going to dodge your question. I'm going to tee that up and then say this. Look, there's going to be time -- every time you reduce taxes on the middle class, you also by definition reduce taxes on the upper class, because the folks who pay taxes at that higher rate also pay taxes at that middle-class rate as they move up our progressive system."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "True."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Balance that against some of the proposals that we have talked about previously, such as getting rid of the deduction for state and local income taxes. If you live in a high-tax state, if you in New York, New York City, if you live in California, you could see your tax bill go up fairly dramatically. So, I don't think it's fair to say that everyone is going to be treated this way, everyone is going to pay higher taxes, everyone is going to pay lower taxes. The middle class, absolutely, those taxes are going down. Corporations, yes, taxes are going down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But even if you're in the middle class and you're in those high-tax states, you would be affected by that. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "You could. And, again, that's part of this discussion. That's why I think what you are seeing is the right way to handle it. It's not a precooked bill. It's not coming down from the mountain and saying, look, here's the tax plan. We are going to work with all of the folks in Congress. Keep in mind all of the people we just talked about have representation on the Hill. And those folks are going to represent the folks back home to the best of their ability. And, together, together, we come up with the best tax plan we can pass."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you think it will pass by the end of the year and that it will be retroactive to the beginning of the year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "I do. In fact, when I think it passes -- secondly, yes, if it passes by the end of the year, it will be retroactive. But as to the first question, I do. And I think, in mid-December, when the tax bill passes, people will look back at what the president did this week and say, you know what? Maybe he was right, cutting that deal in September was a big part of getting these taxes before the end of the year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you know whether the president is genuinely annoyed at Republicans in the aggregate, the leadership, and that's why he's reaching across the aisle, because he's fed up with them? I just read into what he did with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on this debt thing as a sign, I'm sick of you guys."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "I will answer half your question, which is, is he annoyed with the Republican leadership?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think he probably he is. And, believe me, as a Republican, so am I. As a citizen, I am, too. I was promised that they would have repealed and replaced Obamacare by now. I'm a voter. I have a member of Congress. I have a senator. I not only made those promises to people for the last seven years when I was running for office. People made them to me. And I was disappointed and somewhat annoyed that we haven't followed through on that promise. I don't think that's an unnatural reaction at all. And to the extent the president was annoyed by that, I think he's simply reflecting the opinion of many of the people in the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Are you worried that he might be losing friends if he's embracing the Democrats who aren't keen on him and Republicans who feel that he always picks on them, that he's going to be last man standing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Face it. Any self-respecting Republican worth his or her salt is probably annoyed at the party as well. Not being able to follow through on the major promise is a major problem for us, and they need to fix it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right."
