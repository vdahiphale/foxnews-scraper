      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY. We begin with this FOX News alert.  All right. Tonight, the deadline for Georgia's recount is less than three  hours away. Still at this hour, voters in the Peach State have more  questions than answers and thousands of uncounted ballots, most of which were cast for President Trump, they've just been turning up all week.  Fayette County, 2,755 ballots just unearthed. Another 284 were discovered in Walton County. This all in addition to the 2,600 uncounted ballots in  Floyd County that were discovered just a couple of days ago. If you're   keeping track, that's over 5,600 uncounted votes located in the past week, two weeks later. Now, in a state with a razor-thin margin of now just over 12,000, that is a   serious problem. Always want to have faith, trust, confidence in our election system. But the issues in Georgia don't end there. One county, a purported human  error during the recount, might have given thousands of extra votes to Joe   Biden if not for one extremely attentive observer. According to Georgia's Republican Party chairman, it was a 9,000-vote  discrepancy that was signed off by two officials in DeKalb County, Georgia, and would not have been discovered but for the Republican observer. Well,  we didn't have observers that most of the states that's -- whose legal  statutory language says you can have one. Yet another perfect example why election observers are critical if we want  free and fair elections in this country. But in almost every state where   the law guarantees partisan observers, the right to watch the votes start to finish and the vote count, the law was never followed. State after state, we saw partisan observers blocked from performing their important  legal duty and their right to do and what was a clear violation of law,  many observers were reportedly only admitted to monitor poll workers -- let's see, 6 feet, 20 feet, 100 feet.   Let's say you have perfect 20/20 vision. Catch a mathematical error in fine print from six, 20, or 100 feet away. Impossible.  Now, this was one of the many serious issues in the all-important swing  state also of Michigan. According to numerous now sworn affidavits in Wayne County, quote, allegations include workers coaching people on how to vote, peeking at the ballots to see how people voted before processing them, and   preventing Republican poll inspectors from being able to effectively watch  the counting process. And last night, because of all these irregularities and accusations of  fraud, well, there were two Republicans on the county's board of canvassers  that said, you know what, we can't justify certifying the election result. That is, until -- well, they did that and they were called racist. Families  threatened. They were outing where their kids went to school and during a public, you   know, comment period, all on a Zoom call -- you can't make this up. Take a  look.",

      "sentences": "We could just replay their four years of craziness -- are they that out of touch with who they really are? Fake, phony, faint selective outrage, pretty much something to behold.  Sean Davis, \"Federalist\" rights on Twitter: Democrats, the media accused Georgia W. Bush of stealing the election that he was involved in in 2000. They spread a conspiracy theory, Bush was involved in 9/11. They accused Bush of intentionally lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, claiming electronic voting machines stole the election for Bush in '04. That was Democrats. And, of course, they spread the hoax that President Trump was a Russian  agent. They spread those lies and slander for, what, three straight years. Justice Kavanaugh pretty much called a rapist and everything in between. They said violent riots in the summer were peaceful. Remember the banner from fake new CNN? Fiery but mostly peaceful protests. That was the background. Take a look at that. They accused Republicans, especially President Trump, Nazis, you know the names they say.  And let me add, by the way, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, still has not conceded her gubernatorial race in Georgia from 2018. Loved by the Democrats and the media. Now, the president wants to take a few weeks, count every legal vote, investigate every claim of fraud and abuse, and the media acts like the world is ending. Obviously, with amnesia the last four years. They don't care about the thousands of previously uncounted votes we're  discovering just this week in Georgia. They don't care about the two men charged in California. Why? Submitting 8,000 ballot applications for fake or dead voters. Don't seem to care about the impending possible recounts in Wisconsin after allegations over voter fraud they are carried by election officials in two heavily Democratic counties. In fact, breaking tonight, Democrats are trying to change -- get this --  the state's recount rules in Wisconsin to actually make it more difficult to review mail in ballots, after the vote. Clearly, they don't care about the validity of any of those ballots. They don't care about partisan election observers blocked from polling locations. They don't care about the chaos causing widespread made in voting, and by the way mail-in voting. And they don't care about outdated voter rolls and the lack of voter ID.  And that leaves states vulnerable to fraud and to abuse and how can anyone have confidence in any of this? They don't care about security, they don't care about the accuracy of voting machines that they themselves and \"The New York Times\" and Princeton professors, and the \"A.P.\", all criticized. They don't care about any of it because they got the result they wanted. And for them, that's all that matters. Now, the left in this country, they are not valuing freedom, fairness,  truth, equal justice, or the rule of law. We watched that for four straight years. What they want is power and, of course, to slander Donald Trump every second of every day. By the way, the coming weeks and months, you know, fundamentally could alter this country, our way of life. All right. Here with the very latest, of what's going on in his varying states, Kayleigh McEnany.  So, let's start with Georgia again today, so we have three counties where, oh, magically, this week, we find all these votes. Now I guess then we have the verification signature double standard. We've talked at length about that. And then what's the latest on the ground there?",

And this is going to back up your point, who went to the polls and said, I'm here to vote in person and they were told, oh, wait, you already voted by mail. Well, they never requested a mail-in vote, nor did they ever return a mail- in vote and they cast up provisional vote in that instance in their vote was never counted. This is why you need poll watchers to verify that that mail-in vote is actually the person whose name is attached to it. It's why having poll observers a football field away, as they proceed to count 627,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It's such a travesty.",

This election, 240,000 people did that, presumably using COVID and fears of COVID as an excuse. So, it's a way to circumvent voter ID. But at the very top of your question, you hit a key point, Sean. You have - - we filed this recount -- excuse me, the recount petition and in it, we alleged that we need to see the absentee voter applications because it's an important aspect of Wisconsin law and they weren't doing these applications, they were just giving people ballots. And as we speak right now, you have the election board trying to change the way the recount laws work to make sure that we're not able to count those applications for absentee ballots because they see just how strong this petition is.

You wouldn't know it by our election systems because they now represent a train wreck, but only in certain states. So how do you fix it? How do we count every legal vote in a fast, secure, verifiable way like they do in Florida and Ohio? How do we prevent fraud, abuse, changing laws after the game is played? Because we the American people, you deserve better than the chaos that we see. And we've been watching unfold now over the past two weeks. Congressman Jim Jordan will be here with some news on that in a minute.

According to the report, quote: These new records confirm the connections between the Biden family and communist Chinese government, as well as the links between Hunter Biden's business associates and the Russian government and further support the committee's September 23rd, 2020 report and their findings that such relationships created counterintelligence and extortion concerns.

And that is only exacerbated by a system that reduces the ability to have real-time verification like a human being standing there actually voting and I do predict that if the Democrats get more power in Washington, they'll do everything they can to try to keep that power by eroding the integrity of the votes. Jim and I will have a role to play fighting back against that, but so do state legislatures and secretaries of state and chief election officials, we need them to buck up and realize that our democracy is at stake.",

So, full disclosure, I am deeply involved. Let's not kid ourselves. This is a real race. Biden won the state of Georgia, so Republicans can't take it for granted. Democrats demographics change. The state is changing, particularly the Atlanta area. It's different than when you lived there. It's increasingly people from out of, younger people, more liberal people. Stacey Abrams, she has spent -- say what you will about her -- she spent tens of millions of other people's money to build up a giant GOTV machine and it's revved up and going in the votes start on December 7th when you can mail in ballots. And then Chuck Schumer, he wants to -- he has spent every -- think about this, spent $84 million to try and defeat Lindsey Graham. Spent ungodly month of money, similar amount of money to defeat Mitch McConnell. You don't think is going to pour money into the state? So, those are the advantages the Democrats have. On the other hand, we got some advantages. Purdue with 87,000 votes ahead of Jon Ossoff and the rest -- and only failed to get 50 percent because there was a libertarian candidate. Libertarians are not going to come out and vote for the socialist, let me tell you that. We got Republicans in the jungle primary. The Republican candidates outnumber the Democratic candidates and the winner of the Democrat sweepstakes there, Raphael Warnock, ran behind what people anticipated he would run. Best advantage -- these Democrats are on the left, particularly Warnock. This guys like -- you can't serve God and the military? If you're in the military, you can't serve God? I mean, socialism is getting a bad word, as a youth minister, hosted Fidel Castro. As a minister in Atlanta, hosted Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and then when his anti-Semitic comments came out, defended him. This guy is a lefty in favor of any nostra in the Bernie Sanders playbook. And then GOTV. Both these candidates, David Perdue, whom you just saw, and Kelly Loeffler both understand GOVT, they are building a state of the art, get out the vote operation using lots of Georgians and plenty of volunteers coming in from outside of the state. And then, finally, the argument that Senator Perdue laid out. The only way to rein in the excesses of a Democratic White House and the Democratic House of Representatives is to have a Republican Senate. He put it right. This is the last line of defense for conservative values. If we don't control -- have a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, then they are going to have come as you said earlier, a clear path to this nutty agenda, get rid of the 60 vote rule, and pass every nutty nostrum and lock in a governing Democratic left majority for decades to come.

      "utterance": "And welcome to HANNITY. We begin with this FOX News alert. All right. Tonight, the deadline for Georgia's recount is less than three hours away. Still at this hour, voters in the Peach State have more questions than answers and thousands of uncounted ballots, most of which were cast for President Trump, they've just been turning up all week. Fayette County, 2,755 ballots just unearthed. Another 284 were discovered in Walton County. This all in addition to the 2,600 uncounted ballots in Floyd County that were discovered just a couple of days ago. If you're keeping track, that's over 5,600 uncounted votes located in the past week, two weeks later. Now, in a state with a razor-thin margin of now just over 12,000, that is a serious problem. Always want to have faith, trust, confidence in our election system. But the issues in Georgia don't end there. One county, a purported human error during the recount, might have given thousands of extra votes to Joe Biden if not for one extremely attentive observer. According to Georgia's Republican Party chairman, it was a 9,000-vote discrepancy that was signed off by two officials in DeKalb County, Georgia, and would not have been discovered but for the Republican observer. Well, we didn't have observers that most of the states that's -- whose legal statutory language says you can have one. Yet another perfect example why election observers are critical if we want free and fair elections in this country. But in almost every state where the law guarantees partisan observers, the right to watch the votes start to finish and the vote count, the law was never followed. State after state, we saw partisan observers blocked from performing their important legal duty and their right to do and what was a clear violation of law, many observers were reportedly only admitted to monitor poll workers -- let's see, 6 feet, 20 feet, 100 feet. Let's say you have perfect 20/20 vision. Catch a mathematical error in fine print from six, 20, or 100 feet away. Impossible. Now, this was one of the many serious issues in the all-important swing state also of Michigan. According to numerous now sworn affidavits in Wayne County, quote, allegations include workers coaching people on how to vote, peeking at the ballots to see how people voted before processing them, and preventing Republican poll inspectors from being able to effectively watch the counting process. And last night, because of all these irregularities and accusations of fraud, well, there were two Republicans on the county's board of canvassers that said, you know what, we can't justify certifying the election result. That is, until -- well, they did that and they were called racist. Families threatened. They were outing where their kids went to school and during a public, you know, comment period, all on a Zoom call -- you can't make this up. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "We could just replay their four years of craziness -- are they that out of touch with who they really are? Fake, phony, faint selective outrage, pretty much something to behold. Sean Davis, \"Federalist\" rights on Twitter: Democrats, the media accused Georgia W. Bush of stealing the election that he was involved in in 2000. They spread a conspiracy theory, Bush was involved in 9/11. They accused Bush of intentionally lying about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, claiming electronic voting machines stole the election for Bush in '04. That was Democrats. And, of course, they spread the hoax that President Trump was a Russian agent. They spread those lies and slander for, what, three straight years. Justice Kavanaugh pretty much called a rapist and everything in between. They said violent riots in the summer were peaceful. Remember the banner from fake new CNN? Fiery but mostly peaceful protests. That was the background. Take a look at that. They accused Republicans, especially President Trump, Nazis, you know the names they say. And let me add, by the way, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, still has not conceded her gubernatorial race in Georgia from 2018. Loved by the Democrats and the media. Now, the president wants to take a few weeks, count every legal vote, investigate every claim of fraud and abuse, and the media acts like the world is ending. Obviously, with amnesia the last four years. They don't care about the thousands of previously uncounted votes we're discovering just this week in Georgia. They don't care about the two men charged in California. Why? Submitting 8,000 ballot applications for fake or dead voters. Don't seem to care about the impending possible recounts in Wisconsin after allegations over voter fraud they are carried by election officials in two heavily Democratic counties. In fact, breaking tonight, Democrats are trying to change -- get this -- the state's recount rules in Wisconsin to actually make it more difficult to review mail in ballots, after the vote. Clearly, they don't care about the validity of any of those ballots. They don't care about partisan election observers blocked from polling locations. They don't care about the chaos causing widespread made in voting, and by the way mail-in voting. And they don't care about outdated voter rolls and the lack of voter ID. And that leaves states vulnerable to fraud and to abuse and how can anyone have confidence in any of this? They don't care about security, they don't care about the accuracy of voting machines that they themselves and \"The New York Times\" and Princeton professors, and the \"A.P.\", all criticized. They don't care about any of it because they got the result they wanted. And for them, that's all that matters. Now, the left in this country, they are not valuing freedom, fairness, truth, equal justice, or the rule of law. We watched that for four straight years. What they want is power and, of course, to slander Donald Trump every second of every day. By the way, the coming weeks and months, you know, fundamentally could alter this country, our way of life. All right. Here with the very latest, of what's going on in his varying states, Kayleigh McEnany. So, let's start with Georgia again today, so we have three counties where, oh, magically, this week, we find all these votes. Now I guess then we have the verification signature double standard. We've talked at length about that. And then what's the latest on the ground there?"

So how good is that recount is the president has noted?"

What I'm trying to understand, if the law says clearly, partisan observers get to see the vote counting start to finish and they're not allowed to see it in the law is not followed, then you're never going to have the confidence that the law was meant to instill, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Sean, that's exactly right. And in particular, in a place like Pennsylvania, I was contacted today, I found out about a few cases and there are declarations that support this, that there were multiple individuals in a state like Pennsylvania. And this is going to back up your point, who went to the polls and said, I'm here to vote in person and they were told, oh, wait, you already voted by mail. Well, they never requested a mail-in vote, nor did they ever return a mail- in vote and they cast up provisional vote in that instance in their vote was never counted. This is why you need poll watchers to verify that that mail-in vote is actually the person whose name is attached to it. It's why having poll observers a football field away, as they proceed to count 627,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It's such a travesty."

I had a long discussion, Reince Priebus will be on the program tomorrow, that the election committee and admissions committee is trying to change the rules to review absentee ballots, trying to change it in terms of showing the actual application, which the rule calls for. They're trying to do it now at this late date, which means -- uh-oh, that means they sensed trouble. People claimed they were indefinitely confined. That went up like three or fourfold from the last election. Clerks then allowed people to vote early apparently and vote absentee early, which the law doesn't allow also. Is that all going on? Is that all proven?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. So we filed this petition in Wisconsin for a recount into counties. It's exactly as you described it. One of those counts says in the state of Wisconsin, if you are indefinitely confined, you can cast an absentee ballot without showing voter ID. Last election, 72,000 people did that. This election, 240,000 people did that, presumably using COVID and fears of COVID as an excuse. So, it's a way to circumvent voter ID. But at the very top of your question, you hit a key point, Sean. You have - - we filed this recount -- excuse me, the recount petition and in it, we alleged that we need to see the absentee voter applications because it's an important aspect of Wisconsin law and they weren't doing these applications, they were just giving people ballots. And as we speak right now, you have the election board trying to change the way the recount laws work to make sure that we're not able to count those applications for absentee ballots because they see just how strong this petition is. We'll see how they vote. It will probably come down during your program."

You wouldn't know it by our election systems because they now represent a train wreck, but only in certain states. So how do you fix it?

I mean, for goodness sake, Georgia just found three counties where they hadn't even counted thousands of votes in 60 days after the election. So, ranking member Comer and I today first call for an investigation. We sent a letter to Mr. Nadler and Chairwoman Maloney. Why don't you guys investigate? The committees aren't even meeting this week. Why not? Why not look into this? So that to me is the fundamental question. These same Democrats who told us that the rioters and the looters all summer long were peaceful protesters are now the same ones telling us we can trust the vote when everything shows all the problems, Kayleigh just went through `em all. Let's look at that information and when it comes to the Tony Bobulinski and the hunter Biden story, Bill Barr should name a special counsel. That simple, name a special counsel to look into that situation."

We all deserve elections where we don't have people voting in more than one state. We don't have people voting after they changed their address. And the scale is now reaching some significance. In Georgia, these mistakes aren't in the tens or hundreds of votes. They are in the thousands of votes. Maybe we have to put the people who ran Operation Warp Speed in charge of counting the ballots in Georgia, they'd be able to get us a result by now. But here's the thing, Sean -- if we can flip Georgia by showing that there was not accurate counting there, then I think it pulls back the whole veneer that the media and others --"

So, when you get to moving well beyond that, we have an expectation that there could be other errors that literally could flip the outcome in Georgia and once Georgia flips, we got a lot of questions about Pennsylvania, whether it's the spike in 90-year-olds, more of them registering in the last year to vote than in the prior four years combined, including two election years. I think that when we really dig into the circumstantial data and the real data, we will find out that there was ballot laundering going on here and when you pair that with a lack of observation, it really raises more questions. Observation of ballots should not be a game of hide and seek, right? You shouldn't have to be 100 feet away trying to engage in a signature match. This ought to be precise and it ought to be clear and we're getting anything from precision and clarity out of Georgia, and Pennsylvania in particular right now."

That is enough time for us to look what happens and see what happens in the legal cases, see what happens with the recounts, with the audits. And in Georgia, you've had three counties. There are 156 other counties in the state of Georgia. You've got a secretary of state that obviously doesn't know what he's doing. Frankly, I think Doug Collins should challenge the secretary of state and run against him in two years. I think that would be better for the state of Georgia and better for the whole country, so let's let the process play out. Let's let -- let's let the law, the process, and the Constitution work exactly like it's supposed to, let's get to the bottom of all this, as Matt said, for the good of the country, for the good of this election, for the good of the United States of America.

Like when we all showed up at the town center, at the local elementary school and voted in person, we know the results of the election that night and if it was super close, maybe early the next morning. But now as Democrats have separated the verification process from the voting process, we start to see these irregularities like in Wayne County where there are concerns that there are more cast ballots than there are actual voters. And that is only exacerbated by a system that reduces the ability to have real-time verification like a human being standing there actually voting and I do predict that if the Democrats get more power in Washington, they'll do everything they can to try to keep that power by eroding the integrity of the votes. Jim and I will have a role to play fighting back against that, but so do state legislatures and secretaries of state and chief election officials, we need them to buck up and realize that our democracy is at stake."

That means four Democratic senators and Democratic Senate in perpetuity, a packed Supreme Court, abolishing the Electoral College, end of legislative filibuster. Tonight, we're learning even more about the extremism of this new crop of Georgia Democrats. For example, Senator Perdue's opponent, Jon Ossoff, is still trying, out promoting the app TikTok despite partisan concerns about national security involved in the Chinese communist party. Not only that, but Qatar-owned Al Jazeera paid thousands to Ossoff's media company, according to records. Two pretty radical, extreme socialist Democrats, reliable votes for Biden and Kamala Harris, or rubber-stamp Chuck Schumer's agenda. That's pretty much what's at stake and raise taxes, open your borders, abolish fossil fuel, pack the court and end us -- put us into bankruptcy. Here to explain, Georgia Senator David Perdue.

We are in the fight of our lives here. This is -- we are the last line of defense in Georgia. That's what makes every vote count right now in this. If we win Georgia, we save America. But, right now, we are in the process of trying to find out. We just found a few thousand votes that have disappeared for the last week and a half that just showed up and now, President Trump is within 10,000 votes of Biden in Georgia, and I'm right now 10,000 -- even though I won by two points, I'm still about 10,000 votes away from the 50 percent margin that you have to get in Georgia or go into this nine-week runoff."

It's our job to make sure that the people of Georgia know just what's at stake. But we know what the Democrats want to do. You've just highlighted most of it. But they want illegal immigrants to vote. They want to defund the police. They want to take away our private health insurance and they want to stack the courts. That's not what our government has always been about. It's been about checks and balances. And what Schumer said the other day, he said, we win Georgia, we change America. AOC said, look, we're all about -- we want to win those two seats because we do not want to negotiate. She wants the Green New Deal without compromise. And so, we've got to make sure that people in Georgia turn out again. If we do, we win. We've already beaten the Democrats, 52.5 percent, Sean, of Georgia voters rejected this liberal left move that the Democrats are trying to perpetrate, and I think that's a big sign that nobody is talking about."

We know there are in proprieties in Georgia and they are being investigated right now. What we are trying to do is make sure that those same opportunities for impropriety are not there for the January 5th election. I mean, this is what -- we've got to convince people that their vote is going to be counted and it's going to be accounted for accurately. And so, that's the biggest thing. Our job right now is to make sure that the base gets out and votes and knows how important this is. Look, this is the fight of our lives, Sean. As you said over and over this week, if we lose these seats, we may not get another shot at this because Schumer will get a perpetual majority, and we won't be able to break through their when he adds two new states and four new Democratic seats.

So, full disclosure, I am deeply involved. Let's not kid ourselves. This is a real race. Biden won the state of Georgia, so Republicans can't take it for granted. Democrats demographics change. The state is changing, particularly the Atlanta area. It's different than when you lived there. It's increasingly people from out of, younger people, more liberal people. Stacey Abrams, she has spent -- say what you will about her -- she spent tens of millions of other people's money to build up a giant GOTV machine and it's revved up and going in the votes start on December 7th when you can mail in ballots. And then Chuck Schumer, he wants to -- he has spent every -- think about this, spent $84 million to try and defeat Lindsey Graham. Spent ungodly month of money, similar amount of money to defeat Mitch McConnell. You don't think is going to pour money into the state? So, those are the advantages the Democrats have. On the other hand, we got some advantages. Purdue with 87,000 votes ahead of Jon Ossoff and the rest -- and only failed to get 50 percent because there was a libertarian candidate. Libertarians are not going to come out and vote for the socialist, let me tell you that. We got Republicans in the jungle primary. The Republican candidates outnumber the Democratic candidates and the winner of the Democrat sweepstakes there, Raphael Warnock, ran behind what people anticipated he would run. Best advantage -- these Democrats are on the left, particularly Warnock. This guys like -- you can't serve God and the military? If you're in the military, you can't serve God? I mean, socialism is getting a bad word, as a youth minister, hosted Fidel Castro. As a minister in Atlanta, hosted Reverend Jeremiah Wright, and then when his anti-Semitic comments came out, defended him. This guy is a lefty in favor of any nostra in the Bernie Sanders playbook. And then GOTV. Both these candidates, David Perdue, whom you just saw, and Kelly Loeffler both understand GOVT, they are building a state of the art, get out the vote operation using lots of Georgians and plenty of volunteers coming in from outside of the state. And then, finally, the argument that Senator Perdue laid out. The only way to rein in the excesses of a Democratic White House and the Democratic House of Representatives is to have a Republican Senate. He put it right. This is the last line of defense for conservative values. If we don't control -- have a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, then they are going to have come as you said earlier, a clear path to this nutty agenda, get rid of the 60 vote rule, and pass every nutty nostrum and lock in a governing Democratic left majority for decades to come. So, money marbles and chalk as we say in Texas."

But she is now the supposedly nonpartisan voter registration get out the vote effort and put it into a partisan context. There were all kind of problems with that. But the Republicans are going to have a good machine to get out the vote, but you put your finger on it. How do people feel? Are people going to say, you know what, I voted for Donald Trump, he didn't win reelection, he didn't carry our state, I'm staying home, or do they say, I voted for Donald Trump because I believed in a conservative agenda and I want that agenda advanced, I don't want it demolished, I don't want what he has done an office to be -- you know, the tax cuts, the policy put in place, the conservative judges -- I don't want that wiped out and I'm going to turn out and vote?

California's famous French laundry restaurant. Never heard of it. No masks, no social distancing, elbow to elbow and it gets worse because of the same dinner where California Medical Association officials -- you can't make this up -- which exposes all the rampant hypocrisy even more, but they want you to think about no Thanksgiving. Over in Pennsylvania, far left Governor Tom Wolf now ordering ridiculous new rules requiring masks in your home, when people from other household are gathered. California Senator Dianne Feinstein, she was seen on Capitol Hill -- oh, my gosh, -- without her mask. Ask yourself, why is it that the decision-makers, those who are supposed to be the experts are, well, defying their own rules for us only? Totally okay imposing draconian lockdowns, breaking their own COVID restrictions, and it's way past time that they are held accountable. But also tonight, more good news in the race for that vaccine. Pfizer now says it's vaccine candidate shows a 95 percent efficacy rate and plans to formally request emergency authorization within days, thankfully.

So, you have the top medical officials disagreeing about what the guidelines are. And in New York, you've got Cuomo saying the schools are not going to be shut down. You got de Blasio saying they are in Donald Trump has not given us clear guidelines. These guys are clueless and as you pointed out, Dr. Fauci as late as March 8th was talking about doubting the effectiveness of masks and Donald Trump is accused of -- Carl Bernstein said homicidal negligence, that the blood of a quarter of a million Americans are on his hands, when you have all these Democrats who are confused giving us inconsistent advice and not following their own guidelines.

In their latest stunt, a petition reportedly circulating at Harvard seeking to ban all former Trump administration officials from attending, teaching, or even speaking at the university. Meanwhile, Democrats continue to fight amongst themselves following major house losses, but as Utah Republican Congressman-elect Burgess Owen recently said, the Democratic Party's pivot to the far left is what ultimately hurt his opponent in his swing district. Joining us now, Congressman-elect Burgess Owens and Trump 2020 director of press communications, Erin Perrine. Burgess, number one, I think my endorsement tipped the balance, I don't know.

      "utterance": "No, they wouldn't want to talk about it. Why would they? Because it doesn't fit their narrative, it doesn't fit who they believe Trump supporters are or who Republicans are. You have an incredible incoming freshman member of Congress, and every Democrat that was unseated in the House of Representatives in this election was done so by either a Republican woman, a minority, or a veteran, or a veteran of the Super Bowl, as well. We talk about the incredible incoming class on the fact Democrats and some in the mainstream media want to try to silence us, it's no wonder Harvard is trying to have students say that we shouldn't be there. If it's up to them or AOC with a list, personally threatening text messages I received my phone, they don't like what they see in the Republican Party because it's not what they expected under Donald Trump. They want to silence that success. Unfortunately, they're not going to be able to do that. We're not going to be intimidated. If they want to try to launch fireworks at our people, or sucker punch them at a peaceful protests, or shut us down on TV, we're going to stand strong in the fact that Donald Trump delivered a booming economy, multiple vaccines for the coronavirus, a better America now than ever before. And it's too bad for them that they felt so left behind that they thought this was the Republican Party they could put in one corner, and every time they turn around, we're a bigger, better, more inclusive party, because of Donald Trump and the incredible Republican leadership, not only in the Senate, but in the House with the incoming -- well, hopefully, someday speaker -- Kevin McCarthy."

And also with record low unemployment for African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans, you see this dramatic increase in the vote among these demographics for the -- really, for Donald Trump. I wouldn't even argue for the Republican Party. What does that tell you, what is now the future?"

    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "The future is going to be great for our country, because what the left doesn't understand is the DNA of the American people. We don't like bullies, we don't like cowards, we don't like being attacked for trying to be free, and Americans are waking up. This last election, with so many more millions of people saying this is the way to go, and we are not going to stand by and let these guys -- take us in a different direction. So, I'm excited about what will happen coming in. And this freshman class, Sean, is going to be remarkable. Just get ready for a remarkable, powerful, patriotic class coming aboard."

Love Georgia. \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" at the end of '96 said, 1996 was a great year, the Olympics came and Hannity left. I was coming to FOX News. Anyway. There is a lot at stake, and you're going to have an opportunity to get your mail-in ballot early. We, as a country, we'll get on our hands and knees and beg, you can help save the country. All eyes on Georgia. Hope you set your DVR, never miss an episode. Let not your heart be troubled because butterball turkey fryer Laura Ingraham is next.
