What we should be doing is making Ukraine strong, sending them all kinds of lethal aid that they have been begging for. And then we can put sanctions on Ukraine now, because of what Russia has already done, cyberattacks, false flag operations, and other things like that.

And we don't have the help of our German allies in NATO, so there's going to view only so much that we can do economically without the help of Germany, that is, if we if we try to do this with a bunch of our allies. We can do unilateral sanctions. It's not going to be enough to just threaten that before Russia invades. That's why, as Claudia said, the constant insisting that the United States isn't going to send troops, I guess that's for an American audience. That's definitely not meant to deter Russia. They should be having a more ambiguous approach. The other thing that I would say, Sandra, is, the Biden administration is reportedly also considering arms deals with Russia on the table to get Russia to back down, that maybe consider doing an arms reduction or promising that we wouldn't deploy certain troops or certain arms -- long- range -- or medium-range missiles, that is, to Europe. That would be a mistake. It would only incentivize the Russians to act aggressively in order to pocket gains. So it's just as important what we don't do as what we do, do.",

If energy gets caught up in the middle of all of this, and Germany gets cut off from Russia, Germany is going to have to source that energy from other parts of Europe and the Middle East.

While he's talking to Qatar, here, those industries are strangling. That would actually be both a genuine help to the U.S., which matters here. We should stop beating up ourselves. And it would also send a powerful message to Putin, A, he relies on energy exports for what he's doing, these threats he's making and so on. B, it would tell him that the U.S. is regaining a certain measure of sanity, which he must have assumed we lost when he watched the debacle in Afghanistan last August. We're not doing any of that.

We have heard from various generals, including Keith Kellogg, who is forecasting this obviously could happen at any moment. General Keane has suggested he believes that Putin could wait until after the Olympics are over to invade. We now know that Russian forces are said to have Ukraine surrounded on three sides.

Russia is looking at, what kind of concessions can we get? If it doesn't get concessions that it wants, and it might go ahead and pocket those concessions even if it does get them, then it will invade. I think that this idea that they're going to wait until it's frozen, until like winter is totally frozen, or wait until -- they won't go afterwards, I mean, Russia can weather a little mud. They can weather sanctions. They're going to do what they want. And also the other point about the Olympics, the other big elephant in the room is China. I mean, depending on how Russia is coordinating with China, they might be coordinating timing with what the Chinese have in store.

One thing I will say is this. It's one thing to meet with people. It's another thing to soften your rhetoric.

Take a look at this map. The states in red and yellow have the highest inflation rates right now, but it's in battleground states with vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection, like in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Georgia, that are seeing prices spike more than the national average. This could be a factor in whether or not Democrats keep control of Congress. And Republicans know it. The National Republican Senatorial Committee telling us senators from these states will be on defense, saying -- quote -- \"Mark Kelly, Raphael Warnock, Maggie Hassan, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Michael Bennet will have to spend the rest of the year explaining to voters why they supported the failed Biden agenda that made their lives more expensive. Senate Democrats own inflation and it'll cost them their seats and control of the Senate.\" The White House, though, has said it's supply chain issues that are driving prices up. But some economists say that's not the only culprit. Government stimulus has made the problem worse. A progressive professor of economics at NYU's Stern School of Business telling us -- quote -- \"The amount of money that the government gave out to people during the last year, that created inflation and that created the supply chain issues. The supply chain issues would have been totally minor if people didn't have too much money in their pockets.\" But, today, President Biden talking to governors about federal aid, suggesting that the spending spigot isn't going to be turned off yet.",

That is a problem for the country. And I will tell you, Sandra, what's also clear, all roads lead back to Washington.

People were up in arms because they wanted to get out of New York City, and that storm wouldn't let them go anywhere. So they were stuck at the airport for hours. Actually just talked to one woman who said she flew into JFK last night, and she was on the tarmac and her JetBlue flight, according to her, for at least three hours, so a lot of people are still trying to get out of town. Take a look at this video. This came in from overnight, since we have been talking about JFK. They seemed to have more issues there overnight. So, that is the baggage claim there, packed there, as hundreds of people were reportedly stranded due to weather delays and major cancellations. JetBlue Airline is the hardest hit in the United States again today, with cancellations at about 16 percent, according to FlightAware. We reached out to JetBlue for comment about those delays. And other people are definitely calling them too. The airline responding, saying, in part: \"It normally takes a few days to fully recover when a storm of this size significantly impacts our two largest markets of New York and Boston. And our first priority continues to be restarting safely. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience, and we're working to get them on their way as quickly as possible.\" So, people hope they stick to their word, so they can get out of town here. Now, this drone footage is amazing. It shows that aftermath of the storm that hit Massachusetts. That is Brant Rock, Massachusetts, there on your screen, covered in frozen sea spray, those houses after a nor'easter slammed the East Coast over the weekend. Some towns in Massachusetts hit with more than two feet of snow, so they're digging out again today. Now, on Saturday, La Guardia was empty. Nearly every flight was canceled, so people didn't even show up, including crews, as they did work to de-ice and also clear the roadways and the runways, though La Guardia, JFK, Newark, and Boston Logan International were hardest hit over the weekend. Back out here live at La Guardia. We can tell you things are a little bit calmer, people still trying to get out today, over 300 flights canceled in the United States. And a few thousand, we can tell you, are delayed, so make sure you check, Sandra, before you head to the airport, or else you will be hanging out with us.",

But the streaming platform is holding firm, refusing to remove or even censor Rogan's podcast. Why? One big reason for that, in 2020, Spotify reportedly paid more than $100 million for the exclusive rights to the podcast. So they don't want to budge. Another reason, Spotify isn't a music company. It's a tech company trying to maximize profits. And, also, Spotify's popular music service is not profitable.

What we should be doing is making Ukraine strong, sending them all kinds of lethal aid that they have been begging for. And then we can put sanctions on Ukraine now, because of what Russia has already done, cyberattacks, false flag operations, and other things like that.

I wish that President Biden would stop repeating that we will not send troops to Ukraine, even if that's true. It's a gift to Putin to keep on underlining that. Keep quiet about it. Let Putin wonder.

We can do unilateral sanctions. It's not going to be enough to just threaten that before Russia invades. That's why, as Claudia said, the constant insisting that the United States isn't going to send troops, I guess that's for an American audience. That's definitely not meant to deter Russia. They should be having a more ambiguous approach. The other thing that I would say, Sandra, is, the Biden administration is reportedly also considering arms deals with Russia on the table to get Russia to back down, that maybe consider doing an arms reduction or promising that we wouldn't deploy certain troops or certain arms -- long- range -- or medium-range missiles, that is, to Europe. That would be a mistake. It would only incentivize the Russians to act aggressively in order to pocket gains. So it's just as important what we don't do as what we do, do."

Qatar could become a key player here in helping Europe absorb an energy crisis that it could suffer if Putin decides to move in that direction, right? If energy gets caught up in the middle of all of this, and Germany gets cut off from Russia, Germany is going to have to source that energy from other parts of Europe and the Middle East. So, Qatar could eventually play a big role in all that."

      "utterance": "Yes, well, you know what -- the thing that President Biden could do that would be not only low-cost, it would actually be beneficial hugely to the U.S., would be to open up our gas and oil industry again. While he's talking to Qatar, here, those industries are strangling. That would actually be both a genuine help to the U.S., which matters here. We should stop beating up ourselves. And it would also send a powerful message to Putin, A, he relies on energy exports for what he's doing, these threats he's making and so on. B, it would tell him that the U.S. is regaining a certain measure of sanity, which he must have assumed we lost when he watched the debacle in Afghanistan last August. We're not doing any of that. But that would be far more effective, really, than sanctions, which Russia is very adept at evading. They are really masters at that."

We have heard from various generals, including Keith Kellogg, who is forecasting this obviously could happen at any moment. General Keane has suggested he believes that Putin could wait until after the Olympics are over to invade. We now know that Russian forces are said to have Ukraine surrounded on three sides. So, the military presence, even up until today, we know, continues to grow on the part of Russia. So what are you looking at as far as timing of an invasion?"

      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "Well, if Russia thinks that it can get these concessions from the Biden administration, then it might -- that's what it's looking at. Russia is looking at, what kind of concessions can we get? If it doesn't get concessions that it wants, and it might go ahead and pocket those concessions even if it does get them, then it will invade. I think that this idea that they're going to wait until it's frozen, until like winter is totally frozen, or wait until -- they won't go afterwards, I mean, Russia can weather a little mud. They can weather sanctions. They're going to do what they want. And also the other point about the Olympics, the other big elephant in the room is China. I mean, depending on how Russia is coordinating with China, they might be coordinating timing with what the Chinese have in store. So there's several variables, but, really, the balls in Putin's court."

And they're up in arms right now because of what Bragg had initially proposed, in terms of not prosecuting anything but very, very high level crimes such as murder, so -- or -- and not seeking prison terms, which is even crazier. So they have been putting pressure on Bragg. Sources are telling us that they're seeking another meeting with him this week. Sources close to the partnership say they believe that it's -- these meetings and these sort of constant give-and-take -- this would be the second meeting they have had with Bragg -- is starting to soften his stance on this non-prosecution stuff that he initially enunciated, which caused the uproar about a month ago. One thing I will say is this. It's one thing to meet with people. It's another thing to soften your rhetoric. There are certain sort of concrete things that Bragg could do, Governor Hochul could do, that Mayor Adams could do, reinstall qualified immunity, so cops feel, if they arrest someone, they don't have to be sued and their pension is at stake. Get rid of this crazy bail reform, where I guess the intentions were good.

Take a look at this map. The states in red and yellow have the highest inflation rates right now, but it's in battleground states with vulnerable Senate Democrats up for reelection, like in Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, and Georgia, that are seeing prices spike more than the national average. This could be a factor in whether or not Democrats keep control of Congress. And Republicans know it. The National Republican Senatorial Committee telling us senators from these states will be on defense, saying -- quote -- \"Mark Kelly, Raphael Warnock, Maggie Hassan, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Michael Bennet will have to spend the rest of the year explaining to voters why they supported the failed Biden agenda that made their lives more expensive. Senate Democrats own inflation and it'll cost them their seats and control of the Senate.\" The White House, though, has said it's supply chain issues that are driving prices up. But some economists say that's not the only culprit. Government stimulus has made the problem worse. A progressive professor of economics at NYU's Stern School of Business telling us -- quote -- \"The amount of money that the government gave out to people during the last year, that created inflation and that created the supply chain issues. The supply chain issues would have been totally minor if people didn't have too much money in their pockets.\" But, today, President Biden talking to governors about federal aid, suggesting that the spending spigot isn't going to be turned off yet."

My mom's calling me and telling me when I should buy eggs. What's a good day? I mean, that's not the conversation we want to be having with our families right now. And I think, Sandra, what's not clear to me is, which is worse, the empty shelves or the rise in prices? But what is clear is that eight in 10 Americans in a recent Gallup poll see this continuing. That is a problem for the country. And I will tell you, Sandra, what's also clear, all roads lead back to Washington. At the end of the day, it's Washington spending that's contributing to this issue, inability to control the supply chain concern. We can't unload a container ship. How are we going to fix the food and milk and orange juice prices? And then, Sandra, at the end of the day, it's inability to infuse confidence in American voters.

To get to the grocery store, your bill might be 20 percent higher, but your gas bill is 50 percent higher, and your home heating bill is up double digits. So you're suffering on just about every front. This is becoming a big inflation -- a big political issue. And, as you just heard Hillary Vaughn reporting, it affects red states differently than blue states.

By, the way, we did call Chief Raul Ortiz and DHS Secretary Mayorkas to join us. Both are welcome any time. Kaylee, I will get to the political fallout in a moment. But this is real- world scenarios for a lot of folks. And it's not just a border problem, as we have been reporting. This is happening in non-border states, where you have got these migrants coming across the border in numbers that are hard to believe. Yuma border encounters, as we just bannered, up 2000 percent full year 2022 year to date. This is what those Border Patrol agents are dealing with. And they are frustrated, Kaylee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KAYLEE MCGHEE WHITE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And like you said, this isn't just happening in border states either. Videos that we have obtained show that these migrants are being shipped to all different parts of the country, to New York, to Florida, to all these other states that don't necessarily intersect with the Mexican border. And yet the Biden administration is shipping them secretly, oftentimes overnight, to try and keep it quiet. So now you have dozens of cities across the country that aren't even close to the border having to deal with these issues as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "The White House has pushed back on that, saying that there are no secret flights, as you saw our Peter Doocy report from the White House on Friday, although the pictures we're showing here of flights landing in suburban New York, Westchester County, carrying migrants that land in the middle of the night. So we continue to ask the White House for a full explanation of these flights. Who are these migrants and where are they being sent? As that is happening, you have got border officials, as you saw in that leaked video, they're frustrated and they're speaking out. They're saying morale is at an all-time low. We're losing agents. And all this frustration was acknowledged with Mayorkas in the room. Do you think this will force the White House to prioritize the border as a top issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGHEE WHITE",
      "utterance": "They need to but they probably won't, because it's such an issue that is so controversial among the left, which we already know the Biden administration is working overtime to please. And so you do have so much pent-up frustration among Border Patrol agents, who feel like they're literally not allowed to do their jobs, which is to secure the border, to apprehend migrants who are crossing illegally. And like the one agent said, he feels like he's being used as a taxi service because he is not allowed to do what he was hired to do. So, will the Biden administration do anything about it? They absolutely need to and I hope they do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "And, obviously, it is a huge political issue that they will face in the midterm election year, as it has continued to be highlighted, the frustration at the border and those Border Patrol agents frustrated with their leaders, and doing it with Mayorkas in the room made that a very big story. We will continue to follow it. Thank you. The storm slamming the East Coast may have moved on, but it's still wreaking havoc for flyers trying to take off -- Alexis."

It's getting a little bit better, but look at this video. This is in from JFK just overnight. You can see lots of bags and lots of people waiting, as many people say they were stranded for hours. I will have that story coming up next."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCADAMS",
      "utterance": "Hi, Sandra. Well, today is a lot better to be here at La Guardia, yesterday, a completely different situation. People were up in arms because they wanted to get out of New York City, and that storm wouldn't let them go anywhere. So they were stuck at the airport for hours. Actually just talked to one woman who said she flew into JFK last night, and she was on the tarmac and her JetBlue flight, according to her, for at least three hours, so a lot of people are still trying to get out of town. Take a look at this video. This came in from overnight, since we have been talking about JFK. They seemed to have more issues there overnight. So, that is the baggage claim there, packed there, as hundreds of people were reportedly stranded due to weather delays and major cancellations. JetBlue Airline is the hardest hit in the United States again today, with cancellations at about 16 percent, according to FlightAware. We reached out to JetBlue for comment about those delays. And other people are definitely calling them too."

    {
      "speaker": "The airline responding, saying, in part",
      "utterance": "\"It normally takes a few days to fully recover when a storm of this size significantly impacts our two largest markets of New York and Boston. And our first priority continues to be restarting safely. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience, and we're working to get them on their way as quickly as possible.\" So, people hope they stick to their word, so they can get out of town here. Now, this drone footage is amazing. It shows that aftermath of the storm that hit Massachusetts. That is Brant Rock, Massachusetts, there on your screen, covered in frozen sea spray, those houses after a nor'easter slammed the East Coast over the weekend. Some towns in Massachusetts hit with more than two feet of snow, so they're digging out again today. Now, on Saturday, La Guardia was empty. Nearly every flight was canceled, so people didn't even show up, including crews, as they did work to de-ice and also clear the roadways and the runways, though La Guardia, JFK, Newark, and Boston Logan International were hardest hit over the weekend. Back out here live at La Guardia. We can tell you things are a little bit calmer, people still trying to get out today, over 300 flights canceled in the United States. And a few thousand, we can tell you, are delayed, so make sure you check, Sandra, before you head to the airport, or else you will be hanging out with us."

All right, switching up gears now, as Spotify hoping to curb those recent calls to remove podcast host Joe Rogan from its platform. FOX Business' Ashley Webster has more on the changes the company is now making. Hi, Ashley."

      "utterance": "Indeed. Hey there, Sandra. Joe Rogan himself speaking out, saying in a video posted on Instagram that he's not trying, he says, to promote misinformation about COVID, only to talk to people who have, well, differing opinions. Take a listen. JOE ROGAN, HOST, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\": I'm interested in telling the truth. I'm interested in finding out what the truth is. I'm not interested in only talking to people that have one perspective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBSTER",
      "utterance": "Differing opinions. Now, over the weekend, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek announced an advisory will be added to any podcast episode discussing COVID-19, saying -- quote -- \"This new effort to combat misinformation will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days. To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform.\" High-profile musicians, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, may have ditched Spotify over claims of misinformation. But the streaming platform is holding firm, refusing to remove or even censor Rogan's podcast. Why? One big reason for that, in 2020, Spotify reportedly paid more than $100 million for the exclusive rights to the podcast. So they don't want to budge. Another reason, Spotify isn't a music company. It's a tech company trying to maximize profits. And, also, Spotify's popular music service is not profitable. So there's a lot riding on the popularity of podcasts, especially Joe Rogan, who, by the way, generates an estimated 11 million listeners per episode. Not bad."

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. BILL HAGERTY (R-TN)",
      "utterance": "So, it's good to be with you, Sandra. We have a serious effort under way regarding sanctions. The real question is timing. Again, President Biden's had the authority to do this through executive action all along. He's actually refused to impose Nord Stream to sanctions. And he actually worked hard with 44 other Senate Democrats to frustrate Senator Cruz's bill to force them to impose Nord Stream 2 sanctions on Russia, again, trying to remove from Vladimir Putin's hands a geopolitical weapon that he's creating. But, right now, what we're focused on is getting sanctions in place and getting them in place now, from my perspective."

      "utterance": "And, of course, the White House continues to promise crushing sanctions if Russia invades, although, today, there was mention from the White House and Jen Psaki in that Briefing Room that there could be the ability of Russia to absorb these tough sanctions. So, where are you on that? And how tough do these have to be to really cripple Russia from being able to do this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGERTY",
      "utterance": "Well, I tell you where I am right now. And that is that Russia and, frankly, the world has heard enough of tough talk. Actions speak much louder than words. What we need to do is impose sanctions right now to give Vladimir Putin a taste of what's to come and to demonstrate America's resolve. China's watching this too. The ayatollahs in Iran are watching this. And what they can see is an America that won't defend its own Southern border, an America that actually walked away from energy independence and has done everything in its power to wage war on oil and gas. We need to reverse course there and stand strong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "It was the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. warning about those sanctions could be absorbed by Russia. How tough can we get? What position are we in to do that, as far as economic sanctions, knowing this could cripple some of those European countries if we were to go too tough on Russia? Final thought on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGERTY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we have had the opportunity for nine months here with this administration to step up and address Russia. That's when Russia's actions began. And what we have had is inaction and feckless behavior here from the Biden administration. So, I think it's even more important than ever to step up and show leadership as a nation, again, defend our borders, again, regain our energy independence. And with respect to these sanctions, we should lay out the toughest set of sanctions absolutely possible, financial sanctions, crushing sanctions, whether they be against individuals like Vladimir Putin, against key corporations, or the Russian government."
