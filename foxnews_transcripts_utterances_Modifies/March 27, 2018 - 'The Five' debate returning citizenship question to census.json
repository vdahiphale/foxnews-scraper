The reason that we have a census, the reason that Federalist paper James Mattis established a census was that it was important to have an accurate count of the entire American population, in order then to make sure that we were properly representative in the house. Also, that we had statistics about where there was a need for federal funding projects and the likes. That it was properly distributed. So they wanted to avoid there being a revolution of people who felt that they weren't being represented by the federal government.  But I'll say this, let me just quickly add, this is about a situation where you had, I think here, it says on my notes, you had about, you know, 63 percent participation in the census in 2010. In the 1970's, 75 percent of the people in the country participated. Right now, the estimate is that it's going to go down to around 50, 55 percent of the American population will participate. But the objectionable part, Jesse, just to pick up on the point, it's that the Trump reelection campaign has sent out a notice to its fund-raisers saying, hey, let's get behind this. We want this. We want this. And you've got to stop and think then, so this is about politics? This is not about getting an accurate count.",

Unlike Hillary and her friends, we won't besmirch the women. We're going to wait until Trump has at least nine Oval Office encounters with one of his interns fresh out of college and until he's accused of sexual assault by a woman who came to him for help. In the meantime, all we have is a story about a romp a decade ago at a golf tournament. But with Trump, everyone knew his flaws before they voted. Decades as a tabloid staple didn't hurt, as well as all those prize-winning reporters now on the Trump gossip beat. And that \"Access Hollywood\" tape helped. Funny, that tape existed for years, tucked away in some creepy network dude's closet until it was leaked just before an election. What are the odds of that? And so, CNN sacrifices what's left of its reputation trying to undo an election. To think, if only people had another chance to vote for Hillary, they'd forget about the woman who ridiculed her husband's accusers. Congrats, CNN, you've redefined hard news.

And he absolutely loves the Marvels Avengers. And you see the tweet there. She was hoping just one of the actors could send Emilio a greeting, and guess what happened. With the help of the Twitterverse and other journalists like Jake Tapper, Greg's man crush, within an hour she had responses from at least eight, all wanting to help, including Captain America, Chris Evans; Hawkeye, Jeremy Renner; even non-Avenger super heroes reached out, including Deadpool, all the way hot, Ryan Reynolds.

Whether or not we can appropriately determine what your bail status should be and the schedule. Nope. And then you have 16 different names. No one knows who anybody is. And then, God forbid, if you ask to fingerprint someone and run them through the system. This is similar. Like, why would -- this is a legal right you're trying to get in terms of whether you're citizenship status is valid or not. What is your -- are you a green card, are you someone who is here as a legal resident, are you here illegally in the country? There's certain benefit to you depending on that status.

      "utterance": "Well, I think the real reason comes down to, do you want people to participate. The reason that we have a census, the reason that Federalist paper James Mattis established a census was that it was important to have an accurate count of the entire American population, in order then to make sure that we were properly representative in the house. Also, that we had statistics about where there was a need for federal funding projects and the likes. That it was properly distributed. So they wanted to avoid there being a revolution of people who felt that they weren't being represented by the federal government. But I'll say this, let me just quickly add, this is about a situation where you had, I think here, it says on my notes, you had about, you know, 63 percent participation in the census in 2010. In the 1970's, 75 percent of the people in the country participated. Right now, the estimate is that it's going to go down to around 50, 55 percent of the American population will participate. But the objectionable part, Jesse, just to pick up on the point, it's that the Trump reelection campaign has sent out a notice to its fund-raisers saying, hey, let's get behind this. We want this. We want this. And you've got to stop and think then, so this is about politics? This is not about getting an accurate count."

The other questions -- by the way, the other that really bugs me, this is an example again of California spending taxpayer money to assist noncitizens rather than the citizens themselves. And they wonder why people are leaving it's because they're not getting the services. I mean, they ask about your date of birth which is ageist. How dare they do that?

But I'm not against this question being asked. The census is to allocate seats in congress, and resources from the federal government then are dibbed up. If you're not here legally, you do not have representation in congress. But I think one of the things the states have a problem with is that -- imagine you're Californian, you know that you have a high illegal immigrant problem in your state, or maybe you don't think it's a problem. But there is an undercount. OK. So now, you are without -- not just congressional seats but resources."

And in fact, you're doing us a disservice both financially and politically and ideologically. This is not where we stand. We actually want to abide by the rules and the laws on the books. We would like to continue to have federal government support and not act in disregard -- blatant disregard of the laws -- hundred percent. And you saw this kind of evolving over time. It was percolating in California. It's going to be very interesting how this plays out in the election coming up as well, because there're certain disparate parts that really have no bid for the rest of California and the way that they're behaving. It's like a very like vocal minority speaking out up and against people who, in fact, want to go, OK, let's just -- let's for our role and make sure we are going to get all of our benefits and not getting tossed out aside, and the cast out California, secede from the union, the whole deal."

Unlike Hillary and her friends, we won't besmirch the women. We're going to wait until Trump has at least nine Oval Office encounters with one of his interns fresh out of college and until he's accused of sexual assault by a woman who came to him for help. In the meantime, all we have is a story about a romp a decade ago at a golf tournament. But with Trump, everyone knew his flaws before they voted. Decades as a tabloid staple didn't hurt, as well as all those prize-winning reporters now on the Trump gossip beat. And that \"Access Hollywood\" tape helped. Funny, that tape existed for years, tucked away in some creepy network dude's closet until it was leaked just before an election. What are the odds of that? And so, CNN sacrifices what's left of its reputation trying to undo an election. To think, if only people had another chance to vote for Hillary, they'd forget about the woman who ridiculed her husband's accusers. Congrats, CNN, you've redefined hard news.

It's illegal to do that in California. And then, they also have this doctored lie detector test video. Everybody knows that's doctored. So, CNN, you say -- Juan's laughing.

So let's say you say, like, you're a common sense person and you go, \"Those bump stocks, we don't need them. Those should be banned.\" And the gun control people say, \"Yes, you're right. No, just bump stocks.\" And then you go and you ban bump stocks, and then they say, \"That's not enough, actually. We want all your guns.\" And you -- and we're the law-abiding gun owner.

If your kid is having problems with friends, it's because you're being overprotective, because they give off -- they give off the wrong signs in public. Because they don't know what it's like to be around other kids. So they'll cry in public. You're not supposed to cry in public. You can cry at home.

And she tweeted out a plea for help after a man on the plane told her about his 11-year-old nephew Emilio, who is battling cancer and has just days to live. And he absolutely loves the Marvels Avengers. And you see the tweet there. She was hoping just one of the actors could send Emilio a greeting, and guess what happened. With the help of the Twitterverse and other journalists like Jake Tapper, Greg's man crush, within an hour she had responses from at least eight, all wanting to help, including Captain America, Chris Evans; Hawkeye, Jeremy Renner; even non-Avenger super heroes reached out, including Deadpool, all the way hot, Ryan Reynolds. What a sweet gesture for a very, very special little boy. So God bless you, Shannon Bream, and also Emilio and his uncle."

As a 9-year-old attending Sumner Elementary School in 1953, Topeka, Kansas, her dad attempted to enroll her in her neighborhood school, but his bid failed because it was for whites only. That led to a legal challenge. And I came to know her story when I wrote the biography of Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was the lead counsel in the Brown case. Her family foundation now continues to play a role in encouraging educational excellence for all children. But with her death at 76, we're all reminded how one life can change our world."
