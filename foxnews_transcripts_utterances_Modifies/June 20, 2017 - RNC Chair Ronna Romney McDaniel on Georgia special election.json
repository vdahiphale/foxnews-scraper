      "sentences": "Good evening, Martha. There may be of a slight delay in tabulating all the votes, while most of the polls closed at 7:00 o'clock, two polling locations remain open; two voting locations remain open because of some problems with the electronic voting machines. And so, when elections judge ordered those two polling sites to stay open for an extra half-hour. Now, if that has not affected turnout including the storms that came through here, people just showed up with their umbrellas in large numbers. Early voting; huge numbers of early voting, and of course, spending on this U.S. House campaign; the highest amount of spending on the U.S. House race in history. The Georgia sixth district, normally, favors establishment Republicans. They win by wide margins, but when you look at the November presidential election, Donald Trump had to fight for this district; he won by less than two percent and so Democrats see a potential inroad here. Jon Ossoff, throughout the campaign, has been trying to campaign as a moderate reaching out to moderate Republicans and independent voters in this district, which is going to be key if he's going to flip this district from red to blue.  And now my colleague, Steve Harrigan, is available covering Karen Handel. Steve?",

Karen Handel was out there in the rain throughout the day really trying to fight for those last votes. She has gotten a tremendous amount of support throughout this campaign from the president on Twitter, she's also had several cabinet administrators come down here as well to try and campaign with her in person.  But despite that, she had tried to make this not a national race, trying to focus instead on the local people here and the local issues. She has tried to paint her opponent, Ossoff, as an outsider. She says he is too young, too naive to run this district, and over and over again she has tried to link him to the far-left saying he is a pawn of the far-left. Her supporters are gathering here now and what was for 40 years a reliably Republican seat, which could turn into a very close race late tonight. Martha, back to you.",

So he's trying to play himself as some moderate Democrat, we know he's going to go to Washington and vote with Nancy Pelosi 100 percent of the time. So, he's trying to have it both ways within the district, I think the voters are seeing that. And Karen is keeping it local, she's focusing on jobs, the economy, and helping people in the Georgia sixth district, and she's going to come to Washington and be a support to the White House and help us repeal and replace ObamaCare, pass tax reform and get jobs coming back to that district.",

But this is one where this is a straight up, an absolute toss-up. This is a district that has been trending Democrat, it is the most educated district that Republicans hold, it is the most educated, most college degree holders of any district that Donald Trump won in 2016. This is where Democrats future lies, in districts just like this. What we're going to be watching for tonight is basically this. You need two votes; Jon Ossoff needs two votes in the Democratic portion of Fulton -- of the Cobb County closer into Atlanta. He needs to votes there for everyone vote in Fulton County, which is the lion share of the district.

So, I think Republicans in the Senate especially, and all around the House have absolutely one eye on this race because if a Democrat could actually win in a district like this, I think everybody's going to get as far from President Trump's agenda as they possibly can.

You see a reporter asked why there are more off-camera briefings lately and texted Senior Strategist, Steve Bannon, to ask why. She was answered with a curt text that read: \"Sean got fatter.\" This launched a Twitter war between Chelsea Clinton and two conservative writers. Charlie Spiering, offer keen insight about the banning clip, which sounded about right: \"It's a joke, people.\" To which Chelsea Clinton responded, \"OK, so using fat shaming to avoid answering a question about increasing opacity, got it. 2017.\" Jim Henson, former Special Ops strand in: \"P.R.-manage response from the humor impaired left. It was a joke.\" Finished by Clinton, \"Hi, Jim! Just me, as I was standing in line at Starbucks earlier; fat shaming isn't a joke I find funny ever,\" she said. So, in the midst of a Congressional shooting, the death of Otto Warmbier, Russian jets buzzing U.S. Pilots, off-the-cuff sarcasm from a typically acerbic Steve Bannon sent into a safe space tizzy over the horrors of fat shaming in the larger context of the White House. This fuse tweets and leaks on a daily basis at being too opaque.  Spicer answered with an on the record, on-camera briefing. All journalists want the big questions answered, and White House must be transparent as taxpayers, everyone there works for all of us, however, this spiral from joke to tirade may reveal more about the Twitterers and the texters all hyper-focused on their inside-the-beltway-noise than much else. That's my story, and I'm sticking with it.

Early voting; huge numbers of early voting, and of course, spending on this U.S. House campaign; the highest amount of spending on the U.S. House race in history. The Georgia sixth district, normally, favors establishment Republicans. They win by wide margins, but when you look at the November presidential election, Donald Trump had to fight for this district; he won by less than two percent and so Democrats see a potential inroad here. Jon Ossoff, throughout the campaign, has been trying to campaign as a moderate reaching out to moderate Republicans and independent voters in this district, which is going to be key if he's going to flip this district from red to blue.

So, he's trying to have it both ways within the district, I think the voters are seeing that. And Karen is keeping it local, she's focusing on jobs, the economy, and helping people in the Georgia sixth district, and she's going to come to Washington and be a support to the White House and help us repeal and replace ObamaCare, pass tax reform and get jobs coming back to that district."

I've been in withdrawal from vote counting, and this one we know is a big deal; the previous two special elections, contested special elections, were sort of like fan fiction for Democrats like, we'll win in Montana, no, and we're going in Kansas, no. But this is one where this is a straight up, an absolute toss-up. This is a district that has been trending Democrat, it is the most educated district that Republicans hold, it is the most educated, most college degree holders of any district that Donald Trump won in 2016. This is where Democrats future lies, in districts just like this. What we're going to be watching for tonight is basically this. You need two votes; Jon Ossoff needs two votes in the Democratic portion of Fulton -- of the Cobb County closer into Atlanta. He needs to votes there for everyone vote in Fulton County, which is the lion share of the district. So, he's to try and run up the score closer to the city because as the RNC chairwoman pointed out, the Republicans are going to try to run things up in the northern part of Fulton. I can't wait."

I mean, Ossoff had a lead in the polls, leading into just the last round of polls that came up that showed her closing pretty quickly. Right now, the polls have it an absolute toss-up. I think this is going to be a nail- biter, it's going to be a long night, but if you're looking at the trend lines, the way things were moving, they were moving -- seem to be shifted in her direction here toward the end of the campaign."

And this is a district that the Democrats really had no business winning, maybe someday in the future, but they've lost this district by 25-40 points except for the one year they couldn't even get a candidate, and they lost by 99 points. So, I think Republicans in the Senate especially, and all around the House have absolutely one eye on this race because if a Democrat could actually win in a district like this, I think everybody's going to get as far from President Trump's agenda as they possibly can. If the Democrat cannot win in this race, then they're going to say, it's just like these other special elections, it will be fine."

Republicans took advantage of the fact that Democrats really neglected white working class voters, especially in the upper mid-west in 2016. Hillary Clinton left all that money sitting on the table and Donald Trump was only too happy to sweep it up. The question now for Republicans and the Trump era is: can these affluent college-educated voters, who are certainly cool, to say the least, towards President Trump, can Republicans keep them as part of the coalition?

You see a reporter asked why there are more off-camera briefings lately and texted Senior Strategist, Steve Bannon, to ask why. She was answered with a curt text that read: \"Sean got fatter.\" This launched a Twitter war between Chelsea Clinton and two conservative writers. Charlie Spiering, offer keen insight about the banning clip, which sounded about right: \"It's a joke, people.\" To which Chelsea Clinton responded, \"OK, so using fat shaming to avoid answering a question about increasing opacity, got it. 2017.\""

So, in the midst of a Congressional shooting, the death of Otto Warmbier, Russian jets buzzing U.S. Pilots, off-the-cuff sarcasm from a typically acerbic Steve Bannon sent into a safe space tizzy over the horrors of fat shaming in the larger context of the White House. This fuse tweets and leaks on a daily basis at being too opaque. Spicer answered with an on the record, on-camera briefing. All journalists want the big questions answered, and White House must be transparent as taxpayers, everyone there works for all of us, however, this spiral from joke to tirade may reveal more about the Twitterers and the texters all hyper-focused on their inside-the-beltway-noise than much else.

The second thing is that the press has been hostile, and so you know, and they've been hostile from the beginning of the campaign right up until today. And the reason why they're so hostile is that this is such a disruptive, transformative candidate who has brought an economic A-team together, who kept the House and Senate, who is a transformative leader, but he's not styled in the way that the media elites like.

But I am getting such heck for my liberal Democratic friends, how dare you stand in the way of this prosecution and impeachment. Well, I'm going to stand in the way, because I don't believe the constitution permits the prosecution of a president, especially for obstruction of justice, on the basis of him doing what he's constitutionally entitled to do, firing the director of the FBI, even telling them to terminate an investigation. As to the Russian collusion, the worst-case scenario is still not a crime. It may be it should be a crime, but there's nothing in the statute books that would make it a crime. If Donald Trump called Putin and said, hey, Putin, help me become president and I'll be good for Russia, that would be terrible, but it wouldn't be a crime. And we have to understand the difference between doing something bad politically."

But Europe now is going to need to get very serious about how they're going to deal with this. Two things that they can deal with that are under their control, they can deal with their borders to stop the mass migration coming into their countries. They can work through NATO with the United States to get rid of the safe havens in Libya and in Syria, but the more complicated problem is how are they going to deal with the internal politics and the internal threat that exists in their countries today."

I want to put up a tweet that President Trump sent out earlier today and it has to do with China, and it comes in the wake of the horrific killing of Otto Warmbier, a slow death it appears by the North Koreans. And this is what the president said, while I greatly appreciates the efforts of President Xi and China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried. What do you think he means by that?"

And so, we all mourn with Otto's family and with the other Americans, and with the Americans that are in North Korea. But I don't think you can expand this and say, you know, the president at this point in time is saying, you know, China -- we can't expect China to help with North Korea. On this particular issue, China was not successful in getting Otto out."

And keep in mind these are just the very early numbers because we expect, according to the predictions, to get to 230 - 240,000 votes is what's protected, we'll see how many actually come in, but that is part of the story right now.

She said while she can go and vote in this district, Ossoff can't, that's because, of course, the 30-year-old doesn't live in this district. A few factors could be key to this election, 50,000 new voters since the first time people voted in this race in April, both sides claiming that helps them, also a steady downpour throughout the day and some tough traffic problems, no sign on how that will affect turnout. And keep in mind too, this is a district with an incredibly high rate of college graduates among voters, it went big for Mitt Romney, just 2 percent win for Donald Trump, though. So this could be a real nail-biter. But the excitement and energy here has grown in just the past few minutes, Martha, back to you."

The judge noting in his ruling, quote, I'm aware that there's a lot of support in Pensacola to keep the cross as is, and I understand and respect that point of view, but the law is the law.

Four people, four people in Pensacola said that they had a problem with this, tens of thousands of people have enjoyed the fact that it's there and they've seen it, they haven't been offended by it, and this is one of those just irrational decisions for the courts. I think the judged felt like he was in a box on it. But let me ask you this, Martha, I mean, if this cross in Pensacola is somehow offensive to the point that people can even go by there without being overwhelmed with religion, then tell me when are we going to take all of the crosses down at Arlington National Cemetery, because it's filled with crosses, it's filled with religious symbols. In some cases, it may be the Star of David, but those are all religious symbols. When will those come down? Is that not offensive? This is absurd. We're a nation that has freedom of religion, not freedom from religion, but that's what some of these folks they want. It's not that they really are offended they just can't stand the fact that there are some people who believe in God."

And as you say, there were four people who brought the case, two of them have since moved to Canada. They don't even live in the area anymore. So you're down to two people who are claiming to be offended by this cross. And we're looking at the pictures of it. It's been there for 75 years. As that attorney said it has been maintained by the town and that's where the legal problem lies. I was talking to Alan Dershowitz about this before, and he heard tease that the story was coming up, he said I wish I could stick around and talk to my friend Governor Huckabee about this because we always have these heated arguments, but we're good friends on this issue. But he said, you know, because it's on public property, that's the law. And the judge in this case was appointed, he's a Reagan appointee, and he basically was sort of aggrieved at the fact that he had to find that finding, but he said it is backed by the law."

I think that's absurd because we have so many different expressions that really aren't offensive. And you mentioned these two people that moved to Canada, maybe they need to put up another cross and get rid of the other two people and be done with it when they move out of the United States. But I just think that the ultimate solution let the city deed this over to a private entity and maybe these folks won't be so overwhelmed by the offense of the presence of that statute, it's just amazing."

In classrooms, liberal arguments are often treated as unquestionable truths, in some cases conservative students even feel the need to refrain from stating their opinion in fear of being shut down.
