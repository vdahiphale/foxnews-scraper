We are taking a look at some amazing crosscurrents in developments right now that concern a hurricane where we have dodged a bullet, even though a very destructive bullet, at that.  We're also looking at the fallout of the debate controversy. Does Joe Biden want to debate or not? He says he does. Nancy Pelosi isn't so sure it's a good idea. The back-and-forth on what the president saying about all that ahead of his big night.  But, first and foremost, the hurricane and what is going to be involved behind a big old cleanup.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" First to Jeff Flock in a very devastated Lake Charles, Louisiana -- Jeff.",

The negative, of course, is that cleanup that you mentioned. Look at this.  Anywhere you look, if I just shut up and walk this camera around the city, you would see just how difficult the situation is here, power down everywhere. I don't know where -- we haven't seen anybody that has power. And this is a good-sized city. It took a direct hit.   And then damage everywhere. If you look across -- that's McNeese State University. What's in there? It looks like bricks everywhere. That's actually the roof this facility. That's what the roofing material looks like. It's styrofoam and then cement up on top. Businesses. Look at this. This is just one of the dozens -- well, hundreds of businesses damaged and closed right now. Cleanup just now starting. I suspect, tomorrow, Neil, we will start to get into that. Hey, Tomas (ph), come on down, if you can, as I said, just showing you this in real time. This just happened within the last 12 hours, obviously. The cleanup here is starting, but it is going to take a very long time.   Maybe you see a lot of glass, a lot of power lines, a lot of trees, a lot of mess. As I said, Cat 4 storm, 150 mile-an-hour winds, I guess you should expect this sort of thing. Good news is lack of loss of life. Bad news is huge, huge damage -- Neil.",

It brought a nine-foot storm surge and over 100-mile-an-hour winds.  This is Holly Beach, the Cajun Riviera. And here's a drone look. Our FOX News drone will give you an aerial view of some of the damage we are seeing along the coast. It is substantial.  If you walk over here, you can see we have homes that have actually survived this on the stilts. That's the good news, but we have, well, lots of twisted metal. We have other foundations that have not survived, including those with R.V.s. There are lots of downed power lines here and some flooding. We -- those homes did survive on that -- 15-foot pylons. They were able to survive this storm surge, which they think was about nine feet. We spoke to somebody who said that, during Hurricane Rita, nothing was left standing. So, in that sense, they feel relieved that they at least have some of these homes on their pylons.  You can see behind me over here as well and on our drone footage, in some cases, it looks as though a tornado ripped right through here, this R.V. completely demolished, this vehicle completely gone as well.   You see lots of debris all over the place. This is Holly Beach. Just 400 or 500 people call this home. This is the Cajun Riviera. This was just seven miles west of where Hurricane Laura made landfall. We got the brunt of that eye here in this location. But, again, the devastation, you can see. It was really a lot of the winds here. And if you look at those homes with the pylons there, just the windows are intact in many of those homes. The water did not reach all the way to the top. So, in that sense, I believe some of the residents here are going to feel relieved from that, but devastation here. You see me on a satellite phone, lack of signal here, because of all the downed power lines. And there are R.V.s and homes that are completely obliterated.  But, again, during Hurricane Rita in 2005, nothing was left standing here, and this is the situation we are dealing with here in Holly Beach, seven miles west of where Hurricane Laura made that landfall as a Category 4 storm -- Neil.",

I think the White House holds all the cards. I think they won the negotiation. The president could do certain things by executive order, not everything, obviously. But he can show that he was the one trying to get something done, when Nancy was in the way. The way I can say that is, that is the same thing that President Obama did to us back in 2011, 2013 on things like government shutdowns and the debt ceiling. So, the shoe is on the other foot. I think the White House is probably in the driver's seat here.

Similarly -- and we have not talked much about this, Neil -- he could make the federal government go back to work. Washington, D.C., is a ghost town right now, because all of these agencies are just not sending folks back to work. The president has the ability, the administration has the ability to make the administration follow those rules. And that would give the private sector the cover they need to do what they need to, to get more money in the workers' pocket. So, the opportunity is there. The criticism is fair.

And he says: This could be a pandemic. And I have got -- I have got four things that I suggest we need to do, three of them involving passing legislation in 2021, after he took office next January. He would pass three bills. And then he would reauthorize a federal appropriation for hospitals treating pandemic patients, which was coming up In may to be renewed, which Congress renews routinely. So he had no idea. And then I looked at what his people were saying, and it got worse. He's surrounded by advisers like Ron Klain and Zeke Emanuel and Lisa Monaco, who were advising him, will all become members of his health advisory committee, and they're saying bizarre things are. This isn't going to be a pandemic. Travel bans don't work. That the first American dies of COVID in Kirkland, Washington, Zeke Emanuel is on a program -- I think it was NPR -- and says, don't go out and buy a mask because it won't work. And they were dismissive that it was going to get serious. One of them says all, oh, this -- the likelihood of this being serious is very low. Emanuel says, as it get warms up, it's going to move to the Southern Hemisphere, just like the flu does, this is not going to be that serious. So the idea that some -- I mean, think about this. In January, February and March, several words never crossed the lips of the former vice president of the United States, masks, social distancing. Never crossed it. Lockdowns, never crossed his mind. He is in mid -- on March 9 has a rally as late as that. As late as early April, he's talking about the utility of voting in-person, as opposed to doing a mail-in ballot. So the idea that he is somehow on top of this is baloney. And he knows it, because he now -- you will notice in his address, he said, just like I have been saying since March, and then he had a couple of other quotes where he suggested that was even earlier that he had laid out a plan of action. A dead giveaway was, he went on the Joy Reid show, first interview. This was about three weeks ago. She says to him now, assume you get elected president. What would you do next January? And he lists six things, all of which were already being done by the administration. He said, I would invoke the Defense Production Act. Already done. I'd appoint somebody to be in charge of speeding up vaccines and their distribution. That happened in May. I mean, it's just -- it is a remarkable rewriting of history.

Anywhere you look, if I just shut up and walk this camera around the city, you would see just how difficult the situation is here, power down everywhere. I don't know where -- we haven't seen anybody that has power. And this is a good-sized city. It took a direct hit. And then damage everywhere. If you look across -- that's McNeese State University. What's in there? It looks like bricks everywhere. That's actually the roof this facility. That's what the roofing material looks like. It's styrofoam and then cement up on top. Businesses. Look at this. This is just one of the dozens -- well, hundreds of businesses damaged and closed right now. Cleanup just now starting. I suspect, tomorrow, Neil, we will start to get into that. Hey, Tomas (ph), come on down, if you can, as I said, just showing you this in real time. This just happened within the last 12 hours, obviously. The cleanup here is starting, but it is going to take a very long time. Maybe you see a lot of glass, a lot of power lines, a lot of trees, a lot of mess.

It brought a nine-foot storm surge and over 100-mile-an-hour winds. This is Holly Beach, the Cajun Riviera. And here's a drone look. Our FOX News drone will give you an aerial view of some of the damage we are seeing along the coast. It is substantial. If you walk over here, you can see we have homes that have actually survived this on the stilts. That's the good news, but we have, well, lots of twisted metal. We have other foundations that have not survived, including those with R.V.s. There are lots of downed power lines here and some flooding. We -- those homes did survive on that -- 15-foot pylons. They were able to survive this storm surge, which they think was about nine feet. We spoke to somebody who said that, during Hurricane Rita, nothing was left standing. So, in that sense, they feel relieved that they at least have some of these homes on their pylons. You can see behind me over here as well and on our drone footage, in some cases, it looks as though a tornado ripped right through here, this R.V. completely demolished, this vehicle completely gone as well. You see lots of debris all over the place. This is Holly Beach. Just 400 or 500 people call this home. This is the Cajun Riviera. This was just seven miles west of where Hurricane Laura made landfall. We got the brunt of that eye here in this location. But, again, the devastation, you can see. It was really a lot of the winds here. And if you look at those homes with the pylons there, just the windows are intact in many of those homes. The water did not reach all the way to the top. So, in that sense, I believe some of the residents here are going to feel relieved from that, but devastation here. You see me on a satellite phone, lack of signal here, because of all the downed power lines. And there are R.V.s and homes that are completely obliterated. But, again, during Hurricane Rita in 2005, nothing was left standing here, and this is the situation we are dealing with here in Holly Beach, seven miles west of where Hurricane Laura made that landfall as a Category 4 storm -- Neil."

The president pointed to a dramatic reduction in Kenosha, Wisconsin, yesterday, with the addition of a number of National Guard members, the president saying that he's prepared to send the National Guard to anybody who wants to, but that some people in some states -- I think this was a nod to Ted Williams (sic) in the city of Portland, Oregon -- don't want to do that for political reasons.

When we do campaign-related things, there are certain places we can do them on the property, in the residence, for example. Sometimes, we go off-property, we don't do it in the West Wing.

But, yes, we probably would have raised the issue. But if someone sat down and said, look, this is -- this is the law, you move on to the next issue. Believe me, there were plenty of things to challenge the Obama administration about, other than where the president was giving a particular speech at any time. So, your point is well-made. And it is politics, there's no question, but, sometimes, you just have to admit that you lost that battle, and it's time to move on to the next one."

I was in the Cabinet, as Mike Pompeo is. I participated in political activities after-hours, because you're not a federal employee 24 hours a day. At least, the rules don't apply to you 24 hours a day. When I was the chief of staff, I had a Secret Service detail. I would go out 8:00 at night, give a speech at a political event.

She thought the president would fold in those negotiations earlier in the summer. I think part of the reason you're seeing her raise this U.S. Postal Service issue is to draw attention away from the fact that she -- she messed up on stimulus. I think the White House holds all the cards. I think they won the negotiation. The president could do certain things by executive order, not everything, obviously. But he can show that he was the one trying to get something done, when Nancy was in the way. The way I can say that is, that is the same thing that President Obama did to us back in 2011, 2013 on things like government shutdowns and the debt ceiling. So, the shoe is on the other foot. I think the White House is probably in the driver's seat here. They should be looking maybe at doing some small things, things they can do on their selves, but I think they're right not to be throwing trillions of dollars at this -- at the stimulus right now."

Anyway, they were telling me to a man or woman, look, I'm feeling leery of acting on this and taking payroll taxes out, giving them to workers, when it's just the president's executive order, it doesn't have the stamp of Congress. I have very little cover, and this might be temporary, and I have to give the dough back. And that's why they're not acting on it. What do you make of that?"

The president is in the position to make the federal government do it. The federal government is probably the largest employer in the country. He could make the federal agencies do what he's saying and give the workers those taxes (AUDIO GAP) be withheld. That would give the private sector a lot more cover. Similarly -- and we have not talked much about this, Neil -- he could make the federal government go back to work. Washington, D.C., is a ghost town right now, because all of these agencies are just not sending folks back to work. The president has the ability, the administration has the ability to make the administration follow those rules. And that would give the private sector the cover they need to do what they need to, to get more money in the workers' pocket. So, the opportunity is there. The criticism is fair. The criticism is right. But there's a way out of it, if the federal government would lead the way."

We're kind of used to it, of a certain age, that, Burt, we accept debates. They weren't always the case. In 1960, it was precedent-breaking between JFK, Richard Nixon, but Richard Nixon maybe learned something from that experience, because, in '68 and '72, he opted not to debate his opponents. Didn't hurt him either time. He won both times. But I'm wondering how real of an impact it would have, with Americans getting used to these things, if we didn't have them."

And the reason we had them was not because of the issues that Pelosi and President Trump are dealing with now, issues of character. It's issues of politics. Both Kennedy and Nixon felt they had something to gain if they did a debate. Nixon was experienced, two-term vice president. And he thought he would win. Kennedy wanted to appear statesmanlike, that he belonged on the stage. And so both of them had reason to debate. And they did it. But, as you point out, Nixon did not do so in 1968 or '72. Neither did Lyndon Johnson in 1964."

Was she ceding any fears that Democrats have that Biden, in an unscripted debate format, might not be as smooth or fast on his feet, and might suffer in the polls as a result? Normally, it's the leader that sort of rolls the dice and says, I don't need this. But polls can be fleeting. But who stands to lose more if we don't have debates?"

Thus, the Democrats have felt the need to employ the Lyndon Johnson strategy, or the Nixon strategy in 1970, avoid the debates, because you have a big lead. But that big lead has been shrinking this week with the Republican Convention. As Trump narrows the margin, I think Joe Biden will feel he has to debate or, in fact, he will lose credibility. Gerald Ford debated Carter in 1976. That was the renewal of the presidential debates, again, because both felt they had something to gain."

He thought he could crush him like a bug. The polls were oddly enough still tight at the time, with no hint of the blowout to come.

And I have got -- I have got four things that I suggest we need to do, three of them involving passing legislation in 2021, after he took office next January. He would pass three bills. And then he would reauthorize a federal appropriation for hospitals treating pandemic patients, which was coming up In may to be renewed, which Congress renews routinely. So he had no idea. And then I looked at what his people were saying, and it got worse. He's surrounded by advisers like Ron Klain and Zeke Emanuel and Lisa Monaco, who were advising him, will all become members of his health advisory committee, and they're saying bizarre things are. This isn't going to be a pandemic. Travel bans don't work. That the first American dies of COVID in Kirkland, Washington, Zeke Emanuel is on a program -- I think it was NPR -- and says, don't go out and buy a mask because it won't work. And they were dismissive that it was going to get serious. One of them says all, oh, this -- the likelihood of this being serious is very low. Emanuel says, as it get warms up, it's going to move to the Southern Hemisphere, just like the flu does, this is not going to be that serious. So the idea that some -- I mean, think about this. In January, February and March, several words never crossed the lips of the former vice president of the United States, masks, social distancing. Never crossed it. Lockdowns, never crossed his mind. He is in mid -- on March 9 has a rally as late as that. As late as early April, he's talking about the utility of voting in-person, as opposed to doing a mail-in ballot. So the idea that he is somehow on top of this is baloney. And he knows it, because he now -- you will notice in his address, he said, just like I have been saying since March, and then he had a couple of other quotes where he suggested that was even earlier that he had laid out a plan of action. A dead giveaway was, he went on the Joy Reid show, first interview. This was about three weeks ago. She says to him now, assume you get elected president. What would you do next January? And he lists six things, all of which were already being done by the administration. He said, I would invoke the Defense Production Act. Already done. I'd appoint somebody to be in charge of speeding up vaccines and their distribution. That happened in May. I mean, it's just -- it is a remarkable rewriting of history. And the media goes along with this because it's easier to do so than to say, really, what about this statement that you made in January? What about this statements you made in March?"

So, yes, look, it's just -- everybody -- one thing I learned with when thinking about this with -- in the Bush era with SARS and so forth was, you don't -- you never know exactly how this is going to proceed. And the idea that somehow or another Joe Biden had a magic plan that, if we'd only followed it -- he made statements recently that 56,000 people -- and then he later said 30-some-odd-thousand people would not have died had Trump followed his advice. Well, there was no advice that he gave that if, only one week earlier, he had acted, people would not have died. Well, you weren't giving the advice that was needed.

      "utterance": "Yes. Well, you're absolutely right. And, I mean, they already sent two teams from FEMA out of Colorado and Ohio down here. They granted us a state of emergency, which we desperately needed. That allows me to put my police officers and my firemen out during these times of emergency and allow them -- to be able to pay them overtime, so that we can get reimbursed. So, yes, this has been a very collaborative effort from the federal government, state government and local entities as well. So, we're grateful for that. And we're going to use -- utilize the resources as best as possible, so we can maintain safety even post-storm."

      "utterance": "But we appreciate it very, very much. Adrian Perkins is the mayor of Shreveport, Louisiana. Again, we are learning, and the president does plan to visit the area, the Gulf Coast region, this weekend. So, we will keep you posted on that. Also keeping you posted on the president getting ready for his big speech to the nation tonight at the South Lawn of the White House. There will be fireworks, everything else. No doubt he will be addressing some of the issues that came up with that storm and the federal government and its full capacity to try to help anyone and everyone out. And I have a feeling law and order issues will come up, something that, sure, enough did come up when Kamala Harris was speaking to the press earlier today. We will have more on that after this."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. Kamala Harris had a chance earlier today to address some of the problems she sees coming out of the Democratic Convention here. The fact of the matter is, though, that all of this is coming at a time Democrats might be getting concerned about a law and order issue and other issues that seem to be sticking for Republicans. Jackie DeAngelis on what's going on, on that front -- Jackie. Oh, I'm sorry."

    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICH",
      "utterance": "That's all right, Neil. That's all right. There are two Jacquis. It's understandable. Democrats, Neil, are strongly refuting Republicans' claims that people won't be safe in Joe Biden's America, this as President Trump tries to paint himself as the law and order president. You saw Biden give two surprise live TV network interviews today. Senator Kamala Harris just delivered remarks about a half-mile from the White House. Harris focused on justice. She began by addressing the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin. She clearly stated support for the people taking to the streets in protest, but didn't outright condemn violence that ensued after, instead saying people must not confuse peaceful protest with acts of looting and violence, including the Wisconsin shooter now accused of murder. She then repeated past criticism of the administration's handling of the pandemic and economic crisis, contrasting the Democrats' national strategy."

      "speaker": "HEINRICH",
      "utterance": "Biden very clearly condemned the violence in Kenosha, accusing Republicans of using the unrest for political gain, calling out White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who earlier today said -- quote -- \"The more chaos and violence, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best for public safety and law and order.\""

    {
      "speaker": "BIDEN",
      "utterance": "These guys are rooting for violence. That's what it's all about. To prove that you should be scared of Joe Biden, they're pointing to what's happening in Donald Trump's America? It takes everybody's eye off the ball. You want to talk about safety, look at the biggest safety issue in the nation, COVID."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICH",
      "utterance": "Biden got out, and he did a couple of interviews that nobody knew about in advance. I think that what's really going to matter in this election is, there are just a few states that are going to make the difference? Wisconsin is one of them. That's where this violence is unfolding. And Republicans are pushing this message that Biden is soft on public safety. He's really trying to counter that message. And it has to come from him. He is the top of the ticket."

Well, speaking of all things politics and the fallout from the final night of the convention, we will be covering it live on FOX Business tonight, as the president gets ready to address the nation from the South Lawn. There will be fireworks. There will be a lot of give-and-take. There will be market reaction. There will be everything on FOX Business beginning at 8:00 p.m. tonight right through as -- well, as long as it takes.
