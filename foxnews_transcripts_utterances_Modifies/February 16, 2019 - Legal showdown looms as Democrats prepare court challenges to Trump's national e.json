It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” This is a Fox News alert. Police is saying the suspect in an Aurora, Illinois industrial park shooting has been neutralized. According to the city of Aurora, four police officers were wounded in the incident and are in stable condition. We go now to Jonathan Hunt for the latest. Jonathan.",

      "sentences": "Dana, the first 9-11 calls came in at around 1:40 central time, that's 2:40 p.m. eastern. Now, we do not know from officials how this incident played out exactly. We are expecting a news conference with local police and other officials at the bottom of the hour. They will give us the blow-by-blow of what they know.  But what we have heard from eyewitnesses is that a worker at the Henry Pratt Company, which is the building you are looking at right there, checked in for work like it was any normal day this morning. And several hours later suddenly began running through that building in the words of this eyewitness, \"shooting everyone.\"  We know officially now that four police officers were wounded in this. We assume and it is only an assumption at this point that they were among the first officers to respond after those initial 9-11 calls. We are also being told that all four of those are in stable condition. Beyond that, we do not know the extent of their injuries. We also do know, though, that the coroner is now on scene. Obviously a coroner is only called in if there are bodies to be dealt with. So again, our assumption here with the coroner on scene is that at least one person is dead. Whether that is a victim or whether that is indeed the shooter, we do not know. The language that officials have used regarding the shooter has changed.  The first word we got was from the city of Aurora. They said the shooter had been \"apprehended.\" Then a city of Aurora spokesman later changed that talking with (inaudible) news team to the shooter has been \"neutralized.\" And then Aurora police said the shooter is no longer a threat. So, all of these questions -- what is the condition of the shooter? What is the condition of those injured? We hope to get some answers too in the next 30 minutes or so. But the bottom line, there has been a mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois, west of Chicago. The shooter is neutralized, whatever that means according to officials.  There is no longer a threat. Schools in the area went on immediate lockdown. They have now been told they can lift that lockdown and parents can go and pick up their children, so a sense of relief now there. The area was flooded with first responders, SWAT officers. We saw them at one point rushing into the building and that appeared to coincide with those first reports we got that the shooter had been apprehended.   Now we have seen a lot of those first responders standing around far more relaxed fashion, weapons down. Clearly the threat is over as Aurora police have told us, but we wait now, Dana, to find out the details from officials of exactly what prompted this shooting and exactly what is the condition of those four police officers who were hurt, and any other people who were shot in this attack, Dana.",

At that time America was being compared to Nazi Germany because we were separating -- remember we were separating families and putting children in cages. It was a horrifying humanitarian crisis. So you finally get that the president to agree that this is an unacceptable situation and we should apply some solutions, and some of the Democrats are mocking it. It's no longer an emergency even though we said that it was like Nazi Germany just months ago. So for the media and for the Democrats, the caravan is a national emergency until it's no longer visual. So, what you are left with are adults trying to solve the underlying issue that led to this crisis, which is, I mean, think about this.  Whether it is terror or mass shootings, you don't just assume everything is fine when the attack is over. You go back and you figure out how do you prevent that.

And, you know, the police that are working with him are saying listen, can you hand this stuff over because in the form that you are handing them over, there is not enough information here for us to be able to tell if you were on the phone with your agents and people were making racist or homophobic slurs in the background. We need to be able hear that so that we can figure out what happened here. We can corroborate your story and we can get the people who did so.

In this case it was a racist homophobic mysterious men that turns out that half of that is gone. It's not racist, right? That part of the piece is gone. But the media will not -- the media will adjust their narrative without admitting their error. They won't say, oops we were wrong on that. Maybe it's just a homophobic attack. To your point, it's an attack. But it's like they kind of ignored the fact that they were wrong on that as well as attributing this to an atmosphere that encourages hostility. This whole thing like, well, this is happening in Trump's America. Even if it's a strange story with a lot of weird holes and some things don't make sense.

I don't want to believe that he planned it because I don't believe anybody would be sick enough to risk a race war in order to keep his job on a T.V. show. So I'm hoping that that's not true.

It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” This is a Fox News alert. Police is saying the suspect in an Aurora, Illinois industrial park shooting has been neutralized. According to the city of Aurora, four police officers were wounded in the incident and are in stable condition. We go now to Jonathan Hunt for the latest. Jonathan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Dana, the first 9-11 calls came in at around 1:40 central time, that's 2:40 p.m. eastern. Now, we do not know from officials how this incident played out exactly. We are expecting a news conference with local police and other officials at the bottom of the hour. They will give us the blow-by-blow of what they know. But what we have heard from eyewitnesses is that a worker at the Henry Pratt Company, which is the building you are looking at right there, checked in for work like it was any normal day this morning. And several hours later suddenly began running through that building in the words of this eyewitness, \"shooting everyone.\" We know officially now that four police officers were wounded in this. We assume and it is only an assumption at this point that they were among the first officers to respond after those initial 9-11 calls. We are also being told that all four of those are in stable condition. Beyond that, we do not know the extent of their injuries. We also do know, though, that the coroner is now on scene. Obviously a coroner is only called in if there are bodies to be dealt with. So again, our assumption here with the coroner on scene is that at least one person is dead. Whether that is a victim or whether that is indeed the shooter, we do not know. The language that officials have used regarding the shooter has changed. The first word we got was from the city of Aurora. They said the shooter had been \"apprehended.\" Then a city of Aurora spokesman later changed that talking with (inaudible) news team to the shooter has been \"neutralized.\" And then Aurora police said the shooter is no longer a threat. So, all of these questions -- what is the condition of the shooter? What is the condition of those injured? We hope to get some answers too in the next 30 minutes or so. But the bottom line, there has been a mass shooting in Aurora, Illinois, west of Chicago. The shooter is neutralized, whatever that means according to officials. There is no longer a threat. Schools in the area went on immediate lockdown. They have now been told they can lift that lockdown and parents can go and pick up their children, so a sense of relief now there. The area was flooded with first responders, SWAT officers. We saw them at one point rushing into the building and that appeared to coincide with those first reports we got that the shooter had been apprehended. Now we have seen a lot of those first responders standing around far more relaxed fashion, weapons down. Clearly the threat is over as Aurora police have told us, but we wait now, Dana, to find out the details from officials of exactly what prompted this shooting and exactly what is the condition of those four police officers who were hurt, and any other people who were shot in this attack, Dana."

At that time America was being compared to Nazi Germany because we were separating -- remember we were separating families and putting children in cages. It was a horrifying humanitarian crisis. So you finally get that the president to agree that this is an unacceptable situation and we should apply some solutions, and some of the Democrats are mocking it. It's no longer an emergency even though we said that it was like Nazi Germany just months ago. So for the media and for the Democrats, the caravan is a national emergency until it's no longer visual. So, what you are left with are adults trying to solve the underlying issue that led to this crisis, which is, I mean, think about this. Whether it is terror or mass shootings, you don't just assume everything is fine when the attack is over. You go back and you figure out how do you prevent that. That's all that is going on right now. And to laugh at this and say it's not a humanitarian crisis, you were the same people screaming bloody murder that it was."

I am not getting any help from Democrats. They are not interested at this point in calling this what it is which is a national emergency because to do that would give me a victory in 2020 or it gives some credence to what I've been saying. So unless I actually declare this and figure out a way to move some of this money around, I'm not going to get the money for the wall.

Smollett claiming two people hurled racist, homophobic slurs at him and told him \"This is MAGA country.\" The suspects have now been identified by police as Nigerian brothers.

It seems to change, but we had these reports in Chicago suggesting that maybe this was something that was staged with these men. One of them had been an extra on the \"Empire\" show because Smollett was worried that he was going to be written out of the script of \"Empire.\" What do you make of that?"

And where did those reports originate from because once those reports came out, the Chicago local police came out immediately and said, there is -- we're not going to substantiate this. He's not being investigated. We are not confirming these reports. I don't know what happened here and I don't think any of us do and it remains to be seen. That's why an investigation needs to happen. The thing that interests me most still is his phone records though because now he has turned over his phone records 13 days later, but they are redacted. They are not complete. And, you know, the police that are working with him are saying listen, can you hand this stuff over because in the form that you are handing them over, there is not enough information here for us to be able to tell if you were on the phone with your agents and people were making racist or homophobic slurs in the background. We need to be able hear that so that we can figure out what happened here. We can corroborate your story and we can get the people who did so. My only struggle with this story is why has he not turned that over and if he wants this to be a criminal investigation? Without that information it doesn't meet the burden of proof for a criminal investigation. So that's my struggle here. Why not? Why not just hand them over?"

So Pete, what's interesting is of course, the subtext to this is people saying well maybe this guy made it up. Maybe he is attacking President Trump and \"Make America Great Again\" and the hat. So he says in the interview -- he wouldn't need to mention a MAGA hat because that is like putting a cherry on racist sundae. He said these men called him a homophobic slur and the \"N\" word."

I appreciate how careful and restrained we are on this story and how careful and restrained the media is everywhere on this story. Nothing like the Covington story. You want to compare stories. Let's compare the Covington story to the Smollett story, OK. There are two similar -- the similarity in the rush to judge a specific group. In this case it was the Covington kids. In this case it was a racist homophobic mysterious men that turns out that half of that is gone. It's not racist, right? That part of the piece is gone. But the media will not -- the media will adjust their narrative without admitting their error. They won't say, oops we were wrong on that. Maybe it's just a homophobic attack. To your point, it's an attack. But it's like they kind of ignored the fact that they were wrong on that as well as attributing this to an atmosphere that encourages hostility. This whole thing like, well, this is happening in Trump's America. Even if it's a strange story with a lot of weird holes and some things don't make sense. But you know what, it's about surging hostility and it's about smearing Trump and Trump values. Modern-day lynchings, those were the words that were being used. A lot of this stuff happened in the beginning, in the rush it judgment. And now, we're looking at it and we're going, OK, there is something else going on here. I don't want to believe that he planned it because I don't believe anybody would be sick enough to risk a race war in order to keep his job on a T.V. show. So I'm hoping that that's not true. He might have known these guys. These guys might have planted story. It's extremely strange. But it's the media in my mind that is at fault about this because they created atmosphere that makes it quick to judge anybody. The assumptions are that this is the type of person who did it. It's the rush. It happened with Covington and it happened here and we don't know how this is going to end. We don't know what these guys did. These guys might be innocent. Who knows?"

Yes, three boys use their money to buy flowers for every female at the school. That included 270 schoolgirls and 70 women on the school staff. On Valentine's Day they stood at the door and handed out a flower to every female coming in. By the way one of the boys is named Tristan Valentine. He said \"We wanted to make every girl feel important and special\". Way to go Romeo or should I say way to go Mr. Valentine."
