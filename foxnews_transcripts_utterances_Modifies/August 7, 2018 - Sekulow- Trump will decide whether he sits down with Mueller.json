      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we have huge major breaking news on multiple fronts, including election results from five states. We're going to be updating the numbers as they continue to roll in.  But, first, a shocking breaking news report from John Solomon. It is even worse than we originally thought. Tonight, we now have clear evidence that former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr was at the very center of the Clinton campaign's effort to influence, yes, and rig the election, and actually by using your federal government as a tool to do this against Donald Trump. Now, this is worse than we ever thought.  Now, newly declassified text personal memos, handwritten notes from Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele tonight are showing what is a coordinated effort between the Clinton campaign, the Obama administration to use the infamous Clinton bought and paid for dirty dossier to drag down Donald Trump vote before and after the election.  We're going to have all the damning new details coming up. Plus, reaction, John Solomon, and Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows. This is a huge breaking story. Also, tonight, must be a slow week for the destroy Trump press as they continue to push the same old, fake, phony, recycled scandal about the infamous meeting at Trump Tower. Now, we're going to call them out once again. And if you thought they couldn't get any more abusively biased, all the fake news media, they rolled out longtime Trump hater Rosie O'Donnell to bash the president. We have all the lowlights.  Now, plus, the left's hypocrisy on full display last night. The West Hollywood City voting unanimously to remove Donald Trump's star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, citing his disturbing treatment of women. Oh, meanwhile, Bill Cosby's star is there, Brett Rattner's star is there. Kevin Spacey star is there, totally intact. And we'll also show you all the updates from day six of the trial of the century, the 2005 tax case of Paul Manafort. By the way, an incredible exchange between team Mueller and Judge Ellis, apparently, Mueller's guy was in tears.  Now, sit tight. It's time for tonight's important breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right. For over a year, we have been reporting accurately and now we know more about Bruce Ohr's suspicious ties to Fusion GPS. Remember his wife Nellie Ohr actually worked with Christopher Steel for Fusion GPS, and the ones that put together the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dirty dossier. And as you know, the dossier was a campaign op research document put together by Steele himself. He doesn't stand by it. A former foreign spy, full of Russian lies, full of misinformation, full of propaganda, Hillary paid for it, the DNC paid for it, all by funneling money through a law firm to Fusion GPS.   And now, according to John Solomon's reporting tonight, we have clear evidence that Bruce Ohr, the fourth most powerful person in the Obama Justice Department was working hand-in-hand with Christopher Steele and Hillary Clinton's op research team both before and after the election, clearly to stop President Trump from winning the election, and then after he won the election literally destroy him with the Clinton funded Russian lies that nobody ever verified and has now been totally debunked. Now, let's take a look at some of the most damning evidence. Look at this, July 1st, 2016, Christopher Steele reaches out to Bruce Ohr, wrote, quote: There is something separate I wanted to discuss with you informally and separately, it concerns our favorite -- well, business tycoon. Now, that clear reference was to then candidate, President Trump, that was followed up on July 30 of 2016, three months before election day. Steele met Bruce and Nellie Ohr for breakfast.  Now, this was a meet-up that was documented by this text. Quote: Great to see you and Nellie this morning, Bruce. Let's keep in touch on the substantive issues. Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, is happy to speak to you on this if it would help.   Now, just one day later, one day, anti-Trump FBI investigator Peter Strzok, he opened up the investigation into the phony claims of Trump-Russia collusion. Do you see how this is all coming together? And after the election ended, and President Trump was sworn in, which they didn't think would happen? Well, then, the communication even continued now on January 31st 2017, president, now president, just sworn in. Steele texted Ohr, quote: Just want to check you are OK, still in the situation and able to help locally as discussed along with your bureau colleagues.  Now, this text is actually damning for two reasons. One, it shows that Bruce Ohr was, in fact, feeding the FBI, steals lies, misinformation and propaganda. And number two, it shows the FBI was breaking their own protocol, their own rules. Steele had been barred from working with the FBI in November of 2016 because of his leaking to the news media. And let's also keep in mind the major role that this Steele Clinton paid for dirty dossier played in the FISA applications against the Trump campaign associate Carter Page. We now have proof. Bruce Ohr likely funneled the dossier to the FBI a document or new was up research bought and paid for by the opposing political party in an election year.  And remember just that yesterday on this program, House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunez, he revealed exculpatory evidence was completely omitted from the FBI's FISA applications against Carter Page.

They use Clinton campaign material, never verified, never corroborated. The phony Russian dossier to rig a FISA court application, lying to judges to spy on team Trump. Then they use, the very same op research that she paid for to open up a phony Russia collusion investigation into then candidate Trump.  And then they leaked the contents of the dossier to the press because they wanted to influence the election in favor of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump and lie to you the American people and on top of it all, the FBI, on top of Hillary paying Steele, through Fusion GPS, and the DNC paying them, the FBI paid them. The FBI made 11 payments to Christopher Steele.  I have been saying and now it has all come together, the biggest political corruption, abuse of power scandal in our lifetime, this should outrage every single American I don't care what your political affiliation is. Let me say this slowly. They try to steal in the United States of America a presidential election, and we have the evidence. In other words, they abuse their power to steal an election, a presidential election. Our Justice Department has been weaponized for pure partisan political gain. We have so much on this major development. We're going to talk to John Solomon and Mark Meadows in just a minute.   But in other news, just the latest example of why so many Americans can't trust the media. They've been missing in action on that scandal. Last night, we called them out again for hyping up yet another fake news story about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr. and the, quote, Russian lawyer -- oh they met before with GPS and after the Fusion GPS. Anyway, they claim the president finally admitted to collusion. That's what you have now been hearing for days and days and days. They said there was stunning new evidence that the Trump Tower meeting was political. OK, it ended up being about adoption.  None of this is new. Zero. None of this is stunning. None of this is collusion. We've known for more than a year that Donald Trump Jr. took the meeting, yes, because like everybody else -- oh like Adam Schiff and Hillary Clinton, yes, everybody wants oh, op research on their political opponents.  That didn't stop the media even though we've known him for well over year and the president said it from recycling a fake scandal two days in a row -- oh frankly, all weekend. Take a look.",

Oh, how devastating, from the Hollywood hall of -- walk of fame, in part because of Trump's, quote, disturbing treatment of women. OK. The move is nonbinding. However, because the West Hollywood City Council is no authority over the walk, let's take a look at the stars' not targeted last night by the West Hollywood City Council.  There we have Bill Cosby recently found guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, and you have dozens of other similar allegations levied against Bill Cosby. Oh, there he is, Kevin Spacey. Oh, yes, he's facing tons of accusations of sexual misconduct for more than 10 people, including multiple victims who allegedly abused in their early teens. You got Brett Ratner he's been accused by multiple women of serious sexual misconduct and assault. Jeffrey Tambor, Oliver Stone, and many others. But the West City Council is saying, their vote has nothing to do with politics, whatsoever.  And finally tonight, day six of the biggest trial of the century, the 2005 tax case of Paul Manafort, well, it's come to a close, but not without a very tense moment between team Mueller and Judge Ellis. Now, according to reports, the judge reprimanded prosecutor in court and then accused him of tearing up. This would be Mueller's guy.  And Judge Ellis repeatedly clashing from day one with members of Mueller's legal team often questioning the relevance of, quote, the evidence or so- called evidence presented in court.  Meanwhile, the prosecution's star witness Rick Gates, he continued his testimony from the stand Manafort's defense attorney -- oh, they raise serious questions about the character of the star witness, including all the instances he actually -- let's see -- embezzled a ton of money from Paul Manafort, the defense team accused Gates of using the money to fund secret life and an affair in London. And despite all of that, the odds are definitely stacked against Paul Manafort who currently faces a potential life sentence. This is a 2005 case. And remember what the judge said -- to put the screws to Manafort, to make them sing or compose, so they'll get information, so they can get Trump.  They started with his lifestyle. They talked about oligarchs. Then we got the Mueller team guy tearing up in court. And the judge ripping him saying, look at me. I think the judge knows what's going on here. I think it's pretty obvious but because Rob Rosenstein's mandate was so broad and this has nothing to do with Russia, nothing, nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with Trump, nothing to do with the election at all. Well, it's going -- this is what Mueller gives us. Here with more details, reaction to our top story surrounding Bruce Ohr's connection to Glenn Simpson, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, and from \"The Hill\", John Solomon.

And he's not just anybody. He's the deputy to the deputy attorney general. That means the same Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates who signed the FISA warrant for Carter Page, her man is meeting outside of the FBI with the primary sources that Hillary Clinton dug up and he's coordinating. In the beginning, he's finding out what's going on and he's talking then when Christopher Steele is fired by the FBI, he's told -- the FBI told him, you're no longer suitable as an asset to be a source and you may not gather any more information under the color of the FBI.  And what happens 21 days later, Bruce Ohr is gathering information for Steele and giving it to the FBI and Pete Strzok is right there playing wide receiver catching it. It's extraordinary. The FBI is violating its own rules, it's probably misleading the FISA court. The Justice Department has kept us in the dark about this for 18 months. We'll see tomorrow how good the media is.

So you have to start with, the question whether the president would sit for an interview. What the proposition is there are constitutional basis upon that interview can take place. Now frankly, it's the position of the legal team and it's been a pretty clear on this in the last couple weeks, that our position is that there's not a constitutional basis to move an interview forward. And what I mean by that is the article two power of the presidency is very clear. And the idea that you have a series of questions involving the president's motives for particular actions as it relates to article two power, would frankly be inappropriate in our view, unconstitutional. So then you ask yourself, does that answer your question? Well, look, the president has stated that he wants to do an interview. I will tell you the position of the legal team is that we do not advise that. However, there continues to be ongoing discussions and dialogue with the office of special counsel to see if there is something that can be worked out, that we would be comfortable with.

This idea, there's been no evidence put forward on any type of collusion between the president and Russian. I mean, no one has put evidence forward on that. Now that's number one. Number two, let me tell you this. When people say the word obstruction, I want everybody to understand the context in which this is arising. This is arising in decisions that the president makes under his authority under article two, who is going to work for him, who's not going to work for him, where things are developed were they're not. What policy positions they take, what policy positions they do not. The idea that that would constitute some kind of violation of the law, to me, it seems not only a bizarre legal theory and untested but frankly, out of order under our Constitution. But let's go back. You're using these examples of the people involved in the investigation on the legal team. Let's go to what started this investigation in the first place. You had an unverified dossier put together by Christopher Steele who ends up getting fired by the FBI for linking. James Comey wants a special counsel so he leaks a memo that he created based on a conversation that he had with the president. Now if an FBI agent did that could you imagine the repercussions of leaking that memo? But it gets even better. You've the number four at the United States Department of Justice, I know you've already talked about this, Bruce Ohr, whose wife is working for a Fusion GPS, Nellie Ohr. And what is her job? Her job is to work with Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who's putting together the dossier against the president. Now you know what? The fact is, no one could -- it's hard to believe that those are really the facts. You know what the problem is, Sean? Those are the facts. And really no one has disputed any of those facts. So the problem here is a foundational problem, that's why I say the irregularities in the corruption involved in the process from the beginning is a really unprecedented. So, all of that factors into the decision that's ultimately made, whether there will be an interview or not.",

In the Columbus area of Ohio it pits Republican Troy Balderson against Danny O'Connor, a neck and neck race. We knew it was going to be close for this U.S. House seat long held by the Republicans, it's even closer than we thought.

The Democrat had a slight edge by about 155 votes, right now with 89 percent in. Troy Balderson the Republican is up by .6 percentage points or essentially, about a thousand votes.

We're going to be updating the numbers as they continue to roll in. But, first, a shocking breaking news report from John Solomon. It is even worse than we originally thought. Tonight, we now have clear evidence that former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr was at the very center of the Clinton campaign's effort to influence, yes, and rig the election, and actually by using your federal government as a tool to do this against Donald Trump. Now, this is worse than we ever thought. Now, newly declassified text personal memos, handwritten notes from Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele tonight are showing what is a coordinated effort between the Clinton campaign, the Obama administration to use the infamous Clinton bought and paid for dirty dossier to drag down Donald Trump vote before and after the election. We're going to have all the damning new details coming up. Plus, reaction, John Solomon, and Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows. This is a huge breaking story. Also, tonight, must be a slow week for the destroy Trump press as they continue to push the same old, fake, phony, recycled scandal about the infamous meeting at Trump Tower. Now, we're going to call them out once again. And if you thought they couldn't get any more abusively biased, all the fake news media, they rolled out longtime Trump hater Rosie O'Donnell to bash the president. We have all the lowlights. Now, plus, the left's hypocrisy on full display last night. The West Hollywood City voting unanimously to remove Donald Trump's star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, citing his disturbing treatment of women. Oh, meanwhile, Bill Cosby's star is there, Brett Rattner's star is there. Kevin Spacey star is there, totally intact. And we'll also show you all the updates from day six of the trial of the century, the 2005 tax case of Paul Manafort. By the way, an incredible exchange between team Mueller and Judge Ellis, apparently, Mueller's guy was in tears. Now, sit tight. It's time for tonight's important breaking news opening monologue."

      "utterance": "All right. For over a year, we have been reporting accurately and now we know more about Bruce Ohr's suspicious ties to Fusion GPS. Remember his wife Nellie Ohr actually worked with Christopher Steel for Fusion GPS, and the ones that put together the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dirty dossier. And as you know, the dossier was a campaign op research document put together by Steele himself. He doesn't stand by it. A former foreign spy, full of Russian lies, full of misinformation, full of propaganda, Hillary paid for it, the DNC paid for it, all by funneling money through a law firm to Fusion GPS. And now, according to John Solomon's reporting tonight, we have clear evidence that Bruce Ohr, the fourth most powerful person in the Obama Justice Department was working hand-in-hand with Christopher Steele and Hillary Clinton's op research team both before and after the election, clearly to stop President Trump from winning the election, and then after he won the election literally destroy him with the Clinton funded Russian lies that nobody ever verified and has now been totally debunked. Now, let's take a look at some of the most damning evidence. Look at this, July 1st, 2016, Christopher Steele reaches out to Bruce Ohr, wrote, quote: There is something separate I wanted to discuss with you informally and separately, it concerns our favorite -- well, business tycoon. Now, that clear reference was to then candidate, President Trump, that was followed up on July 30 of 2016, three months before election day. Steele met Bruce and Nellie Ohr for breakfast."

      "utterance": "Great to see you and Nellie this morning, Bruce. Let's keep in touch on the substantive issues. Glenn Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, is happy to speak to you on this if it would help. Now, just one day later, one day, anti-Trump FBI investigator Peter Strzok, he opened up the investigation into the phony claims of Trump-Russia collusion. Do you see how this is all coming together? And after the election ended, and President Trump was sworn in, which they didn't think would happen? Well, then, the communication even continued now on January 31st 2017, president, now president, just sworn in. Steele texted Ohr, quote: Just want to check you are OK, still in the situation and able to help locally as discussed along with your bureau colleagues. Now, this text is actually damning for two reasons. One, it shows that Bruce Ohr was, in fact, feeding the FBI, steals lies, misinformation and propaganda. And number two, it shows the FBI was breaking their own protocol, their own rules. Steele had been barred from working with the FBI in November of 2016 because of his leaking to the news media. And let's also keep in mind the major role that this Steele Clinton paid for dirty dossier played in the FISA applications against the Trump campaign associate Carter Page. We now have proof. Bruce Ohr likely funneled the dossier to the FBI a document or new was up research bought and paid for by the opposing political party in an election year. And remember just that yesterday on this program, House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunez, he revealed exculpatory evidence was completely omitted from the FBI's FISA applications against Carter Page.

This is Obama's Justice Department. Part of Obama's branch literally using your federal government, your tax dollars, in this case as a weapon against the Trump campaign and then later the president of the United States, President Trump himself. They use Clinton campaign material, never verified, never corroborated. The phony Russian dossier to rig a FISA court application, lying to judges to spy on team Trump. Then they use, the very same op research that she paid for to open up a phony Russia collusion investigation into then candidate Trump. And then they leaked the contents of the dossier to the press because they wanted to influence the election in favor of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump and lie to you the American people and on top of it all, the FBI, on top of Hillary paying Steele, through Fusion GPS, and the DNC paying them, the FBI paid them. The FBI made 11 payments to Christopher Steele. I have been saying and now it has all come together, the biggest political corruption, abuse of power scandal in our lifetime, this should outrage every single American I don't care what your political affiliation is. Let me say this slowly. They try to steal in the United States of America a presidential election, and we have the evidence. In other words, they abuse their power to steal an election, a presidential election. Our Justice Department has been weaponized for pure partisan political gain. We have so much on this major development. We're going to talk to John Solomon and Mark Meadows in just a minute. But in other news, just the latest example of why so many Americans can't trust the media. They've been missing in action on that scandal. Last night, we called them out again for hyping up yet another fake news story about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Don Jr. and the, quote, Russian lawyer -- oh they met before with GPS and after the Fusion GPS. Anyway, they claim the president finally admitted to collusion. That's what you have now been hearing for days and days and days. They said there was stunning new evidence that the Trump Tower meeting was political. OK, it ended up being about adoption. None of this is new. Zero. None of this is stunning. None of this is collusion. We've known for more than a year that Donald Trump Jr. took the meeting, yes, because like everybody else -- oh like Adam Schiff and Hillary Clinton, yes, everybody wants oh, op research on their political opponents. That didn't stop the media even though we've known him for well over year and the president said it from recycling a fake scandal two days in a row -- oh frankly, all weekend. Take a look."

And if you thought the media is biased couldn't get any worse -- well, think again. In order to bash President Trump, he got paid news CNN, conspiracy TV MSNBC rolling out the longest known sufferer of Trump derangement syndrome ever. There she is Rosie O'Donnell. Last night literally standing in front of the White House, leading a sing-along protest against her arch nemesis.

I'm sickened by Congress that doesn't call for articles of impeachment when we have so much evidence of his horrible high crimes and misdemeanors. Did they come in there and make Trump win when every single exit poll and every person in America knew for sure that Hillary Clinton was going to win? Do you think that there was anything to do with Russia or just a real big swirl for a Donald Trump in these specific areas with the same exact amount of votes that were needed? We're going to stand up at the polls and let him know and unless he goes in and has the Russians kind of fix it, like he did last night in 2016, you know, we're going to see him gone.

Last night, the West Hollywood City Council, they voted unanimously, they're removing Donald Trump's star. Oh, how devastating, from the Hollywood hall of -- walk of fame, in part because of Trump's, quote, disturbing treatment of women. OK. The move is nonbinding. However, because the West Hollywood City Council is no authority over the walk, let's take a look at the stars' not targeted last night by the West Hollywood City Council. There we have Bill Cosby recently found guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, and you have dozens of other similar allegations levied against Bill Cosby. Oh, there he is, Kevin Spacey. Oh, yes, he's facing tons of accusations of sexual misconduct for more than 10 people, including multiple victims who allegedly abused in their early teens. You got Brett Ratner he's been accused by multiple women of serious sexual misconduct and assault. Jeffrey Tambor, Oliver Stone, and many others. But the West City Council is saying, their vote has nothing to do with politics, whatsoever. And finally tonight, day six of the biggest trial of the century, the 2005 tax case of Paul Manafort, well, it's come to a close, but not without a very tense moment between team Mueller and Judge Ellis. Now, according to reports, the judge reprimanded prosecutor in court and then accused him of tearing up. This would be Mueller's guy. And Judge Ellis repeatedly clashing from day one with members of Mueller's legal team often questioning the relevance of, quote, the evidence or so- called evidence presented in court. Meanwhile, the prosecution's star witness Rick Gates, he continued his testimony from the stand Manafort's defense attorney -- oh, they raise serious questions about the character of the star witness, including all the instances he actually -- let's see -- embezzled a ton of money from Paul Manafort, the defense team accused Gates of using the money to fund secret life and an affair in London. And despite all of that, the odds are definitely stacked against Paul Manafort who currently faces a potential life sentence. This is a 2005 case. And remember what the judge said -- to put the screws to Manafort, to make them sing or compose, so they'll get information, so they can get Trump. They started with his lifestyle. They talked about oligarchs. Then we got the Mueller team guy tearing up in court. And the judge ripping him saying, look at me. I think the judge knows what's going on here. I think it's pretty obvious but because Rob Rosenstein's mandate was so broad and this has nothing to do with Russia, nothing, nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with Trump, nothing to do with the election at all. Well, it's going -- this is what Mueller gives us. Here with more details, reaction to our top story surrounding Bruce Ohr's connection to Glenn Simpson, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, and from \"The Hill\", John Solomon. John, it's your story. Let's get to the how a senior DOJ official helped Democratic researchers on the Russia case, before and after the election."

He was the glue that connected the Democratic opposition research effort to destroy Donald Trump during the election by accusing him of having ties to Russia with the Justice Department and the FBI. And he's not just anybody. He's the deputy to the deputy attorney general. That means the same Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates who signed the FISA warrant for Carter Page, her man is meeting outside of the FBI with the primary sources that Hillary Clinton dug up and he's coordinating. In the beginning, he's finding out what's going on and he's talking then when Christopher Steele is fired by the FBI, he's told -- the FBI told him, you're no longer suitable as an asset to be a source and you may not gather any more information under the color of the FBI. And what happens 21 days later, Bruce Ohr is gathering information for Steele and giving it to the FBI and Pete Strzok is right there playing wide receiver catching it. It's extraordinary. The FBI is violating its own rules, it's probably misleading the FISA court. The Justice Department has kept us in the dark about this for 18 months. We'll see tomorrow how good the media is. I'm going to put these documents up on \"The Hill\" Website. People can go read them themselves. Let's see if the media writes a month as much about this as they do about the Manafort trial."

As we now learn tonight from this reporting of John Solomon, this is deeper. This is more corrupt. There is a bigger abuse of power and obviously, they wanted the government tried their best -- the highest levels of the FBI and DOJ to defeat and then undermine a president in the United States.

Now, what we're also seeing is we're not talking about one or two or three contacts, there was over 60 different contacts made between Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele trying to get dirt and actually sell dirt on this president.

    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Sure. Well, the first thing is, look, you have to start with this proposition, the depth of corruption that led to this investigation and that frankly continues to permeate this investigation is unprecedented. So you have to start with that. You mentioned in the earlier segment the irregularities and that's being kind of what took place here. So you have to start with, the question whether the president would sit for an interview. What the proposition is there are constitutional basis upon that interview can take place. Now frankly, it's the position of the legal team and it's been a pretty clear on this in the last couple weeks, that our position is that there's not a constitutional basis to move an interview forward. And what I mean by that is the article two power of the presidency is very clear. And the idea that you have a series of questions involving the president's motives for particular actions as it relates to article two power, would frankly be inappropriate in our view, unconstitutional. So then you ask yourself, does that answer your question? Well, look, the president has stated that he wants to do an interview. I will tell you the position of the legal team is that we do not advise that. However, there continues to be ongoing discussions and dialogue with the office of special counsel to see if there is something that can be worked out, that we would be comfortable with. Short of that the answer of course is no. But if -- ultimately the one that makes that determination though, or the lawyers can advise is the president of the United States. So he will make that decision obviously in consultation with his legal team."

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",

      "utterance": "Look, clearly our inclination, look. Clearly the inclination is no and you could -- I could put a hundred lawyers in the room and a 100 of them are going to say that. I make the joke when I'm talking to reporters that, you know if we put the president up for an interview you will have 12 lawyers saying, I can't believe they did it. If you don't put the president up for an interview those same 12 lawyers are going to say what are they hiding. But if you look at the constitutional issues that are implicated by an interview, it's very serious. It raises very serious constitutional issues that go to the heart of what you mentioned earlier, separation of powers, article two authority, I've been saying that for a year and nothing has changed in that regard. Ultimately, the decision is up to the president, we will give advice but there aren't ongoing discussions to see if there could be something worked out here."

It turns out to be a hoax."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "There's two things here. First of all, I think we got to be clear on this. This idea, there's been no evidence put forward on any type of collusion between the president and Russian. I mean, no one has put evidence forward on that. Now that's number one. Number two, let me tell you this. When people say the word obstruction, I want everybody to understand the context in which this is arising. This is arising in decisions that the president makes under his authority under article two, who is going to work for him, who's not going to work for him, where things are developed were they're not. What policy positions they take, what policy positions they do not. The idea that that would constitute some kind of violation of the law, to me, it seems not only a bizarre legal theory and untested but frankly, out of order under our Constitution. But let's go back. You're using these examples of the people involved in the investigation on the legal team. Let's go to what started this investigation in the first place. You had an unverified dossier put together by Christopher Steele who ends up getting fired by the FBI for linking. James Comey wants a special counsel so he leaks a memo that he created based on a conversation that he had with the president. Now if an FBI agent did that could you imagine the repercussions of leaking that memo? But it gets even better. You've the number four at the United States Department of Justice, I know you've already talked about this, Bruce Ohr, whose wife is working for a Fusion GPS, Nellie Ohr. And what is her job? Her job is to work with Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence officer who's putting together the dossier against the president. Now you know what? The fact is, no one could -- it's hard to believe that those are really the facts. You know what the problem is, Sean? Those are the facts. And really no one has disputed any of those facts. So the problem here is a foundational problem, that's why I say the irregularities in the corruption involved in the process from the beginning is a really unprecedented. So, all of that factors into the decision that's ultimately made, whether there will be an interview or not."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "How is this going to end, when is this going to end?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "I think it ends soon, I cannot give you the date because here's what happens. Let me give you the process. Bob Mueller under his authority will issue a report. That report though does not go to the Congress. This is an independent counsel. We go to the deputy attorney general who is the acting attorney general and then he will determine what goes forward. At the same time quite frankly, we are developing a report that is going to lay out all of these issues that we've talked about. So that's how -- this is not a trial. And people need to -- I think people understand that, this is not a trial in the traditional sense of anything, this is a political process that is going forward, and I want to be clear here. The constitutional issues which is the reason I got -- I was involved in this case in the first place, in fact are the major issues that this issue -- that this investigation turns on. There are serious constitutional implications of this, not just for this president but for the presidency. And that's what history will remember. So that's why we got to be very careful and very direct on how we move forward."

As his, as council of the president we are not the White House counsel so that's a decision made within the context of the White House and their purview. That decision I'm sure is being discussed and the issues are being discussed, so I'm not going to -- I'm not going to defend what has or has not happened there because that's outside of our jurisdiction. Needless to say, and I think this is fair to say, and the American people are asking for this, transparency is important here. And I think one of the aspects of transparency is, what are in these documents. And if it doesn't put our national security at risk I would think that it should be something that should be released and declassified. But you know what, I said, you're not the president, I'm not the president either. I don't get to make those decisions."

In the Columbus area of Ohio it pits Republican Troy Balderson against Danny O'Connor, a neck and neck race. We knew it was going to be close for this U.S. House seat long held by the Republicans, it's even closer than we thought. The latest numbers show the two candidates tied basically at 49.7 percent each. With 85 percent of the votes in. But the Democrat has, well, it's just in a last moment. The Democrat had a slight edge by about 155 votes, right now with 89 percent in. Troy Balderson the Republican is up by .6 percentage points or essentially, about a thousand votes. So clearly, some of the latest votes coming in are from a county that favors Republicans.
