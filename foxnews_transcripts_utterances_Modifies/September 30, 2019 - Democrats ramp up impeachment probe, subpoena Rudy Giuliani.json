We have the former president of Poland, and we also have Devin Archer who's John Kerry's former foreign policy advisor. Very well-connected, very wealthy group of individuals, and they wanted to get the word out to their friends that this guy was a corrupt investigator and he needed to be fired. But, you know what? We found some documents that prove that was a disinformation campaign.   Burisma hired -- I believe it was a blue star strategies, a D.C. consulting firm to put out the fake news about the prosecutor that everybody bought, and then the guy gets fired, and the blue star strategy group came back to Ukraine and apologized for putting out all this fake information about their prosecutor. And the Ukrainian prosecutor who was fired testified under oath that he was fired because he wouldn't drop this investigation into the firm that Joe Biden's son was a member of. And, Joe Biden, the son, were never investigated. The Biden appointed prosecutor, who came in after the other guy was fired, never opened up an investigation into Joe Biden or his son.

So it's those documents that Congress is subpoenaing, not conversations between he and the president. And in terms of the executive privilege, that doesn't apply because he wasn't working -- because the whole point is to determine whether or not he was a vehicle acting on the president's personal behalf using an instrument of the state."

You don't -- if you want to get rid of this guy because of his personality, just realize this is going to come back and haunt you, because you're going to have half of America it's going to go after your guy or girl when this happens.

And there's a lot of fake news coming out of the Biden campaign, because they keep on saying that, you know what, everybody in Europe wanted this one prosecutor fired. And I thought to myself, hmm, I wonder why that is? And I went to start looking, and who was on the board of directors of Burisma, and guess what I found? Allan Actor from Renaissance Capital, the Russian investment bank that paid Bill Clinton a half a million dollars to speak in Moscow. He's the director. Then we have Cofer Black, CIA. We have the former president of Poland, and we also have Devin Archer who's John Kerry's former foreign policy advisor. Very well-connected, very wealthy group of individuals, and they wanted to get the word out to their friends that this guy was a corrupt investigator and he needed to be fired. But, you know what? We found some documents that prove that was a disinformation campaign. Burisma hired -- I believe it was a blue star strategies, a D.C. consulting firm to put out the fake news about the prosecutor that everybody bought, and then the guy gets fired, and the blue star strategy group came back to Ukraine and apologized for putting out all this fake information about their prosecutor. And the Ukrainian prosecutor who was fired testified under oath that he was fired because he wouldn't drop this investigation into the firm that Joe Biden's son was a member of. And, Joe Biden, the son, were never investigated. The Biden appointed prosecutor, who came in after the other guy was fired, never opened up an investigation into Joe Biden or his son. So, he never investigated him and he never cleared him, and I wanted to put that out there because there is a lot of fake news out there about this story."

So this is all been like a Cinderella slipper, you know? They've been searching for that one shoe that's going to fit, and they went through a warehouse of shoes before they got to this one.

And they've said how right-wing troll demonized Antifa to the mainstream media. And it was all about tearing him down and his credibility. But they are missing the forest for the trees, which is that Antifa is violent every time they are out. There's no separating violent from their actions no matter what ideology that they're hiding behind and whatever they are saying. So, it is up to people like the Portland mayor, Ted Wheeler, who came on this network, August 14th, and failed to take a hard stance, failed to say I will enforce and uphold the law in my town, and instead these guys are -- they are attacking everyone, helpless and elderly.

Of course, the real story is how accusations of Trump's nutty behavior always ends up with the accusers acting nuttier. De Niro calls Trump crazy as he goes crazier. Adam Schiff calls Trump a liar, as he makes up quotes. Dems talk about undermining institutions as they try to undermine an election. But when asked for reasons why Trump shouldn't be President, all Bobby had were sputtering F bombs, his resistance had run out of script. It was just another role without dialogue.
