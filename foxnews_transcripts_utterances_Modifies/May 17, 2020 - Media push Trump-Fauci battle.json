He's the doctor. He's the medical expert. He's bringing his best advice on that front. And he's very candidly and openly admitted that he's not in charge of making decisions about the economy. He hasn't been elected to anything. There are politicians and leaders like the president who have to weigh some of these varying factors. He just brings one of those to the table, a very important one, of course. I think a lot of the press has been stoking this narrative, Trump versus Fauci for a long time.

So you're looking at mass numbers. There are realities.

He's been solid and firm on that. And when it comes to the vaccine, you've not heard Fauci deviate from 12 to 18 months.

And then two, anything that might be done to reopen the economy and reverse those trends is killing grandparents. And you're an evil monster if you suggest it. So I think that pretty cynical. It's a lose-lose for the president. And I think that's just a fraction of the left. It's not the whole left or liberals that are doing that, but some certainly are. I would say the biggest element of media bias right now, and I think it is partisan is you look at how they are covering not just Trump but governors.   Blue state governors largely have gotten the pass. Red states governors have gotten all sorts of scrutiny, some of it very unfair. And we see outlets like Axios, CNN just over the weekend saying look at all these spiking cases in a place like Texas. And it's because they are doing more testing, right? Everyone was screaming for more testing. We are doing more testing. And the metric to follow is not total positive cases. It's percentage of positive tests and hospitalizations. I think that's deeply misleading. And it seems like there are different standards for governors depending on the letter next to their name.",

There were some 10,000 requests to unmask names last year, in 2019 and it averages 9, 10,000. But what we are going to get to, and to Guy's point, the Durham investigation shouldn't find that there was some connection between this list of un-maskers in the name of Flynn being leaked to The Washington Post.  Well, that's going to be a prosecution. Quickly one last point and that is we saw a tweet from Mark Zane (ph), the attorney who represented the whistleblower in the Ukraine call. He says he believes there may be reason to prosecute here, so it's far from over, and of course, with Lindsey Graham's hearing starting early June.",

There's no law that requires you to have a press conference. There's no law that requires you to answer every question, especially the stupid ones. And sometimes, people act like it's Trump's fault if he gets a dumb question and he throws it right back at him. I would say bravo.

Kaitlan Collins is wearing a mask and then there's other shows where as soon as the press conference was over in the White House with Kayleigh McEnany, she immediately takes it off and is rubbing shoulder to shoulder with other reporters.

He's the doctor. He's the medical expert. He's bringing his best advice on that front. And he's very candidly and openly admitted that he's not in charge of making decisions about the economy. He hasn't been elected to anything. There are politicians and leaders like the president who have to weigh some of these varying factors. He just brings one of those to the table, a very important one, of course. I think a lot of the press has been stoking this narrative, Trump versus Fauci for a long time.

So you're looking at mass numbers. There are realities. And the reality is a month ago we didn't have this deviation of Coronavirus that is affecting children that mimics Kawasaki Syndrome that we're seeing take place in New York and other places like Italy. There is a concern. I have two children. And I have to say I want our economy open. I love my kids. And I want them to go to school. But I want them to be alive. I want them to come home from school.

Now, Fauci has said from the beginning. I hope I'm wrong and get blamed for being too strict, because that will mean that we will have better numbers in flattening the curve. He has not deviated. He's been solid and firm on that. And when it comes to the vaccine, you've not heard Fauci deviate from 12 to 18 months. That statement about President Trump, vaccine or no vaccine we're back, is a shot at Fauci, and it helps feed, I think, the narrative that there is tension between the president and his top doctor."

One, we're going to trump depression or trump recession and look at the economy. It's tanking under this president. And then two, anything that might be done to reopen the economy and reverse those trends is killing grandparents. And you're an evil monster if you suggest it. So I think that pretty cynical. It's a lose-lose for the president. And I think that's just a fraction of the left. It's not the whole left or liberals that are doing that, but some certainly are. I would say the biggest element of media bias right now, and I think it is partisan is you look at how they are covering not just Trump but governors. Blue state governors largely have gotten the pass. Red states governors have gotten all sorts of scrutiny, some of it very unfair. And we see outlets like Axios, CNN just over the weekend saying look at all these spiking cases in a place like Texas. And it's because they are doing more testing, right? Everyone was screaming for more testing. We are doing more testing. And the metric to follow is not total positive cases. It's percentage of positive tests and hospitalizations. I think that's deeply misleading. And it seems like there are different standards for governors depending on the letter next to their name."

Sorry, you're going to lose your business. Sorry, this many restaurants are going to close, this many mom and shop coffee stores. No, every politician needs to say, look, I helped create jobs. I help to make things better. And politically, let's be honest. In an election year, Democrat or Republican, they are going the say if the economy is bad.

The political season is spinning that would be happening, whether it is a local newspaper, TV station or radio station, it's just absent, so it's a very difficult time. I would just chime in, by the way, you know, my mom had great saying about rooting for failure. She said no reason to shoot yourself in the foot despite your nose. However, I think you are seeing a little bit of a tone- deaf approach as some local officials from very frustrated business owners that don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, albeit local media or other small businesses."

And I think some of the reporting, as I alluded to earlier, has seemed to poll in a direction where the dark situation is portrayed too darkly where some of the good news isn't getting reported in the way that bad news is. And there's not enough context, I would say, but if things, let's say by September, October, aren't feeling a lot better for a lot of voters.

I think there is some question about what Barack Obama himself knew and when, because we learned that Sally Yates that the DOJ learned from the president, Barack Obama, herself -- from the president himself that this Flynn investigation was happening, and that seems interesting at the very least. I think we will know a lot more about who did what, and if there were crimes committed when John Durham swings into gear and either issues indictments or a report of some sort.

Second of all, President Obama is not going to be called and probably wouldn't appear if he were, and quite frankly I wouldn't blame him. This is -- if everybody wants to blame the left with Coronavirus of politics, this is politics of its finest. We have an election coming up. People forget that. This is a diversionary tactic, because the economy's not doing well. And also, because we're not able to reopen state by state as quickly as everyone would like, and this virus is something we can't seem to completely get under control. And of course, we can't get a vaccine as quickly as we would like and our very drive through world that we live in. And that's the reality. Obamagate is just a good headline."

Here is what the president had to say."

    {
      "speaker": "JENKINS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Here's the easy explanator. The crime that was committed was that Flynn's name was leaked to the media, on January 12th, the exact day that Biden requested. And that's why President Trump was mentioning it. Now, this list that includes top Obama officials that requesting the un- masking of Flynn's name are simply possible suspects of whom may have leaked it. We don't know and we may never know. On the other side of this is the view that this is a very common practice of the intelligence community uses. There were some 10,000 requests to unmask names last year, in 2019 and it averages 9, 10,000. But what we are going to get to, and to Guy's point, the Durham investigation shouldn't find that there was some connection between this list of un-maskers in the name of Flynn being leaked to The Washington Post. Well, that's going to be a prosecution. Quickly one last point and that is we saw a tweet from Mark Zane (ph), the attorney who represented the whistleblower in the Ukraine call. He says he believes there may be reason to prosecute here, so it's far from over, and of course, with Lindsey Graham's hearing starting early June."

And I think that a lot of people on the Democratic side have been leaking like sieves for a very long time to their friends in the press who have then reported it. And if Republicans go through, in this case, an official process of declassification and then that gets reported, oh, that's a problem. We have to worry about press. And then all of a sudden, it's not a real story anymore even though we were treated to nothing but Russia coverage for three years. This is another side of that same story.

I think it's interesting that Kaitlan Collins thought that she was in charge of the press conference and that she was going to take her opportunity for a question and toss it over to someone else. That's not how it works. If you get a question, you ask your question. If you don't want to ask a question and you want to give it to someone else, it is the prerogative of the person holding the press conference, in this case the president, to say no. If you want a question, you get it. Howard, there is something that I feel maybe needs to be said. I can say it as a person who has been on the president's side of the podium. There's no law that requires you to have a press conference. There's no law that requires you to answer every question, especially the stupid ones. And sometimes, people act like it's Trump's fault if he gets a dumb question and he throws it right back at him. I would say bravo. I'm glad he's doing it because it just really shows -- let me give you a great example. Kaitlan Collins is wearing a mask and then there's other shows where as soon as the press conference was over in the White House with Kayleigh McEnany, she immediately takes it off and is rubbing shoulder to shoulder with other reporters. So, this whole thing about every day asking, how come you're not wearing a mask, Mr. President? How come you're not wearing a mask? --"

To say that the president didn't take his advice is just on its face ridiculous. He has been at his side at every press conference for two months. He has allowed him to speak. He has invited him. He has deferred to him. He has followed his advice, for heaven's sake, to the point that he did shut down the economy, something that I think we all know the president was loath to do. So, that's, I think, ridiculous when people say the president hasn't listened to Fauci. I would remind you this. While the president certainly has listened to him, it's not his responsibility to be dictated to by anybody. The president was elected, Fauci wasn't.

It's not the top of the fold. It has not been the major story and it should be because this is a huge issue. I will take one point of disagreement with the president on this. I don't think President Obama should be forced to testify and the reason is not because he wouldn't have something to say, not because I don't think he was aware of the unmasking and may have ordered certain things, but I think it's the terrible precedent that we don't want to start because it has no end. But I do want to hear from James Comey, Clapper, Brennan, Strzok, Page, the whole lot of them. I think there were -- there was some extraordinary activity that sounds criminal to me and definitely should be looked into and accountability for these people who abuse the power of the United States government to first of all stage an attempted coup against the president and then cover up what they had done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, you say it sounds criminal to you. I would love to see the result of the investigation. The president says that the former president committed a crime and that may be jumping the gun on the process. But let me ask you this as we close up here -- as we finish up here. Whatever the importance of the unmasking story, the Obama story, the Mike Flynn case, all important and potentially important stories, don't you think that right now, most Americans are far more interested in the virus, going back to work, protecting their families, keeping their jobs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I think they are and they should be, but I don't want us to miss a story that I think is the single biggest political story, not just of the recent days but of certainly my lifetime, whether or not people at highest levels of government, not one or two, but multiple of justice and intel agencies sought to up-end an election and to destroy a dually elected president. I think it's a pretty big story because it goes to the heart of our liberties."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joe Biden was back on MSNBC the other night and once again he was asked this time by Lawrence O'Donnell about Tara Reade's allegations that he sexually assaulted her back in 1993. He addressed his answers to the voters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "If they believe Tara Reade, they probably shouldn't vote for me. I wouldn't vote for me if I believe Tara Reade. The fact is that -- look at Tara Reade's story. It changes considerably. I don't want to question her motive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now is Marie Harf, a Fox News contributor and former State Department spokesperson who runs the Serve America Pac. Marie, Joe Biden is right that Tara Reade has changed story over time with reporters. At the same time, Politico has a piece, interviewing a number of people who said that over the years, Tara Reade lied to them, was deceitful, didn't pay the rent, ripped them off, and generally spoke positively about Biden. So my question is two parts. Is Joe Biden turning more aggressive in use of television about these allegations and are stories like the one in Politico fair game?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I do think that the former vice president is getting more aggressive in answering questions about these allegations. Because they are serious allegations, he is called for a full investigation. And we have seen news organizations whether it's the Post or The New York Times or Politico, like you mentioned, really digging into Tara Reade's accusations. They've been trying to find any evidence that it happened and they are also looking at a pattern potentially of behavior by the person who is accusing Joe Biden of this very serious crime. So I do think it is fair game. He is called for journalists to look into every aspect of the story. I think it's fair when you're running for president and you make this kind of accusation, people should look into whether it happened and what your motives might be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. I don't think the fact that she had problems in the past mean she's not telling the truth, but we have to try to assess people's credibility. Now, I want to get you in on the virus question because President Trump drew a lot of media attention for saying that testing for the coronavirus may be overrated. Here is more of what he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We have more cases than anybody in the world. Why? It's because we do more testing. If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases. They don't want to write that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "They don't want to write that? The media don't want to write that there is a correlation between testing and positive results?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "The media have certainly written that, that the more you test, the more positive results you're going to get. They have also quoted scientific experts across the world, across the political spectrum, that testing is key to attacking this virus. We need to know how many people have it. And this is one of those situations, Howie, where the president says something that maybe dangerous or maybe factually inaccurate, and the press throughout his entire presidency has had a challenge for how to cover those things, because you do give the president -- you give both sides an opportunity to put forward their point of view. But when that point of view is dangerous or wrong, the press has really struggled with how to cover that accurately and paint a real portrait of what's going on at the White House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. You worked in the Obama State Department. There seems to be real split between conservative media that are playing up the accusations about Obama officials unmasking Mike Flynn and all of that and liberal media which are basically agreeing with Joe Biden that this is all a distraction. What is your take on the coverage of these accusations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "It really is like two completely different universes, Howie. You hit the nail on the head. I think what I have been paying attention to isn't the pundits on either side of this. It is the real down the middle news stories which make clear that in the Trump administration, tens of thousands of unmasking requests have been put forward, that these are all adjudicated by NSA and they don't approve of them unless there is a nationals security reason, and really focusing on the facts here. We have seen so many conspiracy theories spread on the internet, particularly about what did or didn't happen in the Russia investigation. A lot of that is being weaponized in partisan ways, quite frankly in ways I've never seen before, and it is really dangerous. So, again, media are struggling with how to deal with something. The president is --"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "-- putting forward some theories that have no evidence but they have to give some credibility to it even though it really doesn't have any. That's a challenge for the press right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "We got half a minute. The president on Friday night fired his latest inspector general, Steve Linick, at the State Department. White House officials say it was at the request of Mike Pompeo. The Washington Post's lead story today calls it a retaliatory purge, a slow-motion massacre. But Linick was an Obama appointee, so why is the press treating it as such a huge deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, it is the fourth inspector general to be fired since the pandemic began. They often happen on Friday nights. The media have a challenge here in covering really important stories that potentially have some wrongdoing in them but in this context of coronavirus where it's so hard for people rightly so to focus on anything other than the pandemic. But these are important stories. You heard Republicans about whether this was an appropriate firing. The press really needs to be able to both cover the pandemic in these really significant --"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We have all missed professional sports during this pandemic. Today, NASCAR ramps up its season, returning to action at Darlington, South Carolina, race you can see on Fox broadcast, but with all kinds of changes, including no fans in the stands. Joining us now is Jamie Little, a pit reporter for Fox NASCAR who is joining today's coverage. Jamie, how does the virus change the way you'll be covering next race and are you worried at all about interviewing drivers and getting a bit too close?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMIE LITTLE, FOX NASCAR PIT REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Hi, Howie. Thanks for having me on. It is top racing again. It's time to get back after 10 long weeks for all of us. It will change the way that I do my job. First and foremost, there are usually four pit reporters on pit road covering 40 race cars. They are only sending one and that's to protect people. We have a limited amount of people at the track, only essential people that we need. Everybody else is in L.A. or Charlotte, covering everything that they need to do from those studios. So, for me, I will be at the Coke 600 next weekend covering the race for four hours by myself and getting information will be different. Like you said, it's all about social distancing. We can't get closer than 6 feet to talk to these guys to get information. So the way that I gather my storyline is going to be much different. We will be spending a lot of time like this on Skype with drivers and crew chiefs (ph) leading up to the race."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. You will get extra comeback pay there for one person doing a four-hour race."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Talk a little bit about how NASCAR is instituting more testing and taking other steps to protect the drivers and crews."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LITTLE",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. They wouldn't be doing this if they weren't 100 percent sure that we are doing this safely. Every single person that goes into that field today at Darlington will be tested. Of course, everybody is wearing masks. Some people are wearing gloves. I know that as a reporter, we have to wear a mask. That's great. Anything that it takes to keep us all safe and to show that we can have live sports back, we can do it safely, and this is something that can continue, so definitely keeping an eye on that. And the drivers -- usually, the access is everything in NASCAR. People get to talk to the drivers. They are mingling. All the teams are mingling with each other. That's not happening today. There is no practice. No qualifying drivers will show up today, probably right about now, and then they will be called to their cars before the race, get in and go. No talking to anybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Fox's Joe Buck says the network is considering, when the NLF resumes, adding some crowd noise and virtual fans. Not so wild about that idea. But for you, what is it like to cover these major races and there is nobody in the stands and it's just quiet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LITTLE",
      "utterance": "I've never been in that situation, right? I mean NASCAR fans, it's everything. It's so loud. You get 100,000 fans screaming and yelling. But the one thing about our sport is it is racing. You have car engine noise. There is a lot of noise, ambient sound that would bring that naturally and that will come through on the television screen. Other sports, stick and ball sports, you really need that feel and that vibe of the energy of the crowd. So I think it will affect those sports more so than racing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I've got 10 seconds. People have been watching NASCAR drivers do videogames. Is there -- how much hunger is there for this sport to come back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LITTLE",
      "utterance": "Oh, my Gosh. Well, the iRacing that we have been seeing, we have been getting over a million viewers on Fox and Fox Sports, just watching these guys play videogames and race each other on iRacing. So, there is a hunger for it. And by the way, we are going to have a second screen viewing party today for Darlington. Join me and the broadcasters. We are going to ask some celebrities starting at 3:30. So, a lot planned today. It is a big day for the sport."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Journalists who get the coronavirus, Lesley Stahl, Brooke Baldwin, Chris Cuomo, tend to use their platforms to speak out. Mara Gay, a New York Times editorial writer and cable pundit, is 33-year-old runner who came down with COVID-1919 and got walloped, still battling pneumonia. She writes this. \"Maybe you don't live in a big city. Maybe you don't know anybody who is sick. Maybe you think we are crazy for living in New York. That's fine. You don't have to live like us or vote like us. But please learn from us. Please take this virus seriously.\" That's a terrific message as the country slowly reopens. Being young and living in a rural area, none of that will protect you if you're exposed. I know the media is taking a lot of hits during this pandemic for hype, for partisanship, for alarming people though it's obviously hard to play down 88,000 American deaths. But some of us are also getting sick and sick of being cooped up for all the frustration we feel as we yearn for greater degree of normalcy. I would echo the message. Please take this virus seriously. That's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope you like our Facebook page where we post my daily columns. And let's continue the conversation on Twitter at Howard Kurtz. Also check out my media -- excuse me, my podcast \"Media Buzzmeter.\" We will put that up. You can subscribe at Apple iTunes or Google Play and now on Spotify, as well. We are back here next Sunday. We will be covering the waterfront, including the virus and this very serious environment. We hope you will join us then. See you with the latest BUZZ. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
