Is it your impression that the president of the United States can pardon himself? REP. MATT GAETZ, R—FLA.: Well, I think that the only folks contemplating the president pardoning himself are in the media, not in the White House, not in the Congress. I agree with Mayor Giuliani that there would be real challenges if the president were to do such a thing.   But here is the reason, Neil, why I think that Sarah is not eager to completely rule out the potential. If there was aggressive prosecutorial misconduct, if there were circumstances that were just totally unreasonable, where the president was treated unfairly, the balance of power, the checks and balances contemplated in our Constitution, give the president unfettered pardon power for a reason. Again, I don't believe he's contemplating it. I don't think anyone in Congress is contemplating it. But I think that we can never say never because we don't know what unfairness the president may be subject to going forward.",
