      "sentences": "We did that on a limited budget. I can't believe Schwimmer did not take that role. All right. To the news, on Thursday, actor and gun control activist Alec Baldwin accidentally killed a cinematographer on the set of the Western he was filming in New Mexico. As the news dribbles out, we see many things that went wrong. Now we hear that the gun actually had been used for target practice by the so called expert. Yikes. And it may have had live ammo in it. Doubly yikes. And that it was pointed at a person. Triple yikes. That's a huge no, no. And one of the most basic tenets of gun safety. You don't have to be an NRA member to know that. The firearm also wasn't checked each step of the way from handoff to handoff. All of these tragic errors are based on carelessness, inexperience and lack of safety protocols. They might as well put Hunter Biden in charge of the medicine cabinet. Now could be they were in a hurry to save money. It could be they were cutting corners. Either way, it was a highly preventable screw up. Having an expert on gun safety would have changed that. It seems at least to me, that's what was lacking. But where do those experts come from? I would say the NRA. But you might as well say IRA if you're telling that to Hollywood gun control activists. They'd rather take gun training from Charlie Sheen and a hot tub full of mayonnaise. So fat chance anyone from the NRA would be invited to a movie set where Baldwin was the producer. Kat would have a better chance guest hosting Special Report. One day. And so we find another instance where the prison of two ideas creates problems. If there was an NRA person on set, this would never have happened. But no one in charge would do that because in the prison of two ideas, gun control good, NRA evil. And that dictates that you're either a gun control activist like Baldwin, or you're an evil gun owner like me. And that excludes real expertise. If the two prison idea didn't exist, the set would have benefited from the NRA's hardcore focus on safety. And it would have saved a life. It's like a homophobe. Not asking his gay neighbor who's an interior designer to help him decorate his apartment. In the long run, he's only hurting himself instead of getting laid all the time, girls are going to take one look at his neon Budweiser sign and shag rug and say sorry, guy, enjoy your hand. We still don't know what truly happened but it's becoming clearer and clearer. Perhaps the people who work in the world of make believe want nothing to do with realities true experts. Anti-gun advocates hate gun advocates because of a projection of their own insecurities. It's not that they don't trust gun people with guns, it's that they don't trust themselves with guns, therefore it should not exist at all. Last week we talked about a segregated dorm of women and trans people who were upset when cis normative, I.E. straight repairmen came to install new radiators for the rooms to anticipate in Ohio winter. You think there's nothing worse than a male or female freezing their balls off? But no, it's straight men trying to help you stay warm. The door means didn't want their world infringed by another different world they felt unsafe with a straight man in their midst. What would they have preferred? Do the work themselves? You see, that's like handling a gun on a set with no expert. You see, it's all the same, that if you segregate your world based on ideas or identities, you lose out on the experience, the wisdom and the expertise of the very groups that you're avoiding. Here's a chart. The first one shows the prison of two ideas. You see, there's no information sharing. The second one shows them overlapping. That's how wisdom and know how spreads. It's pretty simple stuff. I came up with that chart myself. But this simple phenomenon is now being prevented as a consequence of the elitist thirst for separation and conflict. And it's happening everywhere. From Campus Housing to Hollywood. There are millions of amazing people who know how to deliver cargo, repair trucks, build bridges and handle guns. But what if they're straight? Or Trump supporters or religious or meat eaters, or they put pineapple on their pizza? Stop it, Emily. It's the baby in the bathwater. You divorce yourself from different people, and you divorce yourself from their invaluable assistance, and you end up clueless and stupid, meaning a college student. Just the way the professional sports world benefited from desegregating the set of Baldwin's movie could have benefited from an NRA's members experience and knowledge. I'm sure the NRA would have gladly volunteered in experts to oversee safety protocols. You probably could have found a liberal one too. But no one thought of that. Because NRA bad, gun control good. It's unfortunate a tragedy like this had to happen before. Maybe somebody on a movie set says, sure, he voted for Trump, but he can clean his A.R.-15 blindfolded. But I prefer to live in a world where people know how to control the guns they have. Rather than people having guns and have no control at all. Hiring a gun lover would have threatened their safe space, but without them it became a deadly one. So maybe if you're going to film using real guns, reconsider your anti-gun ideology, Allow real experts to be involved so you can expertly shoot movies and not colleagues.",

But usually the guys on small budget movies work their ass off because they want to be big budget movies one day. And everything with guns and stunts is all about procedure. Routine, repetition. It's -- every time I was in a scene with a gun, one take, hand it back. He checks it when he hands it back. He puts it on the table. They check it again it comes back then he yells to the group cold or hot letting you know what the situation with the gun is. When you get to the point and is Alec Baldwin where I'm assuming he's successful. He's producing this movie. He's got people giving him loans and investing and you're starving out and having the people that you rely on behind the scenes, the stunt workers, the coordinators, the second, the thirds, the guys you never see except a little bit on if you stay on a credit looking for an extra part of a movie, he didn't want to pay them or give them a decent place to sleep at night.

Legally, I think we see an unfortunate trend here that on this particular set, there was concern after concern raised that the Assistant Director Dave Halls was ignoring all of that protocol and procedure in addition to the egregious situation that was happening with all the other stuff. But specifically in the realm of firearms and pyrotechnics, there was -- there were complaints that were made and also on prior sets. So this guy has a history of ignoring safety protocols that other people around him have raised but the pyro technicians and prop masters have raised. And to your point, it might just land in the civil bucket. But in 2012, a woman named Sarah Jones who was a camera assistant was killed by a freight train in a stunt in New York State.

The kind where parents, you know, hold public officials accountable. That kind of terrorism. We learned last week that the letter prompted Attorney General Merrick Garland to order the FBI to investigate threats from parents to school officials. As it became known many in the media and in in government played this office, no big thing, even denying the obvious intent of the letter. But now the folks behind the letter copped to the insanity and apologized. Why? Because parents finally had enough. They rose up and called it out. And the board didn't expect that. The apology reads this way. To be clear, the safety of board's -- school board members, other public school officials and students is our top priority. And there remains important work to be done on this issue. Boohoo. However, there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter. So it's good to see parents getting results.

The Department of Homeland Security is paying more than $450,000 in taxpayer money for security fencing around Joe's beach house in Delaware. Yes, the same Joe Biden who stopped construction of the wall at the southern border. But to be fair, Joe's fence is mostly to keep him from wandering into the neighbor's yard. He keeps giving speeches from behind the birdbath and it's just annoying. So, even Biden sees the sense in building a fence. But the optics are worse than an episode of Top Chef featuring Jeffrey Dahmer. Because this Joe's fence goes up a new caravan with 2000 migrants is plowing through Mexico like Brian Stelter through a five-layer wedding cake. He ordered them and he's not even going to a wedding. They've already made their way past Mexican armed forces and are headed this way. In fiscal year 2021, 1.7 million migrants crossed the border illegally according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. And there's no solution in sight, certainly not from Kamala. They put her back to work on the national gender strategy. Probably because she's a dame -- a sexist would say. Thank you, President Biden, what gives?",

So, while violent crime levels are at all-time highs around New York, Mayor Blockhead makes it his personal mission to remove the former president's name from several sites across the city. He just got rid of Thomas Jefferson at City Hall. Now, he's after Trump. I guess de Blasio is threatened by the legacy of great presidents. That was a red meat line, should have got applause. OK, well, we'll add the applause in it. There you go -- I'm kidding. Kidding. Or maybe he's pissed because Trump has spent a lifetime adding great things to NYC de Blasio only knows how to take them away. Still, I haven't seen de Blasio this much rage in his eyes since he murdered that groundhog. But these are the priorities for Mayor Stonehenge (BLEEP). Instead of devoting time and resources to a city that's in serious trouble, de Blasio his personal vendetta could actually end up costing taxpayers $30 million, which once again proves a thoughtful insight I offered earlier this month.

      "utterance": "We did that on a limited budget. I can't believe Schwimmer did not take that role. All right. To the news, on Thursday, actor and gun control activist Alec Baldwin accidentally killed a cinematographer on the set of the Western he was filming in New Mexico. As the news dribbles out, we see many things that went wrong. Now we hear that the gun actually had been used for target practice by the so called expert. Yikes. And it may have had live ammo in it. Doubly yikes. And that it was pointed at a person. Triple yikes. That's a huge no, no. And one of the most basic tenets of gun safety. You don't have to be an NRA member to know that. The firearm also wasn't checked each step of the way from handoff to handoff. All of these tragic errors are based on carelessness, inexperience and lack of safety protocols. They might as well put Hunter Biden in charge of the medicine cabinet. Now could be they were in a hurry to save money. It could be they were cutting corners. Either way, it was a highly preventable screw up. Having an expert on gun safety would have changed that. It seems at least to me, that's what was lacking. But where do those experts come from? I would say the NRA. But you might as well say IRA if you're telling that to Hollywood gun control activists. They'd rather take gun training from Charlie Sheen and a hot tub full of mayonnaise. So fat chance anyone from the NRA would be invited to a movie set where Baldwin was the producer. Kat would have a better chance guest hosting Special Report. One day. And so we find another instance where the prison of two ideas creates problems. If there was an NRA person on set, this would never have happened. But no one in charge would do that because in the prison of two ideas, gun control good, NRA evil. And that dictates that you're either a gun control activist like Baldwin, or you're an evil gun owner like me. And that excludes real expertise. If the two prison idea didn't exist, the set would have benefited from the NRA's hardcore focus on safety. And it would have saved a life. It's like a homophobe. Not asking his gay neighbor who's an interior designer to help him decorate his apartment. In the long run, he's only hurting himself instead of getting laid all the time, girls are going to take one look at his neon Budweiser sign and shag rug and say sorry, guy, enjoy your hand. We still don't know what truly happened but it's becoming clearer and clearer. Perhaps the people who work in the world of make believe want nothing to do with realities true experts. Anti-gun advocates hate gun advocates because of a projection of their own insecurities. It's not that they don't trust gun people with guns, it's that they don't trust themselves with guns, therefore it should not exist at all. Last week we talked about a segregated dorm of women and trans people who were upset when cis normative, I.E. straight repairmen came to install new radiators for the rooms to anticipate in Ohio winter. You think there's nothing worse than a male or female freezing their balls off? But no, it's straight men trying to help you stay warm. The door means didn't want their world infringed by another different world they felt unsafe with a straight man in their midst. What would they have preferred? Do the work themselves? You see, that's like handling a gun on a set with no expert. You see, it's all the same, that if you segregate your world based on ideas or identities, you lose out on the experience, the wisdom and the expertise of the very groups that you're avoiding. Here's a chart. The first one shows the prison of two ideas. You see, there's no information sharing. The second one shows them overlapping. That's how wisdom and know how spreads. It's pretty simple stuff. I came up with that chart myself. But this simple phenomenon is now being prevented as a consequence of the elitist thirst for separation and conflict. And it's happening everywhere. From Campus Housing to Hollywood. There are millions of amazing people who know how to deliver cargo, repair trucks, build bridges and handle guns. But what if they're straight? Or Trump supporters or religious or meat eaters, or they put pineapple on their pizza? Stop it, Emily. It's the baby in the bathwater. You divorce yourself from different people, and you divorce yourself from their invaluable assistance, and you end up clueless and stupid, meaning a college student. Just the way the professional sports world benefited from desegregating the set of Baldwin's movie could have benefited from an NRA's members experience and knowledge. I'm sure the NRA would have gladly volunteered in experts to oversee safety protocols. You probably could have found a liberal one too. But no one thought of that. Because NRA bad, gun control good. It's unfortunate a tragedy like this had to happen before. Maybe somebody on a movie set says, sure, he voted for Trump, but he can clean his A.R.-15 blindfolded. But I prefer to live in a world where people know how to control the guns they have. Rather than people having guns and have no control at all. Hiring a gun lover would have threatened their safe space, but without them it became a deadly one. So maybe if you're going to film using real guns, reconsider your anti-gun ideology, Allow real experts to be involved so you can expertly shoot movies and not colleagues."

Which means and that goes to -- and I've been on some we'll call them B movies. OK? Whether that's small budget or whatever. But usually the guys on small budget movies work their ass off because they want to be big budget movies one day. And everything with guns and stunts is all about procedure. Routine, repetition. It's -- every time I was in a scene with a gun, one take, hand it back. He checks it when he hands it back. He puts it on the table. They check it again it comes back then he yells to the group cold or hot letting you know what the situation with the gun is. When you get to the point and is Alec Baldwin where I'm assuming he's successful. He's producing this movie. He's got people giving him loans and investing and you're starving out and having the people that you rely on behind the scenes, the stunt workers, the coordinators, the second, the thirds, the guys you never see except a little bit on if you stay on a credit looking for an extra part of a movie, he didn't want to pay them or give them a decent place to sleep at night.

They said the teachable moment here is that when a Hollywood actor lectures you about gun control, they don't have a clue what they're talking about, because safety is no accident. And that goes exactly into what you're saying in the protocols. Legally, I think we see an unfortunate trend here that on this particular set, there was concern after concern raised that the Assistant Director Dave Halls was ignoring all of that protocol and procedure in addition to the egregious situation that was happening with all the other stuff. But specifically in the realm of firearms and pyrotechnics, there was -- there were complaints that were made and also on prior sets. So this guy has a history of ignoring safety protocols that other people around him have raised but the pyro technicians and prop masters have raised. And to your point, it might just land in the civil bucket. But in 2012, a woman named Sarah Jones who was a camera assistant was killed by a freight train in a stunt in New York State. And the assistant director was put on probation for 10 years but the director was criminally charged with involuntary manslaughter and he served a year in prison."

The kind where parents, you know, hold public officials accountable. That kind of terrorism. We learned last week that the letter prompted Attorney General Merrick Garland to order the FBI to investigate threats from parents to school officials. As it became known many in the media and in in government played this office, no big thing, even denying the obvious intent of the letter. But now the folks behind the letter copped to the insanity and apologized. Why? Because parents finally had enough. They rose up and called it out. And the board didn't expect that. The apology reads this way. To be clear, the safety of board's -- school board members, other public school officials and students is our top priority. And there remains important work to be done on this issue. Boohoo. However, there was no justification for some of the language included in the letter. So it's good to see parents getting results.

But the optics are worse than an episode of Top Chef featuring Jeffrey Dahmer. Because this Joe's fence goes up a new caravan with 2000 migrants is plowing through Mexico like Brian Stelter through a five-layer wedding cake. He ordered them and he's not even going to a wedding.

So, while violent crime levels are at all-time highs around New York, Mayor Blockhead makes it his personal mission to remove the former president's name from several sites across the city. He just got rid of Thomas Jefferson at City Hall. Now, he's after Trump. I guess de Blasio is threatened by the legacy of great presidents. That was a red meat line, should have got applause.

And then when the judge was like, yes, no, but he said, OK, fine, I'm exercising at will just because I want to, that's what triggers that penalty. So, because he feels like it because he wants to prove a point, that's why we're on the hook for 30 million. And the irony is that the new party that they're, they're engaging with in the golf course they have a lower rent. So, to your, to your point earlier, tax payers here in New York, they're going to get less from this on addition to the -- in addition of 30 million that they're on the hook for all because de Blasio said, well, because I feel like it."

The Braves earned their trip to the World Series this season and are bringing it home to Georgia. Chop on and Go Braves!\" Don't know what that means. Well, that tweet seems out of left field, baseball pun. If you forgot the MLB moved its all-star game from 51 percent Black Atlanta to 76 percent White Denver to protest the voting law that Dems called racist. Meanwhile, if Georgia is so racist, I'm still waiting for CNN to move their headquarters from there to Denver.
