The Democrats, are they wrong, though, to think that culture wars favor them? Plus, he's going to break down the Dems' new, yes, impeachment obsession. We've got lots of new legal news as well. We're going to unveil a new theory about what former FBI Director Jim Comey was trying to do when he briefed newly elected President Trump about that phony dossier. And he knew it was bunk.  Plus, investigative reporter Peter Schweizer is going to tell us about the latest and very troubling ties between the Biden family and corrupt foreign actors, wouldn't you know. And be sure to stay for this. Jimmie J.J. Walker of Good Times fame is here to react to why celebrities are using now late- night TV appearances as a form of resistance therapy. Total meltdowns in Tinseltown.  But first, Democrats misread America. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  And as they try to find their footing in this red-hot Trump economy, for 2020 Democrats are resorting to hyperbole and endless and predictable personal attacks. Their instinct is to demean, not debate.",

Now, this radical social agenda was originally developed and conceived in the academy. And it was meant to upend the old order, the traditional family structure that has been at the core of every major civilization throughout history. And this new world order, this new world view, was then mainstreamed by the popular culture and eventually embraced by Democrats and even some Republicans. And it has now become a new politically correct orthodoxy, and it's extremist and totally unyielding. On issues such as gender and abortion, its adherence are vicious. If you dare disagree with their worldview, they believe that you should lose your job and frankly be banished forever from the public square. And no, I'm not exaggerating.

Yet much of the country is becoming more pro-life. You'd never know it by reading a lot of the newspapers, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. This has been the case for some time.  Now, Democrats think that the new Alabama law that outlaws most abortions, they think it gives them a huge opening in 2020. They've been looking for an opening. But as usual, they misread the country.  First, Alabama didn't pass the law to score political points. Alabamians passed the law because they believe that they were saving the lives of innocent babies. For Christians and others who believe abortion is the taking of an innocent life, no amount of vilification of their position by Hollywood or the news media or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, anybody, is going to change their moral determination.

But we do have some questions tonight. Specifically, did Comey know when he briefed Trump that the dossier was developed and paid for by Hillary Clinton? Did the former FBI Director tell the soon-to-be President that he doubted its accuracy, really doubted its accuracy? Did he inform the President that the dossier was the basis for a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign? Now, if they thought Trump was truly a threat, why even brief him on any of the details at all? Well, it strikes me that the only explanation is that Comey was trying to scare Trump with this brief that the briefing itself was part of a larger plan to get it leaked and take Trump down at the beginning (inaudible). Here now, Robert Ray, former Independent Counsel, and Sol Wisenberg, former Deputy Independent Counsel, Fox News Contributor.

So it raises all kinds of questions about what the FBI Director's motives were going back to the 2016 campaign. And I think, by that point, meaning by January of 2017, it's clear, because within 18 days thereafter, he sends two FBI agents into the White House to interview Michael Flynn. He had already essentially chosen sides in this and was acting in what I think is at least the charitable interpretation.

Quote, \"I'm not here to make headlines. I'm here to get people's problems solved.\" And yet Congressman Cummings is making headlines. A conservative government watchdog group, National Legal and Policy Center, or NLPC, has filed a complaint with the IRS looking into possible unethical behavior involving Cummings and has 48-year-old wife Maya Rockeymoore, who runs a nonprofit called Center for Global Policy Solutions, and a for profit consulting firm called Global Policy Solutions, almost the same name. And the complaint says they appear to operate as a single entity. In recent years the nonprofit has reportedly taken and millions of dollars in grants from companies like Google, J.P. Morgan, and Prudential, which also have business interests before the House Oversight Committee. Then there is the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation by the men who established Johnson & Johnson, which gave more than $5 million to both Maya Rockeymoore's consulting firm and her nonprofit. But the report says in 2017 the foundation stopped supporting her groups, and in recent months, Cummings has been a vocal opponent of Johnson & Johnson, targeting the company as part of the Oversight Committee's probe of drug prices. Now the NLPC says Maya Rockeymoore won't let them look at her nonprofit's financial records, which is required by the IRS. And of course, Elijah Cummings is on his own request for documents. Watch.",

Now, this radical social agenda was originally developed and conceived in the academy. And it was meant to upend the old order, the traditional family structure that has been at the core of every major civilization throughout history. And this new world order, this new world view, was then mainstreamed by the popular culture and eventually embraced by Democrats and even some Republicans. And it has now become a new politically correct orthodoxy, and it's extremist and totally unyielding. On issues such as gender and abortion, its adherence are vicious. If you dare disagree with their worldview, they believe that you should lose your job and frankly be banished forever from the public square. And no, I'm not exaggerating.

Yet much of the country is becoming more pro-life. You'd never know it by reading a lot of the newspapers, particularly in the later stages of pregnancy. This has been the case for some time. Now, Democrats think that the new Alabama law that outlaws most abortions, they think it gives them a huge opening in 2020. They've been looking for an opening. But as usual, they misread the country. First, Alabama didn't pass the law to score political points. Alabamians passed the law because they believe that they were saving the lives of innocent babies. For Christians and others who believe abortion is the taking of an innocent life, no amount of vilification of their position by Hollywood or the news media or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, anybody, is going to change their moral determination.

I mean, they're going to say, one, we have the right to kill a baby after it's born; two, we have the right to charge the taxpayer while we're killing the baby. I mean, think about this stuff. I think in a very radical position, Sanders -- Bernie Sanders said the other day he didn't mind if they had sex selection abortions. Well, that means everywhere on the planet these girl babies get aborted. I mean, there's no question statistically. If you permit sex selection abortions, there'll be far more abortions of females than males. And that's what Sanders said he was willing to accept.

Joe Biden is so shallow that he won't notice most of this. He was just thinking it's kind of confusing. And he'll drift along being Joe Biden.

That's like that - it was a big obsession last year and the year before. But now, of course, as predicted, moving against Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence. Buttigieg says, well, we can rename our dinner maybe because we have people of all - but if we can rename a dinner, not Jefferson-Jackson, Jackson-Jefferson, rename that.

Thank you so much. Fantastic segment, as always. Next, we're going to dig into the misdeeds of fired FBI Director Jim Comey. Now, with a particular focus tonight, on his motive during his briefing to President Trump on the debunked dossier. Two men familiar with the government corruption, you bet, Robert Ray and Sol Wisenberg, are here to break it all down, next."

      "utterance": "The bureau began an effort after we got the Steele dossier to try and see how much of it we could replicate. There were a lot of spokes off of that that we didn't know whether they were true or false, and we were trying to figure out what we could make of it."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Disgraced former FBI Director Jim Comey is now changing his tune about that anti-Trump dossier that sparked the Russia investigation. Comey told ABC News that he didn't think the document was credible. And now, he's shifting the blame to former Intel Chief John Brennan and Jim Clapper for including it in that intel report that was given to President Trump in January of 2016 - January of 2017, obviously, weeks before his inauguration. But we do have some questions tonight. Specifically, did Comey know when he briefed Trump that the dossier was developed and paid for by Hillary Clinton? Did the former FBI Director tell the soon-to-be President that he doubted its accuracy, really doubted its accuracy? Did he inform the President that the dossier was the basis for a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign? Now, if they thought Trump was truly a threat, why even brief him on any of the details at all? Well, it strikes me that the only explanation is that Comey was trying to scare Trump with this brief that the briefing itself was part of a larger plan to get it leaked and take Trump down at the beginning (inaudible). Here now, Robert Ray, former Independent Counsel, and Sol Wisenberg, former Deputy Independent Counsel, Fox News Contributor. Robert, what's the most important outstanding question in your view about Comey's role in this as far as you're concerned?"

      "speaker": "ROBERT RAY, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "He clearly was cagey with the President, as you have suggested, in that January 6, 2017 meeting with the President when he joined with the other intelligence chiefs to - remember, he stayed behind and briefed the President-Elect with regard to what he decided he wanted to share with the President. So it raises all kinds of questions about what the FBI Director's motives were going back to the 2016 campaign. And I think, by that point, meaning by January of 2017, it's clear, because within 18 days thereafter, he sends two FBI agents into the White House to interview Michael Flynn. He had already essentially chosen sides in this and was acting in what I think is at least the charitable interpretation. He was acting adversarial to the President-Elect and soon to be President of the United States. Meaning, in essence, that his position and the position of the FBI was that he was going to protect the American people from the duly-elected President of the country. And--"

But we now have the - on Capitol Hill, they're trying to pull in Hope Hicks, Former Communications Director, Don McGahn, and stiff armed them today. Hope Hicks and Don McGahn's Chief of Staff, Annie Donaldson, at the Capitol Hill, we have Nadler threatening, of course, contempt to - holding him in contempt, threatening other subpoenas beyond these two new subpoenas today. What gives here? Is it because Barr is going to get closer and the Connecticut U.S. Attorney is going to get closer to the truth?"

      "speaker": "SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "That could be it. I just think that Nadler doesn't really know exactly what to do. I mean, I think they've terribly misplayed their hand here. The fact is, as I said last time I was on your show, these battles, these checks and balances battles have gone on in throughout the history of the republic. There's nothing wrong with subpoenaing these people, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with the President coming in, in most circumstances if the circumstances are appropriate, and saying, I'm going to invoke executive privilege. That's kind of what it's all about. We need to learn to distinguish between totally improper and demagogic subpoenas like the one to William Barr and the subpoena to Steve Mnuchin. You might not like what they are trying to do to Steve Mnuchin, but in that particular case there is a statute that says Congress can do this. The Congress can go to the IRS and say give us a tax return. So you've got to tell me, if you are talking to me about something, what's the particular thing you are subpoenaing the person for, what you trying to do, and what are they claiming? It doesn't lend itself easily to gross generalizations."

And by the way, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, guys, is now suing the DOJ for any copies of a chart that apparently they had compiled, they had drawn up, that shows statutes that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could have violated for that unauthorized use of the private email server. Now, that chart apparently was disseminated within the FBI and excluded any section for just gross negligence, the reason for no prosecution stated by Comey in the summer of 2016. So Robert, is that significant? And why is Judicial Watch going after that particular chart?"

      "speaker": "ROBERT RAY, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "As former attorney general Mike Mukasey has pointed out, that was always the centerpiece of the inquiry relative to the former secretary of state, meaning that if there was an avenue for prosecution that was it, and it was on the gross negligence standard. Ultimately what happened here is, as we all recall, the attorney general essentially was conflicted and stepped aside in favor of the FBI director to make the call, and also that includes the deputy attorney general. So neither one of them did their job. And then it was left to Jim Comey to step in and resolve this. And of course then he made a mess of things by essentially acting like a prosecutor even though he was an investigator and the FBI director, the sum and substance of which, ultimately that became grounds through Rod Rosenstein for the president to fire him. So I don't know. The whole thing is a colossal, was then and is now, a colossal mess, and it doesn't surprise me that the FBI would have a chart that would leave off the one place they didn’t want to go, which was to talk about the fact that there was sufficient evidence with regard to gross negligence, and nevertheless the FBI director decided not to prosecute."

He even vouched for him in front of Congress. With me now is Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and the author of the book \"Secret Empires.\" So Peter, you have been months ahead of \"The New York Times\" and other publications on this issue. Why has the Joe Biden family escaped scrutiny on these overseas ties for so long, especially when they are combing through every white Russian a Trump family member ever drank, though they don't drink?"

Joe Biden and Hunter Biden went to China together in December of 2013. Ten days after that trip Hunter Biden gets this billion-dollar deal with the Chinese government, the media never covered it. In 2014 he strikes the deal with the Ukrainians. That gets covered a little bit but they donŸ_Tt know the terms of it. The hit parade goes on. We go from China to Ukraine, now to Romania where this businessman in Romania, Mr. Popoviciu, is brought up on corruption charges and convicted in his own country. According to the Romanian media, he hired Hunter Biden to lobby on his behalf in the United States, in effect to try to get the United States government to call off the Ukrainians from their prosecution and eventual imprisonment of this businessman."

And it's surprising to me the lack of curiosity that a sitting vice president's son is striking three major deals with the Chinese government while he is steering U.S. policy towards China, the deal with Ukraine, all of this stuff. If this was Don Jr. you know he would be sitting in front of Congress, and he should if he actually did that. But Hunter Biden needs to do that. The Senate needs to ask him to testify."

If you have a little complaint with the president -- of all people, Kim Kardashian has done a great job of working with prison reform. She didn't go in screaming at the president, attacking the office. She went in and presented some facts and actually has gotten people relieved of jail duty. It's the same thing that just happened with Joey Cora of the Boston Red Sox. He would not go to the White House. He is complaining about what's going on in Puerto Rico.

A conservative government watchdog group, National Legal and Policy Center, or NLPC, has filed a complaint with the IRS looking into possible unethical behavior involving Cummings and has 48-year-old wife Maya Rockeymoore, who runs a nonprofit called Center for Global Policy Solutions, and a for profit consulting firm called Global Policy Solutions, almost the same name. And the complaint says they appear to operate as a single entity. In recent years the nonprofit has reportedly taken and millions of dollars in grants from companies like Google, J.P. Morgan, and Prudential, which also have business interests before the House Oversight Committee. Then there is the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation by the men who established Johnson & Johnson, which gave more than $5 million to both Maya Rockeymoore's consulting firm and her nonprofit. But the report says in 2017 the foundation stopped supporting her groups, and in recent months, Cummings has been a vocal opponent of Johnson & Johnson, targeting the company as part of the Oversight Committee's probe of drug prices. Now the NLPC says Maya Rockeymoore won't let them look at her nonprofit's financial records, which is required by the IRS. And of course, Elijah Cummings is on his own request for documents. Watch."
