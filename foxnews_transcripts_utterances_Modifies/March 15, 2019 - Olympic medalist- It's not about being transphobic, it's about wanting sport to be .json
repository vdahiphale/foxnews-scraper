      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, HOST",
      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Less than 24 hours ago, a horrifying mass shooting took place in Christchurch, New Zealand. A gunman stormed into two separate mosques and murdered at least 49 people. The killer's name apparently is Brendan Tarrant. In a dreadful modern twist, Tarrant live streamed his attacks on Facebook as they happened. Three other people have been arrested as well, though it's still unclear tonight if they were connected to the attack.  The attack is awful and not just because nearly 50 people were murdered. The killer appears to be motivated by ideology. All violence is bad, but political violence is the worst kind because it's the most divisive.  Over time, political violence tears countries apart. Tarrant left behind a 74-page manifesto in which he explains his motives in detail. Apparently, nobody in the American news media has read any of it.  All day have you heard left-wing commentators and politicians working hard to tie Tarrant to Conservatives in the United States. That is absurd. Tarrant was no Conservative. As he wrote in manifesto, quote, \"Conservatism is corporatism in disguise. I want no part of it. The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China,\" end quote. That's not a sentiment you hear from many Conservatives. Tarrant's views are not derived from American politics. The murders he committed have nothing to do with anyone in the United States, but that doesn't mean his rampage won't be used to change this country. It has happened before.  Political terrorism always makes countries less free. In the panic after the 9/11 attacks, we impulsively gave away our right to privacy. We awarded the Federal government the right to spy on our citizens without their knowledge for virtually any reason. That was a grave mistake. Authoritarian forces within our country would like to seize this moment for similar ends.  Within hours of the Christchurch shooting, Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed the National Rifle Association somehow for the attack.   The NRA doesn't even exist in New Zealand. That's a country with far stricter gun laws than in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't care. Maybe she doesn't even know. What she does know is that the NRA is the single most effective guardian of the Second Amendment. The left would like to invalidate that amendment along with other parts of the Bill of Rights that are in their way. Even as you sleep, they are working to do this. Democrats have already used the Russia hoax to undermine gun rights. Newly released congressional transcripts show that Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS fed false information about the NRA to Bruce Ohr at the DOJ who passed it on to Federal investigators. Simpson's lies helped launch a Federal investigation into the NRA and that of course, was always the goal of it. In Connecticut, the gun manufacturer, Remington is battling a lawsuit that holds them responsible for the Sandy Hook shooting. What did Remington do? What it always does. Sell completely legal firearms. The lawsuit's premise is absurd. The legal coherence isn't the point of the exercise. The point is to shut down gun companies making the Second Amendment irrelevant.   The tragedy was just a pretext to increase the power of a few over the many. That's always the way it works. Already tonight, you are hearing calls in this country for curbs on free speech in response to the New Zealand massacre. Jeff Bezos's newspaper wasted no time in blaming the entire thing on the free flow of ideas that are, quote, \"spreading hate.\" For the censorship class, more control is always the solution. Ban more people, squelch more ideas, go de-platform someone. A writer at the \"Chicago Tribune\" almost immediately blamed Fox News for what happened in Christchurch. You can see what's coming. It's already happening, but it won't work. Censorship does not make us safer. Instead it drives forbidden ideas underground where they fester and explode. If you really wanted to stop horrifying acts of violence like the one we just saw in New Zealand, like the ones we have seen repeatedly over the past five or six years, you would take an honest look at what the west has become. It is a place where the Church has died, a place where a foolish ruling class calls itself god. A place where the people wither.  Its hallmarks are fatherlessness, addiction, mental illness, evaporating social trust and the widespread nihilism you would expect as a result of all of that. This is a society that our ruling class built. Talking about why it doesn't work is a threat to their power, so they shut down that conversation.   But, enforced silence doesn't help, it just divides us more. Dividing us was the point of yesterday's massacre in Christchurch -- literally. Tarrant said so in his manifesto, quote, \"I chose firearms for the effect it would have on social discourse and the effect it could have on the politics of the United States. With enough pressure, the left wing within the United States will seek to abolish the Second Amendment, and the right wing within the U.S. will see this as an attack on their very freedom and liberty. This will result in a dramatic polarization of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the U.S. along cultural and racial lines,\" end quote. So that was the killer's dream. Ripping apart America. Destroying it from within.  Brendan Tarrant is in prison tonight. He has no power to hurt us anymore. We can only hurt ourselves. Let's hope we don't. Colion Noir is a host at NRA-TV and he joins us tonight. Colion, thanks very much for coming on. Are you struck by how little time it takes for people in politics and the media to use a tragedy like the one that happened yesterday in Christchurch, New Zealand, to affect a political outcome in this country?",

They are trying to silence you. And so nothing that they do up to this point now really surprises me because with the free flow of information, there is almost no point in hiding the agenda anymore.

So we are not going to bowdlerize this. We are just going to read his words. And again, these are his, not ours. We would not add capital letters to an E. E. Cummings poem and we are not going to change Beto's poem, but it's a little vulgar, so if you don't want to hear it close your ears.

So basically, what we have now decided is that we just need to speak out before this injustice actually happens. As we know, there is a difference of about 10% to 12% between a female performance and a male performance. So a transgender woman who is biologically a man, had been born a boy will have that advantage whether they have had testosterone suppressant or no that will remain with them the rest of their lives and that gives the females that you're racing against a massive disadvantage and that's just not a level playing field. So we felt that something needed to be said. It's not a matter of being transphobic, it's not a matter of having a problem with the transgender community in any shape or form. It's about just wanting sports to be fair and to be based on sex and not gender.",

All of those things do not go away if you transition and the majority of men transition after puberty, so they have all the extra strength that comes with testosterone that is very much pumped through the body when you go through puberty. And even if you suppress for one year, it is going to make very little difference to your actual performance and women just cannot stand next to somebody and beat them. You know, the reason why I suppose I'm speaking out more than most is that I competed against these Germans for nearly 10 years of my life, and I know exactly what it feels like to stand next to someone that you know no matter what you do in the swimming pool, you just can't beat them.",

She has spoken to many of her friends who are competing nowadays. I've spoken to many swimmers that are competing nowadays, and they are all very frightened to speak out because they get called transphobic, which is just not true. This is about sports. This is about biology. And this is about science. And all we're asking for is more research. At the moment, for the Olympic Games next year in Tokyo, you just have to reduce your testosterone for one year. So no surgery, no diagnosis from a doctor, no estrogen in your system whatsoever. And in fact, if Putin want to put at all his third and fourth and fifth string males against the rest of the British athletes and world athletes, he could do that right now providing they stood up and said that they recognize themselves and self- identify as a woman.

All of this collides in a way that's really difficult to understand. But I will leave you with this, I was flying back from Dallas and I just wrote about this on to Facebook. I got on, I sat down, I had a vodka soda, I fell asleep. I woke up and I looked down and between my legs on the floor was something I had not put there. It was about this long and it was brown and I just couldn't for the life of me figure out what it was, and then it moved. And then I thought, \"My God, it's a snake.\" And I reached down and I grabbed it and the dog yelped behind me. An enormous dog was sitting behind me, and so stood up because I had to see this creature. It scared the heck out of me. It was in the company of a veteran and it had the service vest on and so I sit down and I talk to this guy for about 20 minutes and get his whole story, which include, must visit destinations like Fallujah and all these places and suddenly, you know, I don't know what to think, Tucker. I went from outraged, frightened, the size of this animal on a plane, what's going on, to thank you for your service, that's a good dog.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Less than 24 hours ago, a horrifying mass shooting took place in Christchurch, New Zealand. A gunman stormed into two separate mosques and murdered at least 49 people. The killer's name apparently is Brendan Tarrant. In a dreadful modern twist, Tarrant live streamed his attacks on Facebook as they happened. Three other people have been arrested as well, though it's still unclear tonight if they were connected to the attack. The attack is awful and not just because nearly 50 people were murdered. The killer appears to be motivated by ideology. All violence is bad, but political violence is the worst kind because it's the most divisive. Over time, political violence tears countries apart. Tarrant left behind a 74-page manifesto in which he explains his motives in detail. Apparently, nobody in the American news media has read any of it. All day have you heard left-wing commentators and politicians working hard to tie Tarrant to Conservatives in the United States. That is absurd. Tarrant was no Conservative. As he wrote in manifesto, quote, \"Conservatism is corporatism in disguise. I want no part of it. The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China,\" end quote. That's not a sentiment you hear from many Conservatives. Tarrant's views are not derived from American politics. The murders he committed have nothing to do with anyone in the United States, but that doesn't mean his rampage won't be used to change this country. It has happened before. Political terrorism always makes countries less free. In the panic after the 9/11 attacks, we impulsively gave away our right to privacy. We awarded the Federal government the right to spy on our citizens without their knowledge for virtually any reason. That was a grave mistake. Authoritarian forces within our country would like to seize this moment for similar ends. Within hours of the Christchurch shooting, Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed the National Rifle Association somehow for the attack. The NRA doesn't even exist in New Zealand. That's a country with far stricter gun laws than in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't care. Maybe she doesn't even know. What she does know is that the NRA is the single most effective guardian of the Second Amendment. The left would like to invalidate that amendment along with other parts of the Bill of Rights that are in their way. Even as you sleep, they are working to do this. Democrats have already used the Russia hoax to undermine gun rights. Newly released congressional transcripts show that Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS fed false information about the NRA to Bruce Ohr at the DOJ who passed it on to Federal investigators. Simpson's lies helped launch a Federal investigation into the NRA and that of course, was always the goal of it. In Connecticut, the gun manufacturer, Remington is battling a lawsuit that holds them responsible for the Sandy Hook shooting. What did Remington do? What it always does. Sell completely legal firearms. The lawsuit's premise is absurd. The legal coherence isn't the point of the exercise. The point is to shut down gun companies making the Second Amendment irrelevant. The tragedy was just a pretext to increase the power of a few over the many. That's always the way it works. Already tonight, you are hearing calls in this country for curbs on free speech in response to the New Zealand massacre. Jeff Bezos's newspaper wasted no time in blaming the entire thing on the free flow of ideas that are, quote, \"spreading hate.\" For the censorship class, more control is always the solution. Ban more people, squelch more ideas, go de-platform someone. A writer at the \"Chicago Tribune\" almost immediately blamed Fox News for what happened in Christchurch. You can see what's coming. It's already happening, but it won't work. Censorship does not make us safer. Instead it drives forbidden ideas underground where they fester and explode. If you really wanted to stop horrifying acts of violence like the one we just saw in New Zealand, like the ones we have seen repeatedly over the past five or six years, you would take an honest look at what the west has become. It is a place where the Church has died, a place where a foolish ruling class calls itself god. A place where the people wither. Its hallmarks are fatherlessness, addiction, mental illness, evaporating social trust and the widespread nihilism you would expect as a result of all of that. This is a society that our ruling class built. Talking about why it doesn't work is a threat to their power, so they shut down that conversation. But, enforced silence doesn't help, it just divides us more. Dividing us was the point of yesterday's massacre in Christchurch -- literally. Tarrant said so in his manifesto, quote, \"I chose firearms for the effect it would have on social discourse and the effect it could have on the politics of the United States. With enough pressure, the left wing within the United States will seek to abolish the Second Amendment, and the right wing within the U.S. will see this as an attack on their very freedom and liberty. This will result in a dramatic polarization of the people in the United States and eventually a fracturing of the U.S. along cultural and racial lines,\" end quote. So that was the killer's dream. Ripping apart America. Destroying it from within. Brendan Tarrant is in prison tonight. He has no power to hurt us anymore. We can only hurt ourselves. Let's hope we don't. Colion Noir is a host at NRA-TV and he joins us tonight. Colion, thanks very much for coming on. Are you struck by how little time it takes for people in politics and the media to use a tragedy like the one that happened yesterday in Christchurch, New Zealand, to affect a political outcome in this country?"

      "utterance": "No, not at all, largely because growing up in life, I have always known that whenever there is an issue, one side is going to attack another side and for me the way I look at it is, whoever they are attacking the most, that's who they consider the biggest threat. And right now, when it comes to discussions of freedom, the Second Amendment or what have you, the biggest threat to them is the NRA, and that's why what they're doing to the NRA, NRA-TV and its members the same thing that they are doing to you. They are trying to silence you. And so nothing that they do up to this point now really surprises me because with the free flow of information, there is almost no point in hiding the agenda anymore. They just kind of put it out there for the world to see and attack anybody that disagrees with it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NOIR",
      "utterance": "Well, most of them are talking to their own echo chamber, and so for instance, if you look at the way the discourse is handled online, right? I have been blocked by a number of these individuals that I have had tried to have regular conversations with about the issue. And the reason they block me is so that my people don't see the conversation and then bring up their points and then the people on their side don't see the points that we are making so that we can have an open and honest discourse. They just want to spit all the rhetoric to their echo chamber. So a lot of those people are going to believe it because they don't know anything other than what they see on their side of the issue."

I mean, Chelsea Clinton, whatever her many failings and I've criticized Chelsea Clinton many times, she did not shoot anybody in Christchurch, New Zealand. Why can't people blame the guy who did it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NOIR",
      "utterance": "Because that's the state of our country right now. What we have done is we have taken the idea of personal accountability and responsibility and pretty much shoved it out of the window and so now, any time something happens, we position a lot of people in this generation to just look to somebody else and blame them for somebody else's actions. It's a weird kind of mentality that has developed over the last couple of decades. And I'm starting to notice it more and more. When I see something like that, I'm going to blame the guy. I am going to have my vitriol save all of my vitriol for the person who actually committed the crime. And I'm not going to look to someone else and scapegoat that responsibility on to someone else or even worse, an inanimate object like a firearm which tends to happen on an even more regular basis."

Twenty four hours into this candidacy, all is not well for America's hackie sack hero. He has got some great hookups for sticky bud, but that's not enough in the modern Democratic Party.

Why couldn't she talk? \"The Daily Beast\" says that he drips of male privilege and, wait a minute, he is a rich kid who went to boarding school as Robert. Isn't he culturally appropriating Mexican culture by calling himself Beto? Isn't he a kind of an Elizabeth Warren of South Texas? Can he exist in the woke Democratic Party? Well, our next guest joins us tonight and first we want to give him a victory lap. He is Nate Lerner. He is one of the people who convinced Beto O'Rourke to jump in the race, co-founded draftbeto.org, so congratulations to you, Nate Lerner the way, sincerely that it worked. And by the way as rollouts go, it was better than Howard Schultz's, that's for sure and better than Amy Klobuchar's. But it does raise some questions just who he is because identity, of course, is the core of the Democratic Party. You have all kinds of capable female candidates and you have all kinds of capable candidates of color and here is this rich white guy who elbows his way to the front and says, \"Shh, let me talk,\" is that really the face of the modern Democratic Party?

It's quite a strong contrast and reflects very strongly in what our party represents and what we are about. And I think with Beto, what you have is someone who is an inspirational figure who is going to unite people and that's what our party wants more than anything and that's why I think he is going to be the frontrunner and will eventually win."

The point is that we have these strong candidates competing from all different walks of life, from all different backgrounds and we celebrate that fact and then we look at those candidates and say, \"Okay, which one is going to represent our values? Which one is going to unite the party, unite the country and be an inspirational figure?\" And I think all the candidates in their own way do that very well.

It's kind of insulting, isn't it."

Why are you pushing in a field that is diverse as the Democratic field is for the one young rich white guy with the fake name to jump in front of everybody else?

As a teenager, he went by the hacker nickname \"Psychedelic War Lord.\" Has he dropped acid? That is actually a good question to ask Beto and I hope somebody will. Whether he was doing that or not, he did write a poem about cows. Now, to be clear, Beto is a poet. He is an artist and we don't want to be disrespectful to his art. So we are not going to bowdlerize this. We are just going to read his words. And again, these are his, not ours. We would not add capital letters to an E. E. Cummings poem and we are not going to change Beto's poem, but it's a little vulgar, so if you don't want to hear it close your ears. Here it is. \"I need a butt-shine, Right now, You are holy, Oh sacred Cow. I thirst for you, Provide Milk. Buff my balls, Love the Cow. Good fortune for those that do. Love me, breathe my feet. The Cow has risen.\" End quote. Author and columnist, Mark Steyn struggling mightily to keep a straight face joins us tonight.

You mentioned the other night, Tucker, that they are all hailing him as the new rock star and in our insane world, when it comes to political candidates, it seems to me, you are either the new boy band or the new Hitler. Increasingly, there is nothing in between. So, if you are Trump, you are the new Hitler and Beto is the boy band de jour, and of course, all boy bands are de jour but there is something pathetic in being in a political boy band when you are pushing 50 and still skateboarding around like the rich white kid doing bovine poetry back when you were getting picked up on DWI and burglary charges.

Kramer told the Court, he was singled out by the dossier's author, former British spy, Christopher Steele to lend credibility to the Democrat-funded opposition research. Steele admitted under oath that he tried to verify the dossier using a CNN eye report story. The research was directed Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, quote, \"I think they felt a senior Republican was better to be the recipient of this rather than a Democrat because if it were a Democrat, I think that the view was it that it would have been dismissed as a political attack.\" The FBI's former counterintelligence chief, Bill Priestap also filed this declaration confirming the FBI got the dossier's first 33 pages from McCain in December 2016. Now, the FBI was already receiving the memos from other sources.

Tucker, I can't say this enough. It's not some kind of crazy X files conspiracy theory to say what we know happened. Barack Obama e-mailed Hillary Clinton, excuse me, e-mailed Barack Obama. We know this. We know she e-mailed him from a private account. How do we know this? Because Hillary didn't have a state account. We know she e-mailed him from foreign soil. We also know Barack Obama said he didn't know about Hillary's e-mail. He said it in a televised interview we can all watch. He said that, it's on the record. How did he not know? Now, here is the kicker, Tucker. Barack Obama had a black Blackberry, an e-mail device. WACA - the White House Communication Agency has to white list e-mails that come into that device, so he doesn't get spam and Trojans and things like that on the device. How did Hillary's private e-mail get on that if Obama and his staff didn't know about Hillary's e-mail? Sounds kind of like a scam to me, don't you think? I think they are covering for Obama."

So basically, what we have now decided is that we just need to speak out before this injustice actually happens. As we know, there is a difference of about 10% to 12% between a female performance and a male performance. So a transgender woman who is biologically a man, had been born a boy will have that advantage whether they have had testosterone suppressant or no that will remain with them the rest of their lives and that gives the females that you're racing against a massive disadvantage and that's just not a level playing field. So we felt that something needed to be said. It's not a matter of being transphobic, it's not a matter of having a problem with the transgender community in any shape or form. It's about just wanting sports to be fair and to be based on sex and not gender."

All of those things do not go away if you transition and the majority of men transition after puberty, so they have all the extra strength that comes with testosterone that is very much pumped through the body when you go through puberty. And even if you suppress for one year, it is going to make very little difference to your actual performance and women just cannot stand next to somebody and beat them. You know, the reason why I suppose I'm speaking out more than most is that I competed against these Germans for nearly 10 years of my life, and I know exactly what it feels like to stand next to someone that you know no matter what you do in the swimming pool, you just can't beat them."

She has spoken to many of her friends who are competing nowadays. I've spoken to many swimmers that are competing nowadays, and they are all very frightened to speak out because they get called transphobic, which is just not true. This is about sports. This is about biology. And this is about science. And all we're asking for is more research. At the moment, for the Olympic Games next year in Tokyo, you just have to reduce your testosterone for one year. So no surgery, no diagnosis from a doctor, no estrogen in your system whatsoever. And in fact, if Putin want to put at all his third and fourth and fifth string males against the rest of the British athletes and world athletes, he could do that right now providing they stood up and said that they recognize themselves and self- identify as a woman.

You know, if you start to look at some of the statistics, they are really frightening. So for instance, last year, their birth rate fell about 12%. Perhaps to the lowest rate in the history of the People's Republic going back to 1949. And we are seeing that the workforce has already topped out. The population as a whole will top out soon. China's officials are just in a panic."

      "utterance": "So they are identifying women who are breed-ready but then what do they do with that information? Is there going to be a coercive breeding program in China?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "There very possibly could be because some Chinese officials are now talking about having a two-child policy which is not a maximum two children, but they are talking about requiring couples to have two children. Now, of course, China is not there yet. But you can see where they are going largely because they have been taken by surprise by a collapsing demography. They shouldn't have been. People have been warning Chinese officials about this for the last 15 years. But they have sort of sloughed off the warnings but, you know, a couple of years ago they really started to see the consequences of declining demography."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But I mean, I have been hearing from Democrats in this country who are very concerned about having any kids because of global warming, it sounds like the Chinese aren't as concerned about global warming as we are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "No, and largely because every social problem, every economic problem they have, almost all of them are made worse by declining demography and the Chinese leaders start to notice and that's starting with their economy because, you know, they grew during what was called the demographic dividend years. That was expanding workforce. Now, the workforce since 2011 has started to get smaller and it's gotten smaller fast."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So we have the same demographic problems here, obviously and so does Western Europe declining below replacement rate. We just import new people from the developing world. Has it occurred to the Chinese to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "No, you know, the Chinese don't want to do that because they have a system and then basically, it's based on racial superiority where they do view the rest of the world in inferior terms. And you know, Tucker, on demography, within maybe three years, for the first time in at least 300 years, maybe all of recorded history, China is not going to be the world's most populous society. The world's most populous society will be India and the Chinese both disdain the Indians because of this racial superiority view but also, they fear India. So people are concerned that China is seeing a closing window of opportunity and will lash out on that Himalayan border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, very quick, you just said something that almost nobody ever says which is that China may be the most racist country in the world, maybe after North Korea, but certainly, it is right up there. The country is based on racial superiority and yet liberals in this country suck up to China constantly. Why does no one ever point that out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "You know, that, to me, is a mystery because this nation of enhanced superiority is bred into the Chinese political system and you see it, for instance, they put on a skit on the China Central Television's program, 900 million people saw it that depicted Africans as primates and it is just incredible, Tucker."

      "utterance": "While China rises to rivals the United States, our own people hardly inspire much confidence. To cope with modern life, more and more Americans are making use of emotional support animals. Not all are dogs or cats, that's probably a good thing. Some are spiders or monkeys, one man has an emotional support alligator called, Wally."

      "speaker": "MIKE ROWE, TV HOST",
      "utterance": "Look, I mean, this is an interesting clip. I never really considered the alligator before and I admit, my knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss it as absurd, but it's I guess it's better than crocodile, right, which is completely a different animal and I suppose then, we would have entirely crossed over. Of course it's crazy, except for the fact that it's not always crazy. So if we have our typical binary choice of crazy, not crazy, I'm going to wind up saying something that loses me, however, many fans I might have left. So, all I can tell you, in my world, I love my dog. I have never traveled with my dog anywhere and I do not begrudge people who travel with their pets. But I was -- the first thing that I was invited to do when I adopted my little dog was to get one of those service tags and I said, \"Well, I don't need a service tag.\" And I was told very specifically by a veterinarian, by the way, it's so simple, just go ahead and apply. They can't turn you down. So if we are in a world where anybody can get any tag for any creature to thereby allow them to legally accompany them anywhere, well then I would simply refer to you that classic line in \"Ghostbusters,\" I think where dogs and cats are living together."

      "utterance": "I should say in full disclosure, I know a woman who I may be married to who has brought a Springer Spaniel on airplanes because it's a great dog, honestly. And that seems like a very positive thing to me. But I wonder, does it tell us something about people's lack of human contact that this is as widespread as it is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROWE",
      "utterance": "I think it tells us everything about people's lack of human contact and our increasing lack of empathy, but also, our increasing level of expectations and righteousness. All of this collides in a way that's really difficult to understand. But I will leave you with this, I was flying back from Dallas and I just wrote about this on to Facebook. I got on, I sat down, I had a vodka soda, I fell asleep. I woke up and I looked down and between my legs on the floor was something I had not put there. It was about this long and it was brown and I just couldn't for the life of me figure out what it was, and then it moved. And then I thought, \"My God, it's a snake.\" And I reached down and I grabbed it and the dog yelped behind me. An enormous dog was sitting behind me, and so stood up because I had to see this creature. It scared the heck out of me. It was in the company of a veteran and it had the service vest on and so I sit down and I talk to this guy for about 20 minutes and get his whole story, which include, must visit destinations like Fallujah and all these places and suddenly, you know, I don't know what to think, Tucker. I went from outraged, frightened, the size of this animal on a plane, what's going on, to thank you for your service, that's a good dog. Tail scared the hell out of me but still, you know, we have got to figure it out and there is not going to be playbook that makes sense in every situation."
