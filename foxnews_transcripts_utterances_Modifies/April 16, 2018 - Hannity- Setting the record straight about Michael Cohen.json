Tonight, I got to give a special shout out to all of you liberals in the media and all across America, everyone out there that may not usually watch, tuning in, about some recent news about yours truly that came up today. Let not your heart be troubled. In a few minutes, we will address all of the rumors and speculation and you don't want to miss that at all.  Also, tonight, yes, the book tour has begun. After months of buildup, fired FBI Director James Comey has finally kicked off his quest to become rich and famous and just as we predicted, Comey is now trashing all things Trump, engaging in wild speculation, throwing everybody under the bus, and is the most pitied human being on earth. And as it turns out, James Comey's, quote, 'higher loyalty' is to James Comey. Tonight, we're going to break down some of the most egregious moments from last night's interview.  Plus, we'll show you the questions that Clinton sycophant George Stephanopoulos should have asked last night in his softball sit-down interview. This was by far the worst interview I have ever seen. Also tonight, we'll analyze Friday's U.S.-led military strikes in Syria. It's time for Assad to wake up. The weak, ineffective days of doing nothing of Obama are long gone. And we'll have that and so much more in tonight's important breaking news opening monologue.",

And Comey told Stephanopoulos, quote: 'he's a very smart man and a lawyer and so, it surprised me, he shouldn't have done it, it was inappropriate.' Despite the immense buildup surrounding the interview and all of the alleged explosive new developments, this book was supposed to reveal, the mainstream media's reaction was mixed, because without a doubt, over the next few weeks, many in the media, they're going to treat Comey as the honorable public servant who stood up to the left's most hated figure -- that being President Donald Trump. And you're not likely to see any pressing questions about how we let Clinton off the hook. And you are also not likely be see questions about his rampant misconduct or how at least a dozen high-ranking FBI Justice Department officials have been demoted, forced to resign in disgrace, and someone fired in the case of Andrew McCabe during the last year of his reign as director.  Make no mistake. James Comey's book tour is off to a very predictable start. The media, while they continue to play up his multiple appearances, this nationwide tour for fame and fortune, it is much ado about nothing. But there are serious legal issues at stake here. Joining us now, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova. And the author of the bestseller \"Trumped Up: How the Criminalization of Political Differences Engenders Democracy,\" there's some important things.

He is saying to George Stephanopoulos, it's still unverified, and yet, Andrew McCabe is on record saying, oh, without the dossier, no warrant, and he's also -- we also know that the dossier made up the bulk of the application, according to the Grassley-Graham memo.

On January 11th, before intelligence chief came out to Trump tower they were about to issue in a report on their findings of Russian involvement in the election and wanted us to be aware of what that report was going to be. We sat down, how does that report given to us, at which time, there was a series of questions that were asked by Reince Priebus, General Flynn, Tom Bossert, the homeland security adviser, and Vice President Mike Pence. After the discussion ended, and again, a key point and that is that there was a lot of questions back and forth, which Director Comey suggest did not occur. But I just named four of those people that definitely ask questions. Then at that point, Director Comey said to the president-elect, may I see privately in the back of the room? We got up, the rest of us exited the room, the secure room where we'd receive the briefing and then went outside. At that time, as you may recall, there was a little bit of distrust amongst some of the political appointees, Director Clapper and Director Brennan so we ran by the statement that we are going to issue to make sure that was in accord with the classified nature of the briefing, and that they wouldn't going to differ in terms of their account of the meeting that we just had. And Comey goes on to his book to talk about how it became a P.R. session. That's not true. That's not how it went down. And again, as I noted a lot of people do that. Further, as Comey himself says in his reporting here, he verbally briefed the president on some of the salacious and unproven allegations. CNN went on to report falsely that he had been given a two page report. That report wasn't actually even done at the time that we were briefed. So both Director Comey's account of it is misleading and CNN's reporting of that meeting are false.",

Michael Cohen never represented me in any legal matter. I never retained his services. I never received an invoice. I never paid Michael Cohen for legal fees. I did have occasional brief conversations with Michael Cohen. He is a great attorney, about legal questions I had. Or I was looking for input and perspective. My discussions with Michael Cohen never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions. And to be absolutely clear, they never involved any matter, any -- sorry to disappoint so many -- matter between me or third party, third group at all. And my questions exclusively almost focused on real estate. I said many times on my radio show, I hate the stock market, I prefer real estate. Michael knows real estate. So in response to all the wild speculation, I want to set the record straight here tonight. I never asked Michael Cohen to bring this proceeding on my behalf.

Tonight, I got to give a special shout out to all of you liberals in the media and all across America, everyone out there that may not usually watch, tuning in, about some recent news about yours truly that came up today. Let not your heart be troubled. In a few minutes, we will address all of the rumors and speculation and you don't want to miss that at all. Also, tonight, yes, the book tour has begun. After months of buildup, fired FBI Director James Comey has finally kicked off his quest to become rich and famous and just as we predicted, Comey is now trashing all things Trump, engaging in wild speculation, throwing everybody under the bus, and is the most pitied human being on earth. And as it turns out, James Comey's, quote, 'higher loyalty' is to James Comey. Tonight, we're going to break down some of the most egregious moments from last night's interview. Plus, we'll show you the questions that Clinton sycophant George Stephanopoulos should have asked last night in his softball sit-down interview. This was by far the worst interview I have ever seen. Also tonight, we'll analyze Friday's U.S.-led military strikes in Syria. It's time for Assad to wake up. The weak, ineffective days of doing nothing of Obama are long gone. And we'll have that and so much more in tonight's important breaking news opening monologue."

But with this strike, the president is sending a clear message to the Assad regime -- you don't use these evil, insidious weapons. There will be severe consequences. You can't let men, women, and children, literally dying on television cameras like this. So disgraceful. Also tonight, disgraced former FBI Director James Comey kicked off his much-anticipated book tour last night was none other than Clinton sycophant, Clinton spokesperson turned ABC journalist George Stephanopoulos.

What is shocking is the attack is attack Comey made next, comparing the sitting president of the United States to a mafia crime family, people involved in murder, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, drug dealing.

For a former FBI director, one of the highest-ranking law enforcement officials in the country to compare a sitting president to a member of the mafia is disgusting and it's also irresponsible. Sadly, this salacious, reckless rhetoric didn't end there. Comey also speculated about the untrue, unverified, uncorroborated claims that were made in the Clinton bought and paid for a dossier. You know, the rumors, Trump, hookers, Ritz Carlton, Moscow, urinating on a bed -- without a shred of evidence, nothing, James Comey tells Stephanopoulos, well, this could possibly be true.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "George Stephanopoulos, where is the follow-up? Why didn't you ask Comey to confirm if that dossier was used as the primary piece of information to obtain a FISA warrants on a Trump campaign associate weeks before the election? Why didn't you ask him, did he lie to the FISA court? Did he withhold the sensitive nature that this document was in fact unverified, not corroborated? Why was it ever presented to a FISA court? Now, was it -- did you ever mention it, that Trump's political opponent in an election year paid for this thing, full of Russian lies? Of course, we have an outside foreign entity putting it together, Christopher Steele? George, why didn't you ask Comey to respond to his former deputy, Andrew McCabe, who told the House Intel Committee, no surveillance warrant would have been sought were it not for the information in that dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele and the dossier information was essentially in acquiring warrants. Remember, the Grassley-Graham memo which found out that the bulk of the FISA application consisted of this unverified, uncorroborated Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies. Once again, without any evidence to back up his claims, Comey also entertained the idea that Donald Trump, the sitting U.S. president, had been compromised by Russia. Really? I guess he wouldn't have bombed Syria on Friday night. Take a look."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "It is stunning and I wish I wasn't saying it, but it's just -- it's the truth. It always struck me, it still strikes me as unlikely, and I would have been able to say with high confidence about any other president I dealt with, but I can't. It's possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Again, where's the evidence? By the way, if you don't know if it's true, how does it get presented in a FISA court to get a warrant to spy to an American citizen? You would think as a former FBI director, you know, how can Comey make such a serious claim about a sitting U.S. president without anything to back it up? And then the cherry on the cake of Comey's irresponsible, unhinged, personal tirade against Donald Trump was a new parroted the liberal talking point that Trump is unfit to serve. So, there you have it, sanctimonious Jim Comey casting judgment from his moral high ground and yet, he doesn't even know if the dossier is true but it was used to obtain a warrant. If you watch this show, you know that Comey may have committed a number of crimes and misdeeds, things that I believe need to be investigated, including leaking classified, privileged information to the press. Watch how Comey tried to explain this away during this lovefest last night."
    },

      "speaker": "STEPHANOPOULOS",

      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, it's true. I mean, I'm the one who testified about it. That's how people know about it. I gave that unclassified memo to my friend and asked him to give it to a reporter. That is entirely appropriate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Once again, George, where is the follow-up? Why not ask Comey to explain how private communications between a sitting president and an FBI director are not confidential, privileged, classified? Of course, this was not the first extremely shaky excuse that he had to go completely unchallenged. Remember, when Comey helped draft the letter exonerating Hillary Clinton from crimes that was in May, before she was even interviewed in July and 17 other key witnesses were interviewed. And, by the way, Peter Strzok ran that interviewed. Listen to this pathetic and lame explanation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEPHANOPOULOS",
      "utterance": "Critics say the fix was in from the start. President Trump says you were writing the conclusion even before you interviewed Hillary Clinton. That is just wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMEY",
      "utterance": "Anybody who's actually done investigating knows that if you been investigating something for almost a year and you don't have a general sense of where it's likely to end up, you should be fired."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Wait a minute. How could you possibly know the likely outcome of a criminal investigation without even interviewing the main suspect or the 17 key witnesses? How many investigations start with an exoneration being written before an investigation? James Comey, did you ever hear about 18 USC 793? How many people can store top-secret classified special access programming information on and on unauthorized server and not be charged with a crime and destroy such information? And, by the way, how many people do you know that can delete 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washed, bleached bit the hard drive, beat the crap out of her BlackBerrys with hammers, and not get prosecuted for obstruction of justice. Finally, could Comey's special treatment of Hillary Clinton, well, could that be tied to pressure from his own family? Now, we do know this after last night. We know that his entire family apparently attended the Women's March on Washington after his inauguration. His wife was an avid supporter of Hillary Clinton. Wasn't this the same march where Madonna talked about dreaming to blowing up the White House? Take a look."

      "utterance": "'he's a very smart man and a lawyer and so, it surprised me, he shouldn't have done it, it was inappropriate.' Despite the immense buildup surrounding the interview and all of the alleged explosive new developments, this book was supposed to reveal, the mainstream media's reaction was mixed, because without a doubt, over the next few weeks, many in the media, they're going to treat Comey as the honorable public servant who stood up to the left's most hated figure -- that being President Donald Trump. And you're not likely to see any pressing questions about how we let Clinton off the hook. And you are also not likely be see questions about his rampant misconduct or how at least a dozen high-ranking FBI Justice Department officials have been demoted, forced to resign in disgrace, and someone fired in the case of Andrew McCabe during the last year of his reign as director. Make no mistake. James Comey's book tour is off to a very predictable start. The media, while they continue to play up his multiple appearances, this nationwide tour for fame and fortune, it is much ado about nothing. But there are serious legal issues at stake here. Joining us now, former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova. And the author of the bestseller \"Trumped Up: How the Criminalization of Political Differences Engenders Democracy,\" there's some important things. Joe, I want to start with you tonight, not the least of which I think we got to go to the dossier issue, in large part, because when you look at the dossier, what do we see? He is saying to George Stephanopoulos, it's still unverified, and yet, Andrew McCabe is on record saying, oh, without the dossier, no warrant, and he's also -- we also know that the dossier made up the bulk of the application, according to the Grassley-Graham memo. So, he is saying they never corroborated it and they brought that before a FISA court judge and an application? What does that say to you?"

It is inconceivable to me that anyone can now think that he performed a legitimate law enforcement function during the investigation of Hillary Clinton. And it is quite obvious that the dossier was a fake document, that it was absolutely purposefully used illegally by senior officials of the FBI and the Department of Justice. Mr. Comey has lied repeatedly last night and regrettably, he lied to the FISA court, he encouraged others to lie to the FISA court, and regrettably, I think Mr. Comey has to be charged with crimes for falsely presenting information to a FISA court and for apparently lying regularly to Congress."

Now you know what? I would never have charged Hillary Clinton with anything beyond a misdemeanor in her case. If they had been smart, what they would have done was negotiated a deal with her.

And what's really sobering in here I think what Alan Dershowitz was saying is so important, you had the number one and number two people in the Federal Bureau of Investigation both engaged in behavior that clearly violated the law. I mean, I think the whole depth, the idea that the top two people and what is our preeminent law enforcement agency in the entire country, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, literally now you've had an internal report by the inspector general saying McCabe clearly lied, you had this analysis by Rod Rosenstein, which if you have never read all of it, is really staggering in the degree to which it repudiates Comey.

I can't imagine James Comey saying, well, it could be true at this late date, meaning the Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier. And that that was and he knew she paid for it, and that was the basis, the Grassley-Graham memo, the bulk of the application that they used to get the warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate. That to me is criminal. You don't lie before a judge, nor do you write exonerations before you even interview the person. He did that, too."

The case made today by a very senior attorney in Washington writing in a legal journal, that if you read the inspector general on McCabe, McCabe did exactly what General Flynn did. Now look at how General Flynn has been treated and look where McCabe is at this minute. So, clearly, if you were to apply the law, and not just apply the social norms among good friends, both McCabe and Comey I think would be in very serious legal risk at this stage."

So at every stage, if somebody else disagreed, he is disappointed in them. This is a point made by Rosenstein in his memo to the president. That Comey seems incapable of learning from his mistakes. Or incapable of even thinking that there are mistakes. And so, I mean, the level of danger that we had in having an FBI director who had this level of megalomania, and who decided that he would supplant the attorney general, whether you like or dislike Loretta Lynch, she was the attorney general. No FBI director has the authority to decide that he will now replace her and yet, that's what he did, and in explaining why he had to announce what he did about Hillary Clinton. That he was protecting an institution. It wasn't his job to protect the institution. It's an act of stunning arrogance to believe that he was the only perfect person in an otherwise flawed world."

      "speaker": "SEAN SPICER, FORMER UNITED STATES WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "No, I think the account that director Comey has in his book is at best misleading. So let me laid out for you. On January 11th, before intelligence chief came out to Trump tower they were about to issue in a report on their findings of Russian involvement in the election and wanted us to be aware of what that report was going to be. We sat down, how does that report given to us, at which time, there was a series of questions that were asked by Reince Priebus, General Flynn, Tom Bossert, the homeland security adviser, and Vice President Mike Pence. After the discussion ended, and again, a key point and that is that there was a lot of questions back and forth, which Director Comey suggest did not occur. But I just named four of those people that definitely ask questions. Then at that point, Director Comey said to the president-elect, may I see privately in the back of the room? We got up, the rest of us exited the room, the secure room where we'd receive the briefing and then went outside. At that time, as you may recall, there was a little bit of distrust amongst some of the political appointees, Director Clapper and Director Brennan so we ran by the statement that we are going to issue to make sure that was in accord with the classified nature of the briefing, and that they wouldn't going to differ in terms of their account of the meeting that we just had. And Comey goes on to his book to talk about how it became a P.R. session. That's not true. That's not how it went down. And again, as I noted a lot of people do that. Further, as Comey himself says in his reporting here, he verbally briefed the president on some of the salacious and unproven allegations. CNN went on to report falsely that he had been given a two page report. That report wasn't actually even done at the time that we were briefed. So both Director Comey's account of it is misleading and CNN's reporting of that meeting are false."

      "utterance": "All right. Let me go to Dr. Gorka. So, you know, the big issue for the media, for over a year, has been, Russian influence in the election. And James Comey knew before the election Hillary paid a foreign national, Christopher's Steele, through Perkins Coie, for Fusion GPS, and they paid for Russian lies to manipulate the American people. And then they used it to get a FISA warrant. And then they exonerated Hillary after Peter Strzok interviewed her and they brought the exoneration months earlier. And I'm trying to think, you can't make this irony up when you think about it."

      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "It's not just ironic. You look at the last 16 months, what do we now? We have no evidence of Russian collusion between the president and his campaign. But we know for certain that James Comey is a liar. We know that James Comey leaks to the media. We know the fact that he tries to get his buddy, Robert Mueller, to become a special prosecutor investigating the president, who he didn't want to win the election, his wife didn't want Trump to win, nor did Comey, these are the facts of the case. He has done more single-handedly to damage the FBI than J. Edgar Hoover has done. And if you look at the fact that in his interview yesterday, he is propagating the narrative of the president potentially being a pawn of the Russians, what is he doing? With zero evidence, he is actually assisting in a Russian misinformation operation. That's what James Comey is doing."

To go out there and profess loyalty and concern for these institutions and then openly speculate with no evidence is highly irresponsible. Now he's free to do it, it's a free country. You can do it. But you can't go around and talk about the loyalty that you have to the institutions to this country and openly speculate about things of that nature and not wonder, and not have the opposite effect. There is a reason I think that the director's book, and his account, and appearance are getting panned. And that's because I think he has -- it's become brought him, his image, and his attempts to sell books and not the truth."

Michael Cohen never represented me in any legal matter. I never retained his services. I never received an invoice. I never paid Michael Cohen for legal fees. I did have occasional brief conversations with Michael Cohen. He is a great attorney, about legal questions I had. Or I was looking for input and perspective. My discussions with Michael Cohen never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions. And to be absolutely clear, they never involved any matter, any -- sorry to disappoint so many -- matter between me or third party, third group at all. And my questions exclusively almost focused on real estate. I said many times on my radio show, I hate the stock market, I prefer real estate. Michael knows real estate. So in response to all the wild speculation, I want to set the record straight here tonight. I never asked Michael Cohen to bring this proceeding on my behalf. I have no personal interest in this legal matter. That's all there is. Nothing more."
