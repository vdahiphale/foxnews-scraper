Let's start with a surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. A lot of people say this is because we don't have a national plan. Do you take responsibility for that?  We ask him about reopening schools and whether Washington will pass another big relief bill for businesses that have been shut down and workers that have been laid off. The stimulus bill is running out the end of this month. Will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions?  Then, the nationwide protests against racism and police forces, along with a dramatic increase in urban violence.   There has been a spike in violent crime in America in recent weeks. How do you explain it and what are you going to do about it? And we tell the president about new FOX polls from the state of the 2020 race. You talked about how you're winning and campaign is going well, why did you replace Brad Parscale?   And much more about Dr. Fauci and the cancel culture, and Mary Trump's tell-all book.",

And now I feel good because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of Alabama. Here's the bottom line, I've been very unfairly treated. And I don't say that as paranoid. I've been very - everybody says it. It's going to be interesting to see what happens. But there's tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was. President Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. It's never happened in history. If it were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years right now. That would be Comey, that would be Brennan, that would be all of this - the two lovers, Strzok and Page, they would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail. It would have started two years ago and they'd be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let's see what happens. Despite that, I did more than any president in history in the first three and a half years.",

We ask him about reopening schools and whether Washington will pass another big relief bill for businesses that have been shut down and workers that have been laid off. The stimulus bill is running out the end of this month. Will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions? Then, the nationwide protests against racism and police forces, along with a dramatic increase in urban violence. There has been a spike in violent crime in America in recent weeks. How do you explain it and what are you going to do about it? And we tell the president about new FOX polls from the state of the 2020 race. You talked about how you're winning and campaign is going well, why did you replace Brad Parscale? And much more about Dr. Fauci and the cancel culture, and Mary Trump's tell-all book."

I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors. Many of the governors are changing. They're more mask into -- they like the concept of masks, but some of them don't agree. I do say this -- schools have to open. Young people have to go to school, and there's problems when you don't go to school, too.

The Russia hoax, it was all a hoax. The Mueller scam, it was all a scam. It was all false. I made a bad decision on - one bad decision. Jeff Sessions. And now I feel good because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of Alabama. Here's the bottom line, I've been very unfairly treated. And I don't say that as paranoid. I've been very - everybody says it. It's going to be interesting to see what happens. But there's tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was. President Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. It's never happened in history. If it were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years right now. That would be Comey, that would be Brennan, that would be all of this - the two lovers, Strzok and Page, they would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail. It would have started two years ago and they'd be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let's see what happens. Despite that, I did more than any president in history in the first three and a half years."
