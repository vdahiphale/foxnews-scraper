We have a situation where Bob Mueller and his team believes they have credible evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they can introduce in court and be successful with the prosecution.  Yes, this is very serious. And I would worry about the president not seriously confronting the president of Russia about these indictments. This is extremely serious, but even more frightening is the sure knowledge that is this going to continue and is going to occur during the midterm elections and beyond. So, I think I'm disappointed about the reaction, the public reaction from the White House. I understand they're happy about the fact that there's no ties to an American or to the Trump campaign, but to not say anything, and to not indict the Russian government for this indictment, to me, is baffling and disappointing, because this is extremely serious.  And it affects the very essence of who we are as a democracy. And we need to hold Russia accountable. And so, if the president's not willing to confront Putin and to -- I just -- I would worry about this meeting.",

The president will inquire about this, as he's inquired and mentioned in the past two meetings he's had with Vladimir Putin about Russian meddling in the prior election.
