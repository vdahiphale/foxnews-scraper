      "sentences": "She went from the Greek system to the penal system. A Judge set bail at a million bucks for rioters arrested in Lancaster, Pennsylvania after the police shot a knife-wielding madman. One suspect, a sorority girl is charged with felony arson, felony riot, and felony vandalism. She basically majored in felonies with a minor in looting for formal dresses. A million bucks. It's a lot of deer meat.  But the judge has since lowered the bail to 50 grand, still, I credit him for initially coming down hard. He is an adult who gets disincentives which are just incentives, but with an extra syllable.  I've got to hand it to Amish country. The thing about traveling around in a horse and buggy is you learn how to crack a whip.  Fact is if there's a chance you get locked up with a shocking bail for rioting, looting or arson, you won't riot, loot or arson. Imagine if other cities early on hadn't gone so soft. Lives wouldn't have been lost, people's businesses would have been ruined. Right media?",

Imagine thinking that John Kerry or Hillary Clinton were actual statesmen, while they mocked Jared Kushner for even thinking he could sit at the adult table.

That's our media: a shady machine of ignorant trolls who create horrible problems and call you crazy for pointing them out. People overuse the phrase \"gaslighting,\" but the media has gone further. In their actual gaslighting, they deny real gaslighting, saying that arsonists starting blazes was just a conspiracy. But now we have arrests, but I'm sure it's still Trump's fault. Trump upset these fire bugs you see and torching homes was their stress ball. Fact is, the press and most politicians are far removed from the strife they cause.  They embrace defunding police just like the Minneapolis City Council who are now alarmed by a crime surge after voting to defund police. They just got mugged by reality and probably a few thugs, too.  Far removed from looting, authors still write think pieces defending it as protests. So you see the trend. It is, if the burden is not in your backyard, what's the big deal? Sure shut down a bridge or block traffic. You go, girl. I don't need to get home from work. I am home. I just have a plant and it's dead.   And so this bloody summer is brought to you by media excusing pain that they're immune from, but who's not immune besides the small businesses, minority shopkeepers, injured citizens or commuters? How about the protesters? The sorority girl? Have you seen the mug shots? Do these people appear sound? Do they seem all right?",

But what happens to these people in 10 years? Will, they look back and shame it their grim antifascism phase? Would they be like Manson family members who thought they were leading a revolution, only to find that they were consumed by self-indulgent delusions that led to insane acts of cruelty toward innocent people?

I have a huge problem with the way we're talking about it not because there's no problem with our Criminal Justice System, but because there is, but we're not really addressing the main issue, which is lack of accountability. Even though this week, a report came out, the Registry of Exonerations found that in cases where people were innocent, but convicted of a crime wrongly, there was police or prosecutor misconduct in more than  50 percent of those cases. But anyone who was committing the misconduct, only 17 percent of the time, was there some sort of discipline taken against those people. And so it's a huge problem. There needs to be reform. But as it turns out, not one of those problems that can be solved just by taking the cash away, okay, as well as that works, in the plot of \"Billy Madison,\" it turns out our Criminal Justice System is not a drunken lazy nudie magazine obsessed Adam Sandler character.  And we're having these stupid conversations where people like Don Lemon are saying, I went to New York. It was fine. Well, okay, like I went to the pharmacy this week, and I didn't see a stabbing. Why? Because I went about  10 minutes earlier than I would have gone to see the stabbing across the street.  When we talk and fight about this stupid stuff, we miss the real issues. You're not helping anything especially because anyone can watch videos. And as you mentioned, look at statistics and see that just because you managed to have a peaceful dinner, that doesn't mean anything, so then we can't have the real conversations we need to have.",

A recent IPSOS poll found that 59 percent of Americans knew someone with the virus, and 33 percent knew someone who died from it. Meanwhile, health experts fear another surge of cases this fall. And schools in Rhode Island have launched a silent lunch policy. Students are required to chat quietly or not at all during meals. That's to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

One suspect, a sorority girl is charged with felony arson, felony riot, and felony vandalism. She basically majored in felonies with a minor in looting for formal dresses. A million bucks. It's a lot of deer meat. But the judge has since lowered the bail to 50 grand, still, I credit him for initially coming down hard. He is an adult who gets disincentives which are just incentives, but with an extra syllable. I've got to hand it to Amish country. The thing about traveling around in a horse and buggy is you learn how to crack a whip. Fact is if there's a chance you get locked up with a shocking bail for rioting, looting or arson, you won't riot, loot or arson. Imagine if other cities early on hadn't gone so soft.

In their actual gaslighting, they deny real gaslighting, saying that arsonists starting blazes was just a conspiracy. But now we have arrests, but I'm sure it's still Trump's fault. Trump upset these fire bugs you see and torching homes was their stress ball. Fact is, the press and most politicians are far removed from the strife they cause. They embrace defunding police just like the Minneapolis City Council who are now alarmed by a crime surge after voting to defund police. They just got mugged by reality and probably a few thugs, too. Far removed from looting, authors still write think pieces defending it as protests. So you see the trend. It is, if the burden is not in your backyard, what's the big deal? Sure shut down a bridge or block traffic. You go, girl. I don't need to get home from work. I am home. I just have a plant and it's dead.

And nothing goes over his head. It's literally impossible. My massive sidekick and host of \"Nuff Said\" on FOX Nation, Tyrus. All right, Emily, you know what I'm amazed by is how if you weigh the coverage of things that Trump says versus things that Trump does, it's amazing. Like the peace deal barely got covered. Maybe it got on some front pages, but then it just went away."

And it was so overwhelmingly positive, obviously, right? They recognized the historical significance. They recognized the trade opportunities this opens up. They recognized the strategic undercutting for Iran and Palestine, which is a positive thing. Literally, the only source of downplaying or minimizing or not even covering this development, this historical moment was our own liberal mainstream media."

      "utterance": "I want to talk about the whole debate going on about police, criminal justice and the way we're talking about it right now. I have a huge problem with the way we're talking about it not because there's no problem with our Criminal Justice System, but because there is, but we're not really addressing the main issue, which is lack of accountability. Even though this week, a report came out, the Registry of Exonerations found that in cases where people were innocent, but convicted of a crime wrongly, there was police or prosecutor misconduct in more than 50 percent of those cases. But anyone who was committing the misconduct, only 17 percent of the time, was there some sort of discipline taken against those people. And so it's a huge problem. There needs to be reform. But as it turns out, not one of those problems that can be solved just by taking the cash away, okay, as well as that works, in the plot of \"Billy Madison,\" it turns out our Criminal Justice System is not a drunken lazy nudie magazine obsessed Adam Sandler character. And we're having these stupid conversations where people like Don Lemon are saying, I went to New York. It was fine. Well, okay, like I went to the pharmacy this week, and I didn't see a stabbing. Why? Because I went about 10 minutes earlier than I would have gone to see the stabbing across the street. When we talk and fight about this stupid stuff, we miss the real issues. You're not helping anything especially because anyone can watch videos. And as you mentioned, look at statistics and see that just because you managed to have a peaceful dinner, that doesn't mean anything, so then we can't have the real conversations we need to have."

And for that \"Despacito\" thing. That was the worst thing I've ever seen. I don't know why it like hit me in the juggler so much. I think because my neighbor used to play that song on repeat so much, and it would get in my head and it was hideous. But if I -- if I was at some type of Italian-American event, and Biden came up and played, \"That's Amore\" or the MTV \"Jersey Shore\" theme song, I would set that place on fire.

A recent IPSOS poll found that 59 percent of Americans knew someone with the virus, and 33 percent knew someone who died from it. Meanwhile, health experts fear another surge of cases this fall. And schools in Rhode Island have launched a silent lunch policy. Students are required to chat quietly or not at all during meals. That's to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

I once flew to the Caribbean from the West Coast for a birthday party. And in college, this one frat would build these walls around their whole property and they would keep everyone inside for a full 24 hours and if the colleges didn't think that a spring break's worth of partying occurred in that 24 hours, then I feel like they don't understand what college is."

The Columbia University Marching Band recently announced they would permanently shut down in an effort to take responsibility for what it calls a history of offensive behavior. In other news, Columbia University had a marching band. Apparently for over a century, the band has developed a reputation of irreverence on campus. I don't know why I did that. But in that statement posted to Facebook, the organization says they've had to discuss numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, assault, theft, racism and injury to individuals and the Columbia community as a whole. Wow. It makes Motley Crue look like the Beach Boys. According to the band, the damage it inflicted is beyond repair. I feel the same way about Duran Duran. Now with no marching band, Columbia no longer has a spirit group to perform at sporting events. But I've got the perfect replacement."

I don't understand how that they want to be congratulated for what?"

You notice they don't mention anything specific. They get \"The New York Times\" to cover it and then in a couple weeks, we'll find out it was all a big joke. But if they are taking it seriously, and it looks like the university is, they should just rename Columbia because it's named after Christopher Columbus at some point, and they should rename it Indigenous U or something like that. But I want to commend the students for one thing, they achieved this dramatic social change without any looting, at least, not yet."

No one has ever told you a band camp story that didn't lead to some scars forever in life. I'm just glad that America is finally shedding some light on the bands. They always want to blame the ballplayers."

They were like, everyone raise your hand if you did something wrong. Everybody. You know, and then they played music about it. They were sarcastic about it. So you know what? They had to break it up. There were too many witnesses. And here's the thing, it's not just college, like whereas a football player, we had to be stringent under scholarship to actually go to the school. Anybody off the street could join this band. Anyone. So there was no way of keeping people in and out. They also have the lock on Hollywood. So how they were getting all the movies? You know what I'm saying? There always seem to be one band in the movies, this group of thugs who come together with instruments and have basically traumatized the country, all for a little happy music with evil faces going around? The gangsters are on the football field, and the ones behind the flutes and the trombones. And think about the evilness that goes that goes in to want to play them instruments. I remember I tried to play the French horn and the saxophone, I couldn't do it. Didn't like carrying the thing around. So I see how the years build up. The anger and -- you know what I'm saying? So hey, you know, what, about time. Get off the jocks' back and start punishing these band -- you know what, I can't say it anymore. Because one, I like my job. And two, I don't want them coming after me. So you know, forget everything I just said. I don't need a bunch of band members protesting singing songs in front of my house. So whatever. Just -- I'm glad ballplayers are finally getting a break."

    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "It would definitely not go away and charges could definitely be pressed if there was evidence of these crimes. I have to say that the funny part to me was that the official statement that this band put out as they were indulging in their self-erasure was we unanimously and enthusiastically dissolve. Like these guys were stoked to capitulate to cancel culture, and meanwhile, the alumni organization, this band is 116 years old or the tradition of it is, the alumni came out and they were like, no, we categorically reject all of this. And to me, the sad part is that it's an example where these kids are making a decision and they have absolutely no idea of consequences or actual history or legacy or gravitas, unless they indeed are prosecuted for those crimes."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

Why am -- why do I care this much about this band? I really don't. It's just weird. Okay. So I wanted to I want to get to the next segment, because it's my favorite one.

Now, she is on subscription site and charges 20 bucks a month for people to watch her scamper around the house, 20 bucks a month, play tug of war, or fetch a ball."

I will say that when I first saw this, at first I was jealous, as I always am and regretted being an attorney when I see people half my age out earning a million dollars per year for doing nothing. But then when I saw those videos, I was like, you can't pay me enough to do that. Like absolutely not. I don't care how much she is making. And the best part to me too, is that when you dive deeper into like the description of it in the article, it said that she got most of her stuff, her toys and her props from Etsy and also from pet stores where she would make up fictional dogs to avoid quote \"awkward conversations\" with cashiers. So basically this chick is out earning most of America, but she can't disclose how in daylight hours."

Okay? Whenever I ask Cam to take a photo of me for my Instagram, he's like, okay, and I'm acting human and all of those. No more. All right, this guy now that I see, look at him. He is there.
