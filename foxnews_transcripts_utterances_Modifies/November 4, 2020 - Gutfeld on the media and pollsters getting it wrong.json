Breaking news, Fox News now projecting that Joe Biden will win the state of Michigan, the former VP now just six Electoral College votes away from capturing the magic number of 270.  But it is not over yet, votes still being counted in other key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia.  The Trump campaign is still confident it can win and Joe Biden saying earlier that when all of the votes are counted, that he will be the next president.",

      "sentences": "Yes, indeed. Nice to -- socially distance, right, I mean, this is safe, isn't it, Dana? You were -- you're talking about Pennsylvania. Why don't we start there? There seems to be where the action is indeed. We have made a big call on Michigan just within the last hour. That puts Joe Biden six electoral votes away from the White House. So will he get there? Does he have enough to get over that finish line here? Here in Pennsylvania, this is where the action is, Philadelphia down here in the southeast, as Pittsburgh allocating county in the south -- sorry, the western part of the state. What the Trump campaign is saying is that if they can keep Joe Biden around 70 percent outside of the big cities of Philly and Pittsburgh. They have got the chance to keep this state red. So let's see how they can do that, all right? Down here in Philadelphia, a lot of votes come in here, Joe Biden about 80 percent of the vote from Hillary Clinton four years ago.   He's underperforming at the moment from a percentage basis, so we'll see how that continues to fall out there. And again, all of the votes are not in yet. I talk about this Bellwether County, Bucks County. It has been so tight for the past three election cycles. And again, it is pretty tight this year. But Donald Trump is doing better, actually, than we have seen in years past. For example, eight years ago, there was Mitt Romney. Four years ago, here is where Donald Trump was, same county now, and a lot of votes coming in Bucks County. And here we are this year in 2020. This is what gives the Trump team hope right now that they can hold onto this. Just (ph) for the press conference a moment ago from Rudy Giuliani, now they're going to launch a big challenge in Pennsylvania. That's what is coming our way here. Let's pop around here, quite favorable to Biden in Montgomery County.  Also down here in Chester County by about 12 points so far. And Delaware County, a lot of votes too, raw (ph) votes 105, Biden 164,000. We're going to see whether or not the theory applies to what the Trump team is saying right now. If they keep Joe Biden in the low 70s and areas outside of Philadelphia, can they win the state? Well, I can take you around rural Pennsylvania.   And I can tell you that Joe Biden doesn't get anywhere close to the vote margin that he needs in the countryside. The problem is there's not as many votes in rural Pennsylvania as you find in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. So that is the game right now. And in all likelihood, that's going to be the game now. For several days, possibly even weeks, if this is contested to that degree. Why did we call Michigan? I think this is very interesting. Here's Detroit.  Here's Grand Rapids. This is Wayne County. We were watching this thing all night long. We are waiting and waiting for that vote to come in. What I find it interesting is that Joe Biden is at almost 68 percent, Hillary Clinton was at 69. So he is underperforming. So far this year, the president did better in that county. This is Flint, Michigan, Genesee County. He's at 50 percent. She was at 55. So again, the president is outperforming his performance from four years ago. That's why the Trump team was hanging on to hope in Michigan, as you saw from our decision desk -- just wanted to be clear.  Remember last night, Dana, when we're looking at this map and all of a sudden Arizona popped up. I just wanted to make sure that we are in the same year. And indeed we are, 2020. That's where we will freeze it, 264 to 214.",

      "sentences": "It is a mess. I mean, what a perfect ending to 2020, Dana. We don't know anything yet. I think the country deserves a lot better than this. We can't count votes. We can't tabulate states. It is incredibly frustrating. And at this point, with the margins the way they are, whoever wins, Joe Biden or Donald Trump. The other side is going to feel like there are shenanigans. And personally, this is how I see it. I am going to give Joe Biden and I'm going to give him Michigan and Wisconsin. I'm going to give Donald Trump Georgia and North Carolina. I think there is general agreement around that. So to me, it comes down to three states. The constellation is Nevada, is Arizona, and is Pennsylvania. Donald Trump needs to win Pennsylvania and either Nevada or Pennsylvania and Arizona. Right now, Arizona, the Trump campaign believes if they continue the count there, they will be ahead by Friday. Nevada, they believe if they continue the count there, they will be ahead by about 5,500 votes. But there is a lot of sketchy stuff in Nevada. I would not put a lot of stake in that.   Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, he is ahead right now by 400,000 votes. Right now, we heard from Rudy Giuliani that they are counting votes, 125,000 ballots were counted without any poll watchers there, without any representation from the Trump campaign. And they are very concerned about what is going on there. They believe, again, that once these returns fully come in, they have enough votes to maintain the lead in Pennsylvania.  So again, Pennsylvania and Arizona, I believe, the key to the president it's a narrow path. I will admit that -- more narrow than Joe Biden's, but it's doable and they're confident that that will happen.",

You think we would have had this thing figured out, but we did not factor in a few other things.  I'm going to use an analogy. Because I, you know, I looked at this last night, and I thought of it like a Thanksgiving turkey. You spend all this time preparing for the meal, right, and then you put it in the oven. You set it and forget it, right? Six hours, seven hours, however long, that's what it -- I go bed.

I just thought that was really strange. But I also think that everybody in America is tired of being told something that isn't true. We were expected this massive blow out, right? Because Trump is, like, so hated and he's a racist and he's going to lose minorities and women. And then you find out that -- not at all. This is razor-thin. There was no blow out. CNN admits that. He gained in minorities, even gained in women. And he did get the seniors in Florida after all. So you still find out that despite what the media and pollsters were telling you for, I don't know three or four years, America still loves this guy. This was not the outcome we were told. So I think that that is really -- I think that there is a frustration.   And the people at home that are watching this and going, like, what a bunch of BS we were told. We were told that everybody in America hates this guy.  That this is so awful and evil, and here he is. He's like -- he could win. And there are some weird shenanigans going on. Something flew out of my mouth just now. And let's not forget, you can get mad that Trump is fighting for this like anybody would. Remember, Hillary still hasn't conceded 2016, and neither have the media.   So I just think that -- and also, I have one last point. This isn't about networks. It is about an election, so this race to be first and getting the greatest ratings, that is awesome, but at what expense?",

And then we saw Eric Trump come out, Rudy Giuliani come out, very, very fired up, yelling about fraud and stolen elections.  Now, this is part of the democracy, right? This is part of the process. They have every right to contest these if there are 130,000 votes that they want to watch closely. They should open the doors in Philadelphia. Let them come in. Do the recount that they want to have there so that everybody can feel that there is true transparency there.  It's not right to say that someone can witness an election and make them stand across the room. I had the same thought when people kept saying there are all of these cameras and you can watch them vote. I'm, like, can't see anything. All I can see is people shuffling papers around. And so in the world that we live in where no one trusts anything, as Greg was saying. I do think that there is just a real -- sort of a gut feeling of unease about the polling, about everything that people get told. I think that, you know, a lot of folks need to get out of the way and let this process continue to play out. But that's where I feel we stand right now.",

With regard to recounts, I think we have had 30 recounts in American history.  And the two recounts that resulted in any change, the change was within one-tenth of one percent.

He does not even need Pennsylvania to claim the presidency of the United States.

They said I want to stop the count in Pennsylvania until we can get our poll watchers in there to observe the mail-in's being counted. There is a big difference there. The one thing I think the Trump supporters should just listen to and have a little confidence is this.  What we are hearing from the Trump campaign is based on math. It's based on data, and it's based on their internal polling, which so far has been very accurate. They said they were going to win Florida by about two and they were going to be dead even in all the battlegrounds. And they have been. So when they say, for instance, in Arizona that the outstanding vote there of 650,000. Many of them are coming from same-day voters, which Trump was winning by 60-70 percent. They only need to do 58 percent and they will take the lead in Arizona by Friday. That is good because they can't just have Arizona. They have to have Pennsylvania, too. Right now, they are ahead 400,000 in Pennsylvania. Their math says that if they continue to count the legally cast votes, they will maintain that lead. But just for a second, if there was a Republican county, deep red, being over seen by a Republican guy, Republican mayor, Republican governor with a Republican secretary of state that had been litigating the Democrats all year long about what to do and what not to do, and they were kicking observers out of the places that they were counting 150,000 provisional ballots.",

Breaking news, Fox News now projecting that Joe Biden will win the state of Michigan, the former VP now just six Electoral College votes away from capturing the magic number of 270. But it is not over yet, votes still being counted in other key battlegrounds, including Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia. The Trump campaign is still confident it can win and Joe Biden saying earlier that when all of the votes are counted, that he will be the next president."

    {
      "speaker": "BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, indeed. Nice to -- socially distance, right, I mean, this is safe, isn't it, Dana? You were -- you're talking about Pennsylvania. Why don't we start there? There seems to be where the action is indeed. We have made a big call on Michigan just within the last hour. That puts Joe Biden six electoral votes away from the White House. So will he get there? Does he have enough to get over that finish line here? Here in Pennsylvania, this is where the action is, Philadelphia down here in the southeast, as Pittsburgh allocating county in the south -- sorry, the western part of the state. What the Trump campaign is saying is that if they can keep Joe Biden around 70 percent outside of the big cities of Philly and Pittsburgh. They have got the chance to keep this state red. So let's see how they can do that, all right? Down here in Philadelphia, a lot of votes come in here, Joe Biden about 80 percent of the vote from Hillary Clinton four years ago. He's underperforming at the moment from a percentage basis, so we'll see how that continues to fall out there. And again, all of the votes are not in yet. I talk about this Bellwether County, Bucks County. It has been so tight for the past three election cycles. And again, it is pretty tight this year. But Donald Trump is doing better, actually, than we have seen in years past. For example, eight years ago, there was Mitt Romney. Four years ago, here is where Donald Trump was, same county now, and a lot of votes coming in Bucks County. And here we are this year in 2020. This is what gives the Trump team hope right now that they can hold onto this. Just (ph) for the press conference a moment ago from Rudy Giuliani, now they're going to launch a big challenge in Pennsylvania. That's what is coming our way here. Let's pop around here, quite favorable to Biden in Montgomery County. Also down here in Chester County by about 12 points so far. And Delaware County, a lot of votes too, raw (ph) votes 105, Biden 164,000. We're going to see whether or not the theory applies to what the Trump team is saying right now. If they keep Joe Biden in the low 70s and areas outside of Philadelphia, can they win the state? Well, I can take you around rural Pennsylvania. And I can tell you that Joe Biden doesn't get anywhere close to the vote margin that he needs in the countryside. The problem is there's not as many votes in rural Pennsylvania as you find in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. So that is the game right now. And in all likelihood, that's going to be the game now. For several days, possibly even weeks, if this is contested to that degree. Why did we call Michigan? I think this is very interesting. Here's Detroit. Here's Grand Rapids. This is Wayne County. We were watching this thing all night long. We are waiting and waiting for that vote to come in. What I find it interesting is that Joe Biden is at almost 68 percent, Hillary Clinton was at 69. So he is underperforming. So far this year, the president did better in that county. This is Flint, Michigan, Genesee County. He's at 50 percent. She was at 55. So again, the president is outperforming his performance from four years ago. That's why the Trump team was hanging on to hope in Michigan, as you saw from our decision desk -- just wanted to be clear. Remember last night, Dana, when we're looking at this map and all of a sudden Arizona popped up. I just wanted to make sure that we are in the same year. And indeed we are, 2020. That's where we will freeze it, 264 to 214."

We can't tabulate states. It is incredibly frustrating. And at this point, with the margins the way they are, whoever wins, Joe Biden or Donald Trump. The other side is going to feel like there are shenanigans. And personally, this is how I see it. I am going to give Joe Biden and I'm going to give him Michigan and Wisconsin. I'm going to give Donald Trump Georgia and North Carolina. I think there is general agreement around that. So to me, it comes down to three states. The constellation is Nevada, is Arizona, and is Pennsylvania. Donald Trump needs to win Pennsylvania and either Nevada or Pennsylvania and Arizona. Right now, Arizona, the Trump campaign believes if they continue the count there, they will be ahead by Friday. Nevada, they believe if they continue the count there, they will be ahead by about 5,500 votes. But there is a lot of sketchy stuff in Nevada. I would not put a lot of stake in that. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, he is ahead right now by 400,000 votes. Right now, we heard from Rudy Giuliani that they are counting votes, 125,000 ballots were counted without any poll watchers there, without any representation from the Trump campaign. And they are very concerned about what is going on there. They believe, again, that once these returns fully come in, they have enough votes to maintain the lead in Pennsylvania. So again, Pennsylvania and Arizona, I believe, the key to the president it's a narrow path. I will admit that -- more narrow than Joe Biden's, but it's doable and they're confident that that will happen."

We are the most developed nation in the world and we can't count. We have adults that are in charge of counting things and they can't count. You think we would have had this thing figured out, but we did not factor in a few other things. I'm going to use an analogy. Because I, you know, I looked at this last night, and I thought of it like a Thanksgiving turkey. You spend all this time preparing for the meal, right, and then you put it in the oven. You set it and forget it, right? Six hours, seven hours, however long, that's what it -- I go bed. I don't expect somebody in the middle of the night to come in and open up and screw the turkey, which is what, happened last night."

I just thought that was really strange. But I also think that everybody in America is tired of being told something that isn't true. We were expected this massive blow out, right? Because Trump is, like, so hated and he's a racist and he's going to lose minorities and women. And then you find out that -- not at all. This is razor-thin. There was no blow out. CNN admits that. He gained in minorities, even gained in women. And he did get the seniors in Florida after all. So you still find out that despite what the media and pollsters were telling you for, I don't know three or four years, America still loves this guy. This was not the outcome we were told. So I think that that is really -- I think that there is a frustration. And the people at home that are watching this and going, like, what a bunch of BS we were told. We were told that everybody in America hates this guy. That this is so awful and evil, and here he is. He's like -- he could win. And there are some weird shenanigans going on. Something flew out of my mouth just now. And let's not forget, you can get mad that Trump is fighting for this like anybody would. Remember, Hillary still hasn't conceded 2016, and neither have the media. So I just think that -- and also, I have one last point. This isn't about networks. It is about an election, so this race to be first and getting the greatest ratings, that is awesome, but at what expense?"

And then we saw Eric Trump come out, Rudy Giuliani come out, very, very fired up, yelling about fraud and stolen elections. Now, this is part of the democracy, right? This is part of the process. They have every right to contest these if there are 130,000 votes that they want to watch closely. They should open the doors in Philadelphia. Let them come in. Do the recount that they want to have there so that everybody can feel that there is true transparency there. It's not right to say that someone can witness an election and make them stand across the room. I had the same thought when people kept saying there are all of these cameras and you can watch them vote. I'm, like, can't see anything. All I can see is people shuffling papers around. And so in the world that we live in where no one trusts anything, as Greg was saying. I do think that there is just a real -- sort of a gut feeling of unease about the polling, about everything that people get told. I think that, you know, a lot of folks need to get out of the way and let this process continue to play out. But that's where I feel we stand right now."

With regard to recounts, I think we have had 30 recounts in American history. And the two recounts that resulted in any change, the change was within one-tenth of one percent.

Now, the president has been doing very well in Arizona with day out of voting, and Jason Miller, who is his senior campaign advisor, says that the president would need to win slightly under 58 percent of those in order to take the Grand Canyon state, which would be to perform to a lesser degree than he has been with ballots that have already been counted.

So they are emailing donors today about this new effort. Quote, \"the Biden fight fund will fund election protection efforts for Joe Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot.\" Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are almost never in the same place at the same time. They were both here today. She did not say anything. Neither one took questions. And we don't know when we're going to see Biden again.

And I think Kamala Harris -- secondary role today. But I think the key thing that I take away from so much of this is the Trump campaign wants to stop counting in Pennsylvania because I guess they think they are losing. And then they want to keep counting in Arizona because they think they are losing. But it is a contradictory impulse. And I think it reveals something about a strategy that is getting to be a little desperate in this moment. The other thing that I would say that is so important to me is that if you look, we were watching Bill Hemmer earlier. And he was talking about, you know, various areas of Pennsylvania. But if you look at the map right now and you look at Biden winning in Arizona, likely in Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin. He does not even need Pennsylvania to claim the presidency of the United States. So to me, this is all, you know, a moment when you have to just kind of, I think, go back to what you heard from Vice President Biden today, which is you know what, this is a democracy. Let's celebrate. Let's hold hands and go forward. Let's stop with the divisive nature of just picking on each other and calling names as if it's never going to stop."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Only one thing I want to just challenge Juan on. The Trump campaign did not say they want to stop the count in Pennsylvania. They said I want to stop the count in Pennsylvania until we can get our poll watchers in there to observe the mail-in's being counted. There is a big difference there. The one thing I think the Trump supporters should just listen to and have a little confidence is this. What we are hearing from the Trump campaign is based on math. It's based on data, and it's based on their internal polling, which so far has been very accurate. They said they were going to win Florida by about two and they were going to be dead even in all the battlegrounds. And they have been. So when they say, for instance, in Arizona that the outstanding vote there of 650,000. Many of them are coming from same-day voters, which Trump was winning by 60-70 percent. They only need to do 58 percent and they will take the lead in Arizona by Friday. That is good because they can't just have Arizona. They have to have Pennsylvania, too. Right now, they are ahead 400,000 in Pennsylvania. Their math says that if they continue to count the legally cast votes, they will maintain that lead. But just for a second, if there was a Republican county, deep red, being over seen by a Republican guy, Republican mayor, Republican governor with a Republican secretary of state that had been litigating the Democrats all year long about what to do and what not to do, and they were kicking observers out of the places that they were counting 150,000 provisional ballots."

Remember the dossier. So when you want to play nice because you are winning, we understand that. But when you lost, oh, boy, did you lose badly? I mean, you guys hit the streets. You guys rioted. You guys looted. So forgive me if, you know, we want to fight. Because remember, you know, Trump is popular among a lot of very famous coaches like Bobby Knight. And why is that, because they fight bad calls. You know, they will throw a chair or two, because they are actually fighting for their players. And Trump is fighting not just fighting for himself but for his voters. He doesn't want them cheated. So I think it's not necessarily a strategy, Juan. It is just how he is.

I mean, why would you tell the truth to strangers if that truth is deemed socially unacceptable. Meanwhile, riots ensue as another consequence of that smear as though America deserves it under Trump. Yet even though they stuck the evil white man tag on Trump, his popularity left in this election among Latinos, black men and black women. Again, if Trump is racist, man he sucks at it.

Speaking of polls, you wonder why no one trust this outcome, including Trump, when you keep being lied to? How can you trust anyone? No wonder pollsters never ask if you trust polls. How can you go to bed seeing one result and wake up to a new one that saves the day for the media's choice and not be a little suspicious? So don't blame Trump. Blame the media pollster industrial complex. I compare them to snake oil salesman, but that's unkind of snakes and salesman. Because whatever the media's pollsters are selling, nobody's going to buy it ever again. I said that, by the way in 2016, Jesse, so I was wrong then.

I don't want to name names, but I did a little analysis, and you know who you are out there. I might name some names on Saturday night in \"WATTERS' WORLD\" because trust me, when you have a poll designed to depress Trump supporters because you put a sample of 49 percent Democrats into that poll, the President's never going to do well in a poll that's half sampled with Democrats. So, that's designed to think you know, you're in Wisconsin, and you see a poll and ABC News, Washington Post, there I said it, had Donald Trump losing by 17 points. So, you say yourself, why do I even need to vote? I mean, it's a foregone conclusion. And it's sad. And it's not just the polling industry, it's the media industry at large. This was going to be a landslide victory. What was it, a nine or 10 percent national election? No, it was two to three percent.

And the other thing that we see in this is that when you look at the popular vote, look at how very, very close this is. It's time for both sides to wake up and realize the reality of the other side. And that there's, you know, half of America, very supportive of President Trump, very supportive of his policies for a number of reasons. And I think that the media and the pollsters need to wake up and figure out a way to reach these people. No one is going to pay any attention to them the next time around. They need to completely regroup."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate, but it looks like that will be out of reach. Here's the current balance of power where if things hold, Republicans will retain their majority. Greg, it was good news for the Republicans last night. Really, I think they beat not only the pollsters, they beat the eyes because they had so many more Republicans running. Mitch McConnell long ago said that his primary job, and he won last night, was to make President Obama a one-term president. So, should he do the same thing with Biden or should he work with him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think if Biden wins, he will be the first like lame-duck president to cut -- lame duck when he enters, which is going to be interesting. But I think you know, again, you had these -- you had to two races in which the Democrats spent like $200 million. And so, imagine how rich -- we we're talking about this. The consultants got off that because there's no consultant that encouraged you -- encourages you to spend less money. There's that -- you're overdoing it, save some money. No, they're like they will feed, and so they just got so rich off these up these races, $200 million. Imagine what you could do with $200 million, Juan. Imagine."

OK, so, as I said, tremendous success last night in the Senate races for the Republicans, but to where they lost, Colorado, Arizona. Arizona was a big deal. So, what does that tell you in terms of playing in purple states and Republicans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Arizona is a complicated situation for Republicans and for President Trump. They're still saying that the outcome there is different and Martha McSally has also suggested that, you know, the outcome she doesn't believe. You know, that'll probably work its way out over the next couple of days. But overall, I find it very interesting that, you know, President Trump could potentially lose, and the Republicans could hold the Senate. Although that scenario was out there, I think the main belief was that if President Trump prevailed, then the Senate would be able to also have that strength. But that Division I find very interesting. I also just want to mention in terms of spending money. Michael Bloomberg spent hundreds of billions of dollars on his own campaign, $100 million -- I mean, there was I think on the Republican side, fear when it came out that he was going to spend $100 million on ads in Florida. It got him nothing, because he lost Florida. And I just think that, you know -- I mean for him, you know, speaking about 100, it's like, just flick a little dust off your knee and $100 million is not a problem for him, but it's just emotional. It's got to be a little bit of a dream."

And it looks like the Senate stays red from I think most people's understanding there. But I care more about the big kahuna, the White House. I think everybody cares about that race. And then I will cede my time to Dana Perino loves talking about House and Senate races."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK, so the money, what a waste, right? They have these ego trips where they think they're going to take out somebody like Mitch McConnell with Amy McGrath and they spend $100 million. Jamie Harrison, bright young guy down in South Carolina, but he wasn't going to beat Lindsey Graham. And another $100 million. But the person I wanted to tip my hat to is Susan Collins of Maine. When she voted for Brett Kavanaugh, this opponent of her, Sara Gideon, said I'm going after her on that vote alone. And Susan Collins kept at it. She won by eight points. They had her down by 15 in the Quinnipiac poll just before. And they spent $93 billion in Maine trying to take her out. She won."

That's why you don't see a lot of gloating going on, you see a bit of confusion and sadness. But even more, if you think Trump is going away, this is just a second act. right? 2020 is the second act. 2024 is the third act."

And we're coming across, we're rushing because they're like, Juan is got to be on set at 6:53, running, running, running. We get up to the top of the ramp at Chelsea Piers, and the gate is closed. And so, there's no one around. This is what happened. Dagen was in a skirt, and we all climbed up and over this thing because we were so determined. I cut my foot.

Such a phenomenal sight, people began to gather, and the police had to tell them, this is dangerous. The train could actually fall down. No one was injured.
