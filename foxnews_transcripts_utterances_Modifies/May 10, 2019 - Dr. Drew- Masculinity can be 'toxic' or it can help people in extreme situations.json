No Comey, no Mueller, no Barr, no contempt to Barr, no impeachment talk. What the heck are we going to talk about. Well, I'm telling you we're not doing it, because to a lot of you, it's lot of white noise. None of that really matters to you to some extent. So, Friday, we're going to be talking about a lot of culture, political stuff, but things that get lost in the shuffle, especially when we had as much news as we had this week. And we're going to answer questions such as this. What does the debate over Facebook's future really mean for free speech? Huge issue. And if we can't patrol our own borders, can't control them, why should we be defending the borders of countries thousands of miles away? Interesting question. We're going to examine the backlash to all these boycotts out there, specifically how Chick-fil-A's emergence as the fastest growing fast food restaurant in the country.  How that can teach a lesson to those who want to punish Christian conservatives in this country? You know it's the third biggest fast food chain in America today. And Raymond Arroyo is here, Friday Follies. Why is a radical priest trying to rehab Farrakhan? Well, of course for all the wrong reasons. All that and more coming up with Raymond.  But in a much-ballyhooed New York Times op-ed, former Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called for the breakup of the company he built with his buddy Mark Zuckerberg during their Harvard days. Now, his piece got him booked far and wide across the media landscape.",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "OK. Who is Chris Hughes? He was the Harvard classmate of Zuckerberg where of course they founded the social media giant, Facebook. Now, he left the company over a decade ago with a small and very lucrative stake valued at roughly $850 million. That's about 1 percent of the company. Well, after he cashed out though, Hughes volunteered for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. And then he used his newfound wealth to buy the notorious liberal, New Republic magazine inserting himself as editor, tried to rehab that, revive that, well didn't work, ended up selling that off couple of years later.   Recent years, he's become a proponent of universal basic income. It's only when you know all of those liberal bonafides that Hughes has that you start to understand the real thinking behind his call to break up the social media giant. His main gripe is this, \"I'm disappointed in myself and early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the news feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and as my favorite empower nationalist leaders.\" Trump. Well, there it is. My guess is that if Hughes thought Facebook was amplifying the right voices, meaning the left voices then there wouldn't be the need for this correction. There are plenty of issues with Facebook, privacy, monopoly, power et cetera. All of which we've documented on this show. But to suggest that the movements around the globe in Europe and beyond things like Brexit, the rise of Trump's economic policies, they are only popular because of Facebook is just ludicrous. Completely missing the point. And at bottom I think this is typical leftist snobbery. We don't like your ideas, so they can't be organic. It's kind of like the way they treated the Tea Party back in 2010. They called it all Astroturf. It didn't matter. Well, the same thing happened with Trump's election. Disillusioned elites were so shocked that they had to create another reason for their loss. And in the end, well the breakup of Facebook - it might even be a good idea, but the reasons are putting forth aren't that convincing. So, with the emergence of these social media companies as the main vehicle for disseminating free thought to break them up on these grounds could actually have a chilling effect on speech that some of the former leaders or even current leaders of Facebook don't like. Joining me now for this very big topic Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, a Fox News Contributor and Raheem Kassam, who is the Global Editor-in-Chief of the brand new newly launched, relaunched Human Events. Raheem, it's great to see both. Why does the left always want to silence the views of those who disagree with their world view?",

I actually agree with Chris Hughes in his article as well if you do breakup Facebook, I think it allows for competitors to move into the space a little bit easier, only a little bit easier. But it's still a little bit easier and I think the other thing we need to recognize when it comes to the platform access issue is that we are now talking about this in civil rights terms, because the public square is actually no different from the digital public square and anybody who thinks that is going to go apart rather than more together they're living in cloud cuckoo land.

Well, I'm telling you we're not doing it, because to a lot of you, it's lot of white noise. None of that really matters to you to some extent. So, Friday, we're going to be talking about a lot of culture, political stuff, but things that get lost in the shuffle, especially when we had as much news as we had this week. And we're going to answer questions such as this. What does the debate over Facebook's future really mean for free speech? Huge issue. And if we can't patrol our own borders, can't control them, why should we be defending the borders of countries thousands of miles away? Interesting question. We're going to examine the backlash to all these boycotts out there, specifically how Chick-fil-A's emergence as the fastest growing fast food restaurant in the country. How that can teach a lesson to those who want to punish Christian conservatives in this country? You know it's the third biggest fast food chain in America today. And Raymond Arroyo is here, Friday Follies. Why is a radical priest trying to rehab Farrakhan? Well, of course for all the wrong reasons. All that and more coming up with Raymond. But in a much-ballyhooed New York Times op-ed, former Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called for the breakup of the company he built with his buddy Mark Zuckerberg during their Harvard days. Now, his piece got him booked far and wide across the media landscape."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK. Who is Chris Hughes? He was the Harvard classmate of Zuckerberg where of course they founded the social media giant, Facebook. Now, he left the company over a decade ago with a small and very lucrative stake valued at roughly $850 million. That's about 1 percent of the company. Well, after he cashed out though, Hughes volunteered for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. And then he used his newfound wealth to buy the notorious liberal, New Republic magazine inserting himself as editor, tried to rehab that, revive that, well didn't work, ended up selling that off couple of years later. Recent years, he's become a proponent of universal basic income. It's only when you know all of those liberal bonafides that Hughes has that you start to understand the real thinking behind his call to break up the social media giant. His main gripe is this, \"I'm disappointed in myself and early Facebook team for not thinking more about how the news feed algorithm could change our culture, influence elections and as my favorite empower nationalist leaders.\" Trump. Well, there it is. My guess is that if Hughes thought Facebook was amplifying the right voices, meaning the left voices then there wouldn't be the need for this correction. There are plenty of issues with Facebook, privacy, monopoly, power et cetera. All of which we've documented on this show. But to suggest that the movements around the globe in Europe and beyond things like Brexit, the rise of Trump's economic policies, they are only popular because of Facebook is just ludicrous. Completely missing the point. And at bottom I think this is typical leftist snobbery. We don't like your ideas, so they can't be organic. It's kind of like the way they treated the Tea Party back in 2010. They called it all Astroturf. It didn't matter. Well, the same thing happened with Trump's election. Disillusioned elites were so shocked that they had to create another reason for their loss. And in the end, well the breakup of Facebook - it might even be a good idea, but the reasons are putting forth aren't that convincing. So, with the emergence of these social media companies as the main vehicle for disseminating free thought to break them up on these grounds could actually have a chilling effect on speech that some of the former leaders or even current leaders of Facebook don't like. Joining me now for this very big topic Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, a Fox News Contributor and Raheem Kassam, who is the Global Editor-in-Chief of the brand new newly launched, relaunched Human Events. Raheem, it's great to see both. Why does the left always want to silence the views of those who disagree with their world view?"

And when you are operating in a vacuum of arguments, the best way to defeat your opponent is to silence them rather than take them on.

I would point out that not only do they provide a welcoming environment, but the key thing that we should focus on is the zero percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign on their employee practices, right, so they don't support adoption rights. They don't support spousal benefits for same sex couples. So, I think there is a little bit of an argument for these activists to make there. But again, to Guy's point, it's good chicken.

Boys need to be taught to soften their edges lest they step over the line because of all that testosterone. That's why I think it's important at times to highlight those moments when man's natural strength and chivalry and, yes, courage saves lives. Take the heroes from two recent shootings. When a gunman opened fire at a UNC Charlotte campus just 10 days ago, 21-year-old Riley Howell charged at him, was shot point blank, but still knocked the shooter off his feet. Then there is 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo. He lept from his deck Tuesday at a Colorado STEM school when a shooter entered the classroom. While he confronted the suspect with little regard for his own life, others rushed to safety. Kendrick, tragically, was killed, but because of his bravery, well, something Kendrick's father remembered about him."

We've talked about these issues before, Dr. Drew, but these two cases, I have goosebumps hearing the dad, his loss, his sadness. But the heroism and the sacrifice from young men, 16, 17, 18 years of age, not here to speak their own story, their own truth, but incredible."

      "utterance": "There is a tendency for the males to turn their aggression, which is what people worry about with toxic masculinity -- turn aggression into a positive impulse. Whether they are landing at the beach in Omaha or whether they're rushing a shooter, there is a natural tendency that they actually learn through something called rough-and-tumble play, that is automatic in young males, where they learn to sort of modulate their aggression, but they also learn how to turn it up so they know when it's time to bring it on."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But so much in society today, let's face it, discourages men from believing there is a natural impulse to be chivalrous or show this type of physical courage. If you say physical courage, your stereotyping. And obviously women can be courageous and are courageous every day. So you see what I'm saying, there is a push and pull with this masculinity."

    {
      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "Right, I absolutely agree with you. It is not an exclusive club. It's not that Brienne of Tarth on \"Game of Thrones\" is not a heroic figure, and the rest of the males in there are somehow exclusively heroic. Women can be heroic, too. It's just because of the aggression, because of the thing that makes us toxic, it also makes us do some of the things that have pushed society forward and also have helped people in extreme situations where there's an extraordinary amount of selflessness. But it's aggression, ultimately it's aggression, and we are turning our aggression on an aggressor. And it's OK, then."

      "utterance": "There's another issue here, with one of the suspect in the Colorado school shooting which is being overlooked in some quarters. It was a transgender male in the process of transitioning, OK, so from female biologically to male. And assuming, because in transition, likely taking hormones, testosterone, and so forth, what would that series of drugs do, or how could it affect the mental state of an individual, given how little we have as far as information on the way these drugs affect behavior, especially the testosterone?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "That is correct. So we have very limited research on this topic, and I know of no evidence that it turns people actually violent. But when you expose people to male levels of testosterone, I've taken care of many, many transgender folk over the years, and whenever -- I particularly get sort of, I wouldn't say amused, but I am interested in talking to the female to male transition patients, because they always say the same thing. They're like, oh, my God, I had no idea you were dealing with this. And I point out to them, not only have we been dealing with this chemically in our system, God saw fit to give this at 13."

They said \"The truth is that this therapy may have real long-term effects on children's physical and psychological development. Whether blocking puberty is the best way to treat gender dysphoria remains far from settled. And it should be considered a drastic and experimental measure.\" Johns Hopkins, and University of Washington, too, the premier researchers on this. Others who use these drugs say the same thing. Hey, we don't have peer-reviewed studies on this yet. Parents are giving kids of these drugs before the age of 18, before they can give real consent even."

    {
      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "We don't have the research. You've said it, that is clear, that is true. And so for me to say something conclusive about aggression and violence, I can't do it. But testosterone is the drug of aggression. And so there is a certain amount. Laura, I want to tell you one quick thing that bothers me, though, is that we've gotten to a position in this country where we privilege psychiatric symptoms over the well-being of the individual and the community. So if this kid was having a lot of symptomatology, no one was allowed to do anything if the kid didn't want anything done, unless the parents demanded it. With the 18-year-old, you can't do anything. There is privilege in the law for psychiatric symptoms. That is why we have homeless, and that's why we're getting some of these horrible, violent acting out episodes."

Well, today in response, I love this, hundreds of pro-lifers hit back in a show of force, in prayerful force outside of that clinic. Guess who was too scared to show up to bully more teenagers and more people? That's right, Brian Sims. Joining me now is Ashley Garecht, who was harassed alongside her daughters by Sims. Ashley, first of all, you are a hero to me. I love the fact that you stared him down when this first thing blew up in front of the clinic.

He never made any reference to his encounter with my daughters and their friend.
