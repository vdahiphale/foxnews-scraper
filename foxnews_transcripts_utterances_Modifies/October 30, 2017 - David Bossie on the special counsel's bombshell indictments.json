Good evening, everybody, welcome to \"The Story.\" Breaking tonight, indictments for Manafort and Gates related not to the Trump campaign, but to their years as lobbyists for Ukraine. At the same time, another partner in those deals, Tony Podesta, Democrat Operative and brother of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, shocked a lot of people today by stepping aside after his connections to Manafort were revealed. So, what is to come there? Where is this story going, is it winding down or is it revving up? And what about the Clinton campaign's involvement? Today, Paul Manafort's attorney was too defiant after the court appearance.",

You see an indictment brought by an office of special counsel that is using a very novel theory to prosecute Mr. Manafort regarding a FARA file. The United States government has only used that offense six times since 1966 and only resulted in one conviction. The second thing about this indictment that I myself find most particular is the claim that maintaining offshore accounts to bring all your funds into the United States as a scheme to conceal from the United States government is ridiculous.",

The indictments and the guilty plea, and they came away from that believing this has nothing to do with the president and that they're confident Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe will not lead to the oval office. However, these are deadly serious charges, criminal charges involving the president's former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, and his Business Associate Rick Gates both pleading not guilty. The two men facing up to 20 years in prison and the 12-count indictment charging conspiracy to launder money, dating back to around 2006 -- allegedly funneling $75 million through shell companies while working for a pro-Russian political party in the Ukraine years before the 2016 election.   So, in terms of actual collusion in that election, legal expert, Andrew McCarthy, writes a national review, \"The Paul Manafort indictment is much to do about nothing, except as a vehicle to squeeze in Manafort, which is Special Counsel Robert Mueller's objective.\" And one of the president's top lawyers Ty Cobb says, the White House is not worried at all about Mueller squeezing either Manafort or potentially down the road former National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn. Cobb suggests, they can't flip on the president because they have nothing, telling a podcast for The New York Times, \"The president has no concerns in terms of any impact as to what happens to them on his campaign or in the White House.\" And as you noted, it turns out today's indictment also implicates Democratic Lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta. In the indictment, Tony Podesta's company, The Podesta Group is listed as Company B, which work with Manafort engaged to lobby on behalf of that pro-Russian political party. Tony Podesta today revealing he'll step down from his firm. Perhaps more worrisome for the White House tonight, there was a surprise that ex-Trump Campaign Foreign Policy Advisor, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a conversation he had in 2016 with a professor close to the Russian government, who claims he had dirt on Hillary Clinton, though Sarah Sanders tried to downplay his role.",

If a civilian did that, it would be called extortion, but a prosecutor is allowed to extort essentially. The problem is they want him to sing, but some of these people also want to compose. They want to come out with even better evidence because of the better the evidence the sweeter the deal they're going to get. So, any criminal lawyer will tell you that we've seen a lot of witnesses who were cooperating witnesses who made up stories. And that's why maybe they try to get a wire on some of these witnesses because you can't make up a wire. But you can make up what you remember, what you saw, you can exaggerate it. You know, as a civil libertarian, I have been opposed to this for years. I'm opposed to it whether the Republicans are doing it against Hillary Clinton whether the Democrats are doing it against Donald Trump. I really think that our criminalizing our criminal justice system, having the first recourse, lock her up, lock them up, endangers all of our rights, and endangers democracy. I hope we can pull back and stop doing that. If you don't like what Donald Trump did, don't vote for him.

But it appears the president is making a connection that has yet to be established, because while the Obama campaign reportedly did pay money to Perkins Coie, there is no evidence yet that Perkins Coie paid that money to Fusion. Now, it's significant because Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee did pay $9 million to Perkins Coie, and in turn that money was paid to Fusion GPS. That's when Fusion hired Christopher Steel, the former British intel officer who wrote the now infamous Steele dossier, a document filled with lurid allegations about Donald Trump that had been widely discredited. Meantime, the Washington Free Beacon is trying to get as far away from the dossier as possible. The Free Beacon does acknowledge initially hiring Fusion GPS to get dirt on them-candidate Donald Trump during the GOP primaries. But the conservative publication goes on to say, quoting here, the Free Beacon had no knowledge of, or connection to the Steele dossier or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steel.

The United States government has only used that offense six times since 1966 and only resulted in one conviction.

The indictments and the guilty plea, and they came away from that believing this has nothing to do with the president and that they're confident Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe will not lead to the oval office. However, these are deadly serious charges, criminal charges involving the president's former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, and his Business Associate Rick Gates both pleading not guilty. The two men facing up to 20 years in prison and the 12-count indictment charging conspiracy to launder money, dating back to around 2006 -- allegedly funneling $75 million through shell companies while working for a pro-Russian political party in the Ukraine years before the 2016 election. So, in terms of actual collusion in that election, legal expert, Andrew McCarthy, writes a national review, \"The Paul Manafort indictment is much to do about nothing, except as a vehicle to squeeze in Manafort, which is Special Counsel Robert Mueller's objective.\" And one of the president's top lawyers Ty Cobb says, the White House is not worried at all about Mueller squeezing either Manafort or potentially down the road former National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn. Cobb suggests, they can't flip on the president because they have nothing, telling a podcast for The New York Times, \"The president has no concerns in terms of any impact as to what happens to them on his campaign or in the White House.\" And as you noted, it turns out today's indictment also implicates Democratic Lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta. In the indictment, Tony Podesta's company, The Podesta Group is listed as Company B, which work with Manafort engaged to lobby on behalf of that pro-Russian political party. Tony Podesta today revealing he'll step down from his firm. Perhaps more worrisome for the White House tonight, there was a surprise that ex-Trump Campaign Foreign Policy Advisor, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a conversation he had in 2016 with a professor close to the Russian government, who claims he had dirt on Hillary Clinton, though Sarah Sanders tried to downplay his role."

But they were there for about eight weeks in charge, and I can just submit to you that when I got there at the end of August, you know, there was nothing to do, no discussion whatsoever about Russia, Russia collusion, anything like that. It's just this far-fetched. And I understand why the president is frustrated because he can only say there was no collusion so many times and then you look at the Uranium One deal, you look at what's going on with the DNC and others, paying for this mysterious dossier. Now, there are a lot of questions about that in actual fact, and there's none as it comes to -- out of these two indictments and his guilty plea; nothing to do with the campaign or collusion."

When you looked at the indictments and you looked at the conspiracy charges that were laid out in this indictment, that a lot of people knew that Paul Manafort had a lot of business relationships that they thought were questionable. So, when he was -- when you were observing all of this, and you were, you know, sort of in the larger circle throughout it before you came on, did you think it was a mistake to hire him in the first place?"

They would never have indicted him for money laundering or tax evasion, if he weren't somebody who they thought could turn on Trump, could provide information or evidence. If not Trump, somebody higher up in the chain between Manafort and Trump. This is dominoes. You knocked on the first domino, that knocks down the second domino. Ultimately, what Mueller is aiming for is the big domino in the oval office. I don't think they're going to get them. I don't think they have anything, because of collusion, even if were to be established, isn't a crime. You have to find something that actually violates the federal criminal statutes.

You know, one of the points that are often brought up is that Bill Clinton didn't meet Monica Lewinsky until 18 months after the special prosecutor began the investigation. So, this could go on and on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "This could go on and on, and there are no limits to what an independent special counsel can do. And this shows that because all they're trying to do -- this is what they do with the mafia, this is what they do with terrorist cases, with corporate crime cases. They find a low- hanging fruit, they find a guy who they can go after because of his tax returns aren't perfect or something else, or he didn't file a form, then they threaten him. If a civilian did that, it would be called extortion, but a prosecutor is allowed to extort essentially. The problem is they want him to sing, but some of these people also want to compose. They want to come out with even better evidence because of the better the evidence the sweeter the deal they're going to get. So, any criminal lawyer will tell you that we've seen a lot of witnesses who were cooperating witnesses who made up stories. And that's why maybe they try to get a wire on some of these witnesses because you can't make up a wire. But you can make up what you remember, what you saw, you can exaggerate it. You know, as a civil libertarian, I have been opposed to this for years. I'm opposed to it whether the Republicans are doing it against Hillary Clinton whether the Democrats are doing it against Donald Trump. I really think that our criminalizing our criminal justice system, having the first recourse, lock her up, lock them up, endangers all of our rights, and endangers democracy. I hope we can pull back and stop doing that. If you don't like what Donald Trump did, don't vote for him. If you don't like what Hillary Clinton did, you know, put her in the wastebasket of history if that's what you think. But using criminal charges is very dangerous."

The fact that Manafort and Gates were indicted today, it has nothing to do with the campaign, nothing to do with President Trump. It involves incidents going back anywhere from six to 11 years ago, it involves the Ukraine; nothing with the campaign. And I think this is an attempt by Mueller in case Manafort has something on President Trump, which I am convinced he doesn't, to try and turn them. And that's what that is. As far as Papadopoulos, I really -- I never heard of him, I didn't know anything about him, and it seemed to me -- I don't want to prejudge it, but if you're going to be involved in some sort of collusion, you're not going to pick someone that no one has heard of.

I do want to ask a quick question about tax reform, because I know there's an 8:30 phone call tonight with members of Congress and the White House.

And to me, that would be a big hit against New York, against my constituents. You know, the property tax, that's a step forward, but the fact they still want to keep the state income tax out, to me, that would have a real impact on my constituents, and I cannot sign onto that certainly at this stage because I want everyone to get a tax cut. I don't want the rest of the country to get a tax cut and have my constituents subsidizing it."

They voted for it because they wanted to move it forward and they want to give the Ways and Means Committee time to come out with more details, which I understand.

There are no reports that an Obama-aligned group paid nearly a million dollars to that law firm that we've heard so much about in recent days. And the DNC and the Clinton Campaign used to hire Fusion GPS to gather all their research; Perkins Coie was sort of the middle in a lot of these transactions. Trace Gallagher live in our West Coast Newsroom with the backstory. Hey, Trace."

    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Hey, Martha. Yes, Perkins Coie is the law firm. And the Federalist is now reporting that former President Obama's campaign organization paid Perkins Coie, $972,000. And in reference to that story, President Trump tweeted the following, quote, report out that Obama campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS, the firm also got $12,400,000 really, from DNC, nobody knows who OK'd? But it appears the president is making a connection that has yet to be established, because while the Obama campaign reportedly did pay money to Perkins Coie, there is no evidence yet that Perkins Coie paid that money to Fusion. Now, it's significant because Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee did pay $9 million to Perkins Coie, and in turn that money was paid to Fusion GPS. That's when Fusion hired Christopher Steel, the former British intel officer who wrote the now infamous Steele dossier, a document filled with lurid allegations about Donald Trump that had been widely discredited. Meantime, the Washington Free Beacon is trying to get as far away from the dossier as possible. The Free Beacon does acknowledge initially hiring Fusion GPS to get dirt on them-candidate Donald Trump during the GOP primaries. But the conservative publication goes on to say, quoting here, the Free Beacon had no knowledge of, or connection to the Steele dossier or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steel. But no connection to the Steele dossier does not mean the Free Beacon is back in the president's good gracious. In fact, former White House strategist chief, Steve Bannon, has reportedly promise the president to, quote, go off the chain to destroy."

With the Mueller investigation is looking at is whether the Russian government was involved in some sort of direct involvement in U.S. elections, perhaps through connection to the Trump campaign.

Then you have Obama for America, about 20 percent of their expenditure in 2016, $972,000 goes to this law firm, then you have somebody in the communications team at the White House, the Obama White House, whose husband happens to just work for Fusion GPS. I'm sure that's all just a terrible coincidence, but suddenly now nobody can remember anything about whatever. If you've talk to Debbie Wasserman-Shultz, well, I don't remember that big expenditure."

So this idea that because they've paid this gigantic multi-city law firm money that it's necessarily was involved in this is nuts.

John Quincy Adams called his mother a murderer and his wife an adulterous or something. Politics, as you say, gets pretty low. But what does this add say about sort of how low -- how rough it is in terms of how we're going after each other out there today?"

This is the character assassination by association, and that's what makes it so incredibly disgusting. They don't even say that this represents Ed Gillespie, but they're even trying to say that there is somebody out there who supports Ed Gillespie who would think this. Well, first of all, we don't know that, and Ed Gillespie is not this person at all. He's an honorable guy. I wonder if Ralph Northam will disavow this ad and will condemn it because if he doesn't, then he's embraced it and then he's as sleazy as the ad that's trying to get him elected. So that's the real question for Virginia voters. And this ad presumes they're really stupid. This ad presumes that they can think for themselves, and that they would be able to be suckered in by something this despicable. Let's hope not."

I think it's a pretty low point, as you say. I want to take your attention to the 2020 presidential race, which apparently is already, sort of, bubbling up out there, and there's a lot of suggestion that President Trump could potentially face a challenger, or that he might decide not to run, even from two gentlemen who share that stage with him, as you did as well.

He has no pathway to the presidency. Let's see. Who's sitting in the White House tonight? Well, it ain't those people who said he had no pathway.

But the players say that it was not about the flag, but what about team owner Bob McNair said during an NFL owners meeting last week. He said, quote, we can't have the inmates running the prison. He has since apologized. He said the comment was not aimed at the players and was taken out of context, but the damage was already done. And here now, Gianno Caldwell, Republican strategist and Fox News political analyst, and Richard Fowler, nationally syndicated radio talk show host and a Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, welcome, good to see both of you tonight. I think it's eight or nine weeks into the protest that we've been watching on the NFL, but this one came really as the result of the comment that was made by Bob McNair. Gianno, what did you make of it?"

      "utterance": "I thought it was a stupid and irresponsible comment and provides gravitas to those who would say that these owners have been utilizing players in a racial way. It does, in that sense. And it reminded me of another comment by a Cowboys executive who told the NFLPA, which is the National Football League Players Association, we are the ranchers, referring being an owner, and you guys are the cattle, and we can always get more cattle. So when you think about those kinds of works, and of course, I respect the rights of owners to do whatever they will with their players within the bounds of the law, but when you think about it in that context, it's just so inappropriate, and it's something that they shouldn't say, and they should really change their way of being around the issue like this. And it's no longer about racial injustice. It's about players now protesting anybody that they have a grievance with, whether it be President Trump or NFL owners."

And I think his language speaks to -- there's so much hidden language in that particular quote, you know. We can't have the inmates run the jail. And what that means to those players and how hurtful that is to a team that for a lot of these protests have really said we respect our owner and we're not going to engage, and now because our owner has sort of slapped us in the face with this language that some would argue is racially insensitive, it's morally insensitive, inconceivable, right? Now these players have taken a knee and they've said this will continue because this owner has now tried to say, oh, if I really wasn't talking about you guys, which, obviously, the audience he's talking about that."
