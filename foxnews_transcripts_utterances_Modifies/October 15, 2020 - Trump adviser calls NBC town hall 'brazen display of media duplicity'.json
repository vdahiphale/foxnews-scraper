      "sentences": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from D.C. tonight. President Trump and Joe Biden just finished up these dueling town halls. I actually had one earbud in one ear and then I had the regular speakerphone in the other. I heard both at one time. That was fun. We're going to bring you exclusive reaction to tonight's events.  Now throughout the hour, we are going to hear from, get this, the White House and the Trump campaign. Plus my angle will expose the grifting elites who are profiting off your misery.  But first, let's get right to tonight's town halls. Almost every question to Donald Trump was combative or in some way adversarial. Savannah Guthrie acted as if she were Trump's debate partner, not the moderator, not an interviewer. And she clearly had to prove her liberal bona fides tonight.  But I think in general, she seems like a nice person, but at times she came across just as another angry liberal hack. Her interjections seemed like sad attempts at, I don't know, it was like political point scoring, not done for clarification purposes. Still even with these constant interruptions and what was obvious bias, I think the president delivered a strong, confident, and very likable performance. Now, you contrast that with Joe's town hall where almost every question was a softball or gave him an easy out. And Stephanopoulos did - he did occasionally interject with follow-ups, but even when he did that, the tone was always quite tender and the framing was ever so gentle.  In Biden's performance, it was OK. But at times, it was uneven. And he lapsed into his comfort zone, which I noticed, I'm sure you did if you caught any of it, of old storytelling about his childhood. And I don't think that seem to land very well. And let's be clear. The former VP might have cloaked his language around norms and unity. But what he was saying represents anything but that for you. He opened the door to packing the Supreme Court. He promoted a foreign policy that would subject us to the whims of the global order; and when it comes to the economy, well, wave goodbye to all those wage increases you saw on the first three years of Trump.  Joining me now with exclusive reaction is White House Economic Advisor, Larry Kudlow. Larry, it's great to see you tonight.   What is your message to the American people about what we heard tonight from Joe Biden, specifically his hits on the Trump economy?",

Mr. Biden is determined to rollback all the Trump tax-cuts and the deregulation. So they want to take control, central planning control of the energy sector and the health care sector and elsewhere. That will decimate the economy. President Trump on the other hand made it very clear tonight by the way. He had a great optimistic message on the economy, rebuilding America. He is going to cut taxes more, he is going to deregulate more, he is going to save oil, and he is going to continue with good trade deals. The deal here is a choice. It's a very clear choice, ok?   On the one hand, you have from Mr. Biden, stagnation, recession, pessimism. On the other hand, you have from President Trump, optimism, prosperity, and growth. You couldn't be clearer. And unfortunately, Mr. Biden fell into that trap. Fortunately for my life, I'm not going to break news here, I am for Trump. I think president was a commanding figure on the stage, and I think he did a great job in the face of all these interruptions. He did a terrific job.",

I think with a problem here for people who espouse something different than the president is they are now realizing that we now have a consensus forming around the president's policy of protecting seniors and ending the lockdowns, opening schools and jobs.  We just had a declaration written and the thrust of the declaration is exactly aligned with the president, that is opening schools, opening society, and protecting the high-risk people, the seniors. And now we have over 9,000 epidemiologists from all over the world signing onto this. We have the World Health Organization signing onto this. We have the recent studies finally coming into the so-called mainstream; even the magazines like \"The Atlantic,\" talking about schools should be open. The new study from Yale that was just spread out, talking about how there is very little transmission from children to adults. These are things the president emphasized way back in March, not just when he said the cure cannot be worse than the problem. But in his first statements, the guide to reopening, he said protect the seniors and open the schools, open jobs.  This was done in April.  And he's been very consistent on that and there is a consensus forming. And the opposition's priority really is, well, we better lock down, we better hide, we better have a mask mandate, which by the way, the mask mandates have been proven not to work. Look at Europe.

But one thing I can do is read the literature and understand that the evidence on universal masking is really pretty weak. In fact, the World Health Organization does not recommend universal masking. Professor Heneghan, who is from Oxford University center for evidence-based medicine says, after 20 years of pandemics, two decades, we're still not sure about universal masking. The CDC study that the president was quoting showed that 70 percent of people who got the virus had worn masks all the time. Over 80 percent, almost all the time. So I think it's sort of a lame, bizarre obsession at this point to claim that everyone must have universal masking when that really - the cases explode through it, we have states, we have LA county, we have Miami-Dade county, we have Hawaii, we look all over the world, Philippines, Spain, France, UK. Mask mandates don't work.   The president has a rational common sense mask policy, which is, if you cannot socially distance, you wear a mask particularly when you are high risk. And I think Americans are getting a little bit sick of this obsession with masks. When you go to the states, when you go to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you have people who are frustrated. They want to get back to their normal lives. They don't want to have a generation of neurotic children wearing masks like, the Bubonic plague is everywhere. There is a rational way to use masks. It's simple to understand. That's what the president's policy is. And if that's all they got to run against him, I think, that is sort of lame. I don't know what to say about that.",

A lot of people are saying that this virus in the non-vulnerable population is almost acting like a vaccination, because it's giving some acquired immunity to people who are exposed to it. And people don't want to hear that, but that seems to be what's happening right now in the United States, lot of people are getting acquired immunity. Dr. Atlas, it's great to see you and I'm glad you made that cameo appearance at the debate. That made me happy. All right. You take care. On a related note, are lockdowns the sleeper issue of the 2020 election? An intriguing new poll found that of the 14 percent of voters who are not committed to either candidate, 24 percent favor locking down again. But 70 percent say, it's time to move on and adapt.  Joining me now is the man behind that poll, Scott Rasmussen, pollster and Ballotpedia editor-at-large. Scott, I have been saying since about April or maybe early May, this is a question between liberty and lockdown. Liberty versus lockdown. Freedom versus lockdown.

Now if you were shocked this week to learn that the Biden family cashed in on shady overseas deals when Joe Biden was vice president, I have one question for you, where have you been for the past several years? A treasure trove of emails from foreign interest to Hunter Biden are just more evidence of what we already knew, that the family is knee-deep in sleaze. Now people like the Bidens and the Clintons for that matter, they don't have to take formal bribes. There is no need for any smoking gun. They simply do everything possible while in office to help rich people and to fight off movements like ours that would force big business to pay higher wages. Now during the years between 2000 and 2016, a lot of middle-class folks wondered what happened to all our good paying jobs and wages. Wages were really flat. They were flat. Or what happened to all the prosperity we were supposed to see from allowing China into the world trade organization? And if you look at the Bidens' and the Clintons' paydays well, you can see where some of that money went. Newly unearthed emails do show that Chinese oil tycoon, one of them, was paying Joe's son Hunter, $10 million a year for introductions alone. According to one email, Hunter said, he hashed out an even more lucrative deal with this Chinese oligarch, a man named Jianming. Now no surprise, Jianming had close ties to the CCP, to the Chinese military, and Intel agencies. And it was also no surprise that according to \"The New York Times\" that same Chinese billionaire also donated 100,000 bucks to the Clinton Foundation. What a coincidence!  But don't bother searching Twitter or other social media sites for any info on the Biden enrichment scheme. It wasn't brought up tonight at the town hall either. Well, the Big Tech cover-up is underway. Starting yesterday, Twitter accounts that retweeted \"The New York Post\" exclusives were locked by the company.

Just as a hobby? Because he wants to get tough on China, do lot of exposes about the Uyghurs.  Why do you Steve Jobs' widow bought \"The Atlantic\" magazine, which is filled with any Trump hit jobs? Do you think she really cares about your wages, making sure they go up the Wall Street? Big business has to pay more money? Of course not. Here's the bottom line. No one, and I mean no one in the D.C. establishment actually believes that Trump is a racist or a fascist or Russian mole. They don't think he's going to tear down democracy or blow up the world or destroy the constitution. And they certainly don't think that an old hack like Biden, that he is going to save us from COVID or anything else. Most of them probably don't even think the economy is going to do better for most people under Biden. The establishment just wants Trump and his movement out of the way. So they can go back to doing what they do best, making it easy for rich people around the world to take advantage of America's middle class. Also, beware of all the help Biden, Harris, and the donor class are going to get from the biggest manipulators of them all, I just mentioned a moment ago, the social media giants. It's not just Twitter blocking stories unfavorable to Biden. He's essentially getting in-kind contributions from Facebook, Instagram, and Google. They're all engaging in censorship so you're kept in the dark, and your opinions are going to be kept in the dark as well. It's both insidious and infuriating. I think we've got to be smarter than they think we are. And we have to leave them politically poor so our hardworking people have a shot at a better, freer, and safer life. And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" FOX News contributor. Mollie, Joe Biden's old pal George Stephanopoulos did not ask a single question tonight about the money scheme and Hunter Biden and what Joe Biden understood and knew about it. Are you surprised? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm not surprised. George Stephanopoulos is not that dissimilar from his other colleagues. We know that he used to work in a Democratic administration, but they all seem to be working currently on behalf of the Democratic Party. And they will do whatever it takes to make sure that they can get their preferred candidate over the finish line, and that includes not asking any tough questions. It's why it's really disappointing that there was no debate tonight, because you can't count on anybody in the media to actually ask tough questions of Joe Biden. Maybe the only person in the country who will ask a tough question of Joe Biden is Donald Trump, which is why everyone is working so hard to keep him from being in a position where he can do that. But it's a disservice to the American people. You're absolutely right that we already know that the Biden family has been able to become quite wealthy despite the not wealthy backgrounds that they had because of their proximity to Joe Biden's power, and that this is something that matches with so many people in Washington, D.C. It is very common for a lot of people to go work for firms that might have interests that are not aligned with our country's.",

      "utterance": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from D.C. tonight. President Trump and Joe Biden just finished up these dueling town halls. I actually had one earbud in one ear and then I had the regular speakerphone in the other. I heard both at one time. That was fun. We're going to bring you exclusive reaction to tonight's events. Now throughout the hour, we are going to hear from, get this, the White House and the Trump campaign. Plus my angle will expose the grifting elites who are profiting off your misery. But first, let's get right to tonight's town halls. Almost every question to Donald Trump was combative or in some way adversarial. Savannah Guthrie acted as if she were Trump's debate partner, not the moderator, not an interviewer. And she clearly had to prove her liberal bona fides tonight. But I think in general, she seems like a nice person, but at times she came across just as another angry liberal hack. Her interjections seemed like sad attempts at, I don't know, it was like political point scoring, not done for clarification purposes. Still even with these constant interruptions and what was obvious bias, I think the president delivered a strong, confident, and very likable performance. Now, you contrast that with Joe's town hall where almost every question was a softball or gave him an easy out. And Stephanopoulos did - he did occasionally interject with follow-ups, but even when he did that, the tone was always quite tender and the framing was ever so gentle. In Biden's performance, it was OK. But at times, it was uneven. And he lapsed into his comfort zone, which I noticed, I'm sure you did if you caught any of it, of old storytelling about his childhood. And I don't think that seem to land very well. And let's be clear. The former VP might have cloaked his language around norms and unity. But what he was saying represents anything but that for you. He opened the door to packing the Supreme Court. He promoted a foreign policy that would subject us to the whims of the global order; and when it comes to the economy, well, wave goodbye to all those wage increases you saw on the first three years of Trump. Joining me now with exclusive reaction is White House Economic Advisor, Larry Kudlow. Larry, it's great to see you tonight. What is your message to the American people about what we heard tonight from Joe Biden, specifically his hits on the Trump economy?"

      "speaker": "LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER",

Mr. Biden is determined to rollback all the Trump tax-cuts and the deregulation. So they want to take control, central planning control of the energy sector and the health care sector and elsewhere. That will decimate the economy. President Trump on the other hand made it very clear tonight by the way. He had a great optimistic message on the economy, rebuilding America. He is going to cut taxes more, he is going to deregulate more, he is going to save oil, and he is going to continue with good trade deals. The deal here is a choice. It's a very clear choice, ok? On the one hand, you have from Mr. Biden, stagnation, recession, pessimism. On the other hand, you have from President Trump, optimism, prosperity, and growth. You couldn't be clearer. And unfortunately, Mr. Biden fell into that trap. Fortunately for my life, I'm not going to break news here, I am for Trump. I think president was a commanding figure on the stage, and I think he did a great job in the face of all these interruptions. He did a terrific job."

That's what I'm talking about eliminating. If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration, 39.6 percent, you would raise another - this goes up to, let me get you exact number here, about another $200 - excuse me, $92 billion."

The fact is, and the data show this, census bureau, labor statistics, Federal Reserve board, Trump's three years, lower taxes and regulations, the benefits went to those who needed the most, the middle class and the lower wage earners. They were the biggest winners. If you roll that back, they will be the biggest losers. And that's why this program from my friends on the other side of the aisle does not work. It is stagnation. Trump is growth and prosperity."

I don't know what happened to those 6 percent. But then that same poll found that 58 percent say the country is worse off and trails Biden by 11. So where is the disconnect there? How does Trump - how is Trump behind if most people or half people think the country is doing better? What can you say accounts for that?"

Look across the board, poverty down, unemployment, record down, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans, women, every class benefited more than ever before and more than the upper end, the top 1 percent or the top 10 percent. They had less inequality because of the success of the economic program of President Trump. That is what we hope will happen, it has happened, and as we get through this pandemic, it will happen again. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And I would say to everybody out there, remember, it's not just that Trump's policies worked for the middle class and the working people, he handled the fall-out from COVID better, both the management of the disease as we are seeing what's happening in Europe. And also the economic fallout that Europe is reeling from, we are recovering from because of Trump's smart handling of these policies. So Larry, both the economy in the first three years and the recovery in the year of the pandemic without a doubt, Trump is winning that huge. And that's what the American people, I hope, end up voting on."

We're lucky we didn't follow Europe's lead on tackling the pandemic.

Dr. Atlas, how can Biden claim to do a better job on COVID when his response is modeled after countries doing worse than we are?

So how does that make sense?"
    },

      "speaker": "DR. SCOTT ATLAS, WHITE HOUSE COVID ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Well, it doesn't, Laura. Thanks for having me. I think with a problem here for people who espouse something different than the president is they are now realizing that we now have a consensus forming around the president's policy of protecting seniors and ending the lockdowns, opening schools and jobs. We just had a declaration written and the thrust of the declaration is exactly aligned with the president, that is opening schools, opening society, and protecting the high-risk people, the seniors. And now we have over 9,000 epidemiologists from all over the world signing onto this. We have the World Health Organization signing onto this. We have the recent studies finally coming into the so-called mainstream; even the magazines like \"The Atlantic,\" talking about schools should be open. The new study from Yale that was just spread out, talking about how there is very little transmission from children to adults. These are things the president emphasized way back in March, not just when he said the cure cannot be worse than the problem. But in his first statements, the guide to reopening, he said protect the seniors and open the schools, open jobs. This was done in April. And he's been very consistent on that and there is a consensus forming. And the opposition's priority really is, well, we better lock down, we better hide, we better have a mask mandate, which by the way, the mask mandates have been proven not to work. Look at Europe. These places, these countries have had mask mandates for months and they are exploding with cases."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ATLAS",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, there is a lot of things I'm not. I think my children could tell you that. But one thing I can do is read the literature and understand that the evidence on universal masking is really pretty weak. In fact, the World Health Organization does not recommend universal masking. Professor Heneghan, who is from Oxford University center for evidence-based medicine says, after 20 years of pandemics, two decades, we're still not sure about universal masking. The CDC study that the president was quoting showed that 70 percent of people who got the virus had worn masks all the time. Over 80 percent, almost all the time. So I think it's sort of a lame, bizarre obsession at this point to claim that everyone must have universal masking when that really - the cases explode through it, we have states, we have LA county, we have Miami-Dade county, we have Hawaii, we look all over the world, Philippines, Spain, France, UK. Mask mandates don't work. The president has a rational common sense mask policy, which is, if you cannot socially distance, you wear a mask particularly when you are high risk. And I think Americans are getting a little bit sick of this obsession with masks. When you go to the states, when you go to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, you have people who are frustrated. They want to get back to their normal lives. They don't want to have a generation of neurotic children wearing masks like, the Bubonic plague is everywhere. There is a rational way to use masks. It's simple to understand. That's what the president's policy is. And if that's all they got to run against him, I think, that is sort of lame. I don't know what to say about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, Dr. Atlas, we look at Europe, we see what's happening there. The spikes in deaths and hospitalizations and cases, and they supposedly were the gold standard and how they handled it. Everyone reviled Trump for saying we should open up. A lot of people are saying that this virus in the non-vulnerable population is almost acting like a vaccination, because it's giving some acquired immunity to people who are exposed to it. And people don't want to hear that, but that seems to be what's happening right now in the United States, lot of people are getting acquired immunity. Dr. Atlas, it's great to see you and I'm glad you made that cameo appearance at the debate. That made me happy. All right. You take care. On a related note, are lockdowns the sleeper issue of the 2020 election? An intriguing new poll found that of the 14 percent of voters who are not committed to either candidate, 24 percent favor locking down again. But 70 percent say, it's time to move on and adapt. Joining me now is the man behind that poll, Scott Rasmussen, pollster and Ballotpedia editor-at-large. Scott, I have been saying since about April or maybe early May, this is a question between liberty and lockdown. Liberty versus lockdown. Freedom versus lockdown. Is that perhaps coming to the floor now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT RASMUSSEN, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, BALLOTPEDIA",
      "utterance": "I think the attitude you're describing is coming to the floor right now, but probably not in that terminology. Americans want to find ways, they are frustrated with mask mandates, they are frustrated with over-the-top lockdowns. Still want to proceed with the degree of caution and for the most part what people want is to have more authority to make their own decisions. So you might talk about that in freedom terminology. But for most people, it's just practical common sense. If I go to a place and I feel uncomfortable, well, I'm going to may be not go in. If I feel OK, I may take my mask off. They want to have that freedom. And anybody trying to create a nanny-state mindset of telling people what they should do, that tends to push these voters away."

He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we are winning all these cases because it's unconstitutional what they are doing. And I think they are doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can't let this continue to go on with the lockdowns."

      "utterance": "Scott, does that messaging work, especially with suburban moms who are seeing what's happening to their children who are being kept from schools, especially in the area where we live, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. It's been very tough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RASMUSSEN",
      "utterance": "Suburban voters, suburban moms are concerned about this. In fact, the desire for more lockdowns and stricter controls is pretty much confined to urban areas and Democratic urban voters. Having said that, we are talking about issues, we are only talking about moving a few voters here and there. You said at the open, 14 percent of voters are uncommitted. These might be voters who say they are voting for a libertarian now, or who might change their mind on one of the major party candidates. It comes in the context of Joe Biden is ahead narrowly, in my state polls and the national polling we are seeing, but a shift of a couple of points can move this right back into a toss-up category. And this is an issue that might do it and that most pundits will miss."

Plus the revelations surrounding the Bidens, well, their latest get-rich- quick scheme reveals a very uncomfortable truth. The left gets rich off America's misery. My angle explains in a moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The Bidens' get-rich-quick scheme, that's the focus of tonight's angle. Now if you were shocked this week to learn that the Biden family cashed in on shady overseas deals when Joe Biden was vice president, I have one question for you, where have you been for the past several years? A treasure trove of emails from foreign interest to Hunter Biden are just more evidence of what we already knew, that the family is knee-deep in sleaze. Now people like the Bidens and the Clintons for that matter, they don't have to take formal bribes. There is no need for any smoking gun. They simply do everything possible while in office to help rich people and to fight off movements like ours that would force big business to pay higher wages. Now during the years between 2000 and 2016, a lot of middle-class folks wondered what happened to all our good paying jobs and wages. Wages were really flat. They were flat. Or what happened to all the prosperity we were supposed to see from allowing China into the world trade organization? And if you look at the Bidens' and the Clintons' paydays well, you can see where some of that money went. Newly unearthed emails do show that Chinese oil tycoon, one of them, was paying Joe's son Hunter, $10 million a year for introductions alone. According to one email, Hunter said, he hashed out an even more lucrative deal with this Chinese oligarch, a man named Jianming. Now no surprise, Jianming had close ties to the CCP, to the Chinese military, and Intel agencies. And it was also no surprise that according to \"The New York Times\" that same Chinese billionaire also donated 100,000 bucks to the Clinton Foundation. What a coincidence! But don't bother searching Twitter or other social media sites for any info on the Biden enrichment scheme. It wasn't brought up tonight at the town hall either. Well, the Big Tech cover-up is underway. Starting yesterday, Twitter accounts that retweeted \"The New York Post\" exclusives were locked by the company. Now this included accounts of the Trump campaign and the White House Press Secretary."

Billionaires there, though, they feel very threatened by Trump, because he is trying to drain the very swamp that they got so rich filling. Now with all that is at stake, for Wall Street, the Democrats, the mega donor class, well, they just haven't bought ads with all the money they gave. They've actually bought the media."

Just as a hobby? Because he wants to get tough on China, do lot of exposes about the Uyghurs. Why do you Steve Jobs' widow bought \"The Atlantic\" magazine, which is filled with any Trump hit jobs? Do you think she really cares about your wages, making sure they go up the Wall Street? Big business has to pay more money? Of course not. Here's the bottom line. No one, and I mean no one in the D.C. establishment actually believes that Trump is a racist or a fascist or Russian mole. They don't think he's going to tear down democracy or blow up the world or destroy the constitution. And they certainly don't think that an old hack like Biden, that he is going to save us from COVID or anything else. Most of them probably don't even think the economy is going to do better for most people under Biden. The establishment just wants Trump and his movement out of the way. So they can go back to doing what they do best, making it easy for rich people around the world to take advantage of America's middle class. Also, beware of all the help Biden, Harris, and the donor class are going to get from the biggest manipulators of them all, I just mentioned a moment ago, the social media giants. It's not just Twitter blocking stories unfavorable to Biden. He's essentially getting in-kind contributions from Facebook, Instagram, and Google. They're all engaging in censorship so you're kept in the dark, and your opinions are going to be kept in the dark as well. It's both insidious and infuriating. I think we've got to be smarter than they think we are. And we have to leave them politically poor so our hardworking people have a shot at a better, freer, and safer life. And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" FOX News contributor. Mollie, Joe Biden's old pal George Stephanopoulos did not ask a single question tonight about the money scheme and Hunter Biden and what Joe Biden understood and knew about it. Are you surprised? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm not surprised. George Stephanopoulos is not that dissimilar from his other colleagues. We know that he used to work in a Democratic administration, but they all seem to be working currently on behalf of the Democratic Party. And they will do whatever it takes to make sure that they can get their preferred candidate over the finish line, and that includes not asking any tough questions. It's why it's really disappointing that there was no debate tonight, because you can't count on anybody in the media to actually ask tough questions of Joe Biden. Maybe the only person in the country who will ask a tough question of Joe Biden is Donald Trump, which is why everyone is working so hard to keep him from being in a position where he can do that. But it's a disservice to the American people. You're absolutely right that we already know that the Biden family has been able to become quite wealthy despite the not wealthy backgrounds that they had because of their proximity to Joe Biden's power, and that this is something that matches with so many people in Washington, D.C. It is very common for a lot of people to go work for firms that might have interests that are not aligned with our country's."

And conversely, NBC staged a political knife fight down in Miami. And if I compare that to a TV program, it would seem more like \"The Wire.\" So I think what we saw today really unfortunately was a brazen display of media duplicity. It is extremely clear who corporate media wants in this country. And the fact alone, and again, this isn't my opinion, the fact that George Stephanopoulos did not at one moment in the 90 minutes with Joe Biden today mention the biggest story in America right now, which is the bombshell revelations from \"The New York Post\" that Joe Biden while he was sitting vice president was fully aware of his son's influence pedaling with shadowy figures all over the world, including the two most dangerous adversaries to the United States, Russia and China.

He takes on these incredibly biased moderators, if you want to call them that. I would call Savannah a Joe Biden surrogate who literally was reading off the talking points of the DNC. It's completely outrageous how she behaved, how hostile she was, how she interrupted the president. It was literally like she was the one running for president. Joe Biden should maybe take a page out of Savannah's playbook. But it clearly shows the continual narrative coming from the fake news media, how they will protect Joe Biden at all costs. I thought that they were going to offer Joe Biden some milk and cookies and put him to sleep, because it almost put me to sleep when we are watching the ABC town hall.

He's of course willing to bow up and fight there, as he should. And I think it helps him also because, again, I think this media duplicity is just on full display for the American people. I'll tell you, for instance, when Donald Trump first started calling the fake news media the enemy of the people, I thought that was too harsh, and I actually said so a few times on television. You know what, I'm wrong, and he is completely right, because the performance tonight, the failure of ABC to even mention one single time this \"New York Post\" bombshell story, that reveals just how corrupt our media is, and it is, unfortunately, the enemy of the people."

And let me tell you something, Wall Street should know better than this because it was because of President Trump's economic policies that we have seen a boom in America, that we've been able to still stay strong despite the fact that we're facing this global pandemic, the fact that we've been able to bring back 11.4 million jobs. And so I've got to tell you something. The mere fact that the president has been the only one who has stood tough against China, brought back jobs, brought China back to the negotiating table, is just a stark contrast with what we've seen with Joe Biden's coziness with China, favoring China in their policies, profiting off of China, and seeing Hunter Biden and the family also profiting off of China."

No. He barely showed up for any of those meetings, and now he wants to show up in 2020 in an election year talking about earning our vote. It's too late.
