Or they would remember that those nooses founded in a park turned out to be swings installed by a black man. How racist?   You think that would make these idiotic anchors actually think? But they can't. They're programmed. They're conduits and generators of this modern hysteria, where commonsense is replaced by rage farming. And when it fails, they never learn, they just press repeat. It's funny if it's harmless, but this ain't harmless. Seriously, after three weeks of hell that ruined lives with rioting and burning, they embrace this unproven story that could make everything worse. And why? Because they don't give a damn. Even if this story bodes horribly for a country, they are psyched because they have something to smear all of us with.  Meanwhile, studies show that less than a third of these alleged ads actually turn out to be real. Meeting much of this is media brood hysteria.  Right now in Australia, they're arguing over the inherent racism of chess because the white pieces go first. Wait until they tackle checkers. How can a red piece jumping a black piece not be a hate crime? Fact is, you can make any story more explosive by adding the \"it's racist layer.\" It's a simple equation. Topic plus race equals new story and maybe and Emmy.   Monday, you could do a piece on summer fashions. Tuesday, you could do a piece on the secret racism of summer fashions. Why is everything so white? Except after Labor Day? What's that mean? What are they saying about labor and skin color?  So this is not about Bubba Wallace. It's not his fault. Someone else found the rope and I can see how that confused matters. The garage door rope and the look of a noose kind of go hand in hand. But that noose is for a hand.  So where were all of those intrepid reporters trying to uncover the truth? Waiting for another news story to fall into their laps. This story should have ended in one hour. Instead, Bubba was used as a pawn to keep this divisive flame alive.",

Al pushed her story big time and made his name fronting this hoax pretending his self-promotion was actually victim advocacy. It ruined lives, but you know, he is still doing fine, thanks to the MSNBC bookers.  So we're living in a textbook definition of a panic. What we are told isn't happening is and if you stand up to defy it, you could lose everything. Meanwhile, the media ignores mobs waging violent war on our streets preferring to demonize other citizens just standing by who were worried sick. Riots, burnings, destruction, lies, hoaxes, nooses, and smears. And what do we do? Americans of all colors stand in our yards waiting patiently for it to end so we can get back to being a country.

Well, the young man Bubba Wallace, I couldn't be prouder of in terms of taking the platform that he has and we're actually on the cusp of some real, real good changes.  You know, we're seeing some stuff with police reform. We're having the conversation about equality and getting equal stuff for schools.  We've got a lot of good things going on. There's a lot of awareness and there's a lot of people coming forward asking questions and we're looking for a better tomorrow.  But unfortunately, we still have to deal with the media, but I commend NASCAR and how they handled the situation. They handled what they thought something was a hate crime, a noose, I get it. They investigated it, and they showed that it wasn't. And the media didn't care about the results. They cared about keeping the fire going. Keeping it because it's the wrong message. We're seeing a lot of that stuff.  We're seeing music groups that haven't been relevant in years coming up saying we're going to change our name, you know?",

The suspect was shot in the chest. No word yet on a motive. And Mississippi could soon strip the Confederate symbol from its 126-year old state flag. Lawmakers are expected to debate the measure on Sunday after clearing a major procedural hurdle today. A Commission would then be responsible for designing a new flag that includes the words, \"In God We Trust.\" Voters would weigh in on the new design in November.

Or they would remember that those nooses founded in a park turned out to be swings installed by a black man. How racist? You think that would make these idiotic anchors actually think? But they can't. They're programmed. They're conduits and generators of this modern hysteria, where commonsense is replaced by rage farming. And when it fails, they never learn, they just press repeat. It's funny if it's harmless, but this ain't harmless. Seriously, after three weeks of hell that ruined lives with rioting and burning, they embrace this unproven story that could make everything worse. And why? Because they don't give a damn. Even if this story bodes horribly for a country, they are psyched because they have something to smear all of us with. Meanwhile, studies show that less than a third of these alleged ads actually turn out to be real. Meeting much of this is media brood hysteria. Right now in Australia, they're arguing over the inherent racism of chess because the white pieces go first. Wait until they tackle checkers. How can a red piece jumping a black piece not be a hate crime? Fact is, you can make any story more explosive by adding the \"it's racist layer.\" It's a simple equation. Topic plus race equals new story and maybe and Emmy. Monday, you could do a piece on summer fashions. Tuesday, you could do a piece on the secret racism of summer fashions. Why is everything so white? Except after Labor Day? What's that mean? What are they saying about labor and skin color? So this is not about Bubba Wallace. It's not his fault. Someone else found the rope and I can see how that confused matters. The garage door rope and the look of a noose kind of go hand in hand. But that noose is for a hand. So where were all of those intrepid reporters trying to uncover the truth? Waiting for another news story to fall into their laps. This story should have ended in one hour.

She was a young black girl who didn't come home in time and rather than upset her parents, she claimed she was raped by a bunch of white guys. Al pushed her story big time and made his name fronting this hoax pretending his self-promotion was actually victim advocacy. It ruined lives, but you know, he is still doing fine, thanks to the MSNBC bookers. So we're living in a textbook definition of a panic. What we are told isn't happening is and if you stand up to defy it, you could lose everything. Meanwhile, the media ignores mobs waging violent war on our streets preferring to demonize other citizens just standing by who were worried sick. Riots, burnings, destruction, lies, hoaxes, nooses, and smears. And what do we do? Americans of all colors stand in our yards waiting patiently for it to end so we can get back to being a country. But what if it doesn't end? Or what if this is how it ends? It's not good for you and me. But CNN is smiling all the way to the bank."

Well, the young man Bubba Wallace, I couldn't be prouder of in terms of taking the platform that he has and we're actually on the cusp of some real, real good changes. You know, we're seeing some stuff with police reform. We're having the conversation about equality and getting equal stuff for schools. We've got a lot of good things going on. There's a lot of awareness and there's a lot of people coming forward asking questions and we're looking for a better tomorrow. But unfortunately, we still have to deal with the media, but I commend NASCAR and how they handled the situation. They handled what they thought something was a hate crime, a noose, I get it. They investigated it, and they showed that it wasn't. And the media didn't care about the results. They cared about keeping the fire going. Keeping it because it's the wrong message. We're seeing a lot of that stuff. We're seeing music groups that haven't been relevant in years coming up saying we're going to change our name, you know?"

Now, when I want to cross the crosswalk and I look up, and I see the white man in the crosswalk, because it's a white guy that tells you, you can walk or a white hand that tells you to stop. Is that racist? Should I be thinking that way? What about when I'm looking at the -- what about the Joe Biden event where the white circles were around the five attendees that were there? Should have they been white? I mean, here's the thing that I have with Bubba Wallace. Listen, if he was told about it, or whether he saw it, NASCAR overreacted. My issue with Bubba Wallace is that once he knew it wasn't an intentional hate crime, he didn't back off it and that's what frustrates observers on the outside. It's like listen, guy, you can -- listen, man, you can admit you made him mistake, and that you were maybe quick to react to it.

I'm like, hold on a minute. I read it again. I was like so, these are bad people and they're racist because they're happy that it was not a noose, but you're an anti-racist if you are disappointed it wasn't.

I don't think anyone has the right to put a rope on something and tear it down. You're no different than a rioter or a looter. You're not protesting anything. You're defaming property and causing destruction, and you're bringing violence supposedly to stop violence. So nothing gets settled with that. So anyone who does those things needs to be arrested and charged. There needs to be restitution. No one in this country has the right to go destroy or defame something. You don't like it, you go to the proper channels. You get it voted out. You get a petition. If you want to protest around it. Great. No problem with that. But you don't put your hands on property, you're not -- you're not doing anything by being quote, unquote, \"a thug,\" regardless of your color. That's what you are.

Authorities say four other people were hurt, but are in fair condition. One witness reports hearing 40 to 50 gunshots. About 200 people were working at the time of the shooting. The suspect was shot in the chest. No word yet on a motive. And Mississippi could soon strip the Confederate symbol from its 126-year old state flag. Lawmakers are expected to debate the measure on Sunday after clearing a major procedural hurdle today. A Commission would then be responsible for designing a new flag that includes the words, \"In God We Trust.\" Voters would weigh in on the new design in November.

And don't get mad at me because I am a victim. Okay. You think that I enjoy not liking something that everyone else likes that consumes the world? I try to understand it. And I know what some -- I know what interception is. I know what pick is and they are the same thing. And last year, I figured out what pick six was. You get a touchdown, because there are six points. I thought they were seven points, but that's when you kick for a new one. So I was gearing up to watch the Super Bowl. And then I found out there's something called the run for two. What's that? They're running in two? I don't know. How do people learn this stuff? It's like a story problem on a math test with like tights and helmets and I hate it. Baseball I kind of get that's okay, but football, I don't understand it. I'm a victim and I'm being taunted by a culture that tries to make me like it."

I love the error. Errors are involved in sports because if you benefit from one, you know it's going to come back and bite you two seasons later when an ump makes a bad call. So, I don't want -- I don't want things to change, but I kind of like this. You know, I kind of like -- and I like the plays at the plate. You're going to get a lot of close finishes. So I'd be okay with trying it in the 60- game season, see how it works out. And then if we don't like it, we ditch it. Problem is, a lot of these bad ideas just stick around forever."

Multiple attempts to repair the work left the original image unrecognizable. Look at that. I find it sexy. Anyway, I haven't seen art this weird looking since we saying with Paul Simon. Nobody gets it. Anyway, the same thing happened to a painting of Christ a few years ago also in Spain. What's with Spain? There aren't any legal requirements to become an art restorer there. Anyone could do it even including this guy. Anyway, it remains to be seen if the painting in its current condition is fixable, but it may be an easier face to fix than this one."

And then literally with a ballpoint pen decided to fill in the restoration of that. I mean, that is horrible. They said amateur. No, that's not amateur.

I mean, that is amazing -- a career with amazing upward mobility. That would be like if my first time I came off like \"Fox and Friends\" as a guest.

We don't want to do a bunch of credentialing and schooling and you need 6,000 hours of painting to be a restorer. You should just be able to be a restorer or you might want to find a better one like the one who retouched my face on my book, Greg? This is all retouched. This is not really me.

Researchers showed hundreds of women photos of two guys both pictured with and without a cat. It turns out when shown the cat-free picture, 38 percent of the women said they were likely to date him. But the same guy holding a cat, all the women violently threw up. Not really, just 33 percent of the women would give him a shot. Apparently, men holding cats are viewed as less masculine and more neurotic. Interesting, but what if the dude's cat is a total jerk?"

I mean, dated and millennial -- dating is more of a spectrum truly for our generation oftentimes, but even one man who had very -- I would say very, very many cats, and from what I see from his Instagram, they actually keep multiplying. They reproduce on their own. He has very many cats. But the cats were not why things didn't work out. I think it is fine to love cats. I love my cat. I love all cats.

It's like your dog is a vacuum cleaner. But the cat is a Roomba. You know, a dog, you've got to push it around. Cat does its own pushing while it's staring at you. I don't like that. It's scary."
