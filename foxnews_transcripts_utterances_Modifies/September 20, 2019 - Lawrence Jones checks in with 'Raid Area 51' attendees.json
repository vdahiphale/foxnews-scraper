Now, tonight, we are on day two of the media's psychotic rage and coverage surrounding an unnamed whistleblower who made some kind of unknown allegation again President Trump. Now, there really aren't any other definitive facts in the story.  Somehow your media mob has spent 48 straight hours spinning and spinning in circles but today, President Trump, he rightly defended himself from all of the mobs hysteria, calling the story a political hack job.

No.   But this is what the mob does best. Hyperventilating at the remote possibility that this unknown information will somehow lead to the impeachment they have been craving the day after Election Day 2016. This is a psychotic rage every second of every day. It knows no bounds. Multiple reports now suggest that the so-called whistle-blowers claim, it surrounds the country of Ukraine. Now, they are doing us a favor because they are opening up a lot of questions we wanted them to cover for a long time. The boomerang comes right back on Biden, his family, and the Democrats.  Look at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" says President Trump wants press the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son who was involved in some sketchy business deals in Ukraine. You know, with a gas company that was being investigated by prosecutor. And his father, then vice president, was overseeing at the time the Obama administration's Ukrainian policy.   Oh, and the president wanted the truth? Let's see. We have Joe Biden on tape leveraging your money, a billion dollars worth of it, to fire the prosecutor in six hours or he's taking his money home. The company that was investigating the corruption into the gas company that his son was doing business with. Wonder why he wanted that prosecutor fired? I can't imagine why.  Now, the president wanted the truth about that and any 2016 election interference by Ukraine. You remember? The Ukrainians wanted to give us evidence that they willingly try to influence the election in 2016 and help Hillary. I didn't see anyone in the mob interested in that story. But I do think the media mob, you've open the door now for national discussion about, well, what did Biden and his son do and wondered they do it, and what kind of interference with the Ukraine involved in as it relates to our 2016 election? Now, we'll hopefully get to the truth.  And coming up, we are going to have a full report how sleepy, creepy, crazy Joe 30303 potentially, yes, leverage your money, in order to line the pockets of his own family.  But, first, breaking just moments ago, we have a new twist on all this. John Solomon reporting that the State Department, not President Trump, but the State Department, not President Trump -- that's right. They were behind former New York City Mayor Giuliani's efforts to investigate Biden's dealings in Ukraine. They asked him to do a mission for them. And he did. And then he came back like the great citizen he is and he reported it.  Here with more, investigative reporter, vice president of \"The Hill\", we have John Solomon with us.   You've been on this Ukraine story number one, the election interference evidence that they want to give us.",

In July, a senior diplomat at the U.S. State Department contacted Rudy Giuliani and said, there is a representative, a lawyer, an advisor to President Zelensky, the brand-new president of Ukraine, who would like to talk with you. You don't appear to be taking any calls from Ukrainians these days. Would you consider taking his call? Can you give him your number?  Mr. Giuliani said yes, I'll be glad to take the call. He had a contact with the advisor. They met briefly in Spain, not in Ukraine. And then, Rudy Giuliani called two senior diplomats, two of the most senior people on the ambassadorial staff in Europe, and briefed them on everything that went on, described what the Ukrainians were concerned about, described what they were looking for, described this dynamic that's been going for more than 18 months.

That is a separate issue, making unknown accusations about when unknown but somehow disturbing promise between an unknown world leader and President Trump.  Now, you count all of those unknowns? Because, apparently, this is what passes as a big story among the media elite mob. Now, if you want to call yourself a journalist, you really have to toss out a vague, unverified accusation about President Trump and watch it spread like wildfire. They won't check each other. They just report. Reported here, this is true. I think we got him.   How many times have we heard that the last three years?  The media mob, their handlers in the Democratic Party, they are so desperate to smear this administration pretty much anything goes. I've never seen anything like it neither clear journalism dead in America in 2007. You have deep state operatives and bureaucrats and holdovers from the Obama era. They are very well aware of what their friends in the mob, well, do, how they operate and frankly how they can live delight the hell out of them. And they been working side-by-side with the mainstream media for years in order to shape a phony political narrative. Remember Chuckie Schumer's warning? Play close attention.

And it's funny to me that really with a foreign policy disagreement, the president has such broad latitude in how he managed the foreign affairs of our country under the Constitution that these two disagreed with how the president approached it and so they took illegitimate means by filing this whistle-blower complaint which is not appropriate under the whistle-blower statute. And then, of course, \"The Washington Post\" that gets a hold of it and runs with it. And it's scurrilous. It's cowardly. It's not the way it's supposed to work, Sean. And it's really -- you know, if these people disagree with this president on how he's handling foreign policy, they should run for president themselves. That's the solution. Let's propose some other way to do it.  This president has the economy at full speed. He has America strong, and he has our adversaries on the run.

And tonight, while the media mob obsesses about unknown claims by an unknown whistle-blower, that might have something to do with Ukraine, we do have to thank them. That's right, a big thank you to all of the psychopaths in the media mob because they accidentally now have brought attention to what is a massive underlying scandal surrounding sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe 30330 as his credibility now. He is now accused of leveraging his role in the White House and our tax dollars as a get rich quick scheme for his family. Look at the timeline. It starts in 2014. President Obama appointed Biden to lead the administration efforts in Ukraine. That's a key date. In February of that same year, Biden son Hunter, yes, he was kicked out of the Navy. We won't get into it. That's personal issue but we do know the reason, that's not the issue. The issue is him and whether or not he was capitalizing on his father's connections as the top person identified to lead our negotiations with Ukraine. Remember the issue of him flying to China on Air Force Two, making questionable deals was a result of that trip with his dad. And also in Ukraine, while his father was in charge, of his father leveraging tax dollars to protect his son from a prosecutor that is going after the gas company that's paying him and his company 188 grand a month -- that matters. So a few months later, in May, Biden Hunter, well, he scored a lucrative position on the board of a massive Ukrainian oil and gas company called Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden, all we can tell, had zero experience in the oil and gas industry. He also had zero experience in the country of Ukraine. Yet, this massive oil and gas company in Ukraine owned by a Ukrainian oligarch was shelling out 50 grand a month for these services.  Now, if you think that seems incredibly sketchy? You're not alone. Look at this: John Kerry's stepson who once worked and partnered with Hunter Biden cut all business ties with Biden son after learning about his strange new gig and associations. And meanwhile, one year later, in 2015, Joe Biden's younger brother James reportedly received a generous half a million dollar loan from a wealthy donor with deep ties to, you guessed it, Ukraine. And the story doesn't end there. In March of 2016, the very next year, the Ukrainian energy company pumping money into the pockets of Hunter Biden and his new oil and gas friends was facing a major corruption investigation by Ukraine's top prosecutors. So, of course, well, who came to the rescue? Well, dad, the vice president, in charge of Ukraine and American policies. That's right. He told Ukrainian officials that he would withhold $1 billion, taxpayer money, that they were giving Ukraine as aid and support unless Ukraine fired the prosecutor investigating the company that's doing business with his son. So, that's right, Biden was leveraging our money to fire the prosecutor investigating this whole issue to protect the company that was making his son pretty rich, pretty wealthy. Ultimately Ukraine, they had a six-hour window. Yes, they decided to fire the guy. They wanted the billion dollars. And by the way, Biden bragged about leveraging your money. We've got it on tape.",

Now, tonight, we are on day two of the media's psychotic rage and coverage surrounding an unnamed whistleblower who made some kind of unknown allegation again President Trump. Now, there really aren't any other definitive facts in the story. Somehow your media mob has spent 48 straight hours spinning and spinning in circles but today, President Trump, he rightly defended himself from all of the mobs hysteria, calling the story a political hack job. Take a look."

Oh, did he say tell Vladimir I'll tell you more after the election but don't tell the American people? No, I don't think he made that deal. Did he drop $150 billion in cash and other currency on the tarmac so the mullahs in Iran, they chant, they want to wipe Israel and America off the face of the earth, did he do that? No. But this is what the mob does best. Hyperventilating at the remote possibility that this unknown information will somehow lead to the impeachment they have been craving the day after Election Day 2016. This is a psychotic rage every second of every day. It knows no bounds. Multiple reports now suggest that the so-called whistle-blowers claim, it surrounds the country of Ukraine. Now, they are doing us a favor because they are opening up a lot of questions we wanted them to cover for a long time. The boomerang comes right back on Biden, his family, and the Democrats. Look at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" says President Trump wants press the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son who was involved in some sketchy business deals in Ukraine. You know, with a gas company that was being investigated by prosecutor. And his father, then vice president, was overseeing at the time the Obama administration's Ukrainian policy. Oh, and the president wanted the truth? Let's see. We have Joe Biden on tape leveraging your money, a billion dollars worth of it, to fire the prosecutor in six hours or he's taking his money home. The company that was investigating the corruption into the gas company that his son was doing business with. Wonder why he wanted that prosecutor fired? I can't imagine why. Now, the president wanted the truth about that and any 2016 election interference by Ukraine. You remember? The Ukrainians wanted to give us evidence that they willingly try to influence the election in 2016 and help Hillary. I didn't see anyone in the mob interested in that story. But I do think the media mob, you've open the door now for national discussion about, well, what did Biden and his son do and wondered they do it, and what kind of interference with the Ukraine involved in as it relates to our 2016 election? Now, we'll hopefully get to the truth. And coming up, we are going to have a full report how sleepy, creepy, crazy Joe 30303 potentially, yes, leverage your money, in order to line the pockets of his own family. But, first, breaking just moments ago, we have a new twist on all this. John Solomon reporting that the State Department, not President Trump, but the State Department, not President Trump -- that's right. They were behind former New York City Mayor Giuliani's efforts to investigate Biden's dealings in Ukraine. They asked him to do a mission for them. And he did. And then he came back like the great citizen he is and he reported it. Here with more, investigative reporter, vice president of \"The Hill\", we have John Solomon with us. You've been on this Ukraine story number one, the election interference evidence that they want to give us."

But in July of this year, this is a contact that over the last couple days the media has been hysterical about, but here's the construct and the understanding. In July, a senior diplomat at the U.S. State Department contacted Rudy Giuliani and said, there is a representative, a lawyer, an advisor to President Zelensky, the brand-new president of Ukraine, who would like to talk with you. You don't appear to be taking any calls from Ukrainians these days. Would you consider taking his call? Can you give him your number? Mr. Giuliani said yes, I'll be glad to take the call. He had a contact with the advisor. They met briefly in Spain, not in Ukraine. And then, Rudy Giuliani called two senior diplomats, two of the most senior people on the ambassadorial staff in Europe, and briefed them on everything that went on, described what the Ukrainians were concerned about, described what they were looking for, described this dynamic that's been going for more than 18 months. Ukraine trying to get evidence of what they think is American wrongdoing to American authorities and falling on deaf ears and that's the end of it.

Dig up dirt on Paul Manafort and have Ukraine's president make a kerfuffle here in Washington about Manafort and Trump when he came to visit.

So for two consecutive days, the media mob has obsessively, breathlessly historically been pushing this new story featuring an unknown member of the intel community. That is a separate issue, making unknown accusations about when unknown but somehow disturbing promise between an unknown world leader and President Trump. Now, you count all of those unknowns? Because, apparently, this is what passes as a big story among the media elite mob. Now, if you want to call yourself a journalist, you really have to toss out a vague, unverified accusation about President Trump and watch it spread like wildfire. They won't check each other. They just report. Reported here, this is true. I think we got him. How many times have we heard that the last three years? The media mob, their handlers in the Democratic Party, they are so desperate to smear this administration pretty much anything goes. I've never seen anything like it neither clear journalism dead in America in 2007. You have deep state operatives and bureaucrats and holdovers from the Obama era. They are very well aware of what their friends in the mob, well, do, how they operate and frankly how they can live delight the hell out of them. And they been working side-by-side with the mainstream media for years in order to shape a phony political narrative. Remember Chuckie Schumer's warning? Play close attention. Now, if the powerful tools of intelligence that we give to our intelligence community are then turned on us and weaponized against us or political opponents -- yes, that's really dangerous.

The I.G. report, caught red-handed by the inspector general, leaking sensitive government material for the press and then lying about it. That is dangerous for the country. Naturally after getting canned, McCabe was hired by fake news CNN, a marriage made in heaven, chose the right network. Now, fake news CNN, they always roll out McCabe who is a known liar to defend all of the deep state's mere attempts at abuse of power against President Trump and the latest so-called whistle-blower accusation is no exception.

Now, former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is now calling the whistleblower accusation a clear example of the deep state in action. And joining us now is the man himself. He's a former acting attorney general of the United States, Matt Whitaker. Matt, thank you for joining us. Now, first thing I thought, I heard about this, anonymous, intelligence, heard the president's conversations with world leader. Maybe I'm old- fashioned.

They tried to get the information to the Democrats on Capitol Hill and they try to get it to \"The Washington Post\". And it's funny to me that really with a foreign policy disagreement, the president has such broad latitude in how he managed the foreign affairs of our country under the Constitution that these two disagreed with how the president approached it and so they took illegitimate means by filing this whistle-blower complaint which is not appropriate under the whistle-blower statute. And then, of course, \"The Washington Post\" that gets a hold of it and runs with it. And it's scurrilous. It's cowardly. It's not the way it's supposed to work, Sean. And it's really -- you know, if these people disagree with this president on how he's handling foreign policy, they should run for president themselves. That's the solution. Let's propose some other way to do it. This president has the economy at full speed. He has America strong, and he has our adversaries on the run. And I just think in this situation, this is a prime example of where the deep state has tried to use an illegitimate tool to throw up a smoke screen to distract the people from how good things are going."

We have a Constitution that is supposed to give us civil rights and protect her privacy. We have Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure. We have -- we're supposed to practice minimization of Americans are picked up on some type of surveillance. You're certainly not allowed to unmask people. Do they do that to the president again? We know they spied on him. We know they spied on his campaign based on a phony dossier that they knew was phony to get a phony FISA warrant and his transition in his presidency.

They decided what they could or couldn't do under the law instead of just following the proper rules and procedures. And I think you're right. There are so powerful tools in the hands of these folks that they owe and enhance duty to protect that by following the policies and procedures. Time and time again, the only way that we can restore trust in the American people in the system of intelligence and includes the FBI, includes the director of national intelligence and CIA, DOD, so many agencies, is to make sure that these tools are handled appropriately and that we don't see these leaks. We don't see the leak of intelligence. We don't see the link of Mike Flynn's transcript from his phone call with Kislyak. We don't see any of these things that we have seen over the course of the last three plus years."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, Matt Whitaker. And tonight, while the media mob obsesses about unknown claims by an unknown whistle-blower, that might have something to do with Ukraine, we do have to thank them. That's right, a big thank you to all of the psychopaths in the media mob because they accidentally now have brought attention to what is a massive underlying scandal surrounding sleepy, creepy, crazy Uncle Joe 30330 as his credibility now. He is now accused of leveraging his role in the White House and our tax dollars as a get rich quick scheme for his family. Look at the timeline. It starts in 2014. President Obama appointed Biden to lead the administration efforts in Ukraine. That's a key date. In February of that same year, Biden son Hunter, yes, he was kicked out of the Navy. We won't get into it. That's personal issue but we do know the reason, that's not the issue. The issue is him and whether or not he was capitalizing on his father's connections as the top person identified to lead our negotiations with Ukraine. Remember the issue of him flying to China on Air Force Two, making questionable deals was a result of that trip with his dad. And also in Ukraine, while his father was in charge, of his father leveraging tax dollars to protect his son from a prosecutor that is going after the gas company that's paying him and his company 188 grand a month -- that matters. So a few months later, in May, Biden Hunter, well, he scored a lucrative position on the board of a massive Ukrainian oil and gas company called Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden, all we can tell, had zero experience in the oil and gas industry. He also had zero experience in the country of Ukraine. Yet, this massive oil and gas company in Ukraine owned by a Ukrainian oligarch was shelling out 50 grand a month for these services. Now, if you think that seems incredibly sketchy? You're not alone. Look at this: John Kerry's stepson who once worked and partnered with Hunter Biden cut all business ties with Biden son after learning about his strange new gig and associations. And meanwhile, one year later, in 2015, Joe Biden's younger brother James reportedly received a generous half a million dollar loan from a wealthy donor with deep ties to, you guessed it, Ukraine. And the story doesn't end there. In March of 2016, the very next year, the Ukrainian energy company pumping money into the pockets of Hunter Biden and his new oil and gas friends was facing a major corruption investigation by Ukraine's top prosecutors. So, of course, well, who came to the rescue? Well, dad, the vice president, in charge of Ukraine and American policies. That's right. He told Ukrainian officials that he would withhold $1 billion, taxpayer money, that they were giving Ukraine as aid and support unless Ukraine fired the prosecutor investigating the company that's doing business with his son. So, that's right, Biden was leveraging our money to fire the prosecutor investigating this whole issue to protect the company that was making his son pretty rich, pretty wealthy. Ultimately Ukraine, they had a six-hour window. Yes, they decided to fire the guy. They wanted the billion dollars. And by the way, Biden bragged about leveraging your money. We've got it on tape."
