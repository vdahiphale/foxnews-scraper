Because I think people thought you shutdown the government to try to budge the Democrats. And if they didn't budge, your next step was going to be declaring a national emergency. So I think now he's, unfortunately, in a position where he put out there in the very same way -- he has to learn to stop doing this. He put out there, you know, Mexico is going to pay for the wall, didn't work out that way. He put out there I'm not going to budge. I'm going to dig my heels in. And then when you don't, people are disappointed in you. So no matter what he does now -- now he's saying, oh, I'm going to redirect more other federal funds into this, so don't worry. You're still going to get the wall. We're still going to figure it out even if I have to do it by executive order. But the thing is, this shutdown, this whole shutdown was completely absurd and a waste of time.

Do you think the Democrats are really going to throw away $130 billion of spending which they love to do, for a measly 5.7 billion? He's got them right where he wants them.

And the mirror laughs at you if you compromise. And if the media -- if the media disappeared for one week this problem would have been solved. A perfect example is when you watch like morning bozo. He will scream about how -- what an autocrat Trump is, right? He's terrible. He's unbinding tyrant. And then when Trump compromises, he just laughs at him and mocks him. And so the media knows if that they do any compromise they will be -- I mean, if the Democrats compromise the media will mock them. So there's actually no incentive for them to do it.
