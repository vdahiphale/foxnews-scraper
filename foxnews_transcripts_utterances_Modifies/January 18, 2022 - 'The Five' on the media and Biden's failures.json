Soft on crime policies leaving a trail of avoidable death and destruction in Democrat-led cities all across the country. Dangerous criminals who should be behind bars are set loose with plenty of victims to choose from. And liberal district attorneys don't seem to care, despite there being a tragic new example of their policies every single day. Like 24-year-old UCLA grad student Brianna Kupfer who was randomly stabbed to death while working in a furniture store in Los Angeles. Her heartbroken father blaming politicians for letting criminals run rampant.",

He's the Manhattan D.A. He's under fire for his pro- crime policies. How did he react when the public didn't like what he was doing? He didn't change course. He hired crisis P.R. He was more concerned about the perception than he was about human suffering. That would be like Exxon Valdez doing press conferences every day without ever cleaning up the oil spill. You know, this isn't about perception, it's about human suffering. Meanwhile, you know, that poor father, he is right. The response in all of the cities is a WCYD, what can you do, right? You can't lock them up because there are so many activists out there that say that is a violation of rights. And we have mayors that are more terrified of activists than they are of murderers. So, you have them piling on all of this context, right? When we do this show, we always complain about being taken out of context. In this case, the context needs to be taken out of the story because in the last decade we've allowed the media and activism to create a context for crime. A deranged male savage murders a female, right? Those are all -- those are the only variables you need. Once you start adding more, oh, it's about society, it's about inequality, it's about ineffective policing. Then what you do is you create leadership paralysis. Nobody can do anything. It's about the rights. And that's what the father said. It's about the rights of the person who murdered his daughter. Well, what about the rights of his late daughter and all of these Asian women that are getting killed? Perhaps if it was white supremacist, the media would care, but they don't right now. We have to drill down on the simplest variables in every equation. Deranged man on the street, women getting murdered. You don't need to add anymore context unless you are willing to hang out with a deranged male and explain to him how it's about society and inequality. Good luck with that. Right now we need to get these people off the streets and into institutions. One less thing, institutions, if they are closed we need to open them up. Geraldo gets a bad rap on this. He was focusing on the institutions that were abusing teenagers and young people with disease. We don't know where these other mental institutions. Why aren't they open? We just want these people to get help. We don't want to hurt them. We want them to stop hurting other people.",

Here you are talking about schizophrenic, you're talking about bipolar, you're talking about people who've been deemed crazy who are off their meds. They have no place to go. They are vagrants. You know, Eric Adams is right when he says of New York and other big cities, the number one job of government is to keep people safe. If you don't give people a sense of safety and vagrancy is one thing of homelessness and aggressive panhandlers and the people who come up with the squeegee and the dirty rugs who wipe your windows, all those things were crimes that were enforced from the administration of Ed Koch on. And you know, in recent times have been ignored by these woke D.A.'s on one coast or the other where they say that these crimes are too insignificant. If you don't go for the kid jumping the turnstile in the subway, no one is going to use the subway because they'll feel unsafe. And then you'll have the nut job that pushes the Asian woman onto the tracks. You have to take care of the, you know, the small -- civic well-being. You know, we have to keep people not only safe but with a sense of being safe. We need a cop on every subway station, a cop on every train. Those tracks, those railroad tracks, the Union Pacific, didn't they use to be railroad police? Where's the company's responsibility? Why aren't they patrolling these container cars also? It just seems to me that law enforcement generally has been put on the back burner because of the handful of cases of police abuse. The law enforcement got a bad rap, and now they have overreacted and they are letting -- they're letting these punks do whatever they want to. And in the case of that poor father, what a kick in the guts that his daughter is stabbed. She's in graduate school, working hard. She's going to contribute to society and some punk, some bum, some piece of crap comes over and randomly stabs her to death and then walks out.

County sheriff, he's been working tirelessly with his department to clean up these homeless encampments. So is Kevin de Leon who is an L.A. City council member, and its whac-a-mole. You know, you try. You clear things out, but the ACLU, they've taken the wrong side here. You know, there is a way of defending freedom. There is a way of pushing back against government. But what they are allowing these politicians to do is completely skirt responsibility. Brown is where I'm from where I raised my girls in Pacific Palisades. You know, she went to beach camp down the street. She was raised to do exactly what she was supposed to do. Her parents moved to a safe part of the city. She went to college. She was getting, you know, her masters in architecture. She was working at a high end furniture store learning more about her craft. She was doing what she was supposed to do. And so is Krystal Bayron-Nieves. She's a 19-year-old kid working at Burger King. She was doing the right thing. Same with Michelle Alyssa Go. You know, here is a woman who is working hard. Their parents are proud. Their parents raised them right. And now, you know, it's like they're victims. They're gone. They don't have a future. They're not going to have kids. And that's a travesty that we cannot accept. So, whatever these politicians are doing, they are doing it wrong.

      "sentences": "Look, don't blame the bar, Jesse, but let me tell you who to blame. So Kennedy was mentioning the sheriff there in Los Angeles. That's the same sheriff that the prosecutor there, Gascon, called a pig. Geraldo said where is the government there with the train robberies up 356 percent? Where is the federal government? Interstate commerce and international commerce because 40 percent of our shipped goods go along that trail route there in southern California. That's DOJ jurisdiction. So the question needs to be posed to our president when they're allocating billions of dollars of your tax dollars to things on the streets, $5 billion for mental health. Well, why don't we see where our tax dollars should go? Because all of those families have zero child left. All of those families will mourn for generations where their tax dollars apparently went up in smoke and couldn't even provide for the safety while jurisdictions were fighting over things. And let me explain another policy aspect that leads to this. People talk about criminal justice reform. People pin it on bail laws and the like. When you re-classify crimes that is the heart of this matter. We all know the recidivist issue, right? Two-thirds of violent felons, they are arrested within five years of their original offense. That was before COVID. Now, that stat is even higher. So the notion that people who rob and battery and stock and engage in domestic violence and the likes, the fact that they go free, those are recidivist. That's why when we hear about these murderers, people pushing people off subway platforms, we say, who's surprised? That guy was arrested 16 times for battery and for stalking and the like. But now, stalking is not a felony. Now, battery is not a felony offense. That is where the problem lies. That's who we need to blame. Those politicians and those government elected officials.",

The most amazing truth about this, if you want to be more popular in America, be the party out of power. Remember, the party in power, the Democrats used to be out of power and they could strut and they could pontificate and they could rage. But now they are in power and they have to work. And now we're seeing that they are absolutely hopeless. But what if the Republicans get more done now because the Democrats are failing? A 14-point surge is pretty amazing. You're going to get more Congressional seats, more Senate seats, maybe more governors and you see these progressive policies being exposed.

Did Joe Biden deliver anything for black Americans in 2021? Didn't get Build Back Better, didn't get the election thing. Didn't get anything on police reform, education, healthcare, got zip. But the minute the clock strikes 12 and it's a midterm election year, race card comes down. Republicans are trying to subvert the vote. They're going to try to take away your vote, Bull Connor, Dixiecrat. You hear it all the time. So, what they do is, in the election year, they play the race card to excite the Black base. And then when they're out of power, and it's an off- year, they do nothing for their most loyal constituency. I'm on to them, and everybody else should be. Now, I also read something. He said, Joe Biden, that the Republicans plan to subvert the election. And then crying Chuck said they're rigging the game and rigging the count. Now, I remember when that kind of direct assault on the integrity of an election was deemed censurable. I mean, you couldn't ever say that. You couldn't question the integrity of our democratic institutions. How dare you? But the Democrats are already saying the votes rigged in the midterms and I don't think the Pinocchios have laid a hand on either of those guys. And here's another piece of hypocrisy, Emily Compagno. The Democrats want to federalize the state's election laws, right? But Democrat governors want to fight tooth and nail to regulate their own gun laws, their own state taxes, the way their COVID regulations are, their own health care policies, but they want to take over the state election powers. Which one is it guys? You can't have both.",

Dangerous criminals who should be behind bars are set loose with plenty of victims to choose from.

He's the Manhattan D.A. He's under fire for his pro- crime policies. How did he react when the public didn't like what he was doing? He didn't change course. He hired crisis P.R. He was more concerned about the perception than he was about human suffering. That would be like Exxon Valdez doing press conferences every day without ever cleaning up the oil spill. You know, this isn't about perception, it's about human suffering. Meanwhile, you know, that poor father, he is right. The response in all of the cities is a WCYD, what can you do, right? You can't lock them up because there are so many activists out there that say that is a violation of rights. And we have mayors that are more terrified of activists than they are of murderers. So, you have them piling on all of this context, right? When we do this show, we always complain about being taken out of context. In this case, the context needs to be taken out of the story because in the last decade we've allowed the media and activism to create a context for crime. A deranged male savage murders a female, right? Those are all -- those are the only variables you need. Once you start adding more, oh, it's about society, it's about inequality, it's about ineffective policing. Then what you do is you create leadership paralysis. Nobody can do anything. It's about the rights. And that's what the father said. It's about the rights of the person who murdered his daughter. Well, what about the rights of his late daughter and all of these Asian women that are getting killed? Perhaps if it was white supremacist, the media would care, but they don't right now. We have to drill down on the simplest variables in every equation. Deranged man on the street, women getting murdered. You don't need to add anymore context unless you are willing to hang out with a deranged male and explain to him how it's about society and inequality. Good luck with that. Right now we need to get these people off the streets and into institutions. One less thing, institutions, if they are closed we need to open them up. Geraldo gets a bad rap on this. He was focusing on the institutions that were abusing teenagers and young people with disease. We don't know where these other mental institutions. Why aren't they open? We just want these people to get help. We don't want to hurt them. We want them to stop hurting other people."

Here you are talking about schizophrenic, you're talking about bipolar, you're talking about people who've been deemed crazy who are off their meds. They have no place to go. They are vagrants. You know, Eric Adams is right when he says of New York and other big cities, the number one job of government is to keep people safe. If you don't give people a sense of safety and vagrancy is one thing of homelessness and aggressive panhandlers and the people who come up with the squeegee and the dirty rugs who wipe your windows, all those things were crimes that were enforced from the administration of Ed Koch on. And you know, in recent times have been ignored by these woke D.A.'s on one coast or the other where they say that these crimes are too insignificant. If you don't go for the kid jumping the turnstile in the subway, no one is going to use the subway because they'll feel unsafe. And then you'll have the nut job that pushes the Asian woman onto the tracks. You have to take care of the, you know, the small -- civic well-being. You know, we have to keep people not only safe but with a sense of being safe. We need a cop on every subway station, a cop on every train. Those tracks, those railroad tracks, the Union Pacific, didn't they use to be railroad police? Where's the company's responsibility? Why aren't they patrolling these container cars also? It just seems to me that law enforcement generally has been put on the back burner because of the handful of cases of police abuse. The law enforcement got a bad rap, and now they have overreacted and they are letting -- they're letting these punks do whatever they want to. And in the case of that poor father, what a kick in the guts that his daughter is stabbed. She's in graduate school, working hard. She's going to contribute to society and some punk, some bum, some piece of crap comes over and randomly stabs her to death and then walks out.

County sheriff, he's been working tirelessly with his department to clean up these homeless encampments. So is Kevin de Leon who is an L.A. City council member, and its whac-a-mole. You know, you try. You clear things out, but the ACLU, they've taken the wrong side here. You know, there is a way of defending freedom. There is a way of pushing back against government. But what they are allowing these politicians to do is completely skirt responsibility. Brown is where I'm from where I raised my girls in Pacific Palisades. You know, she went to beach camp down the street. She was raised to do exactly what she was supposed to do. Her parents moved to a safe part of the city. She went to college. She was getting, you know, her masters in architecture. She was working at a high end furniture store learning more about her craft. She was doing what she was supposed to do. And so is Krystal Bayron-Nieves. She's a 19-year-old kid working at Burger King. She was doing the right thing. Same with Michelle Alyssa Go. You know, here is a woman who is working hard. Their parents are proud. Their parents raised them right. And now, you know, it's like they're victims. They're gone. They don't have a future. They're not going to have kids. And that's a travesty that we cannot accept. So, whatever these politicians are doing, they are doing it wrong. So I hope Todd Kupfer continues to speak out, continues to be the voice for his daughter and other victims who are forgotten."

      "utterance": "Look, don't blame the bar, Jesse, but let me tell you who to blame. So Kennedy was mentioning the sheriff there in Los Angeles. That's the same sheriff that the prosecutor there, Gascon, called a pig. Geraldo said where is the government there with the train robberies up 356 percent? Where is the federal government? Interstate commerce and international commerce because 40 percent of our shipped goods go along that trail route there in southern California. That's DOJ jurisdiction. So the question needs to be posed to our president when they're allocating billions of dollars of your tax dollars to things on the streets, $5 billion for mental health. Well, why don't we see where our tax dollars should go? Because all of those families have zero child left. All of those families will mourn for generations where their tax dollars apparently went up in smoke and couldn't even provide for the safety while jurisdictions were fighting over things. And let me explain another policy aspect that leads to this. People talk about criminal justice reform. People pin it on bail laws and the like. When you re-classify crimes that is the heart of this matter. We all know the recidivist issue, right? Two-thirds of violent felons, they are arrested within five years of their original offense. That was before COVID. Now, that stat is even higher. So the notion that people who rob and battery and stock and engage in domestic violence and the likes, the fact that they go free, those are recidivist. That's why when we hear about these murderers, people pushing people off subway platforms, we say, who's surprised? That guy was arrested 16 times for battery and for stalking and the like. But now, stalking is not a felony. Now, battery is not a felony offense. That is where the problem lies. That's who we need to blame. Those politicians and those government elected officials."

Forty-seven percent of Americans now calling themselves Republicans while only 42 percent claim to be Democrats, 47 to 42.

The most amazing truth about this, if you want to be more popular in America, be the party out of power. Remember, the party in power, the Democrats used to be out of power and they could strut and they could pontificate and they could rage. But now they are in power and they have to work. And now we're seeing that they are absolutely hopeless. But what if the Republicans get more done now because the Democrats are failing? A 14-point surge is pretty amazing. You're going to get more Congressional seats, more Senate seats, maybe more governors and you see these progressive policies being exposed. So, I think he should enjoy being out of power because those in power fail and you benefit. And the dynamic goes both ways. It will happen to the Republicans. Beauty of the system."

Geraldo, it's not just -- it's not just COVID because they have been lied to on pretty much every level. It's also inflation and not being able to afford things and having to make sacrifices deciding where you're going to spend what little money you have because inflation, as you know, is outpacing wage growth. And they can't fall back on, well, you know, wages are rising. Well, they are not necessarily when gas and meat cost twice what they did a year ago. This administration has to stop lying about things. They have to stop blaming everyone else for these problems, which is what Paul Begala just did.

But to answer your question, absolutely. But the problem is that the nimbleness and the humility that Walensky, not Lewinsky, Jesse -- that was a -- that was a different person in the White House. That Walensky has said that that she needs to embody and she's sorry about, you know, none of their policies have actually reflected that. So, she said, we developed school guidance, for example, knowing she said that parents and kids and administrators were depending on us to ensure that kids back -- get back into that enriching environment of classrooms. Well, what happened? They haven't changed their policy actually at all. And in fact, they advised the White House directly on how to do that. And because of that, children are committing suicide and in declining mental health at record rates. So, there's a lot more she needs to be held accountable for and that she needs to apologize for. But believe me, humility is definitely not on her attribute list."

Geraldo, obviously I'm going to go to you first because you're not only America's sweetheart, you're also the Walter Cronkite of our generation. So, I have to ask you.
