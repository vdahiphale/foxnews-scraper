At least two people are confirmed dead but officials expect that number to rise. The storm has left over 300,000 without power and 1,500 taking refuge in shelters.  And with the drenching storm expected to continue for more days, 10 million Texans are now under a flash flood warning.   In the moment, we'll discuss the damage and the response from authorities with Texas Governor Greg Abbott. But first, we have Fox Team coverage.

It's impassable the water levels are rising fast because these torrential rains simply will not let up.  Now, look at this video shot not long ago earlier this morning of an actual rescue happening in Houston, a human chain being formed pulling someone to safety. Galveston County and the city of Houston have received highest rainfall totals so far. The National Weather Service says the rain has been coming down at a rate of five to six inches an hour in some places, in fact, 24 inches falling in the Houston metro, which is just to the north of us.  Local emergency management officials say area 911 call centers are swamped with people calling in for help either stranded in their homes or out on the roadways, and forecasters fear the worst may be yet to come in terms of flooding. Now, President Trump is monitoring this disaster very, very closely. In fact, he held a teleconference by video from Camp David yesterday with key members of his cabinet. He was briefed about the situation on the ground here like people from the new FEMA administration, Brock Long. The federal emergency management agency says now is go time.",

Now, we're crossing the eastern side of Texas, that's targeting very directly the Houston area and everywhere around it.   Already, we've seen some spots over two feet of rain and we have about another three days to go. We knew there would probably be some spots around the 50-inch rain, rainfall totals by the end of this. We didn't know exactly where that would line up. It looks like it's going a little bit farther east than we had anticipated. So, we have a very heavy rain in Houston. We've already seen over two feet of rain in Houston and we probably are going to be looking at about an additional two feet of rain by the time this is done.

Which means it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for the Associated Press, and Josh Holmes, Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff and the GOP strategist. Well, Sheriff Arpaio was convicted last month of criminal contempt for defying a court order to stop detaining Latinos on suspicions that they might be illegal. His opponents called it racial profiling. We asked you for questions about the president's pardon and Maria Swanson tweeted this. If the law doesn't apply to Arpaio, should it apply to anyone else? Karl, how do you answer Maria? What do you think of the pardoning as a legal proposition and also the politics of it? KARL ROVE, Fox NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, well, look, the president is entitled under the Constitution to have an unlimited power of pardon. I think he ill exercised it in this instance. Sheriff Arpaio was found guilty of violating a federal court order for over a year that said to stop racially profiling people for driving Latino or walking Latino, and he openly defied it and said he was going to continue the current policy that the federal court had told him to stop. And this did not go through the normal routine that pardon applications go through, the Department of Justice. It was drafted inside the White House. It didn't go through the regular process, review by outside lawyers, I think the president is making a political statement. An ally of his was about ready to go to jail for six months or so and he stepped in. He had the right to do it. I think it was a bad mistake and a bad signal for the country.",

JUAN WILLIAMS, Fox NEWS POLJITICAL ANALYST: Well, this was a political act, as Karl said. This was not an act of mercy for someone who had been denied justice. Sheriff Arpaio has not been sentenced yet. He's been convicted but not sentenced. So this was a preemptive act by President Trump that I think then sets a precedent going in that he can act in terms of pardons with little rebuke from the Justice Department to help out someone who's a family member, someone who's a political ally. This -- you remember, Arpaio was not only an early supporter of Donald Trump, he was an early birther, and he is the face of hostility towards immigrants, specifically with Mexicans and Latinos in his country. So it was a political act that he promised his base on Tuesday night at that rally in Phoenix and he has delivered on that promise in such a way as to say that in the future such acts of pardon are now more normal.

The problem is the storm has stalled just in short, just inland, but all of this moisture of this very warm gulf, it's one of the warmest bodies of water anywhere in the world, that moisture continuing to pull up. Now, we're crossing the eastern side of Texas, that's targeting very directly the Houston area and everywhere around it. Already, we've seen some spots over two feet of rain and we have about another three days to go. We knew there would probably be some spots around the 50-inch rain, rainfall totals by the end of this. We didn't know exactly where that would line up. It looks like it's going a little bit farther east than we had anticipated. So, we have a very heavy rain in Houston. We've already seen over two feet of rain in Houston and we probably are going to be looking at about an additional two feet of rain by the time this is done. That means the flooding pictures that we've been seeing all day today is only going to get worse by the time we get to Wednesday.

Some people will recall Tropical Storm Allison that devastated Houston in 2001 and this looks like somewhat of a replication of that. We're working to save lives and to keep as many people safe as possible in the Houston area, but, Chris, at the very same time, we are conducting search and rescue missions where the hurricane hit near the Corpus Christi and Rockport areas.

And I know the damage has been so extensive that a lot of first responders haven't been able to go in and see what has happened to people who sheltered in place. You know, the casualty account at this point seems remarkably low -- two dead, a dozen or so injured. I hate to ask this, but is it -- do you expect the casualty count to rise dramatically as first responders get into some of these more devastated areas?"

And so, we will have some more reports that will come out today. But I will tell you in that particular region, there were a lot of warnings to evacuate. There was a large number of evacuations from that area and those evacuations likely saved a whole lot of lives."

There are hurricanes and tropical storms that pass through the Gulf Region all the time. They were very well-prepared for, they hunkered down and were able to contain their facilities and they have the ability to ratchet up back up fairly quickly.

Has that made a difference, sir?"

I've spoken to the president several times, to his cabinet members, such as secretary of homeland security, such as the administrator of FEMA, such as Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services. And so, all across the board, from the White House to the federal administration to FEMA, they've been very helpful. We were able to see this storm coming a week or more in advance and get a lot of preposition and taking care of, whether it'd be the federal assets or the state assets or the local assets. So, when it comes to preparation, we've never been more prepared for a storm than we have been this time."

And this is the quickest turnaround I've ever seen from the time that a governor made a disaster declaration to getting that granted. What that means for the layperson out there is because the president so swiftly granted my application for disaster declaration, that means it triggered all the resources of FEMA to help Texas, and what you will see over the coming weeks and months is a tremendous rebuilding from all this damage and a large part of that will be because of FEMA helping out. And so, we are very appreciative of the way the president and the White House has responded to this catastrophe."

And remember this, and that is the focus on TV right now is the Houston area. But there are miles upon miles outside of the Houston area were a lot of people will face a lot of challenges because of rain, and flooding and rising and water.

For example, overnight, our National Guard deployed to Houston, Texas, multiple high-level vehicles that are going to be manned by the National Guard. We are deploying boats and helicopters to be involved in swift water rescues and that would be not just any Houston or Harris County area, but that would be all over east Texas where you can see all the heavy flooding.

I think with respect to the response of the state of Texas, Governor Abbott doing a remarkable job dealing with an ongoing event, and I think it's important that people understand and recognize, this is an ongoing event that they're dealing with. President Trump has convened an all cabinets meeting yesterday. They were going to have another one later this morning to ensure that all agencies were doing everything they can to support the state of Texas and its response. Now, with respect to the oil and gas industry, they have been through this many, many times. They are probably among the most prepared for these types of events. So, they do a lot of pre-staging of capability, but there will be challenges that are created by a storm of this magnitude and a storm that's going to last as long as this one is. I'm confident that they will respond, though, capably and the government have facilitated that with early action as well."

Security Council resolution imposing the most stringent sanctions ever to be imposed on North Korea. There's also a unified international voice echoing our messages that no one wants to see a nuclear Korean peninsula. So, we are all unified in our mission to say (ph) denuclearize Korean peninsula.

We are shifting from a time-based military strategy that had very clear troop ceiling levels to now, as he indicated, a conditions-based strategy, which means it will be dictated by conditions on the ground informed by battlefield commanders. He has also delegated significant authority to Secretary Mattis to set troop levels, but also has been able to delegate for the military commanders in the field, decision-making, to begin to turn the tide against the Taliban. I think we all recognize that for the past couple of years, the Taliban has been advancing and Afghan forces have been unable to push them back. So, there will be a definite change in military tactics on the ground. Now, all of this is directed at sending at message to the Taliban that we are not going anywhere. We're going to be here. We're going to continue to fight for the Afghan government, support the Afghan security forces. And what needs to happen is the Taliban needs to engage with Afghan government in a process of reconciliation and developing a way to govern the country in the future."

    {
      "speaker": "TILLERSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the war against ISIS is quite clear, Chris, and the president has been clear that we will defeat ISIS. We will to eliminate ISIS' capability to organize, to raise financing, to plan, recruit new recruits to their fight to carry out terrorism acts throughout the world. That fight is progressing quite well. We are well on our way to defeating ISIS. We have now taken the caliphate from them in Iraq. Over 70 percent of the territory has been recovered. None of it has been lost back to those forces. Almost 2 million displaced Iraqi people have now returned to their homes. In the fight in Syria, we are in the process of liberating Raqqa, which was their self designated capital. That liberation is going quite well. And it's our expectation that we will defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq. And then our effort is global, to ensure that ISIS does not reemerge elsewhere. Now, all terrorist organizations have somewhat different objectives. So, whether it's ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban or others, our objective is to deny any terrorist organization any territory with which they can organize, raise financing, recruit new fighters, develop techniques for carrying out terrorist attacks and then deploying those. We know that if we deny them the space to do that, we protect the homeland. We also protect Americans and our allies as well. So, in the case of Afghanistan, Afghanistan has a history of being a refuge for some of the most devastating attacks carried out. As we all know, the attack of 9/11 was organized and carried out from Afghanistan. So, in Afghanistan, we have to secure Afghanistan in a way that that can never occur again because there's no territory available to organizations to do so."

Terrorism, as we've said, manifests itself in many types of organization. The president has charged us to develop policies and tactics both diplomatically and militarily to attack terrorism in as many forms, wherever it exists in the world and wherever it might present a threat to the homeland or to Americans anywhere.

So, we will be shifting our diplomatic and aid and development programs as well to coincide with the president's view that the Afghan government and that Afghan people must own their form of government. And they must come to some reconciliation with all ethnic groups, including the Taliban, as to how they can secure their country, as a peaceful country, one that does not support terrorism, does not provide safe havens for terrorists and does not align itself with any terrorist organizations or countries that do.

      "utterance": "President Trump in Phoenix clearly hinting he was going to pardon Sheriff Joe Arpaio. In fact, as a line from \"The Godfather,\" today I settle all family business. And while the country was watching Hurricane Harvey Friday night, the president fired Sebastian Gorka, set out guidelines for banning transgender's in the military, and pardoned Sheriff Joe. Which means it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams, Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for the Associated Press, and Josh Holmes, Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff and the GOP strategist. Well, Sheriff Arpaio was convicted last month of criminal contempt for defying a court order to stop detaining Latinos on suspicions that they might be illegal. His opponents called it racial profiling. We asked you for questions about the president's pardon and Maria Swanson tweeted this. If the law doesn't apply to Arpaio, should it apply to anyone else? Karl, how do you answer Maria? What do you think of the pardoning as a legal proposition and also the politics of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, Fox NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, look, the president is entitled under the Constitution to have an unlimited power of pardon. I think he ill exercised it in this instance. Sheriff Arpaio was found guilty of violating a federal court order for over a year that said to stop racially profiling people for driving Latino or walking Latino, and he openly defied it and said he was going to continue the current policy that the federal court had told him to stop. And this did not go through the normal routine that pardon applications go through, the Department of Justice. It was drafted inside the White House. It didn't go through the regular process, review by outside lawyers, I think the president is making a political statement. An ally of his was about ready to go to jail for six months or so and he stepped in. He had the right to do it. I think it was a bad mistake and a bad signal for the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "And there's also a report in \"The Washington Post\" today that the president had actually talked beforehand to the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, about not bringing the case in the first place. Juan, some critics are suggesting that the way that the pardon went down – and I will refer back to what Karl was just saying -- no appeal, no expression of remorse, no review by the Justice Department, may in some sense send a signal to some of his aides who might be under investigation in the unrelated investigation by Special Counsel Mueller, he'll take care of them, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, Fox NEWS POLJITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, this was a political act, as Karl said. This was not an act of mercy for someone who had been denied justice. Sheriff Arpaio has not been sentenced yet. He's been convicted but not sentenced. So this was a preemptive act by President Trump that I think then sets a precedent going in that he can act in terms of pardons with little rebuke from the Justice Department to help out someone who's a family member, someone who's a political ally. This -- you remember, Arpaio was not only an early supporter of Donald Trump, he was an early birther, and he is the face of hostility towards immigrants, specifically with Mexicans and Latinos in his country. So it was a political act that he promised his base on Tuesday night at that rally in Phoenix and he has delivered on that promise in such a way as to say that in the future such acts of pardon are now more normal. He can say this set a pattern and he can pardon family, friends and allies."

      "speaker": "JOSH HOLMES, FOUNDER, CAVALRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't think there's any grave threat to the democracy here. I mean the presidential pardons are pretty clear. He's got really broad authority to do just about anything he wants. And this is an 85-year-old law enforcement officer who, you know, may or may not get six months in prison as a result of a guilty verdict. In comparison to some of the pardons and clemency that we've seen over the last decade or two decades, it sort of pales in comparison. My guess is that your reaction to this is probably a direct attribution to how you feel about Joe Arpaio. And, you know, he's no -- not my cup of tea, but I think for a lot of Trump supporters, he's the face of law and order."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But I think – I think, just quickly, sorry for interrupting, Chris, but I think very quickly, Josh, the idea that you undermine a federal court order and say that law enforcement is not subject to equal justice under the law seems different to me. When Nixon was pardoned by Ford, huge pushback, even from the president of the United States, allowing a double standard to be put in place for a former president."

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes, we now recognize, however, that was a great act on behalf of our country. It united our country by putting that issue behind us. I'd say this. The suggestion in \"The Washington Post\" that there is a grand strategy to pardon Arpaio and signal to anybody who might be involved in the campaign, Russian (INAUDIBLE), blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, it just doesn't work. There's no strategy behind this. This was an act on impulse by the president. It has no relationship to the ongoing investigation of Russia. There is no, in my opinion, belief that we are going to send a message."

Let's put it up on the screen. Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker, John McCain, Flake, Speaker Ryan. Josh, you have a dog in this fight, as the former chief of staff to Mitch McConnell. Is that the president separating himself and picking fights with all these members, Republican leaders, is that going to make it harder for him to pass and them to pass the agenda?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Yes, no question. There's a great piece in \"The Washington Post\" by Paul Cain (ph) this weekend that explores the presidential triangulation and it can be a very effective strategy at times. Where it's not an effective strategy is when your party runs Congress and you're before the midterms. Where it could lead is impeachment. And I think, look, it has one practical effect of attacking your own party. It drives down the overall approval of Congress, your leaders within and the generic ballot, meaning Republicans versus Democrat. Played out to its logical extension what it means is that Democrats have a heck of a lot better shot in the midterms than they probably would ordinarily and otherwise. And if Democrats take over the House, if this president believes the Democratic based it is not going to enforce impeachment proceedings, he hasn't been paying attention to what's happening."

This president is frustrated. He's frustrated he hasn't moved his agenda more. His base cares deeply about immigration. His base cares about the wall. I mean if you looked at the rally this week in Phoenix, people were chanting, build the wall, as they have been, you know, for over a year.

Did President Trump make the right decision in recommitting, and what do you think of the strategy that he laid out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I believe he did. There's no good decision on this. He took the best of the available options, which is to sustain the Afghan government and its military in this fight and to make a commitment to add additional U.S. troops to allow them to do this. It's a big change from what President Obama did. President Obama was not conditions to the ground. He was an arbitrary deadline. And we were thankfully saved from having these so-called zero option exercise in 2012 by our NATO allies who convinced President Obama that just simply because he was up for election was not reason enough to withdraw U.S. and NATO troops. Our only chance to keep Afghanistan for becoming once again a haven for international terrorism is to win this. And President Trump, I think, did the right thing on Monday night by recommitting America to the fight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But, Juan, there are real questions about whether sending more troops -- and this first deployment, we're told, although the president won't announce it, is going to be 4,000 troops. Is that going to make any real difference in ending, winning, ending America's longest war?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I think if troop numbers were going to make any difference, you go back to '11. We had 100,000 troops on the ground. So I don't think adding 4,000 troops to the existing 8,000 or so that are on the ground is going to make any radical difference. The key here it seems to me is that – what the president said, we have to have talks with the Taliban. What we heard from Rex Tillerson this morning in his interview with you, but also earlier, is that the Taliban is going to have victories on the battlefield. The U.S. is going to have victories. No one's going to win. We need to talk. That's where the focus of this should be. But at the moment, with so many generals surrounding this president, I think the general have said, let's look for a military solution. And I think it plays into a lot of Republican memes about, oh, Obama pulled out too quickly. We want to make sure that we are there. Remember the good that came from the surge back in '06 when President Bush sent added forces into Iraq. But that's really not what this is about. This should be about getting Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States, our allies to the table and find a settlement."

He noted it was a provocative act. But, you know, then said they want to continue with this peaceful pressure. And it seems like, for now, you know, what I'm hearing is that there is interest in seeing how the new U.N. sanctions play out. Those unanimously approved sanctions were pretty tough that came earlier this month and that that seems to be, for the moment, with this latest – latest attack what they're looking at."
    },
    {

      "speaker": "LUCEY",
      "utterance": "Well, you saw that earlier this week. I mean the secretary, you know, praised him for restraint, you know, the president seemed more positive.

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But, Josh, and I gently pointed this out to the secretary of state, when they are talking about restraint and he respects us and then he fires off three missiles, they look a little silly, don't they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, a little bit. I mean I get – you get the impression by listening to the president and listening to the secretary of state over the last week that they were proceeding as if they're dealing with a rational actor here. Ad I think anybody who has seen the way that U.S. foreign policy has proceeded with North Korea over the last two decades, it's pretty clear that we're not dealing with a rational actor at all. And, in fact, the one thing that they crave more than anything is the attention of the American people. And so I think, you know, to the extent that there has been a more muted response, as has been suggested here, is probably a pretty good thing. Every time they fire something off into the water next to the Korean Peninsula doesn't mean the American people need to rush out and note it. So I – you know, I can't fault them for their response to this."

I have to say, I think President Trump did the right thing when they were talking about launching missiles towards a U.S. territory, Guam, and that's when he made the fire and fury comment. And that's where Mattis said, you fire a missile at a U.S. territory, it is an act of war. And what happened? The president's gambit worked. They dropped the plan to launch the missiles towards Guam and instead shot three intermediate range missiles and short-range missiles –"
