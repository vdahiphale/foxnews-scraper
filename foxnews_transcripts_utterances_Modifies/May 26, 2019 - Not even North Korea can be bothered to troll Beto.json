Volunteers found Amanda Eller, Friday after weeks of searching for her. The 35-year-old lost her way during a hike. At one point she fell 20 feet off a steep cliff breaking her leg. Eller ate wild strawberry, guavas and plants. She even spent one night in the den of a wild boar. Speaking from her hospital bed, Eller says it came down to life or death and she chose life. Overseas, a human traffic jam has caused tens of deaths on Mount Everest in two months. Five of those climbers died this week. A record number of mountaineers who want to conquer the world's highest summit during the peak climbing period, which is April and May. This is now one of the deadliest seasons for climbers. I'm Aishah Hasnie, now back to THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW."

And then I even had to like put them on my nose and be like, I know, \"I'm the nostril walrus.\" And then you know that people had to say -- and that was very difficult for me. And I also can't make fun of anyone else's camp. Because in high school, I went to yearbook camp. It's worse than that. I went to yearbook camp two times."
