      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Yes, tonight, 448 days into Mueller's seemingly never-ending witch hunt, but now with just 90 days to go until what I am calling the single most important midterm of our lifetime, there could actually be a light at the end of the tunnel. Earlier today, President Trump's attorney rejected interview terms from team Mueller and rightfully so, we'll explain.  Now, this to me is an obvious perjury trap being set by partisan investigators. In moments, Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney will be here with reaction. And also tonight, more major breaking news surrounding the deep state go-between Bruce Ohr, how the plot thickens tonight even much more than before.  And The Hill's John Solomon unearth texts showing that former foreign spy Christopher Steele desperately trying to infiltrate and actually influence Mueller's ongoing investigation. New information. He actually used Bruce Ohr's connections to Christopher Steele. This is so much worse than we have known up to this point.  We'll explain all of that coming up, and new developments surrounding WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Will he finally be interviewed here in the U.S. about the 2016 election hacking, and what evidence might have? All of that, plus, we cover the president's tough new sanctions against Russia. Oh, I thought he was compromised.  And, of course, comrade De Blasio, the mayor of New York City, he has a beef apparently with us here at Fox News. And its day seven of Paul Manafort's trial of the century and a bizarre, horrifying story about a recently arrested Islamic extremist in New Mexico, another story out of Pennsylvania.  All right. Busy night, busy news night. A lot to get into. Stay tuned, it's time for our breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right. We are going to start, we are going to go very slow tonight because a lot of new information. Robert Mueller and his team of partisan investigators, they want to face off with the president of the United States number but today President Trump's attorneys flatly rejected, rightly so, Mueller's interview terms. They have countered with a proposal of their own. In a statement, the attorney for President Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote: We are restating what we have been saying for months, it is time for the office of the special counsel to conclude its inquiry without further delay.   Now, the former mayor is not predicting that the investigation could be over by September 1st. He will be right here on the show with more details in just a few moments. Without a doubt, President Trump should be aware. Now, Mueller, his merry band of anti-Trump deep state sycophants, Hillary Clinton, Obama, Democratic donors -- what's happening here, we all pretty much agree on -- they are laying a perjury trap for that president of the United States. Mueller should not get what he wants. The president, his attorney should not give in. The president should not sit down for an interview.  Now, tonight, we have yet another example of just how corrupt and how flawed Mueller's witch hunt really is. According to a shocking new report tonight from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, Christopher Steele, remember him? The former foreign spy responsible for the Clinton bought and paid for dossier? Oh, we now know he was also paid by your FBI, your dollars under Jim Comey while they were desperately trying to influence the ongoing counsel with the hunt into so-called Russian collusion and it gets worse.   Bruce Ohr, the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, was trying to help Christopher Steele do it. This is months after Steele was fired for leaking. He got 11 payments from the FBI. On July 16th, 2016, before the election, Steele wrote to Ohr, quote: I spoke to my old colleagues last week. They assured me they would not stand in the way of our re-engagement with the bureau.  Ohr texted back: I will pass along to my colleagues, thanks. And on November 18th, after the election, Trump won. Now, Mueller's witch hunt, by the way, was now underway. Christopher Steele writing: I am presuming you've heard nothing back from your special counsel colleagues on the issues you kindly put to them from me.  And then Steele goes on to say: To say this is disappointing would be an understatement. Certain people have been willing to risk everything to engage with them in an effort to help them reach the truth.  Now, yes, right, just like there's truth in that phony, unverified, uncorroborated, debunked dossier that the Clinton campaign used to smear then candidate Donald Trump, the same Russian lies that were used before the election as the foundation for the Mueller witch hunt and the op research used to mislead a FISA court on four, not one, but four separate occasions, four judges, so the government literally could spy on an opposition party candidate and Trump campaign associate. Now, meanwhile, according to a brand-new report from our own Sara Carter, a post-election 2016 handwritten document from Bruce Ohr listing the names of Strzok and Page and others in the FBI is also raising questions tonight about the extent of Ohr's communications with the bureau.  And according to some other newly unearthed texts tonight, we are also learning he was concerned about the U.S. Senate's inquiry into the dirty dossier, probably because the contents were full of Russian lies and outright propaganda. And, by the way, he even said so himself, in an interrogatory. In England, he said it's raw intelligence. I have no idea if this is true, may be 50/50, really?   Not only did he peddle his Clinton and FBI bought and paid for lies to you, the American people to sway an election. The bulk of that information that is false, Russian lies to get a FISA warrant as top officials, as I said, four separate times like the FISA court judges to spy on an opposition candidate. Then he turns around and tries to peddle his lies through Bruce Ohr. Remember, his wife Nellie -- well, she helped the build allies for Fusion GPS, the dossier. What did they do with it? They wanted to get it to Mueller post-election to destroy President Trump after the fact that they lost. They try to influence the election, it didn't work. Then they try to destroy the president. It is a national, disgusting, despicable disgrace, the biggest abuse of power by the top DOJ and FBI officials in this country, by the way, not rank and file. And according to Solomon's report -- we'll go back to that -- these communications between Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele, they were going on until late November 2017. That's more than a year after the FBI supposedly officially cut off all ties with Christopher Steele because he was leaking and lying about potentially classified information to the media again to peddle his lies to influence the outcome of our election.  Now, this all comes on the heels of last night's shocking report that showed that Christopher Steele was working closely with Bruce Ohr before and after the 2016 election, again to spread the lies from his dirty dossier. He had no faith in those lies, throughout the highest levels of what is supposed to be our fair and unbiased justice system. Equal justice under the law, equal applications of the law.  Now, at the time, Ohr, again, the fourth highest ranking member of Obama's Department of Justice, however, he has since been demoted because of his unethical ties to Steele and Fusion GPS. Now, Sara Carter, John Solomon, they will be joining us in a moment with more details. These are shocking new developments. It is far worse than we ever thought.   But, first, we are also currently tracking another investigation into election hacking. Now, according to WikiLeaks, the Senate Intel Committee has now requested to interview WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Now, Senator Burr's office has not confirmed the request but if it's true, it's about time. After all, remember, WikiLeaks, they were the ones that actually released those hacked emails and unlike so many other so-called journalist here in America, we took the time, we went to England, we sat down and we interviewed Julian Assange right here on the show and on my radio show and he said to us then, no government actor was involved in the hacking. You might remember, take a look.",

We're going to keep you posted when or if the Senate Intel does in fact interview Julian Assange.  And, by the way, the House, they need to do the same thing.  The American people, you deserve the truth. But tonight, regardless of what you think about WikiLeaks, it's irrelevant. We know one thing for certain: President Trump in no way colluded with Russia and instead the president has been extremely tough on Vladimir Putin's hostile regime. And today, we have one more example. Tough new U.S. sanctions levied against Russia in response to an assassination attempt of a former British spy conducted with chemical or biological weapons. These new sanctions will be applied to all Russian state-owned businesses and will reportedly affect 70 percent of the Russian economy.  Gee, I thought the president was compromised by Putin. That's what fake news tells us, or NBC News suggesting he might actually be a Russian agent, President Trump. Now, while the president makes serious policy decisions and as he's conducting consequential peace through strength diplomacy -- well, many on the far left, they are obsessing over ICE, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Now, as part of their grand plan to get open borders, many on the left want to band together and ban ICE altogether.   Earlier this week, we sent Tomi Lahren to Portland, Oregon, to interview some of these anti-ICE activists. This is a small portion, take a look.",

All right. Now, let's return to the horrific breaking story out of New Mexico. A father of a missing disabled 3-year-old son has been arrested at a squalid camp that is linked to Islamic extremists. Now, during this arrest, 11 children were found on this compound where it is believed weapons training was conducted. Now, with plans, of course, to use the children in future school shootings. The individual arrested was the son of a Brooklyn imam who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center attack. Now, sadly, the remains of the young child were also found on this compound. A scary, tragic story we'll continue to follow. And we also have another topic to get to and it comes to us right here in New York City. Sorry, I pay high taxes, I'm stuck here. Far left mayor, comrade Bill de Blasio has a new favorite villain. They are looking at it right now.  That's right. During a recent interview, comrade de Blasio blamed FOX News for dividing America. He tells \"The Guardian\", quote: If you could remove News Corp. from the last 25 years of American history we would be an entirely different place.  Yes, that's true. We'd only have one opinion on the news, from the far left. A universal opinion because they're all a bunch of sheep, a utopian dream for comrade de Blasio. And like a true left wing extremist, well, comrade de Blasio detests diversity of thought. That's not good. Imagine 30 years without Rush? Oh, let's see, 30 years without talk radio? Twenty-three years without FOX News? All right. Finally tonight, our last topic covers day seven of the trial of the century, the 2005 tax and bank fraud charges against Paul Manafort. Remember, no collusion, has nothing to do with Donald Trump, nothing to do with the campaign, nothing to do with Russia.  And while team Mueller is embarrassing themselves attempting to put the screws on Manafort as Judge Ellis said to get him to sing or compose against President Trump so they can impeach or prosecute him, well, it's Mueller's prosecutors who were actually feeling the heat from the presiding judge, T.S. Ellis III. Yesterday, Judge Ellis berated Mueller's legal team and even accused one prosecutor of being such a tough guy he was tearing up like a little crybaby. Today, Judge Ellis reportedly urged the prosecution, quote, focus sharply, speed up the pace of the trial, saying, quote: judges should be patient. They made a mistake when they confirmed. And meanwhile, Manafort's attorneys once again called out what is the questionable character of the star witness Rick Gates, pointing out that he had up to four extramarital affairs on top of, oh, let's see, embezzlement, lying, extortion and could have faced if he didn't get the free -- get out of jail free card from Mueller, could have faced 290 years in jail. Wow, all for 290 years in jail or say something about this guy. I think I'll take the jail. I don't think so.   Now, as always, we'll continue to update you on this trial conducted by Mueller's team of witch hunters. This has absolutely zero to do with Russia, nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with the campaign, nothing to do with Trump. 2005, put the squares to him so he sings or composes. All right. Back to our breaking news story tonight. Joining us from \"The Hill\", John Solomon, and FOX News investigative reporter, contributor, Sara Carter. John, we'll begin with you. Let's talk about this new development. This is massive tonight, put a lot of emphasis, go slow, it gets complicated.",

Months after Christopher Steele was discredited and terminated by the FBI because he has leaked to the media, a major violation of human source intelligence rules, there was an effort underway by him with his buddy Bruce Ohr, at that time a top deputy to Rod Rosenstein, to try to get him back into the FBI's good graces and possibly get him working, reengaged it says is the word used in this emails with special counsel Mueller. Now, it doesn't appear in these things that we can prove they ever got to Mueller, but the mere fact that a senior Justice Department official was trying to get a discredited partisan intelligence source back on to the case tells you all you need to know about this case. This is not the way counterintelligence is normally done in the FBI. Career people that sources carefully, they manage them carefully. They double and triple check their authenticity and their accuracy. Here, we turned a blind eye to their partisanship, to their inaccuracy and their documents, and we are still trying to get them in the investigation a year later. That is what's wrong with this FBI investigation. And this episode is one of the strongest -- strongest parts-- the FBI is talking to Bruce Ohr, they know this is going on.

They withheld exculpatory evidence that the judges should have known about. Also, the documents reveal something very important. These are law enforcement sensitive documents. These are memos written by Bruce Ohr himself and on November 21st, he apparently either met with or spoke with Lisa Page. Remember, she is general counsel for former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. She also with Peter Strzok, her paramour, lover.  And so, when you look at all of this and Joe Pientka, who was an FBI agent, the same one that interviewed General Michael Flynn with Peter Strzok. This is so important because in that note to himself, basically that memorandum, he also mentioned Paul Manafort, that they were moving forward against Paul Manafort. And that's essential here, because he couldn't move forward against Trump. They could move forward against Manafort but he did note, I would contact Christopher Steele. He basically noted to himself to contact Steele. So, what was he doing with Lisa Page, Peter Strzok and Joe Pientka? What was this DOJ official doing and why was this not disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court? I think those are the most essential questions that need to be answered.",

Earlier today, President Trump's attorney rejected interview terms from team Mueller and rightfully so, we'll explain. Now, this to me is an obvious perjury trap being set by partisan investigators. In moments, Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney will be here with reaction. And also tonight, more major breaking news surrounding the deep state go-between Bruce Ohr, how the plot thickens tonight even much more than before. And The Hill's John Solomon unearth texts showing that former foreign spy Christopher Steele desperately trying to infiltrate and actually influence Mueller's ongoing investigation. New information. He actually used Bruce Ohr's connections to Christopher Steele. This is so much worse than we have known up to this point. We'll explain all of that coming up, and new developments surrounding WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Will he finally be interviewed here in the U.S. about the 2016 election hacking, and what evidence might have? All of that, plus, we cover the president's tough new sanctions against Russia. Oh, I thought he was compromised. And, of course, comrade De Blasio, the mayor of New York City, he has a beef apparently with us here at Fox News. And its day seven of Paul Manafort's trial of the century and a bizarre, horrifying story about a recently arrested Islamic extremist in New Mexico, another story out of Pennsylvania. All right. Busy night, busy news night. A lot to get into. Stay tuned, it's time for our breaking news opening monologue."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Mueller and his team of partisan investigators, they want to face off with the president of the United States number but today President Trump's attorneys flatly rejected, rightly so, Mueller's interview terms. They have countered with a proposal of their own. In a statement, the attorney for President Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote",
      "utterance": "We are restating what we have been saying for months, it is time for the office of the special counsel to conclude its inquiry without further delay. Now, the former mayor is not predicting that the investigation could be over by September 1st. He will be right here on the show with more details in just a few moments. Without a doubt, President Trump should be aware. Now, Mueller, his merry band of anti-Trump deep state sycophants, Hillary Clinton, Obama, Democratic donors -- what's happening here, we all pretty much agree on -- they are laying a perjury trap for that president of the United States. Mueller should not get what he wants. The president, his attorney should not give in. The president should not sit down for an interview. Now, tonight, we have yet another example of just how corrupt and how flawed Mueller's witch hunt really is. According to a shocking new report tonight from \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, Christopher Steele, remember him? The former foreign spy responsible for the Clinton bought and paid for dossier? Oh, we now know he was also paid by your FBI, your dollars under Jim Comey while they were desperately trying to influence the ongoing counsel with the hunt into so-called Russian collusion and it gets worse. Bruce Ohr, the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, was trying to help Christopher Steele do it. This is months after Steele was fired for leaking. He got 11 payments from the FBI. On July 16th, 2016, before the election, Steele wrote to Ohr, quote: I spoke to my old colleagues last week. They assured me they would not stand in the way of our re-engagement with the bureau."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ohr texted back",
      "utterance": "I will pass along to my colleagues, thanks. And on November 18th, after the election, Trump won. Now, Mueller's witch hunt, by the way, was now underway. Christopher Steele writing: I am presuming you've heard nothing back from your special counsel colleagues on the issues you kindly put to them from me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And then Steele goes on to say",
      "utterance": "To say this is disappointing would be an understatement. Certain people have been willing to risk everything to engage with them in an effort to help them reach the truth. Now, yes, right, just like there's truth in that phony, unverified, uncorroborated, debunked dossier that the Clinton campaign used to smear then candidate Donald Trump, the same Russian lies that were used before the election as the foundation for the Mueller witch hunt and the op research used to mislead a FISA court on four, not one, but four separate occasions, four judges, so the government literally could spy on an opposition party candidate and Trump campaign associate. Now, meanwhile, according to a brand-new report from our own Sara Carter, a post-election 2016 handwritten document from Bruce Ohr listing the names of Strzok and Page and others in the FBI is also raising questions tonight about the extent of Ohr's communications with the bureau. And according to some other newly unearthed texts tonight, we are also learning he was concerned about the U.S. Senate's inquiry into the dirty dossier, probably because the contents were full of Russian lies and outright propaganda. And, by the way, he even said so himself, in an interrogatory. In England, he said it's raw intelligence. I have no idea if this is true, may be 50/50, really? Not only did he peddle his Clinton and FBI bought and paid for lies to you, the American people to sway an election. The bulk of that information that is false, Russian lies to get a FISA warrant as top officials, as I said, four separate times like the FISA court judges to spy on an opposition candidate. Then he turns around and tries to peddle his lies through Bruce Ohr. Remember, his wife Nellie -- well, she helped the build allies for Fusion GPS, the dossier. What did they do with it? They wanted to get it to Mueller post-election to destroy President Trump after the fact that they lost. They try to influence the election, it didn't work. Then they try to destroy the president. It is a national, disgusting, despicable disgrace, the biggest abuse of power by the top DOJ and FBI officials in this country, by the way, not rank and file. And according to Solomon's report -- we'll go back to that -- these communications between Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele, they were going on until late November 2017. That's more than a year after the FBI supposedly officially cut off all ties with Christopher Steele because he was leaking and lying about potentially classified information to the media again to peddle his lies to influence the outcome of our election. Now, this all comes on the heels of last night's shocking report that showed that Christopher Steele was working closely with Bruce Ohr before and after the 2016 election, again to spread the lies from his dirty dossier. He had no faith in those lies, throughout the highest levels of what is supposed to be our fair and unbiased justice system. Equal justice under the law, equal applications of the law. Now, at the time, Ohr, again, the fourth highest ranking member of Obama's Department of Justice, however, he has since been demoted because of his unethical ties to Steele and Fusion GPS. Now, Sara Carter, John Solomon, they will be joining us in a moment with more details. These are shocking new developments. It is far worse than we ever thought. But, first, we are also currently tracking another investigation into election hacking. Now, according to WikiLeaks, the Senate Intel Committee has now requested to interview WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Now, Senator Burr's office has not confirmed the request but if it's true, it's about time. After all, remember, WikiLeaks, they were the ones that actually released those hacked emails and unlike so many other so-called journalist here in America, we took the time, we went to England, we sat down and we interviewed Julian Assange right here on the show and on my radio show and he said to us then, no government actor was involved in the hacking. You might remember, take a look."

Tough new U.S. sanctions levied against Russia in response to an assassination attempt of a former British spy conducted with chemical or biological weapons. These new sanctions will be applied to all Russian state-owned businesses and will reportedly affect 70 percent of the Russian economy. Gee, I thought the president was compromised by Putin. That's what fake news tells us, or NBC News suggesting he might actually be a Russian agent, President Trump. Now, while the president makes serious policy decisions and as he's conducting consequential peace through strength diplomacy -- well, many on the far left, they are obsessing over ICE, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Now, as part of their grand plan to get open borders, many on the left want to band together and ban ICE altogether. Earlier this week, we sent Tomi Lahren to Portland, Oregon, to interview some of these anti-ICE activists. This is a small portion, take a look."

All right. Now, let's return to the horrific breaking story out of New Mexico. A father of a missing disabled 3-year-old son has been arrested at a squalid camp that is linked to Islamic extremists. Now, during this arrest, 11 children were found on this compound where it is believed weapons training was conducted. Now, with plans, of course, to use the children in future school shootings. The individual arrested was the son of a Brooklyn imam who was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center attack. Now, sadly, the remains of the young child were also found on this compound. A scary, tragic story we'll continue to follow. And we also have another topic to get to and it comes to us right here in New York City. Sorry, I pay high taxes, I'm stuck here. Far left mayor, comrade Bill de Blasio has a new favorite villain. They are looking at it right now. That's right. During a recent interview, comrade de Blasio blamed FOX News for dividing America. He tells \"The Guardian\", quote: If you could remove News Corp. from the last 25 years of American history we would be an entirely different place. Yes, that's true. We'd only have one opinion on the news, from the far left. A universal opinion because they're all a bunch of sheep, a utopian dream for comrade de Blasio. And like a true left wing extremist, well, comrade de Blasio detests diversity of thought. That's not good. Imagine 30 years without Rush? Oh, let's see, 30 years without talk radio? Twenty-three years without FOX News? All right. Finally tonight, our last topic covers day seven of the trial of the century, the 2005 tax and bank fraud charges against Paul Manafort. Remember, no collusion, has nothing to do with Donald Trump, nothing to do with the campaign, nothing to do with Russia. And while team Mueller is embarrassing themselves attempting to put the screws on Manafort as Judge Ellis said to get him to sing or compose against President Trump so they can impeach or prosecute him, well, it's Mueller's prosecutors who were actually feeling the heat from the presiding judge, T.S. Ellis III."

And meanwhile, Manafort's attorneys once again called out what is the questionable character of the star witness Rick Gates, pointing out that he had up to four extramarital affairs on top of, oh, let's see, embezzlement, lying, extortion and could have faced if he didn't get the free -- get out of jail free card from Mueller, could have faced 290 years in jail. Wow, all for 290 years in jail or say something about this guy. I think I'll take the jail. I don't think so. Now, as always, we'll continue to update you on this trial conducted by Mueller's team of witch hunters. This has absolutely zero to do with Russia, nothing to do with collusion, nothing to do with the campaign, nothing to do with Trump. 2005, put the squares to him so he sings or composes. All right. Back to our breaking news story tonight. Joining us from \"The Hill\", John Solomon, and FOX News investigative reporter, contributor, Sara Carter. John, we'll begin with you.

      "utterance": "Yes. No, it is. I think the bottom line is simple though. Months after Christopher Steele was discredited and terminated by the FBI because he has leaked to the media, a major violation of human source intelligence rules, there was an effort underway by him with his buddy Bruce Ohr, at that time a top deputy to Rod Rosenstein, to try to get him back into the FBI's good graces and possibly get him working, reengaged it says is the word used in this emails with special counsel Mueller. Now, it doesn't appear in these things that we can prove they ever got to Mueller, but the mere fact that a senior Justice Department official was trying to get a discredited partisan intelligence source back on to the case tells you all you need to know about this case. This is not the way counterintelligence is normally done in the FBI. Career people that sources carefully, they manage them carefully. They double and triple check their authenticity and their accuracy. Here, we turned a blind eye to their partisanship, to their inaccuracy and their documents, and we are still trying to get them in the investigation a year later. That is what's wrong with this FBI investigation. And this episode is one of the strongest -- strongest parts-- the FBI is talking to Bruce Ohr, they know this is going on. Someone has to come clean in the FBI and describe --"

Now, they are trying to use post-election notes from Strzok and Page, have many lawmakers, and investigators, and other documents, FBI had a back channel investigation, they never revealed. Tell us what you found."

      "utterance": "Well, they never revealed it to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and this is essential, Sean, because they violated it. They withheld exculpatory evidence that the judges should have known about. Also, the documents reveal something very important. These are law enforcement sensitive documents. These are memos written by Bruce Ohr himself and on November 21st, he apparently either met with or spoke with Lisa Page. Remember, she is general counsel for former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. She also with Peter Strzok, her paramour, lover. And so, when you look at all of this and Joe Pientka, who was an FBI agent, the same one that interviewed General Michael Flynn with Peter Strzok. This is so important because in that note to himself, basically that memorandum, he also mentioned Paul Manafort, that they were moving forward against Paul Manafort. And that's essential here, because he couldn't move forward against Trump. They could move forward against Manafort but he did note, I would contact Christopher Steele. He basically noted to himself to contact Steele. So, what was he doing with Lisa Page, Peter Strzok and Joe Pientka? What was this DOJ official doing and why was this not disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court? I think those are the most essential questions that need to be answered."

In other words, there were the top people at the FBI, we can go to Comey, we can go to the deputy FBI director who has been fired and may ultimately end up being indicted. And then we've got Strzok, and then we got Page, and then we got -- all of this going on. Now, Bruce Ohr and Nelly Ohr which are -- they seem to be much more involved than we knew up until this point. Explain how this was all about defeating Trump and then destroying Trump."

This was about either destroying Trump, before he could be -- you know, the president of the United States, ruining him before there was even an opportunity, and if he did become president, which he did, taking down a duly elected president. That is what they were working for, that is what they continued to do and that is what they were semi-successful, at because what they got, the end result -- Comey got it when they appointed special counsel Robert Mueller based on this evidence. And they also got it with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

And I wonder where is the sense of justice on the part of Mueller, on the part of the Justice Department. After all, the Justice Department -- this is a Justice Department investigation. He is working for Rosenstein. And at some point, you've got to say the irregularities, the unethical conduct --"

Look, he's got plenty of time to either decide -- we offered him an opportunity to do a form of questioning. He can say yes or no. We can do it. If he doesn't want to do it, he knows the answers to every question that he wants to ask. He's going to ask them, did you tell Comey to go easy on Flynn? The president will say no I didn't. Hey, Bob, you know it. Why do you want to get him under oath? Do you think we're fools? You want to get him under oath because you want to trap him into perjury.

Previously deported immigrant from Honduras raped a child after Philadelphia authorities ignored ICE detainers and released him. Plead guilty to illegal entry. Anyway, it goes back to this particular man, Juan Ramon Vasquez, 45. Anyway, he faced a couple years in prison and was deported from the U.S. in 2009. Back in the country in March of 2014, taken into custody. Then after local criminal charges against him were dropped, Philadelphia officials did not comply with a detainer by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He was released. After his release he was rearrested and convicted for the rape of a child, and unlawful sexual contact with a minor. Isn't that about Philly's decision to disregard ICE detainers like Andrew Cuomo just talked about? Couldn't that be -- couldn't that have been prevented?"

      "utterance": "It could have been prevented and it should have been prevented. We owe the American people better. I mean, this is a perfect example of when jurisdictions decide not to cooperate with federal law enforcement we put our communities at risk. I mean, what that required was that the men and women of DHS go back into community at their own risk and the risk of the community where the criminal is to try to re-interdict and detain that person."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yes. As one person said he got a free pass from the city of Philadelphia and its Department of Prisons headed straight back into our community, committed a heinous crime. He never would have had the chance to commit had the city of Philadelphia complied with the ICE detainer. This is happening much more than people know. How many times a year -- how often is this happening? We have them, we know they are here illegally, we know they violated laws and then cities don't cooperate and then they get released and then commit other crimes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIELSEN",
      "utterance": "It does. The good news is that we continue to increase our prosecution and our removal of criminal aliens, dangerous criminal aliens. But you are absolutely right. The only way this works to protect our country is if we can get back to a place where law enforcement works with law enforcement."

And I'm told even though we know these drones are coming from Mexico, we can do nothing to take them out of the sky unless we get a warrant. Now the problem with that would obviously be if we get the warrant, the drones are back in Mexico. Is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIELSEN",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not -- it's not just that, but let's face it, when we are talking about the technology we have today, these drones can fly up to 100 miles per hour so the concept of using an antiquated law to get a warrant to stop a nefarious drone is ridiculous. So we've been working really hard with Congress, there is bipartisan legislation that's been introduced in both Houses, but Congress has got to act. I need the authorities now to protect the homeland. This is not a question of if, it's a question of when."
