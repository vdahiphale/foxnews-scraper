This entire week while President Trump is abroad, we're going to be covering every step of this historic journey. And we are your one stop shop for the pageantry, the politics and of course the best analysis. And of course, some protests as well. This will culminate with my exclusive interview with the President this Thursday at the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion in Normandy. On tonight's special broadcast, we're going to talk exclusively with the leader of the UK Brexit Party, Nigel Farage is here in the studio. He stayed up for us in just moments. Plus, Congressman Devin Nunes will update us on his request for President Trump to push the outgoing UK PM on British Intel's involvement in that phony dossier. Will he do it? Ben Shapiro also here to react to the media and Facebook joining forces to destroy the life of an African American Trump supporter. You will not believe this story. The supposed intolerant class reveals itself again. And pollster Frank Luntz is here. Raymond Arroyo is here, we are jam packed. So, you want to stay for the entire hour. And by the way, the Democrat convention in San Francisco over the weekend, this was a scene and a sight to behold. We'll get to all of that and a World War II vet reminds us why D-Day was so important. But first, the resistance has a royal hissy fit. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE  The soggy weather held off and the sun even broke through today here in London, as President Trump kicked off his three-day state visit to one of America's oldest and strongest allies. Well, the pomp and circumstance that only the British monarchy can summon was truly a sight to behold. And the fact that things went so smoothly clearly irritated the media elites at home and abroad.",

      "sentences": "Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader is actually not only did he not go to the dinner tonight at Buckingham Palace, but he's going to take part in tomorrow's protest. So, he's joining the anti-Trump and I would say in many ways anti-American protests here in Britain. Classy. But England, let's face it, it's such a beautiful place, it's a special place for Americans for so many reasons. But watching the economy here, the Brexit politics and the turmoil, I have to say it makes me appreciate our system of government here in the United States even with all of its flaws. You know why? Because it's responsive compared to the system of government here, much more responsive to the will of the people.  Think about this, over the past two years, the dominant parties in the UK including the conservatives, they tried to sweep the concerns of the working-class people onto the rug. Well, and how did that work out for them? Well, an enfeebled Theresa May couldn't get a real Brexit done despite that referendum mandate from her people. So, now she's done. And meanwhile Nigel Farage's Brexit party formed just two months ago was the top vote getter in British EU elections.  The timing of Trump's appearance here with all of the Regal traffics could not have come at a better time. It's a reminder of what's possible when leaders heed the call of their people. Trump alone has stood against the tide of climate hysteria, burden tax - burdensome taxes and regulations and unresponsive international bureaucracies.  He's supporting Brexit, not because he wants to gratuitously meddle in the British people's affairs, but because he knows an independent Britain truly independent will be a better trading partner with the U.S. and in the end, it will lead to a stronger America, a stronger Britain and a stronger alliance. And I've got to tell you outside of the big cities like London, New York et cetera. People liked the fact that Trump is mixing it up. He's refusing to be intimidated by the so-called expert, because I think they've had enough of all these smooth talking people who screwed things up for the working class people in the first place and mayor Sadiq Khan and others, well they prefer a docile American President who nods in agreement when the U.S. is getting the short end of the stick. Well, that aren't Trump. And those days are not coming back anytime soon. And there is a lesson for the UK and the world to learn from the Trump approach, even though they might not want to admit it.   He promised to Make America Great Again and the country responded. Our economy is now the envy of the world. And just look at steel manufacturing, our steel companies were ravaged by Chinese dumping practices. But Trump fought back and said no more. Now many are revived and beginning to thrive again. Yet here in Britain their last major steel company is about to go out of business. Think about this. A central NATO power will no longer be capable of producing its own steel. No worries mate, because the experts say it will work out just fine. Well, it will. When you fight back and rebuild your own industries, it may be only June 3rd, but it feels a lot like July 4th here in England. Trump is reminding our cousins that a nation that is not truly sovereign and free won't be a nation for long. True strength and broad-based prosperity will only come to a nation that is independent and sovereign. And for those who bristle at Trump's brashness, I say get over it.  The resistance won't admit it, but he's getting results for the people back home. And if Britain rejects the false promise of globalism and listens to their people, they can be great again too. And that's The Angle. All right, joining me now is Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit party and a Fox News Contributor. Nigel, first of all thank you for being with us. It's 3 AM plus here in Britain and Nigel was great enough to be here. So, why does this trip by President Trump matter so much at this moment with everything your country has gone through with this new quest for independence.",

We voted to leave. We voted for independence. We've had three years of our government; our Parliament try to stop this from happening. So, right now, we have an American President arriving. Yes, sure. Some people find it brash.  But here's the point. An American President who made some promises back in 2016, who was doing his utmost to put those promises into practice and the contrast of that with a government that made promises that it's denying to the people. So, actually his voice at this moment in time is very, very important. And you'll notice, there is a growing respect for the President in this country. Sure, there'll be protests and all the rest of it. But I think the argument that sovereignty matters, the argument that nations need to be free to be proud. Yes, he's here at a good time.  INGRAHAM: I want to play something. This is from CNN International, which I was forced to watch at my hotel, because there is no Fox News.",

Shawn Brooks admits he's part of the politics Watchdog group, but on Facebook in capital letters he wrote quote, I did not create the video nor did I posted to the politics Watchdog page, adding quote Facebook was taking heat for not taking down the video, so they made me the scapegoat, which was the final piece for The Daily Beast to throw me under the bus. Brooks is now considering a lawsuit and some other journalists are slamming The Daily Beast, Yashar Ali who writes for the liberal Huffington Post in New York said, it sets a really bad precedent when a private citizen particularly someone who is working a blue-collar job has their identity publicly revealed simply because they made a video of a politician appearing to be drunk.

Plus, Congressman Devin Nunes will update us on his request for President Trump to push the outgoing UK PM on British Intel's involvement in that phony dossier. Will he do it? Ben Shapiro also here to react to the media and Facebook joining forces to destroy the life of an African American Trump supporter. You will not believe this story. The supposed intolerant class reveals itself again. And pollster Frank Luntz is here. Raymond Arroyo is here, we are jam packed. So, you want to stay for the entire hour.

He oppresses Christians and he jails dissidents and by the way the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square is today. But Trump, the global threat for this guy. Oh my gosh.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader is actually not only did he not go to the dinner tonight at Buckingham Palace, but he's going to take part in tomorrow's protest. So, he's joining the anti-Trump and I would say in many ways anti-American protests here in Britain. Classy. But England, let's face it, it's such a beautiful place, it's a special place for Americans for so many reasons. But watching the economy here, the Brexit politics and the turmoil, I have to say it makes me appreciate our system of government here in the United States even with all of its flaws. You know why? Because it's responsive compared to the system of government here, much more responsive to the will of the people. Think about this, over the past two years, the dominant parties in the UK including the conservatives, they tried to sweep the concerns of the working-class people onto the rug. Well, and how did that work out for them? Well, an enfeebled Theresa May couldn't get a real Brexit done despite that referendum mandate from her people. So, now she's done. And meanwhile Nigel Farage's Brexit party formed just two months ago was the top vote getter in British EU elections. The timing of Trump's appearance here with all of the Regal traffics could not have come at a better time. It's a reminder of what's possible when leaders heed the call of their people. Trump alone has stood against the tide of climate hysteria, burden tax - burdensome taxes and regulations and unresponsive international bureaucracies.  He's supporting Brexit, not because he wants to gratuitously meddle in the British people's affairs, but because he knows an independent Britain truly independent will be a better trading partner with the U.S. and in the end, it will lead to a stronger America, a stronger Britain and a stronger alliance. And I've got to tell you outside of the big cities like London, New York et cetera. People liked the fact that Trump is mixing it up. He's refusing to be intimidated by the so-called expert, because I think they've had enough of all these smooth talking people who screwed things up for the working class people in the first place and mayor Sadiq Khan and others, well they prefer a docile American President who nods in agreement when the U.S. is getting the short end of the stick. Well, that aren't Trump. And those days are not coming back anytime soon. And there is a lesson for the UK and the world to learn from the Trump approach, even though they might not want to admit it. He promised to Make America Great Again and the country responded. Our economy is now the envy of the world. And just look at steel manufacturing, our steel companies were ravaged by Chinese dumping practices. But Trump fought back and said no more. Now many are revived and beginning to thrive again. Yet here in Britain their last major steel company is about to go out of business. Think about this. A central NATO power will no longer be capable of producing its own steel. No worries mate, because the experts say it will work out just fine. Well, it will. When you fight back and rebuild your own industries, it may be only June 3rd, but it feels a lot like July 4th here in England. Trump is reminding our cousins that a nation that is not truly sovereign and free won't be a nation for long. True strength and broad-based prosperity will only come to a nation that is independent and sovereign. And for those who bristle at Trump's brashness, I say get over it.  The resistance won't admit it, but he's getting results for the people back home. And if Britain rejects the false promise of globalism and listens to their people, they can be great again too. And that's The Angle. All right, joining me now is Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit party and a Fox News Contributor. Nigel, first of all thank you for being with us. It's 3 AM plus here in Britain and Nigel was great enough to be here. So, why does this trip by President Trump matter so much at this moment with everything your country has gone through with this new quest for independence."

We voted to leave. We voted for independence. We've had three years of our government; our Parliament try to stop this from happening. So, right now, we have an American President arriving. Yes, sure. Some people find it brash. But here's the point. An American President who made some promises back in 2016, who was doing his utmost to put those promises into practice and the contrast of that with a government that made promises that it's denying to the people. So, actually his voice at this moment in time is very, very important. And you'll notice, there is a growing respect for the President in this country. Sure, there'll be protests and all the rest of it. But I think the argument that sovereignty matters, the argument that nations need to be free to be proud.

And you know, I've discussed the Royal Family, I've discussed the Queen with Donald Trump, his mother of course was born in Scotland. She had a great reverence for the Queen as does Trump.

Then Kevin Poulsen, a reporter for the liberal Daily Beast posted on Twitter quoting, I went looking for the Russian troll behind the drunk Pelosi viral video hoax. Turns out, he's an itinerant forklift operator from the Bronx who has been secretly running hard right news outlets across social media for years. Also, not Russian. Poulsen's article that identified the man as Shawn Brooks and doxed him making his personal information public including hometown, employment history, social media footprint even noted that he was on probation. Shawn Brooks admits he's part of the politics Watchdog group, but on Facebook in capital letters he wrote quote, I did not create the video nor did I posted to the politics Watchdog page, adding quote Facebook was taking heat for not taking down the video, so they made me the scapegoat, which was the final piece for The Daily Beast to throw me under the bus. Brooks is now considering a lawsuit and some other journalists are slamming The Daily Beast, Yashar Ali who writes for the liberal Huffington Post in New York said, it sets a really bad precedent when a private citizen particularly someone who is working a blue-collar job has their identity publicly revealed simply because they made a video of a politician appearing to be drunk. For those supporting The Daily Beast, Glenn Greenwald writes the justification being offered by rank closing journalists to justify a major media outlet having investigated, doxed and exposed in anonymous day laborer for the crime of posting a mocking video of Nancy Pelosi are almost more repugnant than the journalistic bullying itself.

The fact that Facebook handed over the information is truly incredible.

His day labors. We haven't independently confirmed every detail about him, but it sounds like the guy doesn't have a lot. And so, they make him a scapegoat. But this is a warning shot, is it not Ben. They try to go after this program. They go after other programs go after other websites demonize them, to silence them especially when they're beaten in the ratings night after night. OK, so but that's really what this is all about.  SHAPIRO: There's no question. I mean the fact that the Left, the media Left are intent on destroying all opposition all the way down to some random guy who drives a forklift and posted a funny video of Nancy Pelosi. It just shows how vile and angry the Left has become about taking out people who oppose them in any way. I mean this is just the ultimate example of that, but as you mentioned obviously everybody who is in the conservative media has become a target for the Left and the Left will go out of its way to destroy anybody for virtually any reason so long as they do this. I mean Craig Ferguson back in the 2000s put up a video of George W. Bush slurring his words, called him drunk and nobody cared, because everybody understood that it was just a silly video. You have a random forklift driver who does this about Nancy Pelosi and all hell breaks loose. Bette Midler today posted a brand-new face. It's a complete piece of fake news about Donald Trump, a fake quote from him talking about how he was going to sucker the Republican Party. She posted that I'm very much looking forward to seeing whether the media investigate her and start revealing her personal details about her life because she had the temerity to post a piece of news that wasn't true."

And he's here to give us an update on whether he expects those questions to be posed, Ranking Member of the Intel Committee Devin Nunez live from Washington tonight.

We're trying to get our hands on that document. We haven't been able to get it. So, imagine that, that if the Obama administration was notified about Steele's credibility, and that wasn't actually turned over to the Trump administration. So the president is aware of this, I believe. He wants these questions answered. I'm not sure that he will bring them up with May because she's on her way out.

And that is that supposedly there are four meetings that took place between FBI investigators and the Clinton folks.  Now, remember, every time an FBI investigator meets with someone, they're supposed to put together a 302, right? So it's one of these reports. What we are learning, we don't have it for sure, but what we understand is that there were four meetings with zero, zero reports.

How much money do you make? A clear question that has been in some form on the census one way or another for many, many decades, has been a question about whether or not you're a citizen. So I think for those of us who are policymakers here in Washington, wouldn't it be good to know whether or not somebody is a citizen or not a citizen?"

And we were loading up the mules when the word came down that the war was over. It was just complete silence. Nobody talked to anybody. I think they all had their own thing going on. When I came to, more or less, the first thing I did, I went to see the man who had been loading up the mules. And I think I started crying. It's over. You guys don't have to do what you did before. It's over."

There are not many of these veterans left.  This will be the last major anniversary to celebrate. I remember when Reagan in 1984 did the famous -- the boys -- they took the clip."

Here she is back in 1951 just a few months before being crowned Queen with President Truman. And here she is with President Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Gerald Ford.  President Trump explained the bond of unity between the U.K. and the U.S. tonight."
