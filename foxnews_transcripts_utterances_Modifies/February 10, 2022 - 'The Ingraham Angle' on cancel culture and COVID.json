But I think they're running into a brick wall of common sense, especially among young minorities. Biden's favorability among black voters dropped 10 points through 2021, according to the recent figures from Democrat pollsters. And it's even worse among Black Americans under the age of 35. Their support for Biden fell 25 points by the end of last year. I think most sensible people out there know that the American dream is still out there for people of all races. Most of us know the game that's being played here. The race card is not the only one of the left's go-to weapons of choice against an America they've grown to despise, but it's also a tool of distraction from their myriad policy failures. The fact is, for decades now, Democrats have spectacularly failed, failed the very people they claim to be helping with all this racial hectoring. The demands for reparations, their moves to remake school curricula, and of course remake the workplace culture only breed more resentment and division. So you must never apologize to those who play with racial accelerants. The NFL gets sued for supposedly racist hiring practices. And they rush to meet with Al Sharpton of all people, one of the most corrosive forces on the planet. Sharpton is now moved from defund the police to defund the NFL.",

And since their poles are in the gutter, they're going to resort to even more outlandish race baiting. And no amount of apologies or donations will ever be enough. It never is. Heck, even after Joe Rogan apologized for racially insensitive past remarks, the vultures still swept in for more talents of flesh. The cultural Marxists getting rich off crying racism, they don't care what you said or what you did 10 years ago, five years ago, 30 years ago. They just want more money and they want more power. A fat book contract may be, a lucrative visiting professorship, and a lifetime job guarantee anywhere they go. Because if you ever fire or discipline them, naturally they're going to scream racism. This atmosphere of eggshell walking and nonstop racial recriminations drives people to their individual corners. It breeds distrust. It separates us. But then again, that's the whole point, isn't it? The left doesn't want us to get closer to each other. They only thrive when we're at each other's throats. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Vince Everett Ellison, author of the new book '25 Lies'; and Amala Ekpunobi, PragerU personality. Vince, how insulting is this whole racket to you personally? VINCE EVERETT ELLISON, \"25 LIES\" AUTHOR: Well, Laura, your mama law was straight up. I mean, it was right on the money. The declarative statement in my new book '25 Lies'. I started by saying, Since its inception in 1800, because of slavery, the Confederacy and Jim Crow, the Democratic Party has been the evilest institution on the face of this earth. And this is why. It's because they lie. They say that racism is the cause of all of our problems. That is a lie. People that believe in white supremacy must also believe in black inferiority. You can't have both of them. And as a black man, I can tell you, I don't believe in white supremacy. Because it's an era of Jesus Christ, and the Son of God. I have never met anyone superior to me. I have brothers and sisters. They all have talents. And that's all I mean, good people with talents, given to them by God that we try - that we have to elevate. And if we elevate each other's talents, we all elevate each other. The whole - all of society becomes elevated. But the Democrats want hatred. They want envy, they want strike. They live on it. They've always had it from slavery, Civil War, Jim Crow, now socialism. They want us to hate one another, and they live off of the hate. And this is why I call them an evil institution. You know, my book talked about 25 lies that they give, they talk about the evil. It talks about what they do wrong, and talk about how they drive all of us against one another. And this is just another example. This is racial propaganda.",

Specifically here in California, progressive policy has been the bane of the existence of lower income people in the communities of color in this state. So you have to look at the results here. I'm hearing a whole lot of talk about racism. And what that does is, it takes away from the true hearts of these issues, like class, like two- parent households, like resources, like education.

And then they share that information with intelligence officers and inspectors and investigators to investigate me as to the language on that whiteboard. And then they confront a staffer with it.

But I think they're running into a brick wall of common sense, especially among young minorities. Biden's favorability among black voters dropped 10 points through 2021, according to the recent figures from Democrat pollsters. And it's even worse among Black Americans under the age of 35. Their support for Biden fell 25 points by the end of last year. I think most sensible people out there know that the American dream is still out there for people of all races. Most of us know the game that's being played here. The race card is not the only one of the left's go-to weapons of choice against an America they've grown to despise, but it's also a tool of distraction from their myriad policy failures. The fact is, for decades now, Democrats have spectacularly failed, failed the very people they claim to be helping with all this racial hectoring. The demands for reparations, their moves to remake school curricula, and of course remake the workplace culture only breed more resentment and division. So you must never apologize to those who play with racial accelerants. The NFL gets sued for supposedly racist hiring practices.

Heck, even after Joe Rogan apologized for racially insensitive past remarks, the vultures still swept in for more talents of flesh. The cultural Marxists getting rich off crying racism, they don't care what you said or what you did 10 years ago, five years ago, 30 years ago. They just want more money and they want more power.

Joining me now is Vince Everett Ellison, author of the new book '25 Lies'; and Amala Ekpunobi, PragerU personality. Vince, how insulting is this whole racket to you personally? VINCE EVERETT ELLISON, \"25 LIES\" AUTHOR: Well, Laura, your mama law was straight up. I mean, it was right on the money. The declarative statement in my new book '25 Lies'. I started by saying, Since its inception in 1800, because of slavery, the Confederacy and Jim Crow, the Democratic Party has been the evilest institution on the face of this earth. And this is why. It's because they lie. They say that racism is the cause of all of our problems. That is a lie. People that believe in white supremacy must also believe in black inferiority. You can't have both of them. And as a black man, I can tell you, I don't believe in white supremacy. Because it's an era of Jesus Christ, and the Son of God. I have never met anyone superior to me. I have brothers and sisters. They all have talents. And that's all I mean, good people with talents, given to them by God that we try - that we have to elevate. And if we elevate each other's talents, we all elevate each other. The whole - all of society becomes elevated. But the Democrats want hatred. They want envy, they want strike. They live on it. They've always had it from slavery, Civil War, Jim Crow, now socialism. They want us to hate one another, and they live off of the hate. And this is why I call them an evil institution. You know, my book talked about 25 lies that they give, they talk about the evil. It talks about what they do wrong, and talk about how they drive all of us against one another.

Specifically here in California, progressive policy has been the bane of the existence of lower income people in the communities of color in this state. So you have to look at the results here. I'm hearing a whole lot of talk about racism. And what that does is, it takes away from the true hearts of these issues, like class, like two- parent households, like resources, like education.

He brought us out of poverty. And after college, I started working in a prison. I know the Democratic Party very, very well. They run every crack house, every prostitute house, every failing school. Every big city mayor, every big city police chief, every judge, NGO, lots of black men is run by the Democratic Party. If you don't believe me, go to any ghetto in America and walk around it. See if you see any white Republicans anywhere. You're going to run into black Democrats all over the place. And you're going to run into most black preachers, most black politicians and most black civic organizers, and they're the ones that are doing the conduit - they're the conduits for the Democratic Party. This is them. This is the Democratic Party. And all they do is foment hate. That's what they do, and they live off of it. But black people aren't crazy. They understand. The know Bible when Cain was angry, because God had rejected his offering. He said, If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if not, sin lies at the door to master you. But you must master it.

And we really have to deviate from that, because it's a disservice to everybody who learns this sort of ideology. There are young children now being taught in school, that their race matters more than who they are as an individual, what their interests are, what their dislikes are, their merit, their character. And if we continue on this route, we're going to have a generation that is completely crippled by this narrative. Who cares what color your emojis are? And you should question anybody who looks at you and tries to convince you of your own victimhood. And you should ask, what do they get from me being convinced of this?

The intelligence in the section of the Capitol Police knew that the Capitol was going to be the target on January 6. They knew the extremist groups were going to be there. They knew that individuals had maps, that there was going to be violence and disruption. And they held on to that intelligence and it wasn't shared. And I said, Laura, to the people that that January 6 should have never happened. The Capitol Police had the intelligence. They didn't share it. And they just kept it to themselves and I've been very vocal about that. I've also been very vocal about the death of Ashley Babbitt. I mean, the officer that killed Ashli Babbitt, Lieutenant Byrd. They conducted a very quick investigation, way too quick. And it never even went to a grand jury. So no, I believe that that Nancy recognizes that I'm a law enforcement officer for 30 years, a share for aid. And I've conducted investigations before.

And then they share that information with intelligence officers and inspectors and investigators to investigate me as to the language on that whiteboard. And then they confront a staffer with it. I have a young staffer there. He answers the door. And here you have three special agents that look like the Gestapo, asking him questions about the content on my whiteboard.

And we're talking about over a million dollars in trades a year, sometimes more than that. And as you said, she's grown very rich by using her position.

The truth is, she's been dealing for herself. She has been enriching herself for years in her long, seemingly endless time in the United States Congress. And she's never wanted to actually put any limits on it. She's never wanted to be accountable. And now, her record has finally caught up with her.

By the way, people like Cori Bush, they have private security that they use, that they hide behind, while they deny public funding for police, to folks who can't afford private security. So that's the real issue here that I think is at so much of the heart of this. And this is, by the way, a Democrat Party that, as they want to defund the police, as they want to take away protection for working people, they are also giving crackpipes to criminals using taxpayer dollars.

My next guest was so enraged by the COVID mandates at her kid's school in deep blue Manhattan, she decided to run for office. Joining me now is Maud Maron, New York congressional candidate who is running to unseat Democrat Carolyn Maloney. Maud, now, Governor Hochul, who Tucker likes to remind us, was not elected to anything, she will roll back mask mandates, she said, but only for businesses, not for these poor children. Your reaction?"

      "speaker": "MAUD MARON, (D) NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "It makes absolutely no sense. It is -- it's really -- everyone now knows and accepts the fact the children are at the least risk from COVID, so children should not be bearing the harshest restrictions, which they have been doing in New York City and other cities across the country. We should have started with, well over a year ago, normalizing life for our kids, which would have meant opening schools properly last year, taking the masks off, getting them back into extracurricular activities. and we've done just the opposite in New York City."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The kids should never have been out of school, maybe for a couple of days, but we pretty much knew the truth about this virus and kids from Italy's experience in the spring of 2020. But nevertheless, Governor Hochul has a rationale."

      "speaker": "GOV. KATHY HOCHUL, (D) NEW YORK",
      "utterance": "Kids are in a very concentrated setting, and also adults can make their own decisions. Children still need adults to look out for their health. This is all about looking out for the health of our children. And parents will be reassured to know that we protect them."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Maud, I guess adults get to make decisions for kids, but not their parents. What?"

    {
      "speaker": "MARON",
      "utterance": "It makes no sense. I dined out -- it makes no sense. I was in a restaurant a few nights ago in New York for a long and lovely meal that I enjoyed, and I sat there unmasked for about three hours with people who are younger than me, with people who are older than me, because that's possible for adults in New York. It should certainly be possible for my five-year- old who is in kindergarten and who wants to play with his friends in the school yard during recess."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Maud, you're a Democrat running to unseat --"

      "utterance": "I am certainly am."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "-- a Democrat incumbent. I want to get away, if we can, from even doing red and blue states, because I think a lot of policies really are just about common sense. Like what works, what doesn't work. What's efficient, what's not efficient. And this is one of those issues that I think blurs all political lines, or at least it should. Is it impossible in New York to unseat these incumbent dinosaurs? How hard is that going to be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARON",
      "utterance": "Where I live in New York, it is often a choice between which Democrat you want to vote for, because of the numbers of registered Democrats and Republicans in our district. I am running because I'm mad. I'm mad that the long time Democrats in Congress are not looking out for families like mine. I'm running because I'm worried we're heading into the third year of COVID restrictions on our children, and our cities are getting less safe while our schools are closed. Those are not policies that work for families. And I'm running because I know that I'm not alone. I talk to parents all over the city throughout my district and beyond, Democrats and Republicans, who have the exact same concerns and the exact same worries about how to get our city back on track and make it work for families."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Do your mom friends, a lot of them are quite liberal, do they also have concerns about pushing this vaccine on five-year-olds and below? We had a doctor on last night, Dr. McCullough, who said absolutely no way. That was what he said about the vaccines for the kids."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARON",
      "utterance": "I've been pretty public about my vaccine position. I'm vaccinated. My older children are vaccinated. I think there is, that there's really good data that supports vaccinations being useful for reducing hospitalizations. But where I come down on is it's a parent's decision. And with young kids, there just really isn't robust data. And I think reasonable people can come to different conclusions, and there is no reason why that decision should be in the hands of politicians, certainly not politicians in an election season."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Maud, we've got to roll, but I think it's fascinating that you're taking on this challenge. We'll be following it closely. The Last Bite next."

      "utterance": "Basically, the bottom half of the workforce doing a lot better relative to inflation than the top half. It's the highly paid who are seeing a big lag behind prices."
