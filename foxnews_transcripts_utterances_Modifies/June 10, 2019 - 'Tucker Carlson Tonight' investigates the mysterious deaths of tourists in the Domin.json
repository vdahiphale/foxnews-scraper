Now, an American baseball legend is in the hospital tonight. Even Fox's own news crew has come under attack. This show was on the ground for an exclusive joint investigation into what is happening there. A live report from the DR just minutes away. But first tonight, you probably didn't read about it over the weekend, but it looks like the President's recent brinksmanship with Mexico actually worked. A week and a half ago, the President threatened to impose tariffs on all goods coming across our southern border until the Mexican government joins us to fight illegal immigration. Migration they had been abetting for years. Well, on Friday, they got the message and caved.  The Mexican government will now deploy 6,000 troops along its southern border with Guatemala and going forward, certain asylum seekers will wait in Mexico rather than in the U.S. until their cases are resolved. Now, none of that is going to solve our illegal immigration crisis, but it is, at least potentially a big help and you think every American would be happy about it, but no.  Democratic Presidential candidates spent the weekend complaining about the deal and taking Mexico's side. Watch.",

      "sentences": "So how do you even respond to a statement like that? Maybe, it's best to ignore it? But if you take three steps back, what do you conclude from rhetoric like this? Well you'll probably assume the Democratic Party loves immigrants. But you'd be wrong. They don't.  To the Democratic Party, immigrants are just a means to an end, and of course the end is always the same -- power. When immigrants to this country become pro-American and call for following our laws, as many do, by the way, the left turns on them, too.  It happens a lot. It is happening right now to a Gwinnett college professor called Fang Zhou. Zhou is a legal immigrant from China. He loves the United States. He strongly opposes illegal immigration here.  For that, activists are demanding that he be fired from his job. Professor Zhou is not giving in, in fact, tomorrow night, he will join us on this show. But the Democratic Party doesn't want more immigrants like Fang Zhou. They are very clear about that. They want immigration that is based on family ties, anything but merit. Why?  Because for the Democratic Party, the more desperate, the less skilled, the less educated a potential immigrant is, the easier to control, and therefore, the better, and that's why in the State of California right now, the government there is planning to spend hundreds of million dollars to provide free healthcare to illegal immigrants.   That of course, won't help the State of California. It won't help millions of hard-pressed middle class Californians, but that doesn't matter. Helping regular American has stopped being the agenda a long time ago. Douglas MacGregor is a retired U.S. Army Colonel and author of the book, \"Margin of Victory.\" He who joins us to assess.

But in the long run, this is not going to influence the crisis on the southern border, and for two very good reasons. First of all, Mexico has no interest in halting the flow of either illegal immigrants from its country or any other in Latin America into the United States. That's how they off-load excess population, discontented citizens and criminals on to the United States. They've been doing it for decades. So while they may be temporarily relieved, it will resume inevitably.   Secondly, Mexico is a narco state. We need to be honest about this. The place is ruled by six drug carters. These drug carters control the government. They control the institutions of governance. No one can move in that country without their permission. So ultimately, they have a permanent interest in keeping open borders. They have no interest whatsoever. They want to filter in people and they want to filter in drugs. You can't do that if you close the border, so for those two reasons, it has no future in the long run.  So whatever we get from this, it will be temporary. It's not as you say, a viable solution.",

Just a few decades ago, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were elected to high office from the State of California. Is that possible today? Absolutely not. It's impossible. Why? It's called demographic change. And right now, the largest ethnic minority in California is Mexican and Hispanic. California is in the main today no longer a majority English- speaking white state. It is the main something else, it's something new, but largely Latino, largely Mexican.  The Latinos, the Mexicans are the base of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has decided they are the future for the left in the United States. The more of these people that can be brought in illegally as well as legally, the better it is for the Democratic Party because their goal is to transform the United States into a facsimile of California, so that any election is impossible from the standpoint of the right, for the standpoint of the Republican Party to win anything.",

And I can tell you that there's been a massive explosion of homeless people, not only here in Los Angeles, but San Francisco, especially. And I know you've covered that before.  What's bizarre about this, to me is look, we can all empathize with illegal immigrants. We can all empathize with immigrants. We can have a conversation about what the state should provide for the most needy, all of those things should be on the books. But part of what they're doing with this policy is they're going to tax citizens who do not have health insurance. They're going to tax legal citizens of this country who do not have health insurance to pay for these people's -- illegal people's insurance.  And it's only -- as you noted, it's only for poor, illegal immigrants, not of a certain age -- young people -- not for older people, sort of what they are saying, those people are more valuable than the elderly people are. I mean, it's just sort of a cacophony of conflicting viewpoints that it all sounds good, we all have one home, and all these things. And this is sort of what we've consistently seen the left doing over the last couple of years, just everything sort of seems like a rational position that's for poor people, for women, for black people, et cetera et cetera and most of it is just an excuse to give the state more power.",

We also know that a year ago, David Harrison died here at this very resort behind me. I spoke with his widow today, showed her the video. She said, it seems very mysterious. She wants answer. This comes on the heels of the three Americans that died at the end of May about an hour away in La Romana at the Bahia Principe. The woman from Pennsylvania, Miranda Shaup-Werner who died, went to the minibar as well, a Maryland couple that died mysteriously as well. Both resorts not giving us a statement saying they want to wait for a full investigation. We understand that the pathology and toxicology reports may be very significant with all these questions out there, Tucker, but really the island has been gripping the news of David Ortiz being shot.

But there are multiple reports here on the ground that foul play may be at work, that a drug lord, a local drug lord may have targeted the baseball star over another woman. We're going to try and find out a little bit more about that.  But then finally, just as a sort of reminder about how cautious we have to be when we travel outside of the country to a place like the Dominican Republic, when we were traveling last night between this resort and the other one where the three deaths happened, our fixer, our local producer who helps us with the local issues pulled off the side of the road to ask for directions.

It left from a heliport on the east side of Manhattan and 11 minutes into its flight, it crashed into the building. What caused this accident? We still do not know, but there was heavy rain at the time and heavy cloud cover and the investigation will continue. Witnesses say that they heard the engine, the building shake and they came out of the building, of course, a lot of PTSD in terms of people remembering the events of 9/11. Everybody looking up and initial report said that it was an aircraft hitting the building. So there were some tense moments here this afternoon and Tucker, we now know the identity of that pilot who died. His name is Tim McCormick. He spent 10 years as a volunteer firefighter in East Clinton, New York, a terrible tragedy for him. But this could have been much worse. Remarkably, there were no other injuries.

They should have long ago said this is what it means. This is -- you can't mandate that we impact the climate, but you can kill millions trying or pretending to try, but industry is very slow to that. Their lobbyists have a different constituency, the lobbyist constituencies are the Hill staff they work with, the regulators in the media. It's called the principal agent problem.

Now though a Canadian Federal Prison in Alberta is planning to open a supervised heroin injection site within the prison for prisoners. Government calls this a harm reduction facility, but of course, it is the opposite of that. It's a harm enabling facility. Instead of trying keep inmates from using heroin, which is smuggled in, prison officials have decided to tolerate in effect, to encourage it in the name of achieving some bogus safety. It is more proof that Canada's government has given up on its own citizens. Instead, they've decided to simply look on while there people degrade and destroy themselves in this spiral of addiction and death like euthanasia or late-term abortion, both of which Canada has. It's a sign that their society has become -- there's no other word for it - - suicidal, and if this practice comes here, and some without question will be pushing for it.

Not only did the jurors find that Oberlin College labeled Gibson's Bakery as racist, but found the emotional distress endured by the bakery and the Gibson family should be worth a pretty penny. This all stemmed from an incident in November 2016 where three black Oberlin students went into Gibson's Bakery, used a fake ID, stole some bottles of wine, and when they were confronted by the son of the bakery's owner, police say the students knocked him to the ground and punched him. The students initially claimed they were racially profiled, but later admitted there was no racism and a follow-up police investigation also found accusations of racism were baseless. But none of that stopped Oberlin College which has long been a bastion of liberal activism from declaring war on Gibson's including boycotts and protest involving hundreds of students chanting, \"No justice, no peace.\" The bakery also argued in court that college leaders used a bullhorn to orchestrate the protest and passed out flyers calling Gibson is a quote, \"racist establishment with a long account of racial profiling and discrimination.\" Remember, the business relationship between the college and the bakery goes back a hundred years. The college argue that all of the statements cited by the bakery's owners were protected speech. And the only reason the college temporarily stopped doing business with the bakery was to quell a violent situation.

Well, for many years, leftist billionaire George Soros has used his wealth to remake our society -- American society. His latest area focuses criminal justice. From Texas to Philadelphia, the State of Virginia, Soros has reportedly spent millions of dollars backing candidates for District Attorney, for prosecutor. Once elected, these candidates have tended to have ended cash bail, treated felonies like misdemeanors and sometimes ignored some crimes entirely. In the city of Philadelphia, for example, Soros backed Larry Krasner, and the murder rate there is the highest it has been in a decade. Krasner's main party, though was to get even softer on crime. Bill McSwain is U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and he joins us tonight. Mr. McSwain, thanks very much for coming on. So it's remarkable in a democracy that one man can have the ability to remake our justice system, but it sounds to some extent, that's what George Soros is doing. What are his priorities? What are his goals in doing this?",

And now the returns are in to a certain extent. Larry Krasner has been in office for about a year and a half, funded by Mr. Soros. And we can look at the data and we can see what has happened to Philadelphia. And as you said, homicides have skyrocketed, shootings have skyrocketed. The worst kinds of violent crime have really gone up. And in addition to that, some of the low level and the mid-level crimes have also gone up, but aren't being reported. And the reason they're not being reported is because the DA has said he is not going to prosecute them. So you have statistically a bad situation that has developed in Philadelphia, but actually, the reality on the ground is even worse than the statistics. And what Mr. Soros, I think wants to do is that he wants to implement his radical agenda, and he realizes that he can't do that through the normal democratic process. Normally, if you're going to try to get criminal justice reform, you have to do it through the legislature, you have to get broad public support for the kind of changes that you want to institute. He is taking what I would describe as an illegitimate, anti-democratic shortcut by trying to purchase DA elections. And then once the DA is in place, he or she doesn't enforce the law.

This show was on the ground for an exclusive joint investigation into what is happening there. A live report from the DR just minutes away. But first tonight, you probably didn't read about it over the weekend, but it looks like the President's recent brinksmanship with Mexico actually worked. A week and a half ago, the President threatened to impose tariffs on all goods coming across our southern border until the Mexican government joins us to fight illegal immigration. Migration they had been abetting for years. Well, on Friday, they got the message and caved. The Mexican government will now deploy 6,000 troops along its southern border with Guatemala and going forward, certain asylum seekers will wait in Mexico rather than in the U.S. until their cases are resolved. Now, none of that is going to solve our illegal immigration crisis, but it is, at least potentially a big help and you think every American would be happy about it, but no. Democratic Presidential candidates spent the weekend complaining about the deal and taking Mexico's side. Watch."

Well you'll probably assume the Democratic Party loves immigrants. But you'd be wrong. They don't. To the Democratic Party, immigrants are just a means to an end, and of course the end is always the same -- power. When immigrants to this country become pro-American and call for following our laws, as many do, by the way, the left turns on them, too. It happens a lot. It is happening right now to a Gwinnett college professor called Fang Zhou. Zhou is a legal immigrant from China. He loves the United States. He strongly opposes illegal immigration here. For that, activists are demanding that he be fired from his job. Professor Zhou is not giving in, in fact, tomorrow night, he will join us on this show. But the Democratic Party doesn't want more immigrants like Fang Zhou. They are very clear about that. They want immigration that is based on family ties, anything but merit. Why? Because for the Democratic Party, the more desperate, the less skilled, the less educated a potential immigrant is, the easier to control, and therefore, the better, and that's why in the State of California right now, the government there is planning to spend hundreds of million dollars to provide free healthcare to illegal immigrants. That of course, won't help the State of California. It won't help millions of hard-pressed middle class Californians, but that doesn't matter. Helping regular American has stopped being the agenda a long time ago. Douglas MacGregor is a retired U.S. Army Colonel and author of the book, \"Margin of Victory.\" He who joins us to assess.

      "utterance": "Well, I think in the short run, there will be some temporary relief. But in the long run, this is not going to influence the crisis on the southern border, and for two very good reasons. First of all, Mexico has no interest in halting the flow of either illegal immigrants from its country or any other in Latin America into the United States. That's how they off-load excess population, discontented citizens and criminals on to the United States. They've been doing it for decades. So while they may be temporarily relieved, it will resume inevitably. Secondly, Mexico is a narco state. We need to be honest about this. The place is ruled by six drug carters. These drug carters control the government. They control the institutions of governance. No one can move in that country without their permission. So ultimately, they have a permanent interest in keeping open borders. They have no interest whatsoever. They want to filter in people and they want to filter in drugs. You can't do that if you close the border, so for those two reasons, it has no future in the long run. So whatever we get from this, it will be temporary. It's not as you say, a viable solution."

Just a few decades ago, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were elected to high office from the State of California. Is that possible today? Absolutely not. It's impossible. Why? It's called demographic change. And right now, the largest ethnic minority in California is Mexican and Hispanic. California is in the main today no longer a majority English- speaking white state. It is the main something else, it's something new, but largely Latino, largely Mexican. The Latinos, the Mexicans are the base of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has decided they are the future for the left in the United States. The more of these people that can be brought in illegally as well as legally, the better it is for the Democratic Party because their goal is to transform the United States into a facsimile of California, so that any election is impossible from the standpoint of the right, for the standpoint of the Republican Party to win anything."

And I can tell you that there's been a massive explosion of homeless people, not only here in Los Angeles, but San Francisco, especially. And I know you've covered that before. What's bizarre about this, to me is look, we can all empathize with illegal immigrants. We can all empathize with immigrants. We can have a conversation about what the state should provide for the most needy, all of those things should be on the books. But part of what they're doing with this policy is they're going to tax citizens who do not have health insurance. They're going to tax legal citizens of this country who do not have health insurance to pay for these people's -- illegal people's insurance. And it's only -- as you noted, it's only for poor, illegal immigrants, not of a certain age -- young people -- not for older people, sort of what they are saying, those people are more valuable than the elderly people are. I mean, it's just sort of a cacophony of conflicting viewpoints that it all sounds good, we all have one home, and all these things. And this is sort of what we've consistently seen the left doing over the last couple of years, just everything sort of seems like a rational position that's for poor people, for women, for black people, et cetera et cetera and most of it is just an excuse to give the state more power."

He is in the hospital tonight. In a joint investigation we're conducting with our partners at \"Fox and Friends,\" we sent our Griff Jenkins to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

Officials saying that these are isolated events and that initial autopsies prove that they were dying of natural causes. But we got a room here to take a look a little bit earlier.

You see it's a very plush room, a bathtub in the middle. The grounds have a casino, bars, restaurants, and of course the beach. Chloe, his niece said that Wallace had a drink from the minibar, but investigators will find something that we noticed right away and that is the minibar doesn't add the airplane bottles that you'd usually see coming, but rather full fifths of liquor provide the alcohol, it's even accessible without being locked down. Chloe said that Wallace had a scotch after which he became almost immediately sick. Whether or not there was tampering, it will be up to investigators to determine the pathology and toxicology reports. But this doesn't seem like a difficult thing to perhaps manipulate, whether intentional or accidental. We'll wait and see what the final report has to say."

They have two 20-year-old boys they said who can drink a beer, but don't touch the hard liquor and don't touch that minibar. We also know that a year ago, David Harrison died here at this very resort behind me. I spoke with his widow today, showed her the video. She said, it seems very mysterious. She wants answer. This comes on the heels of the three Americans that died at the end of May about an hour away in La Romana at the Bahia Principe. The woman from Pennsylvania, Miranda Shaup-Werner who died, went to the minibar as well, a Maryland couple that died mysteriously as well. Both resorts not giving us a statement saying they want to wait for a full investigation. We understand that the pathology and toxicology reports may be very significant with all these questions out there, Tucker, but really the island has been gripping the news of David Ortiz being shot. Fox News has not confirmed this. But there are multiple reports here on the ground that foul play may be at work, that a drug lord, a local drug lord may have targeted the baseball star over another woman. We're going to try and find out a little bit more about that. But then finally, just as a sort of reminder about how cautious we have to be when we travel outside of the country to a place like the Dominican Republic, when we were traveling last night between this resort and the other one where the three deaths happened, our fixer, our local producer who helps us with the local issues pulled off the side of the road to ask for directions. He was robbed at gunpoint. He lost all of his valuables. Fortunately, he was not harmed, and we were not harmed either. But it is a reminder, you have to be very careful be there are more and more questions coming out of this tiny little Caribbean paradise -- Tucker."

But still, if somebody told you that they'd go, \"Wow, he has obviously done something right.\" And yet, I'll concede the way he is going about this campaign does leave something to be desired. I do not fault him for not showing up in Iowa for his granddaughter's graduation, again, remember, his wife and daughter -- you know, he had all these tragedies in his life.

The National Transportation Safety Board has arrived here to investigate, but they won't be able to investigate the scene until tomorrow morning because of that fog cover and it gives you an idea of what kind of terrible weather we were dealing with today when this crash happened at about 1:43 p.m. You can take a look at some of these photos from the Fire Department here in New York. It shows what's left of that chopper, one pilot is dead. Remarkably, there are no injuries. But this helicopter crashing into the top of this building 750 feet up. It left from a heliport on the east side of Manhattan and 11 minutes into its flight, it crashed into the building. What caused this accident? We still do not know, but there was heavy rain at the time and heavy cloud cover and the investigation will continue. Witnesses say that they heard the engine, the building shake and they came out of the building, of course, a lot of PTSD in terms of people remembering the events of 9/11. Everybody looking up and initial report said that it was an aircraft hitting the building. So there were some tense moments here this afternoon and Tucker, we now know the identity of that pilot who died. His name is Tim McCormick. He spent 10 years as a volunteer firefighter in East Clinton, New York, a terrible tragedy for him. But this could have been much worse. Remarkably, there were no other injuries.

Biofuels having been an ecological catastrophe to oceans and orangutans and battery breakthroughs. Battery breakthroughs are decades away. They've been decades away since the internal combustion engine replaced the electric vehicle over a century ago. They're talking about marginal efficiency improvements and so on to what's essentially a Doomsday call that's not famously interested in marginal efficiency improvements. This will work with your standard social justice warrior industry, but for reasons that should be obvious, this is very different and I don't think their parry is very well thought out.

The Washington wise men does very well by saying no, you have to understand. You can't say no. All right, what you do is you offer half. You have to haggle and hope that by the time -- first, they'll realize how indispensable you are and never really follow through. And they'll lose their taste for your flesh by the time it comes to you. But this again, is very different. Every radical movement has elements that slipped their leash, some of them had become elected to Congress. Everybody polling over one percent seeking a certain party's nomination is insisting they'll mandate the invention of Flubber or pixie dust by 2050 by government fiat and steel industries, are responding with percentage improvements and so on. They should have long ago said this is what it means. This is -- you can't mandate that we impact the climate, but you can kill millions trying or pretending to try, but industry is very slow to that. Their lobbyists have a different constituency, the lobbyist constituencies are the Hill staff they work with, the regulators in the media. It's called the principal agent problem.

And that is especially true for narcotic drug addicts. For many, prison is the only drug rehab facility they have access to and many get sober while behind bars. Now though a Canadian Federal Prison in Alberta is planning to open a supervised heroin injection site within the prison for prisoners. Government calls this a harm reduction facility, but of course, it is the opposite of that. It's a harm enabling facility. Instead of trying keep inmates from using heroin, which is smuggled in, prison officials have decided to tolerate in effect, to encourage it in the name of achieving some bogus safety. It is more proof that Canada's government has given up on its own citizens. Instead, they've decided to simply look on while there people degrade and destroy themselves in this spiral of addiction and death like euthanasia or late-term abortion, both of which Canada has. It's a sign that their society has become -- there's no other word for it - - suicidal, and if this practice comes here, and some without question will be pushing for it. It'll be a sign that America has become the same. Well, Oberlin College in Ohio maybe the most liberal college in the world. It has lost a court case and has been ordered to pay at least $11 million to a small family bakery after the school -- its staff -- falsely attacked the business as racist. An amazing story. Fox's Trace Gallagher has more on that tonight. Hey, Trace."

      "utterance": "And Tucker, let's face it. That $11 million award means the jury didn't pull a single punch. Not only did the jurors find that Oberlin College labeled Gibson's Bakery as racist, but found the emotional distress endured by the bakery and the Gibson family should be worth a pretty penny. This all stemmed from an incident in November 2016 where three black Oberlin students went into Gibson's Bakery, used a fake ID, stole some bottles of wine, and when they were confronted by the son of the bakery's owner, police say the students knocked him to the ground and punched him. The students initially claimed they were racially profiled, but later admitted there was no racism and a follow-up police investigation also found accusations of racism were baseless. But none of that stopped Oberlin College which has long been a bastion of liberal activism from declaring war on Gibson's including boycotts and protest involving hundreds of students chanting, \"No justice, no peace.\" The bakery also argued in court that college leaders used a bullhorn to orchestrate the protest and passed out flyers calling Gibson is a quote, \"racist establishment with a long account of racial profiling and discrimination.\" Remember, the business relationship between the college and the bakery goes back a hundred years. The college argue that all of the statements cited by the bakery's owners were protected speech. And the only reason the college temporarily stopped doing business with the bakery was to quell a violent situation. But the bakery might even get more money because the punitive phase of the trial starts tomorrow -- Tucker."

      "utterance": "What an amazing story. Trace Gallagher, unexpected. Thank you for that. Well, for many years, leftist billionaire George Soros has used his wealth to remake our society -- American society. His latest area focuses criminal justice. From Texas to Philadelphia, the State of Virginia, Soros has reportedly spent millions of dollars backing candidates for District Attorney, for prosecutor. Once elected, these candidates have tended to have ended cash bail, treated felonies like misdemeanors and sometimes ignored some crimes entirely. In the city of Philadelphia, for example, Soros backed Larry Krasner, and the murder rate there is the highest it has been in a decade. Krasner's main party, though was to get even softer on crime. Bill McSwain is U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and he joins us tonight. Mr. McSwain, thanks very much for coming on. So it's remarkable in a democracy that one man can have the ability to remake our justice system, but it sounds to some extent, that's what George Soros is doing. What are his priorities? What are his goals in doing this?"

      "speaker": "WILLIAM MCSWAIN, U.S. ATTORNEY, EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I would say that I think in a lot of ways, Philadelphia is the laboratory where this experiment in Soros funded prosecutors' is playing out. And now the returns are in to a certain extent. Larry Krasner has been in office for about a year and a half, funded by Mr. Soros. And we can look at the data and we can see what has happened to Philadelphia. And as you said, homicides have skyrocketed, shootings have skyrocketed. The worst kinds of violent crime have really gone up. And in addition to that, some of the low level and the mid-level crimes have also gone up, but aren't being reported. And the reason they're not being reported is because the DA has said he is not going to prosecute them. So you have statistically a bad situation that has developed in Philadelphia, but actually, the reality on the ground is even worse than the statistics. And what Mr. Soros, I think wants to do is that he wants to implement his radical agenda, and he realizes that he can't do that through the normal democratic process. Normally, if you're going to try to get criminal justice reform, you have to do it through the legislature, you have to get broad public support for the kind of changes that you want to institute. He is taking what I would describe as an illegitimate, anti-democratic shortcut by trying to purchase DA elections. And then once the DA is in place, he or she doesn't enforce the law. And presto, you've got criminal justice reform."

      "utterance": "I guess -- and everything you said is absolutely right. And for those worried about the hijacking of our democracy, here's a perfect example of it actually happening. But quickly, I'm just wondering, who is the winner in this? If violent crime goes up? If more people are murdered, why would you want so-called reform of this kind?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "I think the winners in this story are defendants. Unfortunately, criminals are the winners in this story. And Mr. Krasner makes no bones about this. He's not even pretending to be a prosecutor. He calls himself a public defender with power. So it's almost like letting the fox into the henhouse. Once he is in, he is trying to cause as much havoc as possible. He has no background as a prosecutor, he has no interest in prosecution. He has an interest in sort of cramming down his radical pro-defendant ideology on everyone else."
