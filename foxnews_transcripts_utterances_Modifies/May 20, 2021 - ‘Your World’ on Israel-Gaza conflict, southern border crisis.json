Breaking tonight, the Israeli Security Cabinet has approved a cease-fire deal with Hamas, the group in control of Gaza, basically ending 11 straight days of fighting between the two sides. We are getting reports right now. According to Israeli media, this is set to go into place and into effect around 2:00 a.m. local time. And there are no preconditions. This is significant, because we spoke earlier today with Hamas, who said there would have to be preconditions in order to stop the fire. Now, after the report started to circulate that the Israelis were on board with this cease-fire agreement, after a week of being urged not only by the United States, but also the United Nations ,to stop this fighting, we are not really sure if it's going to hold. One example of that is, off in the distance now, you can still hear Israeli helicopters and fighter jets. They're continuing operations against Gaza up until this cease-fire actually goes into effect. And also, just a few minutes ago, there were mortars and rockets fired into this area in Southern Israel, the city of Ashkelon. Earlier today, in that conversation with Hamas, we tried to get an understanding of their perspective about this conflict and the involvement of the Americans. I want you to take a listen to this senior official on what they had to say about the Biden administration.",

The humanitarian situation quickly unraveling, as Palestinian civilians run out of food, electricity and clean water. Reports do indicate that areas crossing on the northern part of the Gaza Strip will be open tomorrow for humanitarian aid. But as we saw earlier in the week, sometimes ,those convoys are actually targeted with rockets and mortars. And it makes it very difficult to get that aid into the Gaza Strip, but, tonight, again, that breaking news, the Israeli Security Cabinet approving a cease-fire that will effectively end 11 days of fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas -- Charles.",

And, of course, Israel is going to continue to take out the targets that it believes that are necessary, where Hamas is still hiding and where it's still conducting operations. I thought Trey made the important point too, the reporter, right before that you and I begin chatting, Charles, that the humanitarian aid that is coming in, it's coming in -- it's important to be clear about where it's coming from. Israel is delivering aid to those civilians that are in the crossfire, and Hamas continues to fire upon those delivering aid in that area. So it's important to keep in mind who the aggressors are here and who is trying to go to extremes to make sure that we minimize the civilian casualties that are -- that are caught in the middle of this.",

And so that has to -- that has to stop, because, of course, Israel is under enormous international scrutiny right now. The Palestinian side has taken on more casualties. And that does not mean that they are the ones that are more innocent, though that is the narrative that's going to continue to be painted. Remember, Hamas is still hiding among civilian targets. And so, as Israel tries to warn civilians to evacuate those areas, it's very difficult, because the Hamas militants are hiding there. So what needs to happen is, Hamas has got to stop.

As you know, the president and the Biden administration are trying to pay for, at least in part, for the American Families Plan by cracking down on tax cheats, trying to build up the IRS and to bring in more money to the federal government. In fact, the Biden administration says that, by building up IRS reinforcements, that could potentially bring in some $700 billion over the course of a decade. One of the ways that they are intending to do this is to have financial institutions report outflows and inflows as it relates to bank accounts. Earlier today, I asked the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, about this, essentially why the federal government should be able to monitor the inflows and outflows of bank accounts, but also, secondly, the Treasury Department is saying that those who make under $400,000 a year would not be audited more under this plan. So, would it amount to a two-tiered audit system? And this was part of her response.",

And she responded by saying, look, if you pay your taxes, you're going to be aboveboard.

So, there is an issue here. And Blake touched on it, too. They're saying the Treasury -- the Treasury officials are saying that the IRS is underfunded.

Breaking tonight, the Israeli Security Cabinet has approved a cease-fire deal with Hamas, the group in control of Gaza, basically ending 11 straight days of fighting between the two sides. We are getting reports right now. According to Israeli media, this is set to go into place and into effect around 2:00 a.m. local time. And there are no preconditions. This is significant, because we spoke earlier today with Hamas, who said there would have to be preconditions in order to stop the fire. Now, after the report started to circulate that the Israelis were on board with this cease-fire agreement, after a week of being urged not only by the United States, but also the United Nations ,to stop this fighting, we are not really sure if it's going to hold. One example of that is, off in the distance now, you can still hear Israeli helicopters and fighter jets. They're continuing operations against Gaza up until this cease-fire actually goes into effect. And also, just a few minutes ago, there were mortars and rockets fired into this area in Southern Israel, the city of Ashkelon. Earlier today, in that conversation with Hamas, we tried to get an understanding of their perspective about this conflict and the involvement of the Americans. I want you to take a listen to this senior official on what they had to say about the Biden administration."

Reports do indicate that areas crossing on the northern part of the Gaza Strip will be open tomorrow for humanitarian aid. But as we saw earlier in the week, sometimes ,those convoys are actually targeted with rockets and mortars. And it makes it very difficult to get that aid into the Gaza Strip, but, tonight, again, that breaking news, the Israeli Security Cabinet approving a cease-fire that will effectively end 11 days of fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas -- Charles."

At one point, President Biden, according to some reports, demanding a de- escalation on the part of Israel with this fighting. What do you think?"

The cease-fire, the early reports are, that it will take into effect, it'll be about 7:00 p.m. Thursday night, so that's tonight, Eastern time. And, of course, Israel is going to continue to take out the targets that it believes that are necessary, where Hamas is still hiding and where it's still conducting operations. I thought Trey made the important point too, the reporter, right before that you and I begin chatting, Charles, that the humanitarian aid that is coming in, it's coming in -- it's important to be clear about where it's coming from. Israel is delivering aid to those civilians that are in the crossfire, and Hamas continues to fire upon those delivering aid in that area. So it's important to keep in mind who the aggressors are here and who is trying to go to extremes to make sure that we minimize the civilian casualties that are -- that are caught in the middle of this."

      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "Well, they need to begin winding down. So, even, as I just said, Israel is going to continue to take out some targets, that's going to have to be very clearly decreasing towards the end. But they're not -- the Israelis are not going to stop if they're still taking incoming from the Hamas militants. And so that has to -- that has to stop, because, of course, Israel is under enormous international scrutiny right now. The Palestinian side has taken on more casualties. And that does not mean that they are the ones that are more innocent, though that is the narrative that's going to continue to be painted. Remember, Hamas is still hiding among civilian targets. And so, as Israel tries to warn civilians to evacuate those areas, it's very difficult, because the Hamas militants are hiding there. So what needs to happen is, Hamas has got to stop. They have got to stop launching these attacks against civilian targets inside of Israel."

As you know, the president and the Biden administration are trying to pay for, at least in part, for the American Families Plan by cracking down on tax cheats, trying to build up the IRS and to bring in more money to the federal government. In fact, the Biden administration says that, by building up IRS reinforcements, that could potentially bring in some $700 billion over the course of a decade. One of the ways that they are intending to do this is to have financial institutions report outflows and inflows as it relates to bank accounts. Earlier today, I asked the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, about this, essentially why the federal government should be able to monitor the inflows and outflows of bank accounts, but also, secondly, the Treasury Department is saying that those who make under $400,000 a year would not be audited more under this plan. So, would it amount to a two-tiered audit system? And this was part of her response."

      "speaker": "PSAKI",
      "utterance": "I would say that lower- and middle-income Americans who are working hard, making -- getting their paychecks are not typically the issue at hand here. The wealthiest Americans and corporations, because they often operate under different tax systems, it already is a system that is living in two Americas. They are able to pay lower tax rates. That's not fair. That's basically what the president is conveying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURMAN",
      "utterance": "So, about this idea, Charles, of having financial institutions report outflows and inflows, I followed up with her by saying, well, what about those who have done well and have paid their taxes and just don't want the possibility of maybe the federal government having more insight as to what comes into and out of their bank accounts? And she responded by saying, look, if you pay your taxes, you're going to be aboveboard. She also noted at least part of what the administration, the case that they're making is that the IRS has been underfunded and understaffed, they say, for the past decade -- Charles."

The proposal says they would like to have access to any financial firm that transfers money. So, they're talking about Venmo. You're talking about crypto wallets, any type of service like that goes back and forth. So, there are concerns out there about what information that the federal government would be able to have. And many people are now pointing to the 2013 scandals, where the IRS, some claim, was weaponized against some conservative voices and Republican- based organizations going forward. So, there is an issue here. And Blake touched on it, too. They're saying the Treasury -- the Treasury officials are saying that the IRS is underfunded. They want to put $80 billion back into the IRS, to grow it at 10 percent per year over the next 10 years, adding agents, auditors to audit folks, as well as new technology to come up with algorithms that can flow information different ways."

That certainly doesn't include -- that's not millionaires and billionaires. Again, it looks like any reason they can to bolster an army, an $80 billion army of IRS agents. They're going for it.

These cartels, these dangerous, dangerous organizations are making billions of dollars off of U.S. policy.

And I'm thankful that Governor Abbott is actually stepping up to the plate and doing his job. But he's only doing it because the federal government is failing the American public. The federal government needs to take the -- a front role in this to give us the resources untie, uncuff the good guys' hands to allow us to do our job, so that we can secure the border.

Yes, it's an interesting story, because I think, so often, when we cover this crisis, that either you're picking one side, either you're just supporting the businesses, or you are covering the crisis from the homeless perspective. But we had the opportunity to talk with all of them. L.A. is not a place where you have a lot of people that aren't compassionate. This is not a matter of people wanting to force people out. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of resources that have been dedicated to these people that are there. And I talked with them. A lot of them are addicted to drugs. They have been on the street ever since they were 13 and 15 years old. Many of them are my age today. And they have been offered resources for drug addiction. They have been offered housing. They get a meal every single day, sometimes three times a day. But they haven't been able to hit that rock bottom point, because the state won't allow them to. And it's a safety issue. One of the guys that I interviewed that day actually overdosed two hours before I gave him -- I talked with him. And it was because the city gave him the needles, as well as the drugs to be able to revive -- revive himself, the Narcan that saved his life. There's a real crisis that is happening there. And I talked with LAPD. They finally released the statement with us. It's not a matter of them not wanting to clean up the area. It's the fact that the city has implemented all these policies that essentially say they cannot clean up the area, that lawlessness is acceptable."

They agree that they have taken over the beach. I mean, these are millions of millions of dollar homes that are surrounding this area. And the fact that they get to just live there rent-free and do criminal activity, there's fires, gunshots, stabbings. So they get that there's a problem there. But, again, when you when you have a city council that is all about heart, and not thinking from a logical standpoint, you really aren't getting any movement.

And Dr. Brian Monahan says, based upon the fact that there's still lots of unvaccinated members of Congress, something like a little more than half of the Republican members, that he does not judge that it is safe for everybody to go around without a mask. I'm faced with the same thing. I run the National Institutes of Health. I have 45,000 employees. We aren't able to let our employees go into the laboratory unmasked, even though most of them are vaccinated. They're not all. So we're stuck in the same place. It really troubles me that, somehow, this has become a big story in and big political battle. Could we just stop a minute and celebrate the fact that masks are coming off if you're fully vaccinated? Somehow, in our country, we have to turn this one into a battle and a problem. And that's a little disheartening. Hey, I am a scientist. I'm a doctor. I was proud to serve President Trump. I'm now proud to serve President Biden. The vaccines we're talking about were mostly designed and tested under President Trump. Why is it that less than half of House Republicans have gotten vaccinated? How does that make sense?"

And some of that's come from the CDC and other organizations that are supposed to influence us in a way that's not confusing. So, do you take any responsibility for maybe these mixed messages that have maybe caused some of these problems? Maybe it's not political, as much as the fact that people just aren't sure what to believe anymore."

And the rates of illness are coming down, which means the risks also of being in a community are somewhat lower. Putting those things together, it's different now than it was six or eight weeks ago. So you would kind of want that message to change, wouldn't you? And now, at this point, somebody like myself, fully immunized, I can go outside with a mask off."

It does not apply to people who have not been vaccinated or who haven't gotten all the way through their course. They still need to wear a mask. They are still potentially at risk of getting sick and making other people get sick. I think that's gotten all mixed up. When CDC says, OK, masks off ,vaccinated people, people thought they said, masks off, everybody? No. There's still 100 million people in the United States who haven't even started their vaccination effort. They still need to protect others from them, and they need to protect themselves.

      "utterance": "Do you sense, though, that that has not been the case, particularly in the last 24 or 48 hours, the demand for Israel to de-escalate and some other things that I have read in the media that seemed really like veiled threats that, if they don't sort of -- if they don't stop, if Israel doesn't stop, they would receive less support from America, particularly the White House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "Right, Charles. And this is disheartening to many of us that recognize that Israel is a nation we can count on when we need their support. It's the only democratic nation in the Middle East. They are there for us. We need to be there for them. And for the president to really be not firm when he is speaking about potential cease-fires by Israel, but not going after Hamas, it's wrong. And it has led our nation to believe that maybe we're not strong friends with Israel anymore. And I'm here to counter that argument. We will always stand by Israel, again, the only democratic nation in the Middle East, a strong supporter and ally. And we need to project that widely and broadly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "The big question a lot of people are asking, I mean, this went on for 11 days. And many are wondering, Hamas, where does Hamas get the money? Where do they get the backing? Where do they even derive the nerve to try this -- these sorts of attacks? And it all seems to trace back to Iran. And you believe this is one reason maybe the White House should step back from the eagerness to reengage with Iran and perhaps reengage this nuclear deal. Is that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "That is absolutely correct. Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism. And, absolutely, they are funding money into proxy terrorist organizations like Hamas. And we know that Hamas -- they have stated it -- they want to see the destruction of the nation of Israel. Iran wants to see the destruction of the United States of America. I think it is absolutely ludicrous that our president and other Democratic members here in Congress would ever want to reengage in a nuclear deal with Iran, which just puts off the inevitable. They are continuing to develop nuclear weapons. We know that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "So, again, it is ludicrous to think that they would abide by any agreement we drew up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "I want to follow up on that. The support Hamas has received, and in the halls of Congress, obviously, in the American media, it goes without saying around the world, how much does that, in your mind, embolden Iran, embolden Hamas, and the eagerness of this administration to do a deal with them? Because it sort of reminds me of when President Obama was in office. It felt like Iran knew that he so badly wanted a deal, they drove an amazing bargain. And they have used all of that cash, a lot of it, for nefarious reasons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "Yes. And that is the point, is that, through these negotiations, the infusion of cash from the United States into Iran, it has enabled this country to support proxy terrorist organizations like Hamas. Now, Hamas is hiding behind people in Palestine. We know that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "And they are lobbing rockets into the nation of Israel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "And those rockets probably were paid for using American dollars. That's a very sad state."
    },

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, Senator Ernst, we appreciate your time and really all that you're doing. Thank you so much. And, folks, that will do it for me.
