      "sentences": "Yes. Here we are. Happy, Happy Monday, everyone or as Kat likes to call it IV drip day. Because, you know, her weekends are a little rough. So this show is doing great. And I know this because I actually read the mail. While my young assistant Clive reads them to me, as I lay in my hammock and he feeds me grapes. He actually shoots them at me. Quite a talent. And a lot of the male says Greg, this show is doing great. Also, dude, you really been working out? And well, it's like you get taller every day. Signed at Neil Patrick Harris. But I get a few complaints. A lot about not enough camera shots of Kat's feet. I forgot I gave Varney my e-mail. But mostly it's about swearing. We swear too much on the show. And I agree. Swearing can get an easy laugh and it feels good. But I don't like it when we overdo it. So why am I saying this? Well, because we're (BLEEP) Sorry. There's no other word to describe the current situation we are in. (BLEEP) Think about it. As we criminalize parenting we decriminalize criminals. As we target people trying to protect their kids, we protect those trying to target us. We're living in a time when we play, catch and release with deranged criminals, picking them up, and then tossing them back into the general population. Like a fisherman releasing an underweight bass. It's now a game of Russian Roulette. The government's the gun, the bullet is the criminal and you're the target. Meanwhile, all the secure lives sit in their safe beds watching Squid Game on Netflix. A drama from South Korea where people are randomly killed in a series of children's games. You know, think hide and go seek with machetes. I enjoyed the first episode but then I was done because I didn't need to watch it. I can just walk outside and see it for real on my streets. Jermaine Foster, a sick maniac who just allegedly robbed one woman on Saturday, then knocked another woman to the ground. Maria Ambrosio. A 58- year-old cancer nurse. She fell suffered a mortal head wound and died a day later. This occurred in the afternoon in Times Square. You know the only time decent people will venture there. It was once the number one tourist capital, but now it's Squid Game. Everyone there is either a criminal, a victim or wearing an Elmo costume. But of course, here comes the second part of the story. Like clockwork, the fiend had been arrested before but was released. So tell me again how racist the justice system is. Maybe the middle-aged Filipino women. The perp was nailed on a groping charge. And like most other heinous thugs, the victims were women. This story gets repeated more often than Seinfeld. If he'd been in jail and received the mental health treatment that we pay for this wouldn't have happened. You know, like when a republican was mayor. But did you know the current mayor's wife runs in $800 million program designed to help the mentally ill people. It's only help two so far, the mayor and his wife. There's more nuts on the streets now than after an explosion at the Planters factory. $800 million. No one knows where the money went. I think patio furniture and weed. Meanwhile, the mayor's son gets chauffeured by actual detectives to and from the drugstore. Make sense. De Blasio doesn't want his son to be a victim of the crime wave he's responsible for. This as Attorney General Merrick Garland directs the FBI to investigate parents as domestic terror threats. Yet flat Earthers have more evidence in support of its claims. As real homicide rates skyrocket. He's focusing on claims of harassment against school boards. Yes, he's right. You've seen all those videos of parents following teachers in the bathrooms with their cell phones? Screaming at school board members while they're trying to have a quiet dinner in a restaurant? Going to people's homes and chanting with bull horns in the middle of the night? Oh wait, that's his team. So let's imagine where this might end up.",

      "sentences": "Those are better than New Yorker cartoons. So perhaps it's a game of deflection. Create mass hysteria from a fake problem to distract from the real problems. But it's hard to get distracted from your stolen car, clothes business and knife wound. But people keep dying from black teens in Chicago to Asian women in Manhattan. And they don't matter because their suffering serves no political purpose. Those black lives don't matter to Black Lives Matter. So it's real criminals roam free in the streets like moose in Alaska, and parents of all colors get demonized for caring about their kid's education. What are you left with? An activist government creating activist parents, for the surest way to red pill hundreds of millions of Americans is to call them terrorists. And the second surest way is to protect the thugs as you do that. Put all of this -- put all of us in harm's way. Now the tide turns. A red tide, if you will. And like a red tide, small anti-government activist groups are going to come to the surface and bloom. We've seen movements come and go. Perot back in the 90s. The Tea Party, Black Lives Matter, line dancing. It's time for a parent's movement that stands up to this bowel movement we call a government. Safe streets and good schools are a popular idea no matter what news channel you watch. And why pay taxes to a government that chooses the side that victimizes you? It's like continuing to give the schoolyard bully your lunch money day after day. Having to respect a government that sees you as a bigger threat than al Qaeda? While citizens get murdered in broad daylight. It's time for a new Black Lives Matter. Call it All Lives Matter. Oh, but that's racist, Greg (BLEEP) self. Sorry. I'm sorry that I swore and I apologize for any future swearing, but it's time we gave (BLEEP) because if we don't, we won't have any left to give.",

I mean, this is true in cities across the country but it's prosecutor's offices too. I have friends in the New York City district attorney's office. And they won't prosecute more minor crimes because they know that they're getting pressure from above. The political winds have changed so much that they're not allowed to really enforce a lot of these laws. This is why if you go to the Duane Reade, that's on the corner, I live right around here. Everything is in plastic.

Cancel culture is about people losing careers, not telling people you suck in a chat room. I know you've been out of the game, but read up a little before you call something a myth. But it's easy for Stewart to call cancel culture a myth. It's not like you really ever had to worry about the mob coming for him, when they already approved of his talking points. And it's not about famous TV stars with F.U. money getting canceled. It's about parents, business owners, even refugees who can lose it all when the mob comes for them. Like University Michigan Music Professor Bryce Shang, he was born in China in the 1950s and survived Mao's cultural revolution. That's something. But now, he's being accused of racism for screening the 1965 version of Shakespeare's \"A Fellow\" in one of his classes, because Laurence Olivier wore blackface to play a fellow. He's apologized profusely, but students still demanded he be fired for making the classroom, an unsafe space. And now, he stepped down from his role. That's one example. And there are more. But Jon is still stuck in the prison of two ideas. If someone complains about a problem, he'd rather say, no, that doesn't exist than actually listened to the complaint itself. But I guess that's why the show is called \"The Problem with Jon Stewart.\" The title fits. So, Kat, what do you -- why would he say -- do you think it's just him being lazy, that he just didn't bother to look up what cancel, because every night you hear about people losing their jobs?",

      "utterance": "Yes. Here we are. Happy, Happy Monday, everyone or as Kat likes to call it IV drip day. Because, you know, her weekends are a little rough. So this show is doing great. And I know this because I actually read the mail. While my young assistant Clive reads them to me, as I lay in my hammock and he feeds me grapes. He actually shoots them at me. Quite a talent. And a lot of the male says Greg, this show is doing great. Also, dude, you really been working out? And well, it's like you get taller every day. Signed at Neil Patrick Harris. But I get a few complaints. A lot about not enough camera shots of Kat's feet. I forgot I gave Varney my e-mail. But mostly it's about swearing. We swear too much on the show. And I agree. Swearing can get an easy laugh and it feels good. But I don't like it when we overdo it. So why am I saying this? Well, because we're (BLEEP) Sorry. There's no other word to describe the current situation we are in. (BLEEP) Think about it. As we criminalize parenting we decriminalize criminals. As we target people trying to protect their kids, we protect those trying to target us. We're living in a time when we play, catch and release with deranged criminals, picking them up, and then tossing them back into the general population. Like a fisherman releasing an underweight bass. It's now a game of Russian Roulette. The government's the gun, the bullet is the criminal and you're the target. Meanwhile, all the secure lives sit in their safe beds watching Squid Game on Netflix. A drama from South Korea where people are randomly killed in a series of children's games. You know, think hide and go seek with machetes. I enjoyed the first episode but then I was done because I didn't need to watch it. I can just walk outside and see it for real on my streets. Jermaine Foster, a sick maniac who just allegedly robbed one woman on Saturday, then knocked another woman to the ground. Maria Ambrosio. A 58- year-old cancer nurse. She fell suffered a mortal head wound and died a day later. This occurred in the afternoon in Times Square. You know the only time decent people will venture there. It was once the number one tourist capital, but now it's Squid Game. Everyone there is either a criminal, a victim or wearing an Elmo costume. But of course, here comes the second part of the story. Like clockwork, the fiend had been arrested before but was released. So tell me again how racist the justice system is. Maybe the middle-aged Filipino women. The perp was nailed on a groping charge. And like most other heinous thugs, the victims were women. This story gets repeated more often than Seinfeld. If he'd been in jail and received the mental health treatment that we pay for this wouldn't have happened. You know, like when a republican was mayor. But did you know the current mayor's wife runs in $800 million program designed to help the mentally ill people. It's only help two so far, the mayor and his wife. There's more nuts on the streets now than after an explosion at the Planters factory. $800 million. No one knows where the money went. I think patio furniture and weed. Meanwhile, the mayor's son gets chauffeured by actual detectives to and from the drugstore. Make sense. De Blasio doesn't want his son to be a victim of the crime wave he's responsible for. This as Attorney General Merrick Garland directs the FBI to investigate parents as domestic terror threats. Yet flat Earthers have more evidence in support of its claims. As real homicide rates skyrocket. He's focusing on claims of harassment against school boards. Yes, he's right. You've seen all those videos of parents following teachers in the bathrooms with their cell phones? Screaming at school board members while they're trying to have a quiet dinner in a restaurant? Going to people's homes and chanting with bull horns in the middle of the night? Oh wait, that's his team. So let's imagine where this might end up."

But it's hard to get distracted from your stolen car, clothes business and knife wound. But people keep dying from black teens in Chicago to Asian women in Manhattan. And they don't matter because their suffering serves no political purpose. Those black lives don't matter to Black Lives Matter. So it's real criminals roam free in the streets like moose in Alaska, and parents of all colors get demonized for caring about their kid's education. What are you left with? An activist government creating activist parents, for the surest way to red pill hundreds of millions of Americans is to call them terrorists. And the second surest way is to protect the thugs as you do that. Put all of this -- put all of us in harm's way. Now the tide turns. A red tide, if you will. And like a red tide, small anti-government activist groups are going to come to the surface and bloom. We've seen movements come and go. Perot back in the 90s. The Tea Party, Black Lives Matter, line dancing. It's time for a parent's movement that stands up to this bowel movement we call a government. Safe streets and good schools are a popular idea no matter what news channel you watch. And why pay taxes to a government that chooses the side that victimizes you? It's like continuing to give the schoolyard bully your lunch money day after day. Having to respect a government that sees you as a bigger threat than al Qaeda? While citizens get murdered in broad daylight. It's time for a new Black Lives Matter. Call it All Lives Matter. Oh, but that's racist, Greg (BLEEP) self. Sorry. I'm sorry that I swore and I apologize for any future swearing, but it's time we gave (BLEEP) because if we don't, we won't have any left to give."

I mean, this is true in cities across the country but it's prosecutor's offices too. I have friends in the New York City district attorney's office. And they won't prosecute more minor crimes because they know that they're getting pressure from above. The political winds have changed so much that they're not allowed to really enforce a lot of these laws. This is why if you go to the Duane Reade, that's on the corner, I live right around here. Everything is in plastic. You can't actually get -- if you want to get four different things, you have to press the little button and then the tired, annoyed employee has to calm and open it up for you slowly. I mean, I go to work every day and tape a T.V. show next to what is one of those homeless shelters that's actually a hotel that all the folks here we're paying taxes are paying for.

Cancel culture is about people losing careers, not telling people you suck in a chat room. I know you've been out of the game, but read up a little before you call something a myth. But it's easy for Stewart to call cancel culture a myth. It's not like you really ever had to worry about the mob coming for him, when they already approved of his talking points. And it's not about famous TV stars with F.U. money getting canceled. It's about parents, business owners, even refugees who can lose it all when the mob comes for them. Like University Michigan Music Professor Bryce Shang, he was born in China in the 1950s and survived Mao's cultural revolution. That's something. But now, he's being accused of racism for screening the 1965 version of Shakespeare's \"A Fellow\" in one of his classes, because Laurence Olivier wore blackface to play a fellow. He's apologized profusely, but students still demanded he be fired for making the classroom, an unsafe space. And now, he stepped down from his role. That's one example. And there are more. But Jon is still stuck in the prison of two ideas. If someone complains about a problem, he'd rather say, no, that doesn't exist than actually listened to the complaint itself. But I guess that's why the show is called \"The Problem with Jon Stewart.\" The title fits. So, Kat, what do you -- why would he say -- do you think it's just him being lazy, that he just didn't bother to look up what cancel, because every night you hear about people losing their jobs?"

So, he's on a streaming service now in his office, nice decoy, he really went all out. But the point is, the point is, he is trying to find the lane, he's going to be cancel culture's champion, which will probably get the viewership up until they roll back a joke, he made 20 years ago, and then that'll be it for him. So, it again, it's always the same thing with the cancer culture. Stop being the frog because the scorpions going to sting you but we're talking about him again and for a guy who I thought had nothing left to do and moved on grew the beard, he was -- he had moved, he's a civilian now.

Saying the real reason was that Jon was making a new life with Yoko, added Paul: \"Jon walked into a room one day and said I'm leaving The Beatles. Is that instigating the split or not?\" Well, maybe that's how they wrote Hello, goodbye. McCartney insisted that he has no hard feelings against Yoko, and that she and Jon were a great couple.

Apparently, the aging members who grew up in the suburbs, instead of the city, are softer and dumber, and didn't learn the business, absolving carbs, and carbs, and public school -- did I read that correctly? And now, the younger cellphone-obsessed mobsters keep sending texts that make crimes all too easy to prove in court. Last month, alleged mobster Rob D'Amato was forced to turn himself in on a racketeering charge after his son tweeted a photo of him relaxing in a pool. So, you can see how this could be crushing to a business that is based on a code of silence. Just listen to the secret mob recording we obtained today."

Like it's, it's changed according to the new guys, but I will say this too. They say that they don't like that they use the social media stuff, because it's not a good idea. It turns out having actually worked on some terrorism cases, even when you say things like, yes, I want a crate of papayas and they say, oh great, bring those papayas, how much will they be? And they say, $30,000 a crate. Law enforcement tends to figure out that you're not selling papayas, it turns out that they could actually figure these things out.
