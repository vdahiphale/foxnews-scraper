President Trump, trying to reassure his base today that, in fact, he has been inspired, he said, by the way, Americans came together after these two devastating hurricanes, and he thinks it's now time for both parties to cut some deals and actually get the government working for the American people. And so, the president, told reporters that his meal with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, 24 hours after another bipartisan dinner here with several key senators at the White House last night, could result in a deal that gives the middle class and corporations a big tax cut while, as you are the president say there, he could live with the rich getting a tax increase.   Hillary Clinton continues to claim: the president is simply not able to accomplish. Because on this book to her, she seems to be making much the same case she tried to make in 2016: negative attacks on Donald Trump's ability to govern without making a compelling case for why Democrats would do better in power. On day two of book tour, Politico revealed today a series of private focus groups conducted in recent days showing that while Democrats have developed these constant lines of attack against the president ahead of the 2018 midterms, nothing seems to be sticking with swing voters, which is why the Web site dubbed the president \"Teflon don.\" Democratic Pollster, Celinda Lake, saying about how President Trump is bearing in these Democratic focus groups. \"People do think he's bringing about change, so it's hard to say he hasn't kept his promises.\" So, the Democrats have now headed -- script and maybe the same start. Clinton, who told NPR yesterday she's not going anywhere because she has the experience and the scars that give her the responsibility to speak out against President Trump while on NBC's \"Today Show\" she suggested today, she could maybe win another race against the president.",

And that's one of the reasons that Donald Trump's poll numbers are shown, as the Democrats are discovering, that he's hard to take on. Because what he represents is not with the media thinks about these inflammatory things he says, how can he possibly say it, but people hear him being the anti- Washington.  And there is still so much dissatisfaction with this town that Donald Trump is successfully tapped into and has retained. So, it's a much more complicated question than just left-right; it really is the outsider- insider. The question remains, though, at the end of the day: can all this fighting lead to legislation being passed? Can the (INAUDIBLE) work?

Here's the question for the Republican Party: do we have the same determination to repeal ObamaCare as Democrats had to pass it? President Trump's Vice President, Mike Pence, called me tonight to tell me that President Trump is 1000 percent on board. I sent five names of governors to get them behind this. I've got 15 Republican governors who liked the idea of a block grant to replace ObamaCare. They want the money, they want the flexibility. I'm urging my Republican leadership, don't take one boat and walk away and say it's over. Bring our bill, which is a fundamentally different approach to health care. Getting the money and power out of Washington back to the states, and let's have a debate worthy of a great country. And I will say this to the Republican Party if you walk away and you give up, we'll never get over this. It's one thing for Democrats to stop us. It's another thing for us to quit.",

I think the average American wants companies to pay their fair share and 35 percent is not their fair share. But I will tell you this about tax reform, we need to get it done, we need to get it done soon, but there is no way to save America from becoming Greece and unless you deal with health care. We're on a glide path to becoming Greece. Medicare and Medicaid alone are going to take all the money you send in taxes by 2042. This is the best and less chance to replace ObamaCare. It will destroy the American economy if we give Bernie his way. So, we got a chance to get power and money out of Washington when it comes to healthcare. We got a chance to change the tax code.

And what we've been seeing are C-5s and C- 17s taking off with food, water, and cots. Today, we rode on a helicopter with a U.S. Navy, over a 110-mile stretch of violence known as the Florida Keys. And from the sky, it doesn't look nearly as bad as it is in person. There still structures there, the keys have some of the more strict building codes in the country. But when you get down, you realize that people don't have water, power, cell phone service, gas, and it is already making an isolated place even more isolated. So, mobile homes are gone, hundreds of boats are sunk at the bottom of the ocean. Now, today in Key West, we were there at one of six distribution centers. And for the first time, we saw supplies like water and food dropped off by Chinook helicopters -- a surreal scene, Martha. People watched these helicopters land in the middle of a shopping plaza in front of a T.J. Maxx and an outback steakhouse. People ran, some barefoot, others with their children as soon as the helicopters took off. These are residents who stayed in the keys for the storm, but we met residents who either lost their homes or boats or simply are just running out of supplies. They each got a case of water, some four MREs -- which are those meals ready to eat from the military. We spoke to Bobby Urdu, who was first in line for food -- for food and water. Take a listen.",

I think they're probably a little bit upset over some of the deal that he made with Chuck Schumer. So there's probably a little back-and-forth. But, Martha, the bigger thing is, that the president already made the statement, which is why the White House had no issue with signing it at all, whatsoever. Now, the bigger question is when do we include Antifa?",

Then he unfixed it again going back to what was the line from very fine people on both sides. No fine people with the white supremacist. So I think what the Republicans who supported this were trying to do, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, may be a little Schumer payback. But more trying to clear their own name and the Republican brand name because there's a lot of conversation about the fact that if you're a Republican then you support racism, which I certainly do not believe myself, but we know that's been said. Howard Dean has commented in, and a lot of other people in high positions. So I think they were covering themselves a little bit too, here.

Our quote of the night comes from Franklin Foer new book, World without end, the existential threat of big tech. He says this. When it comes to those central tenet of individualism, free will, the tech companies have a different way. They hope to automate our choices, both large and small choices, the choices we make as we float through the day. If their algorithm that suggests the news we read, the goods we buy, the paths we travel, the friends we invite into our circle, it's hard not to marvel at this company and their inventions, which often make life infinitely easier, but we'd spent too long marveling. The time has arrived to consider the consequences of these monopolies, to reassert our role in determining the human path. Once we cross certain threshold, once we remake institutions such as media and publishing, once we abandon privacy, there is no turning back, no restoring our lost individuality. Now that is the story we're going to be talking about for some time. Hope you'll join us in the coming days. We will see you back here tomorrow night at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is up next.

For different reasons, Trump, of course, is furious, frustrated, annoyed, angry that they didn't deliver the sweet of legislative successes that he wanted to open up his term. It was part of a very uneven, unhappy beginning to the Trump term presidency. Frustrated with them, he says, OK, I'll go play with the Democrats.

And that she says that, you know, the poll finds that Democrats are naive if they think that they can, you know, sort of lock down 10 Senate seats in 24 House seats.

The Democratic Party is going through a lot of soul- searching like any party does after it loses a major election. And we're looking for those next leaders right now. Hillary Clinton is not the future of the Democratic Party. And look, I don't think Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have changed their opinion of Donald Trump. They realize that Donald Trump is a dealmaker, he's not an ideologue. And if they can get him to work with them on things like DACA, for example, on things like getting him to agree to extend the debt ceiling like they did just last week, look, they're willing to play ball if you'll come close to them and further away from the Republicans like Chris said."

The old conservative liberal way of looking at Washington, D.C., was totally thrown out the window by Donald Trump, who brought an outsider-insider to Washington. And that's one of the reasons that Donald Trump's poll numbers are shown, as the Democrats are discovering, that he's hard to take on. Because what he represents is not with the media thinks about these inflammatory things he says, how can he possibly say it, but people hear him being the anti- Washington. And there is still so much dissatisfaction with this town that Donald Trump is successfully tapped into and has retained. So, it's a much more complicated question than just left-right; it really is the outsider- insider. The question remains, though, at the end of the day: can all this fighting lead to legislation being passed? Can the (INAUDIBLE) work? And that's where, I think, it's only going to be (INAUDIBLE) at the White House. They're not going to kiss. They won't even dance."

Yes, you definitely want Unicorn. You are in a bi-mode on Unicorn's interest. But I would say this: Donald Trump is enjoying and Democrats are enjoying humiliating Mitch McConnell, embarrassing Paul Ryan, rubbing their nose in this. There are no viable replacements for those people -- nobody wants those jobs. And when all of this is over, it's going to be up to the president and his team to work through the leadership in Congress to get this done.

I'm not sure it was determinative, and I'm not sure that's a helpful conversation at to have as the party figures out what comes next.

The more Hillary Clinton speaks, the more they are reminded that elections are about choices and it's not just you measuring Donald Trump and is he doing. This was a Trump-Hillary election, and Trump won for good reasons over Hillary. And so, as Republicans have been used to now almost a year of the pummeling of Donald Trump, they're celebrating.

Under ObamaCare, four states get 40 percent of the money: New York, California, Maryland and Massachusetts. We send it back to the states, which he paired by 2026. It will allow governors to control health care with the state legislators. If you don't like your health care under my approach, you can complain to your governor or your state house member.

He moved heaven and earth to make sure ObamaCare got on the floor of the Senate and kept us in on Christmas Eve. Barack Obama did everything humanly possible to pass ObamaCare. Here's the question for the Republican Party: do we have the same determination to repeal ObamaCare as Democrats had to pass it? President Trump's Vice President, Mike Pence, called me tonight to tell me that President Trump is 1000 percent on board. I sent five names of governors to get them behind this. I've got 15 Republican governors who liked the idea of a block grant to replace ObamaCare. They want the money, they want the flexibility. I'm urging my Republican leadership, don't take one boat and walk away and say it's over. Bring our bill, which is a fundamentally different approach to health care. Getting the money and power out of Washington back to the states, and let's have a debate worthy of a great country.

So, he's going to come up with the plan to make people pay -- a lot of people pay in zero in the corporate world. He's going to pick a number, like 15 percent and make them pay. I think the average American wants companies to pay their fair share and 35 percent is not their fair share. But I will tell you this about tax reform, we need to get it done, we need to get it done soon, but there is no way to save America from becoming Greece and unless you deal with health care. We're on a glide path to becoming Greece. Medicare and Medicaid alone are going to take all the money you send in taxes by 2042. This is the best and less chance to replace ObamaCare. It will destroy the American economy if we give Bernie his way. So, we got a chance to get power and money out of Washington when it comes to healthcare. We got a chance to change the tax code.

FEMA helping out the air force, the army, the navy, the marines. Really, just one team helping out the keys. The USS Iwo Jima, the USS New York are also off of the keys ready to help. And what we've been seeing are C-5s and C- 17s taking off with food, water, and cots. Today, we rode on a helicopter with a U.S. Navy, over a 110-mile stretch of violence known as the Florida Keys. And from the sky, it doesn't look nearly as bad as it is in person. There still structures there, the keys have some of the more strict building codes in the country. But when you get down, you realize that people don't have water, power, cell phone service, gas, and it is already making an isolated place even more isolated. So, mobile homes are gone, hundreds of boats are sunk at the bottom of the ocean. Now, today in Key West, we were there at one of six distribution centers. And for the first time, we saw supplies like water and food dropped off by Chinook helicopters -- a surreal scene, Martha. People watched these helicopters land in the middle of a shopping plaza in front of a T.J. Maxx and an outback steakhouse. People ran, some barefoot, others with their children as soon as the helicopters took off. These are residents who stayed in the keys for the storm, but we met residents who either lost their homes or boats or simply are just running out of supplies. They each got a case of water, some four MREs -- which are those meals ready to eat from the military. We spoke to Bobby Urdu, who was first in line for food -- for food and water. Take a listen."

As for what the many people will be eating today its MRE's. This is a rib shaped barbecue flavored pork patty. It's enough to maybe feed somebody for the full day. And this is the type of thing that people are eating until they can finally get power restored and get those waterlines and those sewage lines and everything else together. The infrastructure here really badly damaged. Again, not from the air, doesn't look like necessarily like what you would have seen in Katrina because the water has receded, but once you get a little bit closer it's a different story.

It says -- just a small part of it, but it says it urges the president and his administration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and white supremacy. Dana, what do you think about that?"

      "speaker": "DANA LOESCH, DANA ON THE BLAZE TV HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, Martha, thank you for having me. It's basically just a formal request to something that the president has already done, two, three, and four times now, I think. I think there's also a little bit of inside baseball to this in terms of some political infighting between Republican leadership and the president. I think they're probably a little bit upset over some of the deal that he made with Chuck Schumer. So there's probably a little back-and-forth. But, Martha, the bigger thing is, that the president already made the statement, which is why the White House had no issue with signing it at all, whatsoever. Now, the bigger question is when do we include Antifa?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That is the bigger question. I mean, it raises this question, why would you, Jessica, put forward a resolution like this, and I think as Dana points out, that probably some political reasons for why they felt it was so important for him to have to sign this. And I think to their credit, they just said, OK, he's going to sign it. They don't want to make a bigger deal out of it than they have to. But it's a little bit, you know, nudgy, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think that they're just protecting themselves, because I think if the president's response which was initially, completely inadequate, and people on both sides of the aisle agreed with that. You've heard from Tim Scott, obviously. We know what happened to Gary Cohn after he came out against it. I mean, this is not adequate. Then he fixed it. Then he unfixed it again going back to what was the line from very fine people on both sides. No fine people with the white supremacist. So I think what the Republicans who supported this were trying to do, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, may be a little Schumer payback. But more trying to clear their own name and the Republican brand name because there's a lot of conversation about the fact that if you're a Republican then you support racism, which I certainly do not believe myself, but we know that's been said. Howard Dean has commented in, and a lot of other people in high positions. So I think they were covering themselves a little bit too, here. And not just mad about what happened with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's move to the other topic, which is that there's been some new appointments in the communications department at the White House. And we can put up the picture of those who are now in positions. The deputy -- the communication director now is Hope Hicks, who has really been at the president side since the very beginning. Kellyanne Conway, of course, is the senior counselor to the president. Mercedes Schlapp is added to this team, she is now going to be a strategic communications director for the president, and, of course, the press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But it's it was interesting today because after all of this was announced there was some twitter activity going on, as there always is, and this one from Hadas Gold, was just, sort of, emblematic of what we saw a lot of today. She said, almost all women. Will there be an Elle, Glamour, Vogue, Marie Claire, Cosmo spread coming soon? It's a good question. And they're ought to be because it's pretty impressive, this team. What do you think about, Dana?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOESCH",
      "utterance": "I think that's great. Of course, there's not going to be any kind of Vogue spread like Samantha Power, or anyone else received because women apparently don't count if they identify as Republicans or conservatives or libertarians or simply independent thinkers. They're immediately discounted because so many people on the left, not everyone, but a certain number of them, have tried to tie identifying as being female with identifying as being Democrat also. You can't be a woman and be anything but a Democrat. You can't be a woman and be anything but pro-choice. And so, they're not going to get that same sort of treatment, they should because their accomplishment are great."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It really is. You know, we talk about, you know, empowering women and supporting each other and all of that, it doesn't go across the party lines though, Jessica, especially with these publications."

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "I do want to say massive congratulations for Mercedes Schlapp, who I absolutely adore. I would miss her greatly because I'm on and off with her. I would say that Dana is absolutely correct, and yours as well, that there isn't going to be a spread about this. But I think that it's not just the fact that they're conservatives. I think it's because they support policies that don't help women. And the Democratic platform is very clear about this that they want to support policies that raise women up. That's raising the minimum wage. That's making sure you have access to health care, as much economic opportunity as possible. So that's where."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So their voices have to be banished from these publications? There are plenty of women's on the other side of the aisle who believe that they are very supportive of women."

      "utterance": "Guys, I got to jump in. I'm sorry. We've got to leave it there, Jessica and Dana. But I think it's about respecting the fact that women have all different opinions on these things. That they ought to be represented, they ought to be credited when they achieve a position like this at the White House. So, thank you both for being here. So a new protest breaking out in Charlottesville, tonight, this time targeting UVA founder and the author of our declaration of independence, Thomas Jefferson, protesters calling him racist and a rapist. Plus, new concerns about violence at UC Berkeley as the school readies for a pair of events featuring well-known conservative, including Ben Shapiro. We're going to get Governor Mike Huckabee's take on that right after this."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So now school is back in session, and across the country we are witnessing the latest in a long debate over free speech on college campuses. Just last night at the University of Virginia, demonstrators climb on top of a Thomas Jefferson statue, the founder of course of UVA, they covered it with a black shroud and protest of the school's handling of recent white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville. The protesters labeling the former president a racist and a rapist. Joining us now former Arkansas governor, Mike Huckabee, a Fox News contributor, good to see you, governor. What do you think about all of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm just so glad that President Teresa Sullivan, the president of UVA, brought her brain to work because a lot of college presidents apparently don't. But she stood up for a simple reality, that Thomas Jefferson was a flawed man but he was also a great man, and if you read the declaration of independence, the very sort of birthday card for this country, how can you not appreciate at least the extraordinary understanding that he had in the time in which he wrote it? And I just think that some of these students, did they not know that the University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson? Were they ignorant and completely unaware of any of his own personal history? Why did they go to school at the University of Virginia? And I would love to ask them where in America could you go, and go to a school that was founded by somebody who was utterly perfect? I mean, the bible is filled with people who were imperfect, and I think only Jesus measures up to the person without sin."

      "utterance": "Well, the sad thing is, statues don't really hurt us. But I'll tell you what hurts us, what hurts us are the bodies of human beings who continually want to stamp out every vestige of who we once were, who we are, and I don't understand what the goal is. This nonsense of saying that we're not going to listen to our history. That's a dangerous thing, Martha. Our history is what gives us perspective. And, you know, if a culture doesn't know its history it's the same as an individual not having a personal memory. If I woke up tomorrow and didn't know who I was, where I came from, who my parents were, anything about my background, I'd be utterly lost. And a culture and a civilization that has no clue to its history is utterly lost. And this is why we study history. History is to the culture what memory is to the individual."

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, it is. And you go back through history, I mean, where does this stop? Do we get rid of the Jefferson Memorial, Mount Rushmore? And who else do we need to eliminate? Do we eliminate Bill Clinton? He was a man that did some pretty, let's just say untoward things in the oval office as president. Do we get rid of John Kennedy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Where does it stop?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So here's a very hot topic, the role that tech companies increasingly play in our lives, our commerce and our politics, companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple. Our quote of the night comes from Franklin Foer new book, World without end, the existential threat of big tech. He says this. When it comes to those central tenet of individualism, free will, the tech companies have a different way. They hope to automate our choices, both large and small choices, the choices we make as we float through the day. If their algorithm that suggests the news we read, the goods we buy, the paths we travel, the friends we invite into our circle, it's hard not to marvel at this company and their inventions, which often make life infinitely easier, but we'd spent too long marveling. The time has arrived to consider the consequences of these monopolies, to reassert our role in determining the human path. Once we cross certain threshold, once we remake institutions such as media and publishing, once we abandon privacy, there is no turning back, no restoring our lost individuality. Now that is the story we're going to be talking about for some time. Hope you'll join us in the coming days. We will see you back here tomorrow night at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is up next.
