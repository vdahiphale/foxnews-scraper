That means retail restaurants, salons, barbershops can all be open again at 25 or 50 percent capacity. But in Orlando today, as you mentioned, Universal CityWalk, the retail and restaurants, at least some of them, reopening now to people to come spend some money. Disney World is doing the same next week for its very similar setup called Disney Springs.  As for when all of Florida's famous theme parks will open, SeaWorld, Universal, Disney World, no firm dates yet. But I can say Disney World is taking reservations for the month of July.   Up in Hollywood, Florida, residents are clearly happy that the Broadwalk along the beach there is now open again for three hours of morning exercise and fresh air. Today was day two and, notably, many not wearing masks. Around the country, most states now have lifted coronavirus shutdown restrictions, at least partially, 43 states by our count, and, by next Wednesday, it will be 46 states.

That would include cities like Rochester, Utica, also Binghamton, New York, less affected by the hard-hit cases that had hit the New York metropolitan area.

For example, hair, we had people who had single shops. We had people who had multiple shops. We had people who do nails. Put them on -- in a group together and say, come up with the best practices. And the good thing was, Neil, there was really very little dispute between the health people on the group and the people who were running the business or the professions. They all came to an agreement. We put those best practices out. We said, look, if you're going to open back up, this is what you have to do. So, when someone walks in to get their hair cut tomorrow, they're going to know that who is ever cutting their hair is following the best practices that we know of that can -- that can take place and keep people as safe as is possible.  So, we went about it in a careful way. We have also kind of layered this. We haven't -- didn't do everything at once. We have spread it out over a few-week period of time.  But, as you and I have talked, we still are obviously concerned. One of the things I said to Ohioans today at my press conference is, it's now more important than ever that you keep the social distance, that you -- if you're out in public, wear a mask. These are things that are very, very important, because we're opening up the economy. We know there's more contact. People are moving around more. So the risk goes up.

This afternoon, he hosted roundtable events discussing the pandemic with former rival Michael Bloomberg and possible V.P. candidate Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. An April FOX News poll showed Pennsylvania voters prefer Biden in a head- to-head matchup with Trump, with six in 10 saying the Trump administration was too slow to act on coronavirus.

      "sentences": "It's like we moved the markets on \"Cavuto,\" your FOX Business News, FOX Business show, when we started talking about deal talks, and particularly as they relate to banks. I mean, banks have taken the pandemic's lockdowns pretty hard. Bank shares have been off lately. Deals that involve mergers often -- that's often a self-correcting -- correcting mechanism for companies that are under financial distress.  Goldman Sachs is the name we hear. And Goldman's had a rough year, even rougher lately, given what's going on in the markets. What we understand is that there's lots of chatter out there from bankers, Neil, that Goldman Sachs is going to find a merger partner, possibly a big bank. The names we keep hearing is PNC Bank, which recently sold out its stake in BlackRock, the big money management firm. So, clearly, it could be looking for something else to do. Another firm is Wells Fargo, as you know, the bank in L.A., been in a lot of trouble lately over their phony accounts scandal. Looking to jump-start itself. So that name has been in the mix as well. U.S. Bancorp has always been in the mix with Goldman. From what I understand, Goldman Sachs officials have looked at that deal. They have walked in the past. And one of the reasons why they walked in the past is because of management issues. Who would control it? Usually, when Goldman Sachs engages in these talks, Neil, one are the main reasons why they break down is because Goldman wants to run the show, but they don't have the size anymore to run the show. The banks are -- that they are looking to team with are bigger, and their management wants to run the combined entity. So that's where it breaks down. But there's no doubt, in the market right now, there's a lot of smoke about Goldman Sachs teaming up with some -- with another player. It helped the markets, because Goldman Sachs is a widely held stock. It helped financials, because people think there could be deal-making. And, usually, deal-making leads to higher stock prices.",

But, for sure, we need to know what Obama and Biden knew, and when did they know it. And we also need to know, when it comes to this unmasking of American citizens' names that are supposed to never be disclosed because of constitutional protection, most of that unmasking is done within the intelligence community, because they know what else they need to know about an American citizen maybe working for a foreign government. But it's very curious that at the highest political levels of the president of the United States that they're involved with the unmasking. And that's a -- that's a real issue. We got to get to the bottom of it. Is it for intelligence purposes or is it for political purposes? And three years of digging into this, I have come to the conclusion it's more for political purposes. And for Democrats right today that are saying we're doing this for political reasons, I want to remind them that Senator Feinstein, the Democrat of California, and I sent a letter to the Justice Department February of 2017 asking for the transcripts of the ambassador, Russian ambassador, talking to Flynn.

You would do it through an interview. So it's a little too soon to tell. But, certainly, it is in the realm of possibility, bordering on likelihood, because there was this huge flurry of interest in this Kislyak communication with an American. By the way, poor General Flynn, not only in light of what's been happening on the legal front, but we now know that essentially he was cleared at the lower levels of the FBI after a five-month investigation into whether he had connections with the Russians.

But what it basically is, is, it's a group of decision trees here for everything from schools to businesses and what they need to do in open -- in order to open safely. And there's a lot of commonality here between all of these. Let's look at the school one here first, promote healthy hygiene practices, handwashing, employees wearing a face covering, if possible, intensify cleaning and disinfection. And then there comes down to some specific guidelines, like encourage social distancing in schools through increased spacing, small groups, limited mixing between groups, if feasible. Let's put up the next graphic, which is workplaces. You can see that what changes there is, when you come down to encouraging social distancing, it's enhancing spacing between employees through physical barriers, changing layout of workspaces, encouraging telework, closing or limiting access to communal spacings, staggering shifts and breaks, limiting large events, where feasible. A lot of commonality between these and also some specificity as well. So, basically, what you do is, you go -- you start at the left and you go through the decision tree. If you don't have all of those satisfied, then you don't open, you go back, you re-mitigate. But if you proceed to yes, then you go to the next phase, proceed to yes, and go to the next phase after that, then you can open. The president here, as you see, coming down the stairs at Joint Base Andrews after being in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at a company that is helping to replenish the National Stockpile of protective equipment. The president should be back to the White House in about 15 for 20 minutes or so. One of the things that the president did this morning on his way out was, he gave us a very big tease, Neil, as to something coming on vaccines tomorrow. I have discovered that what the president is going to announce tomorrow officially is a public-private partnership, a real Manhattan Project-style of thing. It really involves the private sector and the Department of Defense to develop a vaccine. We know the players who are going to be involved in that, Neil. What we have not gotten yet is the official rollout of that, and that will come tomorrow. So, some new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control today, tomorrow, the rollout of this new vaccine initiative. One thing I should point out, though, is that these decision trees that the CDC has put out on their Web site, they're very difficult to find. So, if you go to my Twitter feed, you can find some direct links to them. Also, it does not include some of the guidelines we talked about yesterday, which were more stringent than the guidelines that the White House had put out. For example, the White House says you can resume nonessential business travel in phase two. The CDC wanted to hold that to phase three. So that hasn't changed. But they do have these new decision trees here to help you go through the process of getting ready to reopen -- Neil.",

He said that he wanted more virus samples earlier on, and he also sounded alarm that we needed more PPE. There's a really easy way to refute these charges, in the sense that all the administration has to do is just prove that there was a broader interagency effort to secure some of this. And we know that they were. It wasn't -- it wasn't part of BARDA, which is what Dr. Bright is director of. That's a very small area within the N -- or within HHS. So when it comes to PPE and the virus samples, yes, well, let me tell you the common denominator there. That is China. And China is notorious into keeping information during global pandemics, like they did here. And they weren't doing virus sampling in the beginning. Yes, they gave us the genetic sequencing, but we needed virus sampling. And it wasn't until the end of January that Australia was able to identify the virus in one of their infected citizens. But, at that point, over five million people had already left Wuhan, China, which is why we saw so many cases of this virus across the world. And then in terms of PPE, well, yes, the National Stockpile was deficient in PPE. But guess what? We also have a supply problem, Neil, because 50 percent of our PPE, ventilators, a lot of the medications or -- is actually manufactured in China. So that's the common denominator here. And, again, I appreciate what he is saying, that he needed these things in the beginning. But I have to tell him that I'm pretty sure that there was a larger, broader effort also demanding these things. We know President Trump has a tendency to just pick up the phone, like he did. He said that he actually was communicating with the president of China to try and get the virus samples. And he was actually trying to get more PPE. He invoked the Defense Production Act mid-March. So we know that there were other efforts to do this that maybe Dr. Bright wasn't privy to in his limited role at BARDA.",

For example, hair, we had people who had single shops. We had people who had multiple shops. We had people who do nails. Put them on -- in a group together and say, come up with the best practices. And the good thing was, Neil, there was really very little dispute between the health people on the group and the people who were running the business or the professions. They all came to an agreement. We put those best practices out. We said, look, if you're going to open back up, this is what you have to do. So, when someone walks in to get their hair cut tomorrow, they're going to know that who is ever cutting their hair is following the best practices that we know of that can -- that can take place and keep people as safe as is possible. So, we went about it in a careful way. We have also kind of layered this. We haven't -- didn't do everything at once. We have spread it out over a few-week period of time. But, as you and I have talked, we still are obviously concerned. One of the things I said to Ohioans today at my press conference is, it's now more important than ever that you keep the social distance, that you -- if you're out in public, wear a mask. These are things that are very, very important, because we're opening up the economy. We know there's more contact. People are moving around more. So the risk goes up.

But the reason the health professionals tell you that you need to do that is not so much that you're worried directly about those kids, but that this is a great place to spread it. And so take a class of 25 kids, 26 kids, and they're all from different families, and they come in, and one of them is not showing any signs, no temperature or anything, but we know many people who have this don't show the signs.

      "utterance": "It's like we moved the markets on \"Cavuto,\" your FOX Business News, FOX Business show, when we started talking about deal talks, and particularly as they relate to banks. I mean, banks have taken the pandemic's lockdowns pretty hard. Bank shares have been off lately. Deals that involve mergers often -- that's often a self-correcting -- correcting mechanism for companies that are under financial distress. Goldman Sachs is the name we hear. And Goldman's had a rough year, even rougher lately, given what's going on in the markets. What we understand is that there's lots of chatter out there from bankers, Neil, that Goldman Sachs is going to find a merger partner, possibly a big bank. The names we keep hearing is PNC Bank, which recently sold out its stake in BlackRock, the big money management firm. So, clearly, it could be looking for something else to do. Another firm is Wells Fargo, as you know, the bank in L.A., been in a lot of trouble lately over their phony accounts scandal. Looking to jump-start itself. So that name has been in the mix as well. U.S. Bancorp has always been in the mix with Goldman. From what I understand, Goldman Sachs officials have looked at that deal. They have walked in the past. And one of the reasons why they walked in the past is because of management issues. Who would control it? Usually, when Goldman Sachs engages in these talks, Neil, one are the main reasons why they break down is because Goldman wants to run the show, but they don't have the size anymore to run the show. The banks are -- that they are looking to team with are bigger, and their management wants to run the combined entity. So that's where it breaks down. But there's no doubt, in the market right now, there's a lot of smoke about Goldman Sachs teaming up with some -- with another player. It helped the markets, because Goldman Sachs is a widely held stock. It helped financials, because people think there could be deal-making. And, usually, deal-making leads to higher stock prices."

All right, well, we know right now that a lot of people want to know exactly what some higher-ups in the Obama administration, all the way up to President Obama himself, why they were so interested in unmasking a certain individual. We're beginning to put it all together -- after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, well, someone has some explaining to do, maybe lots of someone at the Obama White House in the final days of that administration. At least, that's the way Senator Chuck Grassley sees it, when he was talking about the unmasking that itself has to be unmasked. Chuck Grassley."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA)",
      "utterance": "We do know that there was a meeting took place on January 5 at the White House, that all these people, including Biden, were involved and Obama involved, and that there was a leak to the press, and the leak to the press on January the 12th was a criminal act. And we need to pursue all these facts, how -- if -- I hope Graham does have a hearing. And if he has a hearing, I'm going to be there participating. But, in the meantime, I have got my investigative team in the Finance Committee working on this full time. And we're going to follow these facts to where they lead us. But, for sure, we need to know what Obama and Biden knew, and when did they know it. And we also need to know, when it comes to this unmasking of American citizens' names that are supposed to never be disclosed because of constitutional protection, most of that unmasking is done within the intelligence community, because they know what else they need to know about an American citizen maybe working for a foreign government. But it's very curious that at the highest political levels of the president of the United States that they're involved with the unmasking. And that's a -- that's a real issue. We got to get to the bottom of it. Is it for intelligence purposes or is it for political purposes? And three years of digging into this, I have come to the conclusion it's more for political purposes. And for Democrats right today that are saying we're doing this for political reasons, I want to remind them that Senator Feinstein, the Democrat of California, and I sent a letter to the Justice Department February of 2017 asking for the transcripts of the ambassador, Russian ambassador, talking to Flynn. And we still -- we didn't get them now, and we're asking for them again. So, this is something I have been working on that had nothing to do with the pandemic. So, I take very personal the fact that, somehow, we are just being political because this is a political year and because Biden's involved in this."

    {
      "speaker": "GRASSLEY",

He could be saying that sincerely, but you have got to connect that to the fact that he lied on television time after time about Russian involvement and he didn't know of any intent of the -- for political reasons to get involved in that. And then, when he testifies before the committees under oath, he says he didn't have any intelligence whatsoever that connected him that would tell him that we had anything to worry about."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we might have not clarified the real newsmaking element in that interview. It started out with Chuck Grassley saying that he was not going to tell Lindsey Graham to call President Obama as a witness, as President Trump had recommended, but he said it would -- it would probably be a good idea. Now, I'm going to raise this with Ken Starr, the former Whitewater independent counsel, FOX News contributor, more importantly to us. Ken, the issue started with Grassley, of course, the head of that very committee Lindsey Graham runs now, that would be responsible to try to take this to the next level if they do and to call Barack Obama as a witness to that committee. How likely do you think that is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEN STARR, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It is all dependent, Neil, on the facts. And you build your case a step at a time, gather the facts, assess the facts. And then, if the facts point to the president -- and we know about the January 5 meeting -- then there is a compelling need to get his testimony to hear what he has to say about it. You would do it through an interview. So it's a little too soon to tell. But, certainly, it is in the realm of possibility, bordering on likelihood, because there was this huge flurry of interest in this Kislyak communication with an American. By the way, poor General Flynn, not only in light of what's been happening on the legal front, but we now know that essentially he was cleared at the lower levels of the FBI after a five-month investigation into whether he had connections with the Russians. And by this time, remember, he was the designated national security adviser to the incoming president of the United States. It's all very odd."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Ken, what's odd to me is so many administration officials, very high-up officials, as I said, to the vice president at the time, seeking this unmasking, in other words, not knowing, ostensibly, who the person was who was having these discussions with the Russian ambassador, but trying to find out who that would be, leading to, obviously, General Flynn. But does it seem odd to you that either that many either didn't know or were trying simultaneously to find out and get to them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "It is odd to me that so many people were trying to find out through their own resources, as opposed to allowing the intelligence community, the appropriate people, to say, hey, to piece all these things together, we in the intelligence community need an unmasking. But why did the chief of staff to the president of the United States need to unmask? Why did Vice President Biden need to unmask? There's been no explanation for that. And so one of the reasons I would frankly be suspicious right now is the failure of memory of person after person, Samantha Power, others, who just said, well, I just don't remember. And you just can't accept that at face value. Amnesia on the part of Washington, D.C., senior officials occurs much too frequently and much too conveniently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Democrats have come back largely -- I think I'm getting the gist of their argument, Ken -- to say, this is meant to focus more on the investigators, rather than the investigated. And it's sort of like a shell game that the White House is playing now to take the attention off of the investigation itself. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Well, but the investigation itself has proved to have been fruitless and feckless. It should not have continued on into January, it being the investigation into General Flynn. That's the underlying investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, the fact that they were relentless at it -- I just want to understand. The fact that they were relentless at it, Ken, catches your attention, that they didn't just drop it? This was something that was in wave after wave, higher-up after higher-up, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "That's correct. It is so odd that you had so many people and at increasingly high levels. Again, it raises a lot of, I think, very serious questions. We don't have the answers to them. But it is very good reason to be suspicious."

Again, there's been no indication certainly out of President Obama's office whether he would even entertain being called to a committee. The president of the United States, Donald Trump, has said that he would recommend it. We will have more after this."

It's a company that's making all these face mask, gloves, hospital gowns. Got the president's attention, certainly. The CEO of that company, Ed Pesicka, joins us right now, the big cheese at Owens & Minor. Ed, very good to have you. How was it there today with the president? EDWARD PESICKA, CEO, OWENS & MINOR: I'll tell you, Neil, it was great. And it was great for our teammates here. Our teammates at this facility have been working 24/7 really since back in February, along with all the other teammates at our distribution centers. So just to put it in perspective, since February, we have distributed over three billion units of PPE across the United States through our distribution facilities. In addition to that, it was another honor to have him here to recognize our manufacturing teammates that have been working 24/7 also since February to increase production of N95s, of our masks, our iso gowns. So, extremely proud of our teammates and extremely happy for the president to come here and recognize them."

So, I think that's a big part of it, is just our approach to what we have - - how we have handled the situation."

Because, in some cases, you have produced far more than is certainly needed right now. Now, God forbid it's needed down the road, that you're accommodating that, but like a central medical supply warehouse or station?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PESICKA",
      "utterance": "I think that's what the medical distribution companies do. It's actually the ability to store that product, properly rotate it, so it doesn't expire, and then get it out to the customers when they need it. That was part of the tour today. We displayed what one day of PPE looks like at a major hospital, in addition to that, our ability to pick hundreds of lines per person, per hour at any unit of measure that the customer wants. So, I think the value of medical distribution is really what was appropriate today and what we talked about."

That's what we do from an organization to keep our teammates safe. We have instituted that back in early February. And we -- to keep our teammates safe, we wear gloves, we wear masks, as well as do temperature check. I tell you, the other nice thing about a 200,000-square-foot warehouse is, it enables us to social distance during our production. And if you saw on TV, we were social distancing even in the audience, with six feet between everybody."

Had a big event that got the president out of Washington today to let the workers there know he appreciates what they are doing. Real quick peek at the corner of Wall and Broad today, in case I did not mention it a little earlier, but did want to remind you, we were down as much as 400 points for a while on the Dow, finishing at almost the exact reversal of that, on talk that, right now, things look good for banks, that maybe people got a little ahead of themselves yesterday. It's a snapshot. It's one day. It does not trend make, but, for today, more green than red. Stay with us. When the CDC issues them when it comes to what we look for to get states to reopen, they get a lot of attention, especially when John Roberts gets ahold of them. John, what are you finding out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Now, this is something that we expected to come from the CDC today. And it's just out now on the Web site. It's a little bit difficult to navigate to. But what it basically is, is, it's a group of decision trees here for everything from schools to businesses and what they need to do in open -- in order to open safely. And there's a lot of commonality here between all of these. Let's look at the school one here first, promote healthy hygiene practices, handwashing, employees wearing a face covering, if possible, intensify cleaning and disinfection. And then there comes down to some specific guidelines, like encourage social distancing in schools through increased spacing, small groups, limited mixing between groups, if feasible. Let's put up the next graphic, which is workplaces. You can see that what changes there is, when you come down to encouraging social distancing, it's enhancing spacing between employees through physical barriers, changing layout of workspaces, encouraging telework, closing or limiting access to communal spacings, staggering shifts and breaks, limiting large events, where feasible. A lot of commonality between these and also some specificity as well. So, basically, what you do is, you go -- you start at the left and you go through the decision tree. If you don't have all of those satisfied, then you don't open, you go back, you re-mitigate. But if you proceed to yes, then you go to the next phase, proceed to yes, and go to the next phase after that, then you can open. The president here, as you see, coming down the stairs at Joint Base Andrews after being in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at a company that is helping to replenish the National Stockpile of protective equipment. The president should be back to the White House in about 15 for 20 minutes or so. One of the things that the president did this morning on his way out was, he gave us a very big tease, Neil, as to something coming on vaccines tomorrow. I have discovered that what the president is going to announce tomorrow officially is a public-private partnership, a real Manhattan Project-style of thing. It really involves the private sector and the Department of Defense to develop a vaccine. We know the players who are going to be involved in that, Neil. What we have not gotten yet is the official rollout of that, and that will come tomorrow. So, some new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control today, tomorrow, the rollout of this new vaccine initiative. One thing I should point out, though, is that these decision trees that the CDC has put out on their Web site, they're very difficult to find. So, if you go to my Twitter feed, you can find some direct links to them. Also, it does not include some of the guidelines we talked about yesterday, which were more stringent than the guidelines that the White House had put out. For example, the White House says you can resume nonessential business travel in phase two. The CDC wanted to hold that to phase three. So that hasn't changed. But they do have these new decision trees here to help you go through the process of getting ready to reopen -- Neil."

The indications from the doctor were that it will drag on. This on the same day we learned from the World Health Organization that this could be a problem, forget about the rest of this year to next year, like forever, which really rattled a lot of folks. Dr. Nicole Saphier with us right now, \"Make America Healthy Again,\" the bestselling book, of course, more importantly to us, a FOX News contributor. Doctor, what do you make of what this whistle-blower is saying, now what the World Health Organization is warning? That's sort of like a double damning statement there. What do you make of it?"

    {
      "speaker": "DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, so we have to think about some of the things that Dr. Bright mentioned. He said that he wanted more virus samples earlier on, and he also sounded alarm that we needed more PPE. There's a really easy way to refute these charges, in the sense that all the administration has to do is just prove that there was a broader interagency effort to secure some of this. And we know that they were. It wasn't -- it wasn't part of BARDA, which is what Dr. Bright is director of. That's a very small area within the N -- or within HHS. So when it comes to PPE and the virus samples, yes, well, let me tell you the common denominator there. That is China. And China is notorious into keeping information during global pandemics, like they did here. And they weren't doing virus sampling in the beginning. Yes, they gave us the genetic sequencing, but we needed virus sampling. And it wasn't until the end of January that Australia was able to identify the virus in one of their infected citizens. But, at that point, over five million people had already left Wuhan, China, which is why we saw so many cases of this virus across the world. And then in terms of PPE, well, yes, the National Stockpile was deficient in PPE. But guess what? We also have a supply problem, Neil, because 50 percent of our PPE, ventilators, a lot of the medications or -- is actually manufactured in China. So that's the common denominator here. And, again, I appreciate what he is saying, that he needed these things in the beginning. But I have to tell him that I'm pretty sure that there was a larger, broader effort also demanding these things. We know President Trump has a tendency to just pick up the phone, like he did. He said that he actually was communicating with the president of China to try and get the virus samples. And he was actually trying to get more PPE. He invoked the Defense Production Act mid-March. So we know that there were other efforts to do this that maybe Dr. Bright wasn't privy to in his limited role at BARDA."

But we already heard earlier this week during the testimony from the doctors that they have already secured different contracts to make sure that we have hundreds of millions of these in case that we do find a safe and effective vaccine in the future.
