He stood with them on the campaign trail, and he stood with them in his address to Congress. So, now that DACA is in danger and they watch all of this, what do they think about all of this?

The president touched down in West Palm Beach, Florida, just a short time ago. Air Force touching down after a blinding thunderstorm there in West Palm and here comes the president out now along with Melania, and he'll spend the weekend at Mar-a-Lago; Barron, there, with them as well. Before heading back to Washington D.C., for what he hopes will be a much quieter beginning to his week, than the end of this week.  We're also learning some preliminary details of the president's physical that was conducted this afternoon at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. According to Dr. Ronny Jackson, he was the White House physician who examined him: \"The president's physical exam today at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center went exceptionally well. The president is in excellent health. And I look forward to debriefing some of the details on Tuesday.\" We won't learn everything about itself, but we will get a good idea of how he's feeling.   Now to the other big story today, we can go back to those pictures in West Palm Beach, then I guess you can call it the \"S\" storm, over the president calling several countries around the world from which the United States, against its immigrants, \"S\" holes. It remains to be seen whether or not the president's comments on all of this are going to affect negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which will begin in earnest next week. Of course, the president had that big meeting here at the White House earlier this week; 22 members of Congress over where he appeared to earn an awful lot of political capital. One of the big questions now is: has he squandered all of that? Certainly, this has been a distraction today. Watch what happened when the president was on in the proclamation of -- for MLK Day on Monday and got up to leave the room. And they had a bunch of question shouted at him by the National Press Corps. Listen here.",

President Trump denies that he ever used the word \"S-hole\" to describe Haiti and other nations, though he did acknowledge in a tweet that he said Haiti was a poor and troubled country. And while Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois who was at the meeting, insisted President Trump used that word several times. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, who were also there saying, they didn't hear it; released a joint statement to the contrary saying, \"We do not recall the president saying these comments specifically, but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest.\"  Now, the real danger for the president here is that he risks losing leverage in the days ahead in his efforts to get what he wants in the DACA deal. This morning, the president very loudly insisted on Twitter that the deal that was brought to him yesterday was no good, that it didn't adequately fund a wall, made chain migration and the lottery worse. Democrats, though, are going to try to drag this out as long as they can. There are already plans for a censure resolution that the president and Congress, and there were some talks as well that this could increase the chances of a government shutdown on January 19th, which the Democrats would then try to blame on the president and probably pointed to this as one of the reasons why.  Just when the president got up a huge head of steam of political goodwill, as I mentioned earlier, from that meeting earlier today, he may have just sort of given it all away in a singular moment. With an ill-timed comment, Martha, that he should have known given some of the company would never stay in the room. But of course, all of this is heading, not toward the DACA negotiations, not toward the budget negotiations, but toward next November when the Democrats are going to try to give the president some very big coattails and try to drag down Republican candidates across the country.

The argument of people who want to extend temporary status is that we have to do it even if it's been 18 years because we can't send people back to these hellholes where they're from. And yet, the people who want to end the temporary status are supposedly referring to these countries at these places that are horrible. It doesn't quite make sense. It also doesn't make sense because Donald Trump's big push from our current incoherent immigration policy is to merit-based immigration, where you judge people based on their skills, their education, their language abilities, their chance for success in this country. And of course, that doesn't matter where you come from if you're being judged on merit. So, I don't think we have a full understanding of what the president's comments ran its bad language, but it doesn't really match with what his overall policy is.

And I know that there's this theme that people are saying this could be a Democrat wave in 2018.   Typically, the party in the White House loses seats. Well, with all of these things going well in the economy, I'm still confused as to what the Democrats are actually running on in 2018. I mean, if the economy is going great, the market is going great, what are they going run on? Resistance? Impeachment? Hey, put us back in power so we can raise your taxes? So, I'm still confused as to what the actual message of Democrats is going to be in 2018. And let's not forget, in the Senate, the Senate map heavily favors Republicans.

And that's why a lot of people like (INAUDIBLE) are actually backing away from this, coupled with Republican popularity and the president's own popularity there. But returning to Pennsylvania's 18th, I don't actually see Conor Lamb winning there. I think it's a 12-point lead for Saccone. But what I do think is really interesting is that Conor Lamb came outside days ago and said that he wouldn't support Nancy Pelosi for a leadership position anymore. And I believe that that's going to be a trend, especially for younger Democrats coming up. We've heard a lot about how it's time for a change, and that we need younger, new more progressive leadership.

And I don't think they're going to be approved by Congress or Europe. But, here's something -- I'm going to break some news here. This is based on a friend of mine who met with the president in December. The president told my friend, when he decertify the deal in October, he never thought Congress would fix it. And I don't think he thinks Congress will ever fix it. So you might ask why did the president do what he did today? Here is the second thing my friend was told. North Korea is the president's priority. He does not want both situations to blow up simultaneously. I think that that makes a lot of sense and it makes me feel better about a decision that on the face of it looks very bad. Let me make one final point. I think there are senior officials who are leaving this government over the next 120 days. I think one will be Rex Tillerson, one may be H.R. McMaster.

In December of 2013, Baruch college freshman Chun Deng, who goes by Michael, collapsed after taking part in a ritual called the glass ceiling. It is a gauntlet meant to represent the plight of Asian-Americans where pledges are blindfolded and wear a backpack filled with sand while being confronted by fraternity brothers. The grand juror reports that Michael Deng was being defiant and resistant and so fraternity members forcefully and repeatedly hit him and knocked him to the ground. In some cases running directly at him with their heads down from 15 feet away. Michael Deng fell unconscious. The fraternity members considered getting an ambulance but thought it would be too expensive. So instead they changed his clothing and tried to revive him. Googling phrases like concussion, can't wake up. The 19-year-old died the next day. In all, 37 people face charges. The four fraternity members facing the most serious charges were all sentenced between one and two years in prison. And the fraternity itself was banned in Pennsylvania for 10 years. In her ruling, Judge Margherita Patti-Worthington called this the most troubling case in her 19 years on the bench. She also noted the dangers of hazing by pointing to a case this program has covered extensively, the death of 19-year-old Tim Piazza, who after a pledge night of drunken partying, fell numerous times including down a flight of stairs and never regained consciousness. In the death of Michael Deng, Pi Delta Psi released a statement saying its members feel shame and dishonor that fraternity brothers could be so callous and inhumane.

Five are still missing tonight. The oldest victim was 89 years old. The youngest was just three. In tribute, here are some of their stories. After raising their two children in Orange County, Jim and Alice Mitchell realized their dream of coming home to Montecito. Their home was filled with Alice's artwork. Their daughter called them an adorable couple and said they were in love with their home. As a young woman, Rebecca Riskin landed a role dancing with the American Ballet Theater. She later became a successful realtor. Her company says it intends to carry out her life's work with the same strength and grace and elegance that wholly defined Rebecca (ph). She is survived by her husband, children, and a grandson. Roy Rohter was in the real estate business and founded a Catholic school in Ventura. The school's headmaster says he will miss Roy's infectious love of the faith and of life and for all things true, good and beautiful. He lived in Montecito with his wife. Our prayers are with their families and those who are still being searched for tonight. That is \"The Story\" for this week. Tucker Carlson is up next.

It remains to be seen whether or not the president's comments on all of this are going to affect negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which will begin in earnest next week. Of course, the president had that big meeting here at the White House earlier this week; 22 members of Congress over where he appeared to earn an awful lot of political capital. One of the big questions now is: has he squandered all of that? Certainly, this has been a distraction today.

President Trump denies that he ever used the word \"S-hole\" to describe Haiti and other nations, though he did acknowledge in a tweet that he said Haiti was a poor and troubled country. And while Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois who was at the meeting, insisted President Trump used that word several times. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, who were also there saying, they didn't hear it; released a joint statement to the contrary saying, \"We do not recall the president saying these comments specifically, but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest.\" Now, the real danger for the president here is that he risks losing leverage in the days ahead in his efforts to get what he wants in the DACA deal. This morning, the president very loudly insisted on Twitter that the deal that was brought to him yesterday was no good, that it didn't adequately fund a wall, made chain migration and the lottery worse. Democrats, though, are going to try to drag this out as long as they can. There are already plans for a censure resolution that the president and Congress, and there were some talks as well that this could increase the chances of a government shutdown on January 19th, which the Democrats would then try to blame on the president and probably pointed to this as one of the reasons why. Just when the president got up a huge head of steam of political goodwill, as I mentioned earlier, from that meeting earlier today, he may have just sort of given it all away in a singular moment. With an ill-timed comment, Martha, that he should have known given some of the company would never stay in the room. But of course, all of this is heading, not toward the DACA negotiations, not toward the budget negotiations, but toward next November when the Democrats are going to try to give the president some very big coattails and try to drag down Republican candidates across the country.

This DACA program that the liberals claim have such, you know, they're contributing members of society. 24 percent of them are illiterate in English. Only 42 percent of them have basic English comprehension. And 49 percent of them have not graduated from high school. And there's a huge percentage of them that are on welfare programs. What I think our politicians need to be doing, and Mitch McConnell needs to take this to the Senate floor; we need Kates Law passed, and we need No Sanctuary for Criminals Act passed because both of those things deal with over 900,000 convicted illegal felons who are roaming the streets of America. And our politicians don't care about our safety, and they want to make a big deal about protecting these DACA people. Do what you need to do first. Mitch McConnell, quit throwing this back on angel mom and dad, so we to pressure Trump to give us more airtime in order to enable you to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote. And do what you were elected to."

But with that being said, I think we can do both of these things. It's not hard to do both, and I think that's what Senator Dick Durbin from Illinois was trying to do when he presented his deal to the president. Democrats are willing to give on border security, willing to give more money to make sure that the border is secure. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we protect those individuals who came to this country of no fault of their own, who either in college, have a job, or are serving in our military. And on top of that, we want to make sure that we protect those who have temporary status in the country who are working and contributing to our society. And what the president --"

But I think there's a lot we don't understand about the comments that he leaked. You know, that he's claimed-- we're talking about, you know, whether to extend temporary status. The argument of people who want to extend temporary status is that we have to do it even if it's been 18 years because we can't send people back to these hellholes where they're from. And yet, the people who want to end the temporary status are supposedly referring to these countries at these places that are horrible. It doesn't quite make sense. It also doesn't make sense because Donald Trump's big push from our current incoherent immigration policy is to merit-based immigration, where you judge people based on their skills, their education, their language abilities, their chance for success in this country. And of course, that doesn't matter where you come from if you're being judged on merit. So, I don't think we have a full understanding of what the president's comments ran its bad language, but it doesn't really match with what his overall policy is. But most importantly, like your first guest said, this is just ridiculous. I mean, people will do anything to keep from talking about our problems with our immigration policy and how to fix it, and it's really getting disgusting for a lot of people to watch."

These 30 Republicans have said, sayonara, at least, to their seat in the House. Democrats only need to take 24 seats to regain control of the House, which, of course, would dramatically change the entire rest of the Trump presidency. Thus, the intense interest at the White House in Pennsylvania's 18, district 18's upcoming special election. So, everyone's going to be there next week. The president's going, Mike Pence is going, and others. President Trump won that district by 20 points in the election; it should be a very safe area. But after the Alabama experience, there is no desire to repeat that, and the president will head there to support the Republican candidate, Rick Saccone, over his Democratic opponent, Conor Lamb. So, here now: Ned Ryan, is the Former White House Staffer under President George W. Bush, one of them, and a CEO -- not the only staffer, there were others -- CEO of American Majority; and Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor, of course; Jessica Tarlov is Author of \"America in the Age of Trump\" and a Fox News contributor. So, Mr. Stirewalt, we'll begin with you, because you know every one of these districts, and why they are or are not important.

And the way you change that narrative is say, look, we can win, we can defend these seats, this is not going to be the route, we're going to fight for you. And the message in Western Pennsylvania is we're going to hold the seats, we're going to hold the line, and it's supposed to telegraph across the country to other Republicans."

We just saw 150 companies give bonuses, I think, in the neighborhood of $3 billion. People vote with their pocketbooks. And I know that there's this theme that people are saying this could be a Democrat wave in 2018. Typically, the party in the White House loses seats. Well, with all of these things going well in the economy, I'm still confused as to what the Democrats are actually running on in 2018. I mean, if the economy is going great, the market is going great, what are they going run on? Resistance? Impeachment? Hey, put us back in power so we can raise your taxes? So, I'm still confused as to what the actual message of Democrats is going to be in 2018. And let's not forget, in the Senate, the Senate map heavily favors Republicans. I actually think Republicans are going to pick up seats in the Senate regardless, and I still think they're going to keep the House in November of 2018."

I agree with Ned in so far as that we need messaging based on policy, and I think Democrats need to get that under control. I completely disagree about taking the House back. As you said, we need 24 seats; you already have 30 retirements. I think 18 are actually the Hillary Clinton held. And that's why a lot of people like (INAUDIBLE) are actually backing away from this, coupled with Republican popularity and the president's own popularity there. But returning to Pennsylvania's 18th, I don't actually see Conor Lamb winning there. I think it's a 12-point lead for Saccone. But what I do think is really interesting is that Conor Lamb came outside days ago and said that he wouldn't support Nancy Pelosi for a leadership position anymore. And I believe that that's going to be a trend, especially for younger Democrats coming up. We've heard a lot about how it's time for a change, and that we need younger, new more progressive leadership. So, I think he might be leading the way there ala-Tim Ryan from the leadership challenge last year. So, that's what I think is important there."

This thing with Qasem Soleimani specifically is disturbing because the Israelis had a plan to take him out, I think, somewhere near Damascus, and apparently, they were tipped off, as being reported by this Iranian newspaper. I talked to some of my friends in Washington and in Virginia today and they said that's exactly happened. And if they're willing to protect the guy that's been referred to as the Iranian Usama bin Laden simply to get a really bad nuclear deal done -- just for the sake of getting the deal done, if it's true which it will come up that is, yes, I'm disturbed by it."

And I don't think they're going to be approved by Congress or Europe. But, here's something -- I'm going to break some news here. This is based on a friend of mine who met with the president in December. The president told my friend, when he decertify the deal in October, he never thought Congress would fix it. And I don't think he thinks Congress will ever fix it. So you might ask why did the president do what he did today? Here is the second thing my friend was told. North Korea is the president's priority. He does not want both situations to blow up simultaneously. I think that that makes a lot of sense and it makes me feel better about a decision that on the face of it looks very bad. Let me make one final point. I think there are senior officials who are leaving this government over the next 120 days. I think one will be Rex Tillerson, one may be H.R. McMaster. And the president is going to need people who support his Iran policy, hopefully Ambassador John Bolton as national security advisor, to get us out of the deal.

This case is also unique because legally it went after both fraternity members and the fraternity itself. In December of 2013, Baruch college freshman Chun Deng, who goes by Michael, collapsed after taking part in a ritual called the glass ceiling. It is a gauntlet meant to represent the plight of Asian-Americans where pledges are blindfolded and wear a backpack filled with sand while being confronted by fraternity brothers. The grand juror reports that Michael Deng was being defiant and resistant and so fraternity members forcefully and repeatedly hit him and knocked him to the ground. In some cases running directly at him with their heads down from 15 feet away. Michael Deng fell unconscious. The fraternity members considered getting an ambulance but thought it would be too expensive. So instead they changed his clothing and tried to revive him. Googling phrases like concussion, can't wake up. The 19-year-old died the next day. In all, 37 people face charges. The four fraternity members facing the most serious charges were all sentenced between one and two years in prison. And the fraternity itself was banned in Pennsylvania for 10 years. In her ruling, Judge Margherita Patti-Worthington called this the most troubling case in her 19 years on the bench. She also noted the dangers of hazing by pointing to a case this program has covered extensively, the death of 19-year-old Tim Piazza, who after a pledge night of drunken partying, fell numerous times including down a flight of stairs and never regained consciousness. In the death of Michael Deng, Pi Delta Psi released a statement saying its members feel shame and dishonor that fraternity brothers could be so callous and inhumane. The fraternity is also appealing the judge's decision saying the national chapter should not be conflated with the actions of individuals. Martha?"

      "utterance": "Trace, thank you very much. There is also new information tonight on the case that Trace just mentioned, the Tim Piazza case. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office is now taking over the manslaughter case against 12 former members of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity after the former prosecuting attorney claimed that he had a conflict of interest and couldn't go forward with the case. They did not specify what that conflict might be. The state attorney general has promised to conduct an independent review now. That review could lead to charges being dropped or increased or changed against all of those individuals, so stay tuned as we follow that. Piazza, as you remember, died February of 2017. Seventeen of his so-called brothers have been charged with involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence originally. Police recovered deleted surveillance video showing Piazza given 18 drinks in under 90 minutes. Later that night, he tumbled down an entire flight of stairs, hitting his head. No one called an ambulance for 11 hours. And hours after her prime time special aired, Hollywood's new darling, Tonya Harding, is experiencing yet another fall from grace. She is firing back at reporters, TV anchors, and now her own publicist for daring to bring up Nancy Kerrigan. A person who knows the whole 1994 saga all too well is here, next."

In fact, Harding's publicist has just quit, claiming, her adamant and final position is that reporters must sign an affidavit stating that they won't ask her anything about the past or they will be fined $25,000. Obviously, it doesn't work that way, and therefore I have chosen to terminate our business relationship, he said. Joining us now, journalist Julie Vader, who has covered Harding for years in Oregon. She was there when all of this happened. She coauthored the book \"Fire on Ice.\" Good to see you, Julie. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. I saw the movie \"I, Tonya\" and watched the special last night. You saw the new movie as well which stars Margot Robbie s Tonya Harding. You say you didn't like it, why? JULIE VADER, JOURNALIST, CO AUTHOR OF \"FIRE ON ICE\": If all I knew about Tonya Harding is what I saw in that movie, I would have total sympathy for her. But, unfortunately, I know her and her story all too well. And the movie badly distorts what actually happened. It's a fictional."

They made it look like she didn't know anything, something to do with some letters. That's quite different from what he told the FBI 24 years ago, that they had discussed killing Nancy Kerrigan or cutting her Achilles tendon or breaking her leg and leaving her duct taped gagged in a hotel room. I mean, really horrific stuff. Of course if you bring that up in a movie, it doesn't make Tonya look sympathetic at all. So, they just --"

We all remember those days. And we all kind of had the same take away when you watch Tonya Harding, except maybe the people who were cheering her on from her own community for very understandable reasons. The rest of America, you know, saw her as the way she was portrayed, you know, white trash, very tough, very unlikable in many ways character. But here is her talking about landing the triple axle which was the really high point of her life."

(INAUDIBLE) in 1992 wrote a very sympathetic long article about the abuse she suffered and her terrible childhood. She was a great story. But that's an explanation, not an excuse. If I can talk about the triple axel, I was there in 1991. I was a sportswriter for 15 years and got to see amazing things. I got to see Joe Montana and Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky and (INAUDIBLE). I got to see a lot of great athletes. But seeing her 1991 triple axel was one of the highlights. It really was genuinely exciting and exhilarating. And it was the highlight of her life."

You know, everybody is feeling sorry for her and thanking her for her involvement in this and you think about what happened to Nancy Kerrigan. One of the biggest lines in the movie to me was when Tonya Harding says, I got hit my whole life, she got hit once."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VADER",
      "utterance": "Yes. That was horrific. The film I saw, the audience burst out laughing. And there were two other times, Kerrigan was on the screen in this movie, she was laughed at, which is appalling. I mean, Tonya Harding gets the award for the worst display of sportsmanship ever in sports. That's what she will be remembered for as well as just squandered talent. It's a shame because I like Today. I rooted for her. She was a hometown girl. It's awfully hard to have any sympathy for her or-- my main reaction to the movie and seeing her at the Golden Globes was kind of a nauseous feeling."

Five are still missing tonight. The oldest victim was 89 years old. The youngest was just three. In tribute, here are some of their stories. After raising their two children in Orange County, Jim and Alice Mitchell realized their dream of coming home to Montecito. Their home was filled with Alice's artwork. Their daughter called them an adorable couple and said they were in love with their home. As a young woman, Rebecca Riskin landed a role dancing with the American Ballet Theater. She later became a successful realtor. Her company says it intends to carry out her life's work with the same strength and grace and elegance that wholly defined Rebecca (ph). She is survived by her husband, children, and a grandson. Roy Rohter was in the real estate business and founded a Catholic school in Ventura. The school's headmaster says he will miss Roy's infectious love of the faith and of life and for all things true, good and beautiful. He lived in Montecito with his wife. Our prayers are with their families and those who are still being searched for tonight. That is \"The Story\" for this week. Tucker Carlson is up next.
