But instead of remembering the events of that tragic day and focusing on those, he used the occasion to smear millions of his fellow Americans, many of whom probably pulled the lever for him twice. My \"Angle\" will come a little later on tonight. But as you might imagine, my commentary on this one will be unflinching.  But first, you know that old saying when you're in a hole, stop digging? Well, Biden and his party don't seem to get it. They've jumped into a ditch. And then they spend their day shoveling out more dirt. Unfortunately, for us, the more they dig, the deeper the trouble for America.  Now let's start with our fragile state of our economy. All self inflicted.",

The picture will look pretty ugly, they say. But back to the ditch, the Democrats answer to this precarious situation is to supercharge inflation, and dig us deeper into debt with a monstrous $3.5 trillion spending bill. Now, apparently, you'll pay for it eventually. Because we learned today, they're going to fund this with 3 trillion in taxes. So higher taxes on incomes, corporations, small business owners, capital gains, and that's on top of the huge increase in gas prices since Biden took office. Now, last week, we urged Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to do the right thing and resist with everything he has this fiscal catastrophe. And yesterday, he gave us some hope.",

Now, our enemies view all of this, overall, the economy, our foreign policy is ineptitude as an opportunity. Over the weekend, China, Iran and North Korea all decided to flex their muscles. They're confident that America is diminished. And under Biden, we already see that sadly, they're probably right.  Biden standing has deteriorated so sharply and so quickly that Democrat pollster Doug Schoen offered a blunt warning. \"Without drastic changes, Democrats are on track to lose big in 2022.\" Well, since the Democrats, Biden, they're determined to stay dug in for socialism, I'll bet on their losing big in 2022. Joining me now is former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Fox News contributor, author of the new book, \"Beyond Biden\" out on November 2. You can pre order your copy today. Newt, now, they have to see where this is all going with not only one poll coming out, but multiple polls now coming out, showing massive political blowback. So are they just hurrying to get as much socialist stuff done as they can before the midterms? Or is there some other strategy at play?",

It shows you how the socialists have frankly alienated themselves from most Americans.  I think what's going on is, they watched Bill Clinton, he lost the Congress in '94. They watched Obama, he lost the Congress of the House in 2010. And I think deep down, all of their leadership expects to lose next year. And so they want to ram everything they can through the system before they're defeated. And if that means they defeat 30, or 40 of their marginal Democrats in the house, and three or four or five in the Senate, that's the price they have decided is inevitable. And so, they're going to try to get this stuff through. I think, however, the Ways and Means Chairman today, when he came out and talked about $3 trillion in tax increases, and was very candid and said, he's not going to share the details because everybody will mobilize in opposition when they see the taxes. Well, that isn't going to work. All across the country, you're going to have people calling their House and Senate members and saying, I do not want you to vote yes on raising my taxes.

Republicans under Bush lost the House, they lost the Senate. And John McCain, who doubled down on Bush's record, got shellacked by Barack Obama in 2008. Turns out GOP voters had had enough. The country had had enough. And now after they lost their grip on the GOP for good, the old Bush establishment, well, they're older, but not wiser. Bush's remarks set the stage to boost Biden and the Democrats. They're flailing with their agenda now and poised for a wipeout in 2022. But Bush came in to try to do a temporary save. And all the media can do, all the Democrats can do is attack Republicans as racist, white supremacists and insurrectionists. The entire thing is pathetic. And most of all, it's revealing. It shows that they know that their agenda is delivering despair, and will not improve the lives of average Americans.",

Their view and Bush's view is that since the Republican party is no longer follows the Bushes and the Cheeneys, it should essentially be labeled as a terror organization. Now, this idea is being openly discussed among the left. Let's not kid ourselves. The Bush has helped raise $150 million for Jeb's 2016 run. And in the end, Jeb dropped out before getting to his own home state primary, and they still don't get it. They're not mad at the people who called him a war criminal, or Hitler, who ridiculed him every week on SNL. The Bushes are mad at the Republicans who rejected their policies. They all claim that Trump was the devil incarnate for demanding loyalty of the people who work for him. But the truth is the Bushes were the ones who demanded personal loyalty, regardless of how their policies affected the country.  Now, this is all hard for me to say actually tonight, because I always liked the Bushes personally. But when I questioned and ultimately helped torpedo, Bush's nomination of the supremely unqualified Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, the Bush White House made it clear, they wouldn't ever deal with me again. You see, you can never go against the family. So the old Bush guard has declared an unwinnable war again. And this time, it's against the 74 million plus Republicans who voted for Trump in 2020, and who didn't vote for Jeb in 2016. I'm sure they hope that the leftist historians will treat them more kindly in the future than they have in the past. Maybe they will, but I doubt it.

Joining us now is Byron York, \"Washington Examiner's\" chief political correspondent, a FOX News contributor, and author of \"Obsession.\" Byron, you wrote about the speech pretty much as soon as it was over. Why did you feel so strongly about what you had heard? BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": For some of the very reasons that you just said. This was the speech that Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, if they had given speeches on September 11th, this is part of the speech they would have given. And the other thing is parts of Bush's speech were just jaw-dropping. He decried the divisiveness in our politics today, and yet he was entirely, completely unself-aware of the role that his own actions had played in creating those very divisions. The war in Iraq was certainly the most divisive event in American history in the last 20 years until the election of Donald Trump, of course, which had something to do with the war in Iraq. And then the most incredible thing, the reason I wrote about it, was that Bush signed on to this idea you hear from the left, mostly from the left, on MSNBC and other places that September 11th and the January 6th Capitol riot were essentially the same. The Capitol riot was just as bad as September 11th.  It's a crazy idea, but it has really taken hold in some areas of the left, in part to view the rioters as enemy combatants or insurrectionists.

My \"Angle\" will come a little later on tonight. But as you might imagine, my commentary on this one will be unflinching. But first, you know that old saying when you're in a hole, stop digging? Well, Biden and his party don't seem to get it. They've jumped into a ditch. And then they spend their day shoveling out more dirt.

The picture will look pretty ugly, they say. But back to the ditch, the Democrats answer to this precarious situation is to supercharge inflation, and dig us deeper into debt with a monstrous $3.5 trillion spending bill. Now, apparently, you'll pay for it eventually. Because we learned today, they're going to fund this with 3 trillion in taxes. So higher taxes on incomes, corporations, small business owners, capital gains, and that's on top of the huge increase in gas prices since Biden took office.

Now, our enemies view all of this, overall, the economy, our foreign policy is ineptitude as an opportunity. Over the weekend, China, Iran and North Korea all decided to flex their muscles. They're confident that America is diminished. And under Biden, we already see that sadly, they're probably right. Biden standing has deteriorated so sharply and so quickly that Democrat pollster Doug Schoen offered a blunt warning. \"Without drastic changes, Democrats are on track to lose big in 2022.\" Well, since the Democrats, Biden, they're determined to stay dug in for socialism, I'll bet on their losing big in 2022. Joining me now is former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Fox News contributor, author of the new book, \"Beyond Biden\" out on November 2. You can pre order your copy today. Newt, now, they have to see where this is all going with not only one poll coming out, but multiple polls now coming out, showing massive political blowback. So are they just hurrying to get as much socialist stuff done as they can before the midterms? Or is there some other strategy at play?"

It shows you how the socialists have frankly alienated themselves from most Americans. I think what's going on is, they watched Bill Clinton, he lost the Congress in '94. They watched Obama, he lost the Congress of the House in 2010. And I think deep down, all of their leadership expects to lose next year. And so they want to ram everything they can through the system before they're defeated. And if that means they defeat 30, or 40 of their marginal Democrats in the house, and three or four or five in the Senate, that's the price they have decided is inevitable. And so, they're going to try to get this stuff through. I think, however, the Ways and Means Chairman today, when he came out and talked about $3 trillion in tax increases, and was very candid and said, he's not going to share the details because everybody will mobilize in opposition when they see the taxes. Well, that isn't going to work. All across the country, you're going to have people calling their House and Senate members and saying, I do not want you to vote yes on raising my taxes.

So in the House, they have this gridlock. Because if they can't pass the $3.5 trillion, they're not going to get the infrastructure. I don't think they can pass the $3.5 trillion in the Senate. I think Manchin has now really dug in. They're not going to pass it in the Senate. And so does the left then blow up and refuse to pass the infrastructure bill. But what's deeper is, president of the United States who talks about, oh, several trillion dollars, this is going to be a 10,000 page bill with $3 trillion of tax increases, $3.5 trillion of spending.

So now we have the same finding in adults and about the same magnitude. But the good thing about this is, it means we're doing a lot better than we thought. That the deaths are really down with the Delta wave compared to the original strains from early this year, in the winter, and so on. And that means that a very large fraction of the American public are already immune between natural post infection immunity and vaccine immunity. American public is very highly immune already."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And we know, Dr. Bhattacharya, that some - it looks like beginning to see some healthcare companies who are mandating a vaccine are accepting a natural immunity as an alternative in the form of an antibody test within the last three months, I guess. Does that give you any hope that Fauci and company will ever recognize kind of immunology 101 about prior infection, and the protection you get?"

    {
      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "It's amazing actually. Yes. Laura, it's been an amazing denial of the basic fact that after you get COVID and recover, you are protected against severe disease, and actually probably better protected than the vaccine itself, if you hadn't been previously infected. So in that denial of science, that basic scientific fact, actually I think fuels vaccine hazards. If you can't trust the scientific community and the public health community to acknowledge a basic fact like that, well, why would you trust them on other aspects? I think it's really heartening, as you say, Laura, to see that some entities, healthcare entities are finally recognizing. I wish that that it would spread to the entire public health community that would acknowledge that. And if they're going to do vaccine mandates certainly to make that as a proviso where it's just either vaccine or immunity would suffice."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, Dr. Risch, on this issue of the boosters, I know, a couple of the top vaccine experts, (inaudible) FDA had resigned. And are now saying that rushing to the booster before the people who are vulnerable are vaccinated is not smart. There seems to be a growing divide on this issue of the booster and whether people truly need the booster or should be rushing out to get the booster who otherwise are not vulnerable. Your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RISCH",
      "utterance": "Well, the original plan that we should have had is to protect the vulnerable, whether by vaccines, whether by medications. All of the methods that we have available should have been aimed primarily at protecting vulnerable people, high risk people, elderly people, people with obesity, diabetes, comorbidities, chronic conditions. So now we have people, who for whatever their personal reasons, have escaped from the narrative, and are seeing that the people who need to be protected are the high risk people. And so they're finally coming on side what they should have seen a year ago."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And, Dr. Bhattacharya, before we let you go, this - now a new concern that the government may require vaccines for Interstate travel in the United States on airplanes and trains.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think, the thing is it may increase vaccine uptake. I mean, people want to be able to travel across states, but they'll feel coerced into doing so. And so what I'm afraid of is that it will increase the distrust that people have in public health. Why are they - they will feel forced. And they'll say, well, why are they - if they are so good, why am I being forced to do it? I think it'll undermine public health in the long run. At the end, while you may get a short run bump, because people have to travel across state, it will, in the long run, be worse for public health. It's just not worth it."

Now, there was a lot of speculation swirling among media types and political junkies about why Joe Biden didn't deliver a live address at one of the 9/11 memorial sites on Saturday's anniversary? Conservatives snicker that it was because Biden's handlers worry that he'd embarrass himself and liberals blamed it on the possibility that Biden actually might be booed, while speaking. He didn't want to have that. But I have another theory that's just as plausible. Why would Biden need to speak at all, when George W. Bush would do it for him? GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but from violence that gathers within. There's a little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home. But then there's disdainful pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols.

When they tried to burn down St. John's Church across on the White House, did President Bush decry the defiling of that national symbol? No and No. Whoever wrote those remarks for Bush this weekend, and of course, they were written for him, also, in effect, wrote them for Biden and former Presidents Obama and Clinton as well. On the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, how cynically clever of the Democrats when Biden's on the ropes to have a former Republican president slash at Trump and his supporters?

Amidst the avalanche of praise for his Saturday remarks, let's not forget that after seven years of war, the loss of nearly 5 million manufacturing jobs overseas, a little more than that actually, and the 2008 financial crisis, Bush's approval rating was in the high 20s at the end of his last full year in office. Republicans under Bush lost the House, they lost the Senate. And John McCain, who doubled down on Bush's record, got shellacked by Barack Obama in 2008. Turns out GOP voters had had enough. The country had had enough. And now after they lost their grip on the GOP for good, the old Bush establishment, well, they're older, but not wiser. Bush's remarks set the stage to boost Biden and the Democrats. They're flailing with their agenda now and poised for a wipeout in 2022. But Bush came in to try to do a temporary save. And all the media can do, all the Democrats can do is attack Republicans as racist, white supremacists and insurrectionists. The entire thing is pathetic. And most of all, it's revealing. It shows that they know that their agenda is delivering despair, and will not improve the lives of average Americans."

      "utterance": "Of course, they're talking about this rally next Saturday that no one I know has ever heard of. Their view and Bush's view is that since the Republican party is no longer follows the Bushes and the Cheeneys, it should essentially be labeled as a terror organization. Now, this idea is being openly discussed among the left. Let's not kid ourselves. The Bush has helped raise $150 million for Jeb's 2016 run. And in the end, Jeb dropped out before getting to his own home state primary, and they still don't get it. They're not mad at the people who called him a war criminal, or Hitler, who ridiculed him every week on SNL. The Bushes are mad at the Republicans who rejected their policies. They all claim that Trump was the devil incarnate for demanding loyalty of the people who work for him. But the truth is the Bushes were the ones who demanded personal loyalty, regardless of how their policies affected the country. Now, this is all hard for me to say actually tonight, because I always liked the Bushes personally. But when I questioned and ultimately helped torpedo, Bush's nomination of the supremely unqualified Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, the Bush White House made it clear, they wouldn't ever deal with me again. You see, you can never go against the family. So the old Bush guard has declared an unwinnable war again. And this time, it's against the 74 million plus Republicans who voted for Trump in 2020, and who didn't vote for Jeb in 2016. I'm sure they hope that the leftist historians will treat them more kindly in the future than they have in the past. Maybe they will, but I doubt it. So while Bush was trying to appeal to that very media that has demonized him for years, here's what Trump is doing."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's kind of what happened to the GOP, it found its real bass again. The fact is most conservatives long ago shook off the alure of the Bushs. We found new leaders, including exciting young governors who will fight for us instead of against us. And we won't be fooled again. And that's the ANGLE. Joining us now is Byron York, \"Washington Examiner's\" chief political correspondent, a FOX News contributor, and author of \"Obsession.\" Byron, you wrote about the speech pretty much as soon as it was over. Why did you feel so strongly about what you had heard? BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": For some of the very reasons that you just said. This was the speech that Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, if they had given speeches on September 11th, this is part of the speech they would have given. And the other thing is parts of Bush's speech were just jaw-dropping. He decried the divisiveness in our politics today, and yet he was entirely, completely unself-aware of the role that his own actions had played in creating those very divisions. The war in Iraq was certainly the most divisive event in American history in the last 20 years until the election of Donald Trump, of course, which had something to do with the war in Iraq. And then the most incredible thing, the reason I wrote about it, was that Bush signed on to this idea you hear from the left, mostly from the left, on MSNBC and other places that September 11th and the January 6th Capitol riot were essentially the same. The Capitol riot was just as bad as September 11th. It's a crazy idea, but it has really taken hold in some areas of the left, in part to view the rioters as enemy combatants or insurrectionists. And here, they got their most prominent endorsement from a former Republican president."

      "speaker": "GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "When it comes to the unity of America, those days seem distant from our own. Malign force seems at work in our common life. It turns every disagreement into an argument, and every argument into a clash of cultures. So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear, and resentment."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "There is no doubt about it. And by the way, if anyone remembers the Bush presidency, the left was really, really mad. You mentioned earlier about how he was referred to as Hitler often. And indeed, he was, it happened all the time back then. But here again, he comes out himself and endorses perhaps the most toxic view of what happened on January 6th. And just to be clear, the September 11th attacks killed roughly 3,000 people, brought downs New York's tallest skyscrapers, destroyed a large part of the Pentagon, brought down four commercial airlines, started two wars, and changed American foreign policy for decades. There is simply no comparison at all to what happened on January 6th, which was an appalling act of civil disorder, but it resulted in one natural causes death of a single policeman, the death of a rioter who was shot by police, and three other natural causes death. They simply are not comparable in any way."
