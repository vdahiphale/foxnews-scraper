The fight for 270 still on as several key states remain up for grabs. You just heard from the Trump team. And now, we're awaiting a news conference from the Pennsylvania secretary of state on election results in that state, which is still undecided. Also, still too close to call are Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia. As the results continue to roll, the legal battle over them is ramping up.

And the news out of Phoenix today was that the Trump camp still believes, still firmly confident, that they have the votes to win it when everything is counted. There are 417,000 ballots according to the campaign left to count. The current split is 68,000 between the president and Joe Biden.   After tonight's ballot count dump, they expect that the president will be within 40,000 votes of Joe Biden. And there will still be another 325,000 ballots left to go. So they believe that they do have the numbers and the percentages there for the president to prevail. Listen to what David Bossey said a short time ago.",

They also claim that ballots were cast in the name of people who are deceased. They're going to providing a list of those votes to the Department of Justice and local law enforcement authorities, in hopes that they will investigate that. Nevada very, very tight, there's still some more vote that's going to be coming on later on tonight.  Now, back to where we were at the top of the hour here in case you just tuned in and you saw Pam Bondi and Corey Lewandowski. Earlier today, a judge in Pennsylvania ordered the local county elections board to allow Republican observers to get in to where the votes are being counted, and to get within six feet of the tables that which they're counting the votes so the Republican observers can take a look to see whether or not those votes were valid.

He has to go. So that's going to suspicion among everybody else that likes Trump that there will be fraud, because if you're that emotionally invested in getting rid of somebody, and especially the hard left who are emotionally invested in politics. They're going to do anything that they can. They will cheat. And your suspicions are valid, because if they think he's Hitler, cheating is completely justified.  So then you hear about all these ballot dumps going on, emphasis on dump. And you think -- it's like imagine watching the Superbowl and suddenly, you know, the Cowboys or the Patriots find extra points in the locker room. You know, and they disappear on the scoreboard. You are like a little suspicious even if -- even if the fraud is inconsequential or it is incompetent. You understand why people are suspicious. And I would say, you know the media or the Democrats, you cannot, you cannot criticize voters for feeling this way. You can't mock them. You can't laugh at them because you spent four years shouting election fraud without any evidence, with this dossier.   And here -- you have been vilifying these people.  So they actually have real evidence in their heads by your behavior. So the fact is, you know, voters have a right to be sceptical after what you have done to them.

And then you have this lack of transparency with the poll watching.

And the idea that Democrats are trying to keep Republicans from actually seeing what's on these ballots by continually pushing them back. While in the other precincts have vote counters wearing Biden-Harris asks, of course there are questions. It's not illegitimate for the Trump campaign or just everyday Americans to be asking questions for verification of legal votes and just some transparency about the process.

And the difference between Biden- Trump at that point was 700,000 votes. Check that. That is not correct. It was 700,000 outstanding votes across the state. That's right.

So for example, we talked about -- I think it was yesterday, voting by mail in Pennsylvania. So the process, though it's new under Act 77 that we can all vote by mail, it's the same processes that we've used for decades for absentee voting. So voters have to apply. They're checked against either social security database or (Inaudible). They're checked against their voter records to make sure that they're a qualified voter and they are who they say they are. They cast their ballot and then they're checked again when the ballot is received that they're an approved voter, very secure. There's really like -- the strength of the integrity of this vote is really unparalleled. Same when you vote in person, right? You have to be registered. You go in. You sign in the poll book. All of these things are tracked. Our voting systems and our databases make sure that no voter can cast more than one vote. It literally has a hard stop should anybody even try. And the counties again, as I've talked about, the amazing county election officials, they take this so seriously. They're such professionals. So you know, I can just say really. No matter how you chose to vote this year and so many Pennsylvanians have and it looks like it's really going to be a great turnout when we finalize the numbers, that every method is incredibly safe and secure.

And as you know, this dashboard and even the Web site, it's the first year that we broke out provisional ballots, mail-in ballots, and in-person.

They have about 91,000 ballots here in Philadelphia just for the city still to go. So we're certainly going to be going on this through tomorrow, if not, perhaps through the weekend. This comes as the Trump administration -- Trump campaign has launched two separate lawsuits and there is a lot of confusion here tonight about one of them. But within the last hour, we have learned that the Trump campaign has launched a lawsuit claiming that the Philadelphia Board of Elections has not allowed their poll watchers inside. The lawsuit claims that Trump Republican poll watchers have been barred from coming and seeing this firsthand themselves. But that appears not to be true because I have interviewed for two days now a GOP Trump activist who is a canvasser who has been inside this building. And a source tells me that right now, right as we're speaking, there are canvassers of both parties, A Democrat and a republican inside there right now watching the counting. Although there is an interesting point about what can you see. Let me show you a photograph. This is the view. This is the exact point of view that a poll watcher sees. This is taken by GOP Trump activists, Brian McCafferty, here in Philadelphia. He's been involved in Republican politics for a long time. And Brian was angry about this. He wanted to get even closer. They were barred for 25 feet away. Then the federal judge ruled they could go to six feet. The city Board of Elections is appealing that. This is the view exactly of what a Republican poll watcher is and has seen inside that room, which seems to conflict completely with the Trump campaign lawsuit and Trump claims that their poll watchers are not allowed in this room. In fact, earlier today, Brian told me how angry he was that he couldn't even get closer. Here he is.",

Whether you hate him or love him or you're somewhere in between, you got 200 federal judges, you got three Supreme Court justices, you got the -- you got Middle East Peace Plans coming out the wazoo. He brought in the appeal of the Republican Party to blue-collar and Black voters. Let's hope the Republicans capitalize on that.

So even if he -- even if he loses this election, I said this yesterday and people laugh, but trust me, 2024, he's going to be the nominee. And I'll be -- I'll be in my early 40s. So, I could consider being the V.P. I'm not sure how I feel about it. But I think that barring any health issues, he's going to be back. And the fact that he doesn't drink means that he's not going to change. You know what I mean? But I think that being -- if you're a Trump supporter, you got feel good. You won. The guy broke the system. He broke the mold. He broke the media, he broke the pollsters, he broke the entire political machinery. Nothing is ever going to be the same.

They also claim that ballots were cast in the name of people who are deceased. They're going to providing a list of those votes to the Department of Justice and local law enforcement authorities, in hopes that they will investigate that. Nevada very, very tight, there's still some more vote that's going to be coming on later on tonight. Now, back to where we were at the top of the hour here in case you just tuned in and you saw Pam Bondi and Corey Lewandowski. Earlier today, a judge in Pennsylvania ordered the local county elections board to allow Republican observers to get in to where the votes are being counted, and to get within six feet of the tables that which they're counting the votes so the Republican observers can take a look to see whether or not those votes were valid. But when Pam Bondi and Corey Lewandowski and their team went in to do it, they had moved the goal posts inside. Listen to what they said a couple of hours ago about that."

The president currently leads by 97,000. But there are still 92,000 votes in heavily Democratic Philadelphia County that have jet to be counted. The president does have a lot of outstanding ballots as well in counties that skew Republican. But one thing I think you can say safely about Pennsylvania, it is going to be close and so is Georgia.

Let's say there isn't anything illegal going on. It's just mere incompetence. But the Democrats, for four years, have said that Trump is an apocalyptic threat to our nation, to our species. He has to go. So that's going to suspicion among everybody else that likes Trump that there will be fraud, because if you're that emotionally invested in getting rid of somebody, and especially the hard left who are emotionally invested in politics. They're going to do anything that they can. They will cheat. And your suspicions are valid, because if they think he's Hitler, cheating is completely justified. So then you hear about all these ballot dumps going on, emphasis on dump. And you think -- it's like imagine watching the Superbowl and suddenly, you know, the Cowboys or the Patriots find extra points in the locker room. You know, and they disappear on the scoreboard. You are like a little suspicious even if -- even if the fraud is inconsequential or it is incompetent. You understand why people are suspicious. And I would say, you know the media or the Democrats, you cannot, you cannot criticize voters for feeling this way. You can't mock them. You can't laugh at them because you spent four years shouting election fraud without any evidence, with this dossier. And here -- you have been vilifying these people. So they actually have real evidence in their heads by your behavior. So the fact is, you know, voters have a right to be sceptical after what you have done to them. You put them through hell for four years. Give them a week or two to figure out what is going on before you call it a conspiracy theory, because they're only acting as a reaction to your behavior."

There was a judge -- an elections judge of May of 20 who was convicted on federal charges for taking bribes, to changing ballots, and certifying false election results. And then you have this lack of transparency with the poll watching. And when it comes to elections, especially in a swing state like Pennsylvania at a time that we're in now with the country, transparency is everything. You have to show everybody what you're doing. And the idea that Democrats are trying to keep Republicans from actually seeing what's on these ballots by continually pushing them back. While in the other precincts have vote counters wearing Biden-Harris asks, of course there are questions. It's not illegitimate for the Trump campaign or just everyday Americans to be asking questions for verification of legal votes and just some transparency about the process.

So you're down to 11,000 votes that separate Biden and Trump at the moment here. Come over here to the east coast here. Georgia, this is where you stand at the moment. I've been watching this all day. Dana, it's getting tighter by the moment, .9 to .7 and now .2 percent that separate Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Up here in Philadelphia, state of Pennsylvania, very interesting, I will tell you I was telling Neil last hour. We started watching this earlier today about 10:00 a.m. east coast time. And the difference between Biden- Trump at that point was 700,000 votes. Check that. That is not correct. It was 700,000 outstanding votes across the state. That's right. And it went down below 700,000. The difference at 10:00 this morning was 135,000 then it went to 115,000. And right now, it just dropped again. It had been 95,000 and then 5,000 votes more just came in, so it goes to 90,000, which leaves you with a 1.4 percentage points lead for the president in Pennsylvania. Here's Philadelphia, a lot of votes still out there. I heard John Roberts a moment ago. I was told the number is even higher for outstanding votes. And Joe Biden is getting 80 percent of them. Just bop around these counties here in Southeastern PA, Bucks County very close. You have an 8,000 vote difference there. Montgomery County, 130,000 difference, Chester County, 50,000 over here. It was just -- might as well complete the play, right? Delaware County 71,000 difference, so we'll see here. But I tell you.

You're saying Joe Biden turned out more people than Barack Obama? I mean, some of the stuff is just -- I want to believe that it's fine.

And now, all of you, everybody around the country, around the state are eagerly awaiting, and I can tell you the counties are, too. They're really taking their time, making sure that every single voter in the commonwealth who has cast their ballot is having those ballots accurately and securely counted. So you know -- as you know, we're going to keep counting. Military and overseas ballots, I think, are coming in. Those will continue to be accepted through next Tuesday. There are obviously provisional ballots that will have to be counted as well after the initial round of ballots.

So for example, we talked about -- I think it was yesterday, voting by mail in Pennsylvania. So the process, though it's new under Act 77 that we can all vote by mail, it's the same processes that we've used for decades for absentee voting. So voters have to apply. They're checked against either social security database or (Inaudible). They're checked against their voter records to make sure that they're a qualified voter and they are who they say they are. They cast their ballot and then they're checked again when the ballot is received that they're an approved voter, very secure. There's really like -- the strength of the integrity of this vote is really unparalleled. Same when you vote in person, right? You have to be registered. You go in. You sign in the poll book. All of these things are tracked. Our voting systems and our databases make sure that no voter can cast more than one vote. It literally has a hard stop should anybody even try. And the counties again, as I've talked about, the amazing county election officials, they take this so seriously. They're such professionals. So you know, I can just say really. No matter how you chose to vote this year and so many Pennsylvanians have and it looks like it's really going to be a great turnout when we finalize the numbers, that every method is incredibly safe and secure.

So it's very close in Pennsylvania, right? There's no question. And so that means it's going to take longer to actually see who the winner is. But I can tell you that there are several hundred thousand ballots remaining to be counted. You can track all that, what counties it remains in. Look at our website. And you'll be able to see how we get to the conclusion. But you know, either way, I want to be clear, that these are just the mail-in and absentee votes and the in-person votes, right? The overwhelmingly -- like, you know, huge, huge majority of the in-person votes have been counted. We're in a very good place with the mail-in and absentee ballots, but not quite there yet. But then there's still going to be provisional ballots, the military and overseas ballots, and so forth. So the closer race is, the longer it takes. But I think -- what I've said all along is that the overwhelming majority of ballots will be counted by Friday. I still think that we're ahead of the schedule.

It's like a fraction of what we saw in the primary. So, I think we saw 60,000 in the three days following the primary. It's not going to be anywhere near that. So, once I have the full -- again, I think I have maybe, you know, two-thirds of the counties. And so, I just want to make sure before I give -- but what I said was true. There are some counties that got zero the day following, and there were some counties that got in the hundreds, you know, maybe 500, but -- so that's the range that I have now, but I just don't want to give an overall picture until I make sure I have every county in.

Some of the -- each voting system vendor has the way they translate with the data has worked slightly differently. And as you know, this dashboard and even the Web site, it's the first year that we broke out provisional ballots, mail-in ballots, and in-person. So, some of the reporting, if the counties files were not done perfectly, it might merge to the categories, it might put things in the wrong category. So, we've been working on all those quirks. Like I know for example, York was off for a little while, but that is now corrected. So, that may have explained what was going on with the Lancaster.

      "utterance": "The most important two words. Stay tuned, Dana. There's a lot of speculation when she announced this news conference that the state was ready to announce the results, the final results of this. Certainly, that's not happening yet. As we heard 200,000 or so ballots are still to be counted. I'm here at the Philadelphia Convention Center where right now inside they are continuing to count those ballots. They have about 91,000 ballots here in Philadelphia just for the city still to go. So we're certainly going to be going on this through tomorrow, if not, perhaps through the weekend. This comes as the Trump administration -- Trump campaign has launched two separate lawsuits and there is a lot of confusion here tonight about one of them. But within the last hour, we have learned that the Trump campaign has launched a lawsuit claiming that the Philadelphia Board of Elections has not allowed their poll watchers inside. The lawsuit claims that Trump Republican poll watchers have been barred from coming and seeing this firsthand themselves. But that appears not to be true because I have interviewed for two days now a GOP Trump activist who is a canvasser who has been inside this building. And a source tells me that right now, right as we're speaking, there are canvassers of both parties, A Democrat and a republican inside there right now watching the counting. Although there is an interesting point about what can you see. Let me show you a photograph. This is the view. This is the exact point of view that a poll watcher sees. This is taken by GOP Trump activists, Brian McCafferty, here in Philadelphia. He's been involved in Republican politics for a long time. And Brian was angry about this. He wanted to get even closer. They were barred for 25 feet away. Then the federal judge ruled they could go to six feet. The city Board of Elections is appealing that. This is the view exactly of what a Republican poll watcher is and has seen inside that room, which seems to conflict completely with the Trump campaign lawsuit and Trump claims that their poll watchers are not allowed in this room. In fact, earlier today, Brian told me how angry he was that he couldn't even get closer. Here he is."

There's a 7:00 p.m. federal court hearing, so we'll see what the Trump campaign brings to that court hearing and what the Philadelphia Board of Elections says and answer to that and see if not, that perhaps they are right, and that their poll watchers have been barred from where they think the poll watcher should be.

You're just going to send out tens of thousands of ballots into the countryside, and then you're going to see how many you need after the early vote and after the Election Day vote comes in, and then you count them in a room where you're not going to have sufficient oversight.

And they are -- they posted video of back and forth with the local attorneys saying you can't come in yet. We're evaluating what the court order means, what the judges said in this case. The campaign pushing back and saying we've been in legal work for 30 years. Why don't you understand what the court ruling is? So, obviously, there was an issue this morning with access. You also had in Michigan yesterday, which are reporters were reporting. Matt Finn was posting video, this asking questions about why this was happening, papering over windows in Michigan when they were asking for access to watch the counting. So, again, President Trump might lose his thing. The campaign says he can still win Pennsylvania, he can still win Arizona. But the fact is that the numbers are tough for both candidates at this point. They both have to make up a gap in both places. But the fact is that just because the end result might be a winner or lost for the president, doesn't delegitimize questions about the process especially because Pennsylvania looks like it's going to determine the future of the presidency for the rest of the country. And the rest of the country has serious questions about the process. And they deserve answers about a lack of transparency, why the lawsuits are happening, what is the outcome of the lawsuits, and why local officials, apparently, aren't enforcing a judge's order as of earlier today."

So, I would be - - I'm not so much worried about or concerned about what's going on with these protesters and whatnot. I do think that it is time for a change. I mean, we are a first-world country. We automate so many things. If robots can flip burgers, robots can count ballots. You don't have to stand six feet from AI or robots to do the counting. And I think that's where we're headed in the next couple of years. But I would just like to -- I just want to mention that I am actually really optimistic about what's going to happen. We keep thinking about what's next. But remember how much Donald Trump accomplished within four years, OK. This was a probably one of the most consequential political phenomenons we've ever seen. Whether you hate him or love him or you're somewhere in between, you got 200 federal judges, you got three Supreme Court justices, you got the -- you got Middle East Peace Plans coming out the wazoo. He brought in the appeal of the Republican Party to blue-collar and Black voters. Let's hope the Republicans capitalize on that. And you know what, and this is something that the left just should be thanking him for. He didn't start a single war. He upset you guys and kept you up at night with tweets. So, the good news is, this guy did a lot. And the even better news is he's going nowhere. So even if he -- even if he loses this election, I said this yesterday and people laugh, but trust me, 2024, he's going to be the nominee. And I'll be -- I'll be in my early 40s. So, I could consider being the V.P. I'm not sure how I feel about it. But I think that barring any health issues, he's going to be back. And the fact that he doesn't drink means that he's not going to change. You know what I mean? But I think that being -- if you're a Trump supporter, you got feel good. You won. The guy broke the system. He broke the mold. He broke the media, he broke the pollsters, he broke the entire political machinery. Nothing is ever going to be the same.

I could watch this for days and I have a feeling I probably will because I don't know why. It's just something to watch."

It's going to give them away to other museums, veterans organizations, national parks, educational institutions, and the chance to snag their own piece of history. Now -- and if there's leftovers, they're willing to open it up to the American public which is great because tanks are available. I'm probably going to sign up for one."
