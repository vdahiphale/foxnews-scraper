      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". Busy news night. So, with zero evidence of cropping up in Russia-Trump collusion, 442 days of stupidity into this Mueller partisan return, well, your mainstream corrupt media is literally in this country desperately searching for a new crisis every second of every day. This time, they are trying to focus their attention on their favorite topic, oh, themselves. They are narcissistic.  And one particularly devout anti-Trump fake journalist over at fake new CNN is so openly concerned the president's rhetoric could endanger members of the media. But we're going to show you how the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, absolutely decimated this person -- we'll tell you about it in a minute -- during today's very tense briefing.  Plus, we're going to help remind the anti-Trump fake news CNN network why so many Americans chant at you that you suck. Americans don't trust your abusively biased coverage. And despite the constant stream of negative, negative coverage from the media -- well, the president's poll numbers are growing higher and higher, which, by the way, comes as the administration is now combating, quote, Russia election meddling in a big way, something that Obama failed to actually do!  Obama said this couldn't happen in this country. Trump needs to focus on getting voters and stop whining. OK. Moments ago, by the way, the president wrapped up a massive rally in Pennsylvania. We'll show you those best moments.  We also have the very latest details, day three of the Paul Manafort trial of the century, a 2005 tax case. Sit tight, buckle up, it's almost Friday. Time for tonight's breaking news opening monologue. We're glad you're with us.",

      "sentences": "All right. Those crisis peddlers are at it again. Your mainstream, destroy-Trump-media has constantly tried and constantly failed to sink the Trump presidency. Night after night, they are pushing scandal after scandal. It's day after day, and now, it has come full circle. Now, tonight, the outrage of the day is centered around members of the media talking about themselves and their own little bubble. And how some believe that they president's rhetoric and conservative rhetoric, people chanting at them, any criticism against them actually is putting them in danger. All right. Let's be very clear, get it off the table, as I said last night. Violence against any member of the press, frankly anybody, is reprehensible. No one that I don't know, no real conservative, whatever call for or support any violence against the media.   But I also said last night I'd be the first person to jump in and personally defend any journalist who was attacked anywhere in the country. By the way, I trained five days, hard, MMA. Frankly, I think I'd be an asset to them. And I'm pretty confident I could be effective. But let's also be clear. The fact that the people of this country are so fed up with their bias, they are lying, it's not a call for violence at all. As a matter of fact, it's actually freedom of speech, and our duty to call out blatant lies, fake news, for what it is. It's no surprise that you, the American people, no longer trust the so- called mainstream media. Here's just one recent example.  Today, the Trump-hating New York Times, the so-called paper of record, they actually defended the hiring of a person who wants to tweeted, quote, #cancelwhitepeople and, quote, are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to leave underground like groveling goblins? And, quote, I was equating Trump to Hitler before it was cool.   That's The New York Times. Why would- with the American people trust any organization that proudly hires that person? And today, the president tweeted, quote: They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the fake news, which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people.  Now, the press is absolutely a vital part of any democracy. Their rights are guaranteed in our Constitution, but so are the rights of freedom of speech, and the president calling them out for the lies that they tell. And the American people also have a right and when they know a network is feeding them lies, propaganda, misinformation, every single second of every single minute of every single day, week after week, month after month, year after year, they are right to call them out. In fact, once so-called news network is so blinded by this anti-Trump derangement rage that they have, they don't even remember how destructive, how aggressive, how insane, how pathological their own rhetoric was even before day one of the Trump presidency.  But we've got the videotape to remind you. Take a look.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, CNN, MAY 17, 2016: What he's done is create a lot of hatred and hostility between groups in this country after a half-century of us trying to bring people together.  BRIAN STELTER, CNN, MAY 29, 2016: Are the talking heads missing something when they put it all on the economy? What about racial anxiety is a factor?   The Arizona Republic getting so many death threats over an endorsement is an example of how overheated the rhetoric is. Another example out of North Carolina today, the firebombing of a local GOP office. But that kind of action is unacceptable, and we need to have the temperature come down on all sides right now. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is raising the temperature at this moment in time. VAN JONES, CNN, NOV. 11, 2016: I think that if there's one thing that Donald Trump could do now that might calm some people. We are on track for a tragedy.",

And I'll be the first to stand up and say everybody has a right to freedom of speech. But saying that you're a liar and calling out fake news is only words. Nobody is supporting any violence. So don't make accusations that are untrue. Many in the media -- they're all too happy to play down violence that have been over the years perpetrated against conservatives, for example, just the day, a man arrested after leaving Majority Whip Steve Scalise a threatening voice mail. Remember, 2017, Steve Scalise, Republican, was shot by a deranged Bernie Sanders reporter.   Remember, the biased press assigning blame for that violence, nor did I. You can't hold one psycho accountable and attributed some of the person. Now, remember, during the Obama administration, no member of the mainstream media feared for their lives or blamed Obama for random acts of violence against conservatives because he said things like this.   THEN-SEN. BARACK OBAMA, AUG. 5, 2008: I might have to put Mr. Burgess on Fox News. You know, I'll put -- I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. He'll tear him up.  OBAMA, SEPT. 17, 2008: I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. I want you to talk to them whether they are independent, or whether they are Republican.

Rasmussen poll out today, the president's approval rating now stands at a solid 50 percent, which incidentally is five points higher than Obama during the same time frame.

And sadly, like every federal case, chances are high they will try again, they can indict a ham sandwich and get a ham sandwich guilty. But so far, Mueller's legal team is facing pretty stiff pushback from Judge Ellis who's presiding over that trial, after some speculation that the prosecution wouldn't even call their star witness, and that's former Manafort business partner Rick Gates. Ellis reprimanded Team Mueller and saying they can't prove conspiracy without him. And he's also consistently pushed back on the prosecution's criminalizations of the fact that the guy is wealthy. It's not a crime to be rich or spend money. We'll monitor this trial. But remember it was Ellis that said they are putting the screws to Manafort so that he'll sing or compose so they can either -- oh -- prosecute or impeach Donald Trump.

It's embarrassing. Now, what happened? Well, what happened was Trump had the goods to fight it out. He had the guts to go nose to nose with Hillary, had the guts to take on the elite media, he had the guts, no matter what the poll said, to campaign five or six or seven rallies a day. So, where are the House Republicans? This is not complicated. I've done this my whole life. Joe Gaylord and I, and, you know, Joe designed the '94 campaign, writing a brief paper right now to say to House Republicans, you know, suck it up. If you are prepared to go nose to nose with the left and you're prepared to tell the truth, and you're willing to wage a national campaign, you want open borders or do you want to control who comes in the U.S., including MS- 13 gangsters? Do you want really great economy, really great growth? Or do you want to go back to food stamps, dependency, big government, et cetera? Go down the list. We have a chance here for historic election, to give the American people an honest choice between a radical, extremist Democratic Party in which the progressive wing is gradually being destroyed by the radical extremists, or they can try to appease the elites. And I tell you, if they run a district by district campaign, they will lose the House. It is impossible in the modern era. You are proof of it. Rush Limbaugh is proof of it. You are in 435 districts every day. And so Republicans have got to decide they are to win the fight, they are going to the win the argument. They got all of the issues on their side.

Sessions if he did his job could intervene tonight or tomorrow and would be totally within his authority. Ad he should. Number two, the president will take every example we are talking about and simply declassify. I mean, I want to see every decision memo about Benghazi where the Obama team consciously decided lie to the American people. I want to see all the decision memos about Hillary Clinton. The president can order them released. I mean, he has to do it by executive orders and say I want them out by next Thursday. Don't give me this baloney about it's going to take 22 years. Get them out. Third, I think we ought to look very carefully at what this case is all about. Mueller has a bunch of very left wing Democrats. They are totally a hunting party. And I think the president should challenge Mueller head on. Mueller, he should say to the president -- or he should say to Mueller, I dare you to hold a press conference.

The D.C. press corps today is the least professional press corps in my lifetime.

Most of the issues they're raising if he did all of these things, bank fraud, embezzlement, tax fraud and all the rest, and he did it during the Obama administration. Who was the FBI director? Mueller. Mueller was the FBI director. He did nothing about it apparently when he was the FBI director. Apparently they didn't know anything. So now Manafort is the campaign chairman for Donald Trump and they throw 17 left wing Democrat prosecutors at the guy who worked for the special counsel. That is a matter for the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. That's number one. Now, Mueller is pushing the other case into the Southern District of New York. Then they set up Lieutenant General Mike Flynn. Then they have few lesser lights here where they get for false statements o something like that. What the hell do we have the special counsel for?

So, with zero evidence of cropping up in Russia-Trump collusion, 442 days of stupidity into this Mueller partisan return, well, your mainstream corrupt media is literally in this country desperately searching for a new crisis every second of every day. This time, they are trying to focus their attention on their favorite topic, oh, themselves. They are narcissistic. And one particularly devout anti-Trump fake journalist over at fake new CNN is so openly concerned the president's rhetoric could endanger members of the media. But we're going to show you how the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, absolutely decimated this person -- we'll tell you about it in a minute -- during today's very tense briefing. Plus, we're going to help remind the anti-Trump fake news CNN network why so many Americans chant at you that you suck. Americans don't trust your abusively biased coverage. And despite the constant stream of negative, negative coverage from the media -- well, the president's poll numbers are growing higher and higher, which, by the way, comes as the administration is now combating, quote, Russia election meddling in a big way, something that Obama failed to actually do! Obama said this couldn't happen in this country. Trump needs to focus on getting voters and stop whining. OK. Moments ago, by the way, the president wrapped up a massive rally in Pennsylvania. We'll show you those best moments. We also have the very latest details, day three of the Paul Manafort trial of the century, a 2005 tax case. Sit tight, buckle up, it's almost Friday.

Now, tonight, the outrage of the day is centered around members of the media talking about themselves and their own little bubble. And how some believe that they president's rhetoric and conservative rhetoric, people chanting at them, any criticism against them actually is putting them in danger. All right. Let's be very clear, get it off the table, as I said last night. Violence against any member of the press, frankly anybody, is reprehensible. No one that I don't know, no real conservative, whatever call for or support any violence against the media. But I also said last night I'd be the first person to jump in and personally defend any journalist who was attacked anywhere in the country. By the way, I trained five days, hard, MMA. Frankly, I think I'd be an asset to them. And I'm pretty confident I could be effective. But let's also be clear. The fact that the people of this country are so fed up with their bias, they are lying, it's not a call for violence at all. As a matter of fact, it's actually freedom of speech, and our duty to call out blatant lies, fake news, for what it is. It's no surprise that you, the American people, no longer trust the so- called mainstream media. Here's just one recent example. Today, the Trump-hating New York Times, the so-called paper of record, they actually defended the hiring of a person who wants to tweeted, quote, #cancelwhitepeople and, quote, are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to leave underground like groveling goblins? And, quote, I was equating Trump to Hitler before it was cool. That's The New York Times. Why would- with the American people trust any organization that proudly hires that person?"

In fact, once so-called news network is so blinded by this anti-Trump derangement rage that they have, they don't even remember how destructive, how aggressive, how insane, how pathological their own rhetoric was even before day one of the Trump presidency. But we've got the videotape to remind you. Take a look. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, CNN, MAY 17, 2016: What he's done is create a lot of hatred and hostility between groups in this country after a half-century of us trying to bring people together. BRIAN STELTER, CNN, MAY 29, 2016: Are the talking heads missing something when they put it all on the economy? What about racial anxiety is a factor? The Arizona Republic getting so many death threats over an endorsement is an example of how overheated the rhetoric is. Another example out of North Carolina today, the firebombing of a local GOP office. But that kind of action is unacceptable, and we need to have the temperature come down on all sides right now. Unfortunately, Donald Trump is raising the temperature at this moment in time. VAN JONES, CNN, NOV. 11, 2016: I think that if there's one thing that Donald Trump could do now that might calm some people. We are on track for a tragedy."

Remember, 2017, Steve Scalise, Republican, was shot by a deranged Bernie Sanders reporter. Remember, the biased press assigning blame for that violence, nor did I. You can't hold one psycho accountable and attributed some of the person. Now, remember, during the Obama administration, no member of the mainstream media feared for their lives or blamed Obama for random acts of violence against conservatives because he said things like this. THEN-SEN. BARACK OBAMA, AUG. 5, 2008: I might have to put Mr. Burgess on Fox News. You know, I'll put -- I'll put Mr. Burgess up against Sean Hannity. He'll tear him up.

He accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined. And he tried to bribe the mullahs in Iran that say \"death to America, death to Israel\" with $150 in cash and other currency. He let us Assad across his phony red line in the sand. And Russia -- well, it was totally unchecked. Oh, nobody can influence our elections, Devin Nunes warned about it in 2014.

And sadly, like every federal case, chances are high they will try again, they can indict a ham sandwich and get a ham sandwich guilty. But so far, Mueller's legal team is facing pretty stiff pushback from Judge Ellis who's presiding over that trial, after some speculation that the prosecution wouldn't even call their star witness, and that's former Manafort business partner Rick Gates. Ellis reprimanded Team Mueller and saying they can't prove conspiracy without him. And he's also consistently pushed back on the prosecution's criminalizations of the fact that the guy is wealthy. It's not a crime to be rich or spend money. We'll monitor this trial. But remember it was Ellis that said they are putting the screws to Manafort so that he'll sing or compose so they can either -- oh -- prosecute or impeach Donald Trump.

We have a chance here for historic election, to give the American people an honest choice between a radical, extremist Democratic Party in which the progressive wing is gradually being destroyed by the radical extremists, or they can try to appease the elites. And I tell you, if they run a district by district campaign, they will lose the House. It is impossible in the modern era. You are proof of it. Rush Limbaugh is proof of it. You are in 435 districts every day. And so Republicans have got to decide they are to win the fight, they are going to the win the argument. They got all of the issues on their side. But the question is, do they have the courage?"

      "utterance": "Let me ask you this. So, the president tweets out about Robert Mueller, he tweets out about Jeff Sessions about the witch hunt. He was very clear in saying that no it's fake news. Most media is not the enemy of the people but the fake news ones are because they don't tell the American people the truth. What does the president do -- how do you -- how should he be dealing with this cloud that has been hovering over his head with no evidence whatsoever? Like for example, Paul Manafort, there is nothing about Russia, nothing about the president, nothing about the campaign, and nothing about collusion. It was a 2005 tax case was Hillary Clinton has never indicted. How does he navigate what he believes and what I also agree with his unfair witch hunt leading into this mid-term?"

The first is, let me point to everybody in the audience, 98 or 99 percent of what Mueller is doing is not covered by Sessions recusal over the Russian campaign incident. Ninety eight of 99 percent. Sessions if he did his job could intervene tonight or tomorrow and would be totally within his authority. Ad he should. Number two, the president will take every example we are talking about and simply declassify. I mean, I want to see every decision memo about Benghazi where the Obama team consciously decided lie to the American people. I want to see all the decision memos about Hillary Clinton. The president can order them released. I mean, he has to do it by executive orders and say I want them out by next Thursday. Don't give me this baloney about it's going to take 22 years. Get them out. Third, I think we ought to look very carefully at what this case is all about. Mueller has a bunch of very left wing Democrats. They are totally a hunting party. And I think the president should challenge Mueller head on. Mueller, he should say to the president -- or he should say to Mueller, I dare you to hold a press conference. And tell the American people any evidence you have that you think is relevant to why you originally hide? Give us any evidence you have. Because I don't think Mueller has any evidence. And I think it would be embarrassing at how little he knows--"

Why do the press hate the American people? Over 65 million people give or take voted for Donald Trump for president of the United States. I wrote this down. Various press outlets and reporters and hosts or their guests called millions and millions of Americans Nazis, racists, deranged, cultists, deplorables and even worse. How do the press in this country justify calling tens of millions of people such outrageous names? And we conservatives have watched this the press have destroyed, they're seeks to destroy Trump, Palin, Bork, Clarence Thomas, Ronald Reagan, the list goes on and on and on. The D.C. press corps today is the least professional press corps in my lifetime. They think that their job is to make it impossible for the president to function, to sabotage him and to advance the cause of the ideologues, to advance the cause of a rogue prosecutor by the name Bob Mueller. And so, the press really needs to be circumspect, to take a look at itself. It won't. As long as they keep putting clowns like Jim Acosta out there who is a drama queen of sorts and who like to report on themselves and talk about themselves. As long as it's impossible to tell a late night comedian from Jake Tapper, and Jake Tapper from the porn star and all the rest of it. This is going to be the reaction of the American people."

As I know you do. Let me ask you this and let you put on your attorney's hat for a minute. For those who don't know you were the chief of staff for I think one of the greatest attorney generals ever and that was Edwin Meese. Why would they ever allow an illegitimate investigation run by Mueller and his merry band of Democratic donors to interview President Trump when there is no evidence, collusion is not a crime, no evidence whatsoever. It's been a witch hunt from day one. Look at what they are doing with Manafort."

      "utterance": "I think Attorney General Meese at this point would have stepped down. I honestly do. And Newt Gingrich was on to something there. Much of the power being exercised by the deputy attorney general or the attorney general has nothing to do with Jeff Sessions' recusal. Jeff Sessions won't be attacked by the media as long as he is quiet. But the minute he speaks up or does something, he will be attacked. Look, the Manafort trial -- here's what I don't get. Most of the issues they're raising if he did all of these things, bank fraud, embezzlement, tax fraud and all the rest, and he did it during the Obama administration. Who was the FBI director? Mueller. Mueller was the FBI director. He did nothing about it apparently when he was the FBI director. Apparently they didn't know anything. So now Manafort is the campaign chairman for Donald Trump and they throw 17 left wing Democrat prosecutors at the guy who worked for the special counsel. That is a matter for the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia. That's number one. Now, Mueller is pushing the other case into the Southern District of New York. Then they set up Lieutenant General Mike Flynn. Then they have few lesser lights here where they get for false statements o something like that. What the hell do we have the special counsel for? You want to know why? Because he wants Trump. And he wants to interview Trump. And he wants to get him on obstruction of justice. And now he is threatening here--"

DARRELL SCOTT, FOUNDER & PASTOR, NEW SPIRIT RIVAL CHURCH: To be honest, this is probably going to be -- and I'm going to say this as the most pro- black president that we've had in our lifetime. Because and I try to, you know, analyze the people that I encounter. This president actually wants to prove something to our community. Our faith based community and our ethnic community.
