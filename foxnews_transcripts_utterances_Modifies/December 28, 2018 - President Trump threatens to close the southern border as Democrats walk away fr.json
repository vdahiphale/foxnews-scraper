This is a Fox News alert. The illegal immigrant wanted for killing a police officer in California arrested after a massive 48-hour manhunt. The sheriff in charge of the investigation blaming sanctuary laws saying the suspect had two previous DUI arrests. And if he had been reported Officer Ron Singh would still be alive.  Authorities also saying the suspect had known gang affiliations and was trying to flee to Mexico. The slain officer was shot and killed during a traffic stop on Wednesday morning. Two others have also been arrested for helping the suspected murderer evade capture. Police announcing the arrest at an emotional press conference with the officer's family. Watch.",

He's an illegal who entered the country illegally, obviously illegal, he was a part of a notorious street gang. He had a couple of arrests and he murdered a police officer on Christmas Day. Now, you could possibly notion that illegal immigrants are less violent than the legal population or the people born here. That's fine. But, you know, more Americans die from heart decease than from cancer. That doesn't mean you don't fight cancer. OK. So, that argument goes away. The fact is that if you have prevented his illegal immigration, you would have a police officer, a good man who is still alive.   Second part now leads to the media will accuse people like us of using a tragedy in order to impact political discourse. Where did we learn that from, right? After a natural disaster is linked to climate change, after every mass shooting is linked to lack of gun control. When the child of an illegal immigrant attempts to cross the country and ends up the hospital, that's because we're a cold heartless country, who didn't treat these people correctly. So we've learned this. It makes me think that perhaps we should be using these tragedies. What else can we do? We see that this is wholly preventable. And what's really infuriating, it happened while we were having this discussion. We have been having this rolling discussion for two years about this. And it happened. If only someone had listened to it before, he would be alive. It's something that just people go you are using this. No, this is actually evidence that something has to be done.",

Is cracking down on sanctuary cities something that would have an evidence- based, demonstrable impact? I don't know the answer. I'm not an expert. But what is so frustrating about this shutdown is we are obsessed with this one thing. The wall. Can we get DACA for the wall, which I actually think or some wall funding which I think would be a good tradeoff. But the broader picture here, is the wall the right thing, what role do sanctuary cities play, what should we do with DACA, what about visa overstays which is a huge problem?

And I think that's what some of the Democrats have to do. Because they talk a big game, but for a lot of their voters, this is a nimby issue, not in my backyard. And they want to see something done on immigration. And you know, he acts so high and mighty now and so self-righteous, and he thinks he is so much better than the president in terms how he argues about immigration. And I may actually agree with Chuck Schumer on certain points. But when he said just a few years ago, people who went to the United States without our permission are illegal aliens. And illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the United States legally. That is an opposition to statements that he made.",

Authorities also saying the suspect had known gang affiliations and was trying to flee to Mexico. The slain officer was shot and killed during a traffic stop on Wednesday morning.

    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, first of all, it's obviously tragic, but it's also infuriating. It's infuriating because it was wholly preventable, if you stick to the facts. He's an illegal who entered the country illegally, obviously illegal, he was a part of a notorious street gang. He had a couple of arrests and he murdered a police officer on Christmas Day. Now, you could possibly notion that illegal immigrants are less violent than the legal population or the people born here. That's fine. But, you know, more Americans die from heart decease than from cancer. That doesn't mean you don't fight cancer. OK. So, that argument goes away. The fact is that if you have prevented his illegal immigration, you would have a police officer, a good man who is still alive. Second part now leads to the media will accuse people like us of using a tragedy in order to impact political discourse. Where did we learn that from, right? After a natural disaster is linked to climate change, after every mass shooting is linked to lack of gun control. When the child of an illegal immigrant attempts to cross the country and ends up the hospital, that's because we're a cold heartless country, who didn't treat these people correctly. So we've learned this. It makes me think that perhaps we should be using these tragedies. What else can we do? We see that this is wholly preventable. And what's really infuriating, it happened while we were having this discussion. We have been having this rolling discussion for two years about this. And it happened. If only someone had listened to it before, he would be alive. It's something that just people go you are using this. No, this is actually evidence that something has to be done."

Not hard-working immigrants who are doing whatever they can to get a foothold in this country, and make lives better for themselves and for their families. But for people like this, who have prior arrests, who shouldn't have been in the country, especially after putting other people's lives at risk with DUI arrests, and you know, they essentially are shielded. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Here is what I would say. We need to take a look at everything and try to figure out what the solutions would be. Is a border wall actually something that would be a solution? There are Republicans like Will Hurd from Texas, a congressman, who actually said it would not be a good solution. There are smart people who not believe this is the right solution. Is cracking down on sanctuary cities something that would have an evidence- based, demonstrable impact? I don't know the answer. I'm not an expert. But what is so frustrating about this shutdown is we are obsessed with this one thing. The wall. Can we get DACA for the wall, which I actually think or some wall funding which I think would be a good tradeoff. But the broader picture here, is the wall the right thing, what role do sanctuary cities play, what should we do with DACA, what about visa overstays which is a huge problem?

And when you see their reaction, there is a component of this that is preventable. There was no way you could watch this and somehow step back and defend sanctuary cities. I mean, that is a part of the conversation that should not be happening. There are good people on both sides of the debate about immigration, you want to talk about comprehensive reform, even when we talk about the wall. You made good points. Some people feel maybe the wall is in the best route or maybe the wall isn't the only route. It has to be coupled with other things. But you're going to watch this and somehow defend a sanctuary city that defies federal law and mayors like the mayor of Oakland who comes out and lambastes ICE and says to its residents, you know, I will give you a warning to protect you from ICE. Border patrol agents have been vilified, ICE has been vilified. And there are people in this country who are a known risk, who have a known record, and they are being allowed to exist here.

And I think that's what some of the Democrats have to do. Because they talk a big game, but for a lot of their voters, this is a nimby issue, not in my backyard. And they want to see something done on immigration. And you know, he acts so high and mighty now and so self-righteous, and he thinks he is so much better than the president in terms how he argues about immigration. And I may actually agree with Chuck Schumer on certain points. But when he said just a few years ago, people who went to the United States without our permission are illegal aliens.

But he put it front and center. And by virtue of him doing that, everybody that loathed him now had to hate that policy. I mean, Chuck Schumer sounds like Donald Trump in that clip that we heard. He is echoing the very same talking point. But now, because this is Trump's issue and the wall has become a priority for Trump, when they oppose Trump, they have to oppose that measure, even if it is counterintuitive to what they've been saying for a very long time.
