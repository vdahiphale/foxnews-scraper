They have the very latest.

Not when moms and dads will bury kids this week and more sons and daughters will grow up without parents.\"  Nancy Pelosi, she's out there calling on Speaker Paul Ryan to create a select committee to examine gun violence in America. Hillary Clinton, she took things further, going after the NRA. Here's what she tweeted. Quote, \"Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside and stand up to the NRA and work together to try and stop all of this from happening again.\" Beyond disgusting, inappropriate and pathetic.  Now, Clinton weighed in less than nine hours after the shooting and went deep into the gutter of politics she said she doesn't want to play. Here is my question. Do they have any decency? Any thoughts about the families? We don't know the details yet. But this is their initial impulse. Keep watching, the images on the side of your screen tonight. As anyone on the left criticized Hillary or other Democrats for making this point? I don't see it. Imagine if the president today brought up the Second Amendment. How would the news media in this country have reacted? We don't know the motivation of this lunatic. We know it was premeditated, we know it's evil, I could make a hundred different arguments if it wasn't a gun it would be a car or a bomb or whatever. The only thing the Democrats should be focused on tonight, the country needs to be focused on, the victims that are in the hospital, their families and the investigation, because we don't have facts.But instead, they couldn't even wait a half a day to play politics. Shameful. And members of the media, they are also going directly after the victims. Liberal CNN Jeff Zeleny suggests that the only person President Trump is -- the only reason he's going to Vegas is because the victims in the audience may have been his supporters. Really?

I'm actually,\" -- listen to this -- \"not even sympathetic [because] country music fans are often Republican gun toters.\" Wow! This has nothing to do about which party you support. Those were Americans that were shot, those are Americans fighting for their lives. These tragedies happened under Democratic presidents, too. You don't believe me? Look at the mass shootings where eight or more died under President Bill Clinton, including Columbine High School. And here's all the mass shootings using the same metrics that happened under President Obama, if you are so desperate to play politics. You also have the Washington Navy Yard and Sandy Hook, also the shooting at Fort Hood.  These were all tragedies. The people that carry out these acts are despicable, deranged and evil. You know what? The right didn't do what Bill Clinton did after the Oklahoma City bombing and blame talk radio and fertilizer. And guess what? We didn't blame Barack Obama for tragedies that happen on his watch. My main criticism was him not identifying radical Islamic terrorism when it was so obvious and true. Exploiting this shooting is pathetic. It's the most pathetic thing that Democrats in the media is doing right now. Yet every single time something like this takes place, they rush to judgment without facts, immediately calling for stricter gun control. The lack of sympathy for the families that the media won't show and the left isn't showing, speaks volumes. And it's not surprising. If you watch TV all weekend, they are doing the exact same thing when it comes to the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.   The island was pounded, a category five, 200 mile-per-hour winds. They had two hurricanes, all the infrastructure, the electrical grid, their water, their power, their cell service all knocked out. Airports, roads almost impassible around the whole country. And instead of focusing on the Trump administration's, their valiant efforts to help those people in need, well, the media ignored all the facts on the ground and they again try to use a natural disaster to, what? Hurt the president. Politicize it. Destroy the president. Politicize it, bring up race, anything else they could. Watch this.  GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, \"GMA\"/ABC: You've also heard a lot of commentary saying that yesterday might have been President Trump's Katrina moment. Here with Hurricane Maria. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"MEET THE PRESS\"/NBC: Let's go back to, you know, this comparison with Katrina, whether or not, this is Trump's Katrina, this could actually be worse.

And in the last hour we are being told that 12 of those remained in critical condition, although officials also tell us they are very hopeful that those 12 will all survive, but tonight in the operating rooms behind us and in operating rooms at other hospitals across Las Vegas, surgeons are again fighting to keep those survivors alive. We spoke to one surgeon earlier Sean, who told us he has had many years here in Vegas, he has seen many gunshot wounds, he has never seen anything like the injuries that came in last night. That is because of the kind of caliber of weaponry that the 64-year-old was using as he reigned down that carnage at the Mandalay bay hotel. We've also heard tales of ordinary civilians stopping in their pickup trucks and other vehicles to help ferry the wounded to these hospitals, because the ambulance services were clearly so overwhelmed with well over 500 wounded. An urgent call went out earlier today too for blood donations and the people of Las Vegas responded in an extraordinary fashion lining up for between six and eight hours at every single blood donation unit that was set up around the City. These clearly, Sean, have been the worst of times for the people of Las Vegas, but once again in the worst of times, we are seeing the best of the spirit of the American people.",

Speakers expressed grief and anger, but they all also talked about how Las Vegas is a city of unity and that what happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas. They said situations like this, what happens in Vegas touches the state and the rest of the land. Speakers also talked of hope and heroism, people turning their cars into ambulances and getting victims to the hospital. Stranger helping stranger, scramble over a fence to get out of harm's way. Of hotels offering rooms now to families of victims streaming into the City. And of people waiting many, many hours to donate blood. A relief fund announced this morning has already raised over a million dollars, some of that money will help pay for funerals. In the meantime the police are still trying to determine why 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd of 22,00 concertgoers. They are looking into his background and talking to people who knew him and they continue to process no fewer than four crime scenes. Sean, just a short time ago the mayor of Las Vegas spoke bluntly when she said that while the city is heartbroken, it will not be tarnished by the actions of this one sick individual.",

Let's take a look right there at the side of your screen -- we must warn you the images you are watching, they are heartbreaking, horrifying, lives shatter, dreams destroyed. Now, some of these victims are still in the hospital clinging to life. We still don't have all the facts. You know what, bodies weren't even in the morgue yet. Parents were at hospitals with their kids that are hanging onto life. None of this mattered to the left in this country.

We can and must put politics aside and stand up to the NRA and work together to try and stop all of this from happening again.\" Beyond disgusting, inappropriate and pathetic. Now, Clinton weighed in less than nine hours after the shooting and went deep into the gutter of politics she said she doesn't want to play. Here is my question. Do they have any decency? Any thoughts about the families? We don't know the details yet. But this is their initial impulse. Keep watching, the images on the side of your screen tonight. As anyone on the left criticized Hillary or other Democrats for making this point? I don't see it. Imagine if the president today brought up the Second Amendment. How would the news media in this country have reacted? We don't know the motivation of this lunatic. We know it was premeditated, we know it's evil, I could make a hundred different arguments if it wasn't a gun it would be a car or a bomb or whatever. The only thing the Democrats should be focused on tonight, the country needs to be focused on, the victims that are in the hospital, their families and the investigation, because we don't have facts.But instead, they couldn't even wait a half a day to play politics. Shameful. And members of the media, they are also going directly after the victims. Liberal CNN Jeff Zeleny suggests that the only person President Trump is -- the only reason he's going to Vegas is because the victims in the audience may have been his supporters. Really? That's pretty twisted and very sick. Watch."

So, this is something that I'm not surprised at all to see him go there visiting early. Something else I think to keep in mind, a lot of these country music supporters were likely Trump supporters. And this is something that of course is hitting the tapestry of all Americans and they're going to be victims from across the country here."

A top lawyer for CVS was fired earlier today after writing on Facebook, listen to this, quote, \"If they wouldn't do anything when children were murdered, I have no hope that Republicans will ever do the right thing. I'm actually,\" -- listen to this -- \"not even sympathetic [because] country music fans are often Republican gun toters.\" Wow! This has nothing to do about which party you support. Those were Americans that were shot, those are Americans fighting for their lives. These tragedies happened under Democratic presidents, too. You don't believe me? Look at the mass shootings where eight or more died under President Bill Clinton, including Columbine High School. And here's all the mass shootings using the same metrics that happened under President Obama, if you are so desperate to play politics. You also have the Washington Navy Yard and Sandy Hook, also the shooting at Fort Hood. These were all tragedies. The people that carry out these acts are despicable, deranged and evil. You know what? The right didn't do what Bill Clinton did after the Oklahoma City bombing and blame talk radio and fertilizer. And guess what? We didn't blame Barack Obama for tragedies that happen on his watch. My main criticism was him not identifying radical Islamic terrorism when it was so obvious and true. Exploiting this shooting is pathetic. It's the most pathetic thing that Democrats in the media is doing right now. Yet every single time something like this takes place, they rush to judgment without facts, immediately calling for stricter gun control. The lack of sympathy for the families that the media won't show and the left isn't showing, speaks volumes. And it's not surprising. If you watch TV all weekend, they are doing the exact same thing when it comes to the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. The island was pounded, a category five, 200 mile-per-hour winds. They had two hurricanes, all the infrastructure, the electrical grid, their water, their power, their cell service all knocked out. Airports, roads almost impassible around the whole country. And instead of focusing on the Trump administration's, their valiant efforts to help those people in need, well, the media ignored all the facts on the ground and they again try to use a natural disaster to, what? Hurt the president. Politicize it. Destroy the president. Politicize it, bring up race, anything else they could. Watch this. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, \"GMA\"/ABC: You've also heard a lot of commentary saying that yesterday might have been President Trump's Katrina moment. Here with Hurricane Maria. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"MEET THE PRESS\"/NBC: Let's go back to, you know, this comparison with Katrina, whether or not, this is Trump's Katrina, this could actually be worse.

There's also this headline from the Washington Examiner, Neighboring mayor praises the president, says that San Juan mayor -- who supported Hillary -- is playing politics and didn't even show up for the FEMA meetings. So, not only is the San Juan mayor not telling the truth about the president, she is skipping all of these important meetings. And for the record, the governor of Puerto Rico is also saying the Trump administration has been doing a phenomenal job in their response. Why do the liberal mainstream media lie to you all week?

You see in that audience right there, like I said, people from all over the United States all joining in together and singing. By the way, there's one young man I want to say his name on your program, a young kid from Big Sandy Tennessee, his name is Sonny and he was in his mid-20s, he came to the Big and Rich show, first time he been to a big concert like this and he was one of the very first casualties. We shook his hand and met him in the meet and greet and this -- it's something so terrible you can't digest what this really is. But at least people should be able to hold their tongues for a while and not disrespect all these people that have lost their lives and that are now fighting for their lives in the hospitals. We got no time for that."

The FBI is also bringing its full investigative and forensic resources to bear on this case, opening a 1-800-tip line for videos, social media post that can really help investigators recreate the scene. The FBI has ability to process massive amounts of data and to do it rapidly.

And in the last hour we are being told that 12 of those remained in critical condition, although officials also tell us they are very hopeful that those 12 will all survive, but tonight in the operating rooms behind us and in operating rooms at other hospitals across Las Vegas, surgeons are again fighting to keep those survivors alive. We spoke to one surgeon earlier Sean, who told us he has had many years here in Vegas, he has seen many gunshot wounds, he has never seen anything like the injuries that came in last night. That is because of the kind of caliber of weaponry that the 64-year-old was using as he reigned down that carnage at the Mandalay bay hotel. We've also heard tales of ordinary civilians stopping in their pickup trucks and other vehicles to help ferry the wounded to these hospitals, because the ambulance services were clearly so overwhelmed with well over 500 wounded. An urgent call went out earlier today too for blood donations and the people of Las Vegas responded in an extraordinary fashion lining up for between six and eight hours at every single blood donation unit that was set up around the City. These clearly, Sean, have been the worst of times for the people of Las Vegas, but once again in the worst of times, we are seeing the best of the spirit of the American people."

      "utterance": "Sean, on this chamber of commerce day in Las Vegas, a crowd gathered to remember the darkest night the city had ever seen to mourn those who lost their life last night and pray for the recovery of those wounded in last night's massacre. Speakers expressed grief and anger, but they all also talked about how Las Vegas is a city of unity and that what happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas. They said situations like this, what happens in Vegas touches the state and the rest of the land. Speakers also talked of hope and heroism, people turning their cars into ambulances and getting victims to the hospital. Stranger helping stranger, scramble over a fence to get out of harm's way. Of hotels offering rooms now to families of victims streaming into the City. And of people waiting many, many hours to donate blood. A relief fund announced this morning has already raised over a million dollars, some of that money will help pay for funerals. In the meantime the police are still trying to determine why 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd of 22,00 concertgoers. They are looking into his background and talking to people who knew him and they continue to process no fewer than four crime scenes. Sean, just a short time ago the mayor of Las Vegas spoke bluntly when she said that while the city is heartbroken, it will not be tarnished by the actions of this one sick individual."

If also awaiting a police news conference for the very latest news and information. As soon as they come to the podium we will bring it to live.

This is the reflex, and that is more division of America, that is not America coming together. If they want to push gun laws in the 2020 election or 2018, that their right, they should go through the political process and try to abridge our second amendment rights, but I think there are certain rights that are God-given that are nonnegotiable. A right to defend ourselves, our right that is inalienable for us to protect our families and our friends."

And the only thing I say is I played for Sheriff Clarke earlier tonight the police dispatch. The 32nd floor where this guy is. This guy has a machine gun. How are they going to take them on without a weapon? Or if it's happening within a crowd, if they were in San Bernardino, do you want Sean Hannity, who is trained in the safety and use of a firearm in that room?

We have different religious backgrounds, that is fine.
