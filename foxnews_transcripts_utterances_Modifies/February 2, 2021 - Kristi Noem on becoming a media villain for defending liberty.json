While, blue state governors tortured their states with destructive COVID policies, many of them saw a corresponding rise in violent crime as well. But one state leader has stood above the rest. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is here on why her leftist critics are still trying to take her down. Also, tonight, we've warned you about a domestic spying operation under Biden. Well, wait till you hear what some so-called experts are pushing through a new \"New York Times\" article. Kim Strassel and Dinesh D'Souza unpack it.  But first, \"China's Useful Idiots,\" that's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now, sometimes the U.S. medical cartel lets the truth slip out. They get comfortable when they're gabbing with their friends, like when Dr. Fauci appeared in his, I don't know, millionth on-camera interview with David Ignatius.",

In other words, no matter what we do here in the U.S., double, triple, quadruple masks, social distancing, more closures, more vaccines, unless the virus is eradicated from every corner of the earth, Fauci is saying we can't have our old lives back. That's what he's saying. So now we know this was never about flattening the curve or saving the hospitals, a worthy goal. This was never about our needing to be patient and do our part. It was never about developing vaccines. It was never about how well we were doing vis-a-vis other nations. Because if the virus is still present in a country, let's say like Malawi, America is not safe. No normal, can't go back.  Now, the Left, perversely, loves the pandemic. After all, they believe climate change requires that we will end up using less, consuming less, traveling less, which means we're going to enter a period of slow, steady and permanent decline anyway. So we might as well get used to it. COVID is a perfect time to do it.   And, remember, the climate nuts and irrational bureaucrats, all at the W.H.O., they believe that it is immoral for the U.S. to have a higher standard of living than any other country. They want something called wealth harmonization for a more placid and ecologically friendly planet. But let's tease this out a little bit more. Which nation stands to benefit the most if the United States is less free and less prosperous and more beholden to, let's say, global bureaucrats and unelected experts? OK, if you answer China, you win the home version of \"The Ingraham Angle\" board game. Good for you.  Now the CCP hid the truth about the virus's origins, we know that. Then they let it rage around the world and devastate millions. And now its evil regime will end up dominating while we stupidly adopt a new permanent, new normal. Now, Bill Gates whose net worth won't change much if China runs the show has just the answer for preventing future pandemics. And of course, it involves global superstructures.  BILL GATES, CO-CHAIR BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION: If there turns out to be some new infectious pathogen, then we need a group of infectious disease responders to spring into action. Think of these as like pandemic firefighters. Stopping the next pandemic will require a big investment. But I think of this as the best insurance policy the world could buy.",

Joe Biden's entire mandate is solving the coronavirus pandemic, nothing more, nothing less. And now we find out it was a complete fraud. The men pulling his strings are apparently fine with a forever pandemic as long as it allows them to stay on TV, and as long as it gives the medical establishment unlimited power and resources. Again, the great reset. Now, Republicans and anyone with common sense must not allow this madness, this destructive insanity to continue, and that's The Angle.  Joining me now is Dr. Scott Atlas, former White House COVID Adviser, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Dr. Atlas, you just heard THE ANGLE.

This is the rational, sensible way. We have a virus here that has a target audience, if you will, of high risk. It's not true that everyone's at high risk from this virus. It's not true that, for instance, children need to be locked out of in-person schools. The data is in. It's been in for months, by the way, it's nothing new.

But the idea that he doesn't know the data, I believe that for a second. He's made clear now that we're not going back to normal. I think the exact same thing that I said in May continues to happen. The goalpost will always shift. Kids aren't going to go back to school if he has anything to say about it.  I'm sorry. They're not going to force the kids to go back to school.

Number three, looking at the exceptions to the rule, instead of putting things into perspective, like somebody who's actually knowledgeable about medical science.   There's been gross failure after failure in articulating things to make the American people - instead of keep - igniting them with fear, to put them in a rational sense of expectation, the rational sense of expectation. I don't care what was just said in that interview, is that we protect the people that are at high risk to die and open everything up. That's the point of getting the vaccine.

And those numbers released by Chicago Police Department are conservative. \"The Chicago Sun Times\" puts the number of killings at 54. And while the murder rate is always the most concerning, it's not the only violent crime on the rise. In January Chicago, had a 144 carjackings. That means 2021 is now on pace to outdo the carjackings in 2020 and 2020 had double the carjackings of 2019. The number of carjackings is also setting off alarm bells, because most police say that carjackers are between the ages of 15, 18 maybe 20. And it's not just Chicago seeing a rise in crime. In a sample of 34 American cities from New York to Norfolk, Virginia, The National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice says the murder rate increase in 2020 has \"no modern precedent.\"  For example, homicide rates from 2019 to 2020 were up 30 percent which translates to an additional 1,200 killings. And the study says oddly the murder rate didn't fit usual crime patterns. Normally, homicides increase during summer months and decrease during the fall and winter. But the 2020 murder rate steady throughout the year, though it did peak a bit during the summer riots. Gun assaults and aggravated assaults also went up. In fact, the Commission says the reasoning for the increase is that the pandemic, quoting here, \"disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, placing at-risk individuals under additional physical, mental, emotional and financial stress.\" And the situation was further aggravated, says the report, by lack of outreach to those who were most affected.

Now, Fauci will just give another interview in, what, three months and say there's just another mutation. It's too risky. Can't open up.

In other words, no matter what we do here in the U.S., double, triple, quadruple masks, social distancing, more closures, more vaccines, unless the virus is eradicated from every corner of the earth, Fauci is saying we can't have our old lives back. That's what he's saying. So now we know this was never about flattening the curve or saving the hospitals, a worthy goal. This was never about our needing to be patient and do our part. It was never about developing vaccines. It was never about how well we were doing vis-a-vis other nations. Because if the virus is still present in a country, let's say like Malawi, America is not safe. No normal, can't go back. Now, the Left, perversely, loves the pandemic. After all, they believe climate change requires that we will end up using less, consuming less, traveling less, which means we're going to enter a period of slow, steady and permanent decline anyway. So we might as well get used to it. COVID is a perfect time to do it. And, remember, the climate nuts and irrational bureaucrats, all at the W.H.O., they believe that it is immoral for the U.S. to have a higher standard of living than any other country. They want something called wealth harmonization for a more placid and ecologically friendly planet. But let's tease this out a little bit more. Which nation stands to benefit the most if the United States is less free and less prosperous and more beholden to, let's say, global bureaucrats and unelected experts? OK, if you answer China, you win the home version of \"The Ingraham Angle\" board game. Good for you. Now the CCP hid the truth about the virus's origins, we know that. Then they let it rage around the world and devastate millions. And now its evil regime will end up dominating while we stupidly adopt a new permanent, new normal. Now, Bill Gates whose net worth won't change much if China runs the show has just the answer for preventing future pandemics. And of course, it involves global superstructures. BILL GATES, CO-CHAIR BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION: If there turns out to be some new infectious pathogen, then we need a group of infectious disease responders to spring into action.

This is the rational, sensible way. We have a virus here that has a target audience, if you will, of high risk. It's not true that everyone's at high risk from this virus. It's not true that, for instance, children need to be locked out of in-person schools. The data is in. It's been in for months, by the way, it's nothing new.

But the idea that he doesn't know the data, I believe that for a second. He's made clear now that we're not going back to normal. I think the exact same thing that I said in May continues to happen. The goalpost will always shift. Kids aren't going to go back to school if he has anything to say about it. I'm sorry. They're not going to force the kids to go back to school.

It's what happened with Ebola and a whole host of other deadly contagions. Contrary to the doomsday, as my next guest says, it's a reason why COVID is in a steep decline across the country. Joining me now is Dr. Harvey Risch, the Yale School of Public Health from there. Dr. Risch the virus is mutating. We've been talking about viral mutations since, I don't know last March.

And as we see what Dr. Atlas said, you vaccinate and treat high risk people and let the rest of the population get on with life, and that's what ends the pandemic. Mutations come, the same principles apply. There will be some degree of immunity from the earlier infections and the vaccination, and whatever needs to be made up will be made up by treating or vaccinating again and that's how we handle it.

And those numbers released by Chicago Police Department are conservative. \"The Chicago Sun Times\" puts the number of killings at 54. And while the murder rate is always the most concerning, it's not the only violent crime on the rise. In January Chicago, had a 144 carjackings. That means 2021 is now on pace to outdo the carjackings in 2020 and 2020 had double the carjackings of 2019. The number of carjackings is also setting off alarm bells, because most police say that carjackers are between the ages of 15, 18 maybe 20. And it's not just Chicago seeing a rise in crime. In a sample of 34 American cities from New York to Norfolk, Virginia, The National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice says the murder rate increase in 2020 has \"no modern precedent.\" For example, homicide rates from 2019 to 2020 were up 30 percent which translates to an additional 1,200 killings. And the study says oddly the murder rate didn't fit usual crime patterns. Normally, homicides increase during summer months and decrease during the fall and winter. But the 2020 murder rate steady throughout the year, though it did peak a bit during the summer riots. Gun assaults and aggravated assaults also went up. In fact, the Commission says the reasoning for the increase is that the pandemic, quoting here, \"disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, placing at-risk individuals under additional physical, mental, emotional and financial stress.\" And the situation was further aggravated, says the report, by lack of outreach to those who were most affected.

Several experts I spoke with recommended that the Biden administration put together a cross agency task force to tackle disinformation and domestic extremism, which would be led by something like a reality czar.\" In other words, an arm of the government dedicated to demonizing and censoring Biden's political opposition, how convenient, something we were mocked for warning you about many weeks ago. Here now is Kimberley Strassel, \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board member, FOX News quote. Also with me is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator and filmmaker. Kim, \"Pravda\" would be applauding the \"New York Times\" for propagating these disturbing recommendations. It seems like a laugh, a parody at this point. But it's not. It's coming perhaps to a government near you, namely Biden's."

It was only a couple of weeks ago that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested that we have a truth commission in Congress that the media should come in front of. She was laughed at. And yet two weeks later, here we are, and \"The New York Times\" is treating that as a serious idea and quoting people with respectable positions suggesting this indeed should become a reality in the Biden administration.

It's almost as if there's a group of people, we're in some dystopian future society where a group of vicious people are taking Orwell not as a warning but as a handbook. They open up Orwell, they go, oh, my gosh, this guy has some fantastic ideas. Let's start implementing them right away. So this whole notion of a ministry of truth controlling information, acting as if they get to define what reality is when reality should be emerging through observation, experiment, criticism, debate. All our processes from science to the law are based upon the idea of contested ideas, and somehow in politics they want to abolish them."

At least terrorism and violence are crimes, but extremism, you get a Biden administration that just decides anything that is beyond its pale somehow gets lumped into the same category as terrorism and violence.

So we're now living in a world where words have lost their basic meaning, terms like incitement don't really mean incitement. They mean things like defending yourself, speaking up for yourself, playing your appropriate part in a formal Senate trial. And the fact that you have this cozy relationship between the media and the Biden team shows we don't really have a functioning free press in the country. The press are sort of in on it, and it's almost like they're making coded signals to the Biden press secretary.

Those same toxic forces are pushing this BLM coloring book on children in D.C. and New York City. One page urges kids to be transgender affirming. And on the national page promoting BLM's week of action, there's a quote from FBI most wanted terrorist Assata Shakur. Shakur is a former member of the Black Liberation Army, and was serving a life sentence for taking part in the murder of a New Jersey state trooper in 1973. That is until she escaped and fled to Cuba. So who's behind this? A Boston University professor named Ibram X. Kendi.

They have convinced everybody from school age on up that we have inherent racism in every sector of our economy and our lives. And then they have created a market-based solution for it, which is if you pay me, I will come and teach you. It's almost like a form of the mob if you're a corporation. It's protection money. If you want to avoid having strikes, if you want to avoid having trouble in your workspace, you will pay this consultant. And to be clear, this isn't the old once a year sexual harassment training that everybody had to sit through. Today's version of diversity, equity, and inclusion, so called DEI consulting, is a constant process. Your work is never over, to use this term. You have to constantly be bringing in these experts to come in and host and provoke these conversations. You know what, most of our corporations are there to provide products, build value for their shareholders. They didn't have a problem in the first place to the degree that these companies have convinced them. And now these people have a multibillion dollar industry that is expanding into federal contracting. It is used by companies to defend themselves against lawsuits. And now they're reaching into the schools with some fairly horrifying concepts that most parents are not aware that are being pushed. So it is a dangerous business."

And by the way, Twitter cofound Jack Dorsey, he donated $10 million to his Center for Antiracist Research, Kendi's center. Before that, the company Vertex Pharmaceuticals handed Kendi's center $1.5 million. The Rockefeller Foundation, of course, gave another $1.5 million. Fairfax County public schools in northern Virginia paid Kendi 20k for an hourlong lecture, and spent another $24,000 buying his books. Harmeet, you add that up around the country, grievance pays."
