      "sentences": "So, talk about a rough week. Terrorists attack the Kabul airport, killing 13 U.S. service members, 10 Marines, two Army soldiers, and one Navy corpsman. At least 160 Afghans were killed. The mayhem believed to be carried out by the Islamic group ISIS-K. The president tried to speak, then Jen Psaki spoke. But somehow, I don't feel comforted.  The president seemed defeated, lost between spasms of anger. Then followed instructions to use a list of reporters given to him by whoever is really in charge.  And Jen was just Jen, acting as though she was doing us a favor instead of her job. A job I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. And besides Perino already was press secretary.  I go back to one question, though, how can everyone but the people in charge not see this coming? Maybe they were so busy distracting us that they got distracted while distracting us? Look, I'm an English major magazine editor turned class clown with an obsession over unicorns, and I could see this coming. Hell, the blind shake could see this coming.  After a conference call with Helen Keller, How could the people in charge not? Perhaps they did and just assumed carnage was the price we pay. Or maybe they just underestimated the risk, which boggles the mind. But again, I'm no expert. And yet, how do I know better? Going forward, how can we have any confidence in our leaders? I wouldn't let them leave my paintball team. They make the Bay of Pigs look well thought out.  I mean, who gives control of the airport perimeter to the Taliban as well as info on Americans? Could we have made it any easier for these medieval maggots? Oh, they will say hey, we had no choice. But when has the military with the best weapons not had a choice? Instead, they led us to a place where there was no plan B. That's not leadership. That's resignation.   And where are the resignations? Where are the firings? Maybe General Milley should put down the Robin DiAngelo and pick up the art of war. The upside no more arguments over the meaning of the word stranded. We got a good visual of that at the podium yesterday. Biden is stranded. When really it's on the Democrats and the media. They only wanted Joe to win, but not to govern. And now he has to lead and he can't. And don't even think of impeachment. Who could replace him? It's incredible how the woke embrace has destroyed the Democratic Party.   You can't lead a country you think is racist while obsessing over pronouns and crackpots in Viking hats. So, we ended up relying on the Taliban to keep us safe. That's like letting Charlie Manson babysit your kids. It reminds me of the Portland mayor who decided to make peace with Antifa while shafting the cops. We chose a regime that stones women to death for showing too much ankle at the expense of our troops.  So, why so many smart people making bad decisions? Well, maybe they're not that smart. Or maybe politics polluted their decision-making, driven by a still fresh loathing of Trump or our country itself.   Having to get out by the end of August was a political choice, a self- induced deadline with the emphasis on dead. Not providing adequate security? Another political choice. We couldn't have that many troops there, right? That's bad optics they thought. Well, I got worse optics. A target with more sitting ducks than a decoy factory. Remember how under Trump it was a new crisis every day, every hour. CNN told us the walls were closing in. From the Steele dossier to the tax returns, and every phony scandal in between.  Those scandals were the good old days. High caloric low nutrition, outrage, junk food, Compare and contrast to now, Kabul is the real deal, real horror, real scandal, a blind consensus of sheer incompetence. So what do we do? Well, I'm no military general, but then again, does that matter? We must take responsibility for our people over there, get them all out, and obliterate those responsible for the bombings. And when we're done, we can decide what to do with Joe and the rest of that clown car.  Think about this, after committing 20 years to one effort. We accepted the very opposite of that effort quickly and without looking back. Like a husband who tells his wife and kids that he's going out for cigarettes only to never return. Leaving his loved ones vulnerable and unprotected. Someone should pay for that.  But in the meantime, I don't want to hear -- about January 6th, climate change, mask mandates, or voter suppression, or whenever gassy, stupid political theatre you're trying to peddle until you figure out how to get us out of this mess. But maybe asking them for help to get us out is as stupid as relying on the Taliban for the same thing.",

And in this case, anybody talking about impeachment is talking about it based on a rage over the death of Americans. But talking about it in that vein, that just cheapens impeachment, but about that perfect phone call -- all right, up next, a bonus monologue.

Either way, there's no science to back that up unless tyranny is considered science. Fact is the politicians want to cover your face to cover their asses. Meanwhile, I'd like to cover their face with my ass. Figuratively. Figuratively.  Meanwhile, you got hysteria in Australia as the media and police chase down quarantine breakers. This is in a country where the national bird is beer. So, hysteria is now a virus. We don't need a shot of Moderna, we need a shot of valium. But this is driven by a denial of reality and risk. If you believe we must do everything to reduce the risk to zero, then every freedom is up for grabs. Unless you're the Obamas party planner. True, we could probably get COVID death down to zero. We could also get car fatalities to zero too. You want to avoid traffic accidents completely? Pass a unicycle mandate. That make Tom happy. But this pandemic is really messing with the racists. Like Hakeem Jefferson, a Stanford professors spit out a bunch of tweets, claiming protesters of school mask mandates were doing so due to their whiteness. Some snippets, \"Make no mistake, the crazy opposition to mask-wearing, you can't disconnect it from whiteness.\" He adds, \"It's not just cause these white folks are GOP. It's cause they're white, and believe whiteness confers upon them a kind of a power that places them above government action.\" That's nonsense.  Then, Jefferson tweets, \"whiteness be working overtime.\" Like we say in the south, the devil is busy. Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say he just compared white people to the devil. Which is impossible because I do not do well in the heat. Jefferson also says that people of color can be committed to whiteness. That's his way of addressing any black parent who also dare question mask mandates or critical race theory or voting Republican. Every black who disagrees with him, he Uncle Tom's, claiming they're people of color attracted to their oppressors. No wonder the L.A. Times can freely call Larry Elder, a successful black man, now the face of white supremacy. Elders running for a California Governor against a white liberal who's turned that state -- literally. Watch your step tourists. California's official export is hobo poop. Now, there is a new Ben and Jerry's flavor. Chunky hobo poop.  Meanwhile, NFL legend Herschel Walker -- Herschel -- it was like he's a Sex in the City character. Herschel! Herschel Walker is running for senate as a Republican. Now, I doubt, Jefferson would spew this nonsense to Walker primarily to his face. Instead, he'll probably just start an online petition to take his Heisman away.",

I don't see the problem there. Apparently, it caused enough outrage among fans that the company took the survey results down from its Web site.

As for the Leprechaun, critics referred to him as a disparaging symbol of Irish Catholics. But the school pushback saying there's no comparison to their mascot and the indigenous Warner's use worriers used by other institutions. Speaking of other schools, the new school, which is a private college in New York, has redesigned their mascot to be a gender neutral social justice warrior named Narls Narwhal. Narls holds a dual degree in Communications and Environmental Studies, which actually accurately mirrors new school students by having no employable skills.

      "utterance": "So, talk about a rough week. Terrorists attack the Kabul airport, killing 13 U.S. service members, 10 Marines, two Army soldiers, and one Navy corpsman. At least 160 Afghans were killed. The mayhem believed to be carried out by the Islamic group ISIS-K. The president tried to speak, then Jen Psaki spoke. But somehow, I don't feel comforted. The president seemed defeated, lost between spasms of anger. Then followed instructions to use a list of reporters given to him by whoever is really in charge. And Jen was just Jen, acting as though she was doing us a favor instead of her job. A job I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. And besides Perino already was press secretary. I go back to one question, though, how can everyone but the people in charge not see this coming? Maybe they were so busy distracting us that they got distracted while distracting us? Look, I'm an English major magazine editor turned class clown with an obsession over unicorns, and I could see this coming. Hell, the blind shake could see this coming. After a conference call with Helen Keller, How could the people in charge not? Perhaps they did and just assumed carnage was the price we pay. Or maybe they just underestimated the risk, which boggles the mind. But again, I'm no expert. And yet, how do I know better? Going forward, how can we have any confidence in our leaders? I wouldn't let them leave my paintball team. They make the Bay of Pigs look well thought out. I mean, who gives control of the airport perimeter to the Taliban as well as info on Americans? Could we have made it any easier for these medieval maggots? Oh, they will say hey, we had no choice. But when has the military with the best weapons not had a choice? Instead, they led us to a place where there was no plan B. That's not leadership. That's resignation. And where are the resignations? Where are the firings? Maybe General Milley should put down the Robin DiAngelo and pick up the art of war. The upside no more arguments over the meaning of the word stranded. We got a good visual of that at the podium yesterday. Biden is stranded. When really it's on the Democrats and the media. They only wanted Joe to win, but not to govern. And now he has to lead and he can't. And don't even think of impeachment. Who could replace him? It's incredible how the woke embrace has destroyed the Democratic Party. You can't lead a country you think is racist while obsessing over pronouns and crackpots in Viking hats. So, we ended up relying on the Taliban to keep us safe. That's like letting Charlie Manson babysit your kids. It reminds me of the Portland mayor who decided to make peace with Antifa while shafting the cops. We chose a regime that stones women to death for showing too much ankle at the expense of our troops. So, why so many smart people making bad decisions? Well, maybe they're not that smart. Or maybe politics polluted their decision-making, driven by a still fresh loathing of Trump or our country itself. Having to get out by the end of August was a political choice, a self- induced deadline with the emphasis on dead. Not providing adequate security? Another political choice. We couldn't have that many troops there, right? That's bad optics they thought. Well, I got worse optics. A target with more sitting ducks than a decoy factory. Remember how under Trump it was a new crisis every day, every hour. CNN told us the walls were closing in. From the Steele dossier to the tax returns, and every phony scandal in between. Those scandals were the good old days. High caloric low nutrition, outrage, junk food, Compare and contrast to now, Kabul is the real deal, real horror, real scandal, a blind consensus of sheer incompetence. So what do we do? Well, I'm no military general, but then again, does that matter? We must take responsibility for our people over there, get them all out, and obliterate those responsible for the bombings. And when we're done, we can decide what to do with Joe and the rest of that clown car. Think about this, after committing 20 years to one effort. We accepted the very opposite of that effort quickly and without looking back. Like a husband who tells his wife and kids that he's going out for cigarettes only to never return. Leaving his loved ones vulnerable and unprotected. Someone should pay for that. But in the meantime, I don't want to hear -- about January 6th, climate change, mask mandates, or voter suppression, or whenever gassy, stupid political theatre you're trying to peddle until you figure out how to get us out of this mess. But maybe asking them for help to get us out is as stupid as relying on the Taliban for the same thing."

Either way, there's no science to back that up unless tyranny is considered science. Fact is the politicians want to cover your face to cover their asses. Meanwhile, I'd like to cover their face with my ass. Figuratively. Figuratively. Meanwhile, you got hysteria in Australia as the media and police chase down quarantine breakers. This is in a country where the national bird is beer. So, hysteria is now a virus. We don't need a shot of Moderna, we need a shot of valium. But this is driven by a denial of reality and risk. If you believe we must do everything to reduce the risk to zero, then every freedom is up for grabs. Unless you're the Obamas party planner. True, we could probably get COVID death down to zero. We could also get car fatalities to zero too. You want to avoid traffic accidents completely? Pass a unicycle mandate. That make Tom happy. But this pandemic is really messing with the racists. Like Hakeem Jefferson, a Stanford professors spit out a bunch of tweets, claiming protesters of school mask mandates were doing so due to their whiteness. Some snippets, \"Make no mistake, the crazy opposition to mask-wearing, you can't disconnect it from whiteness.\" He adds, \"It's not just cause these white folks are GOP. It's cause they're white, and believe whiteness confers upon them a kind of a power that places them above government action.\" That's nonsense. Then, Jefferson tweets, \"whiteness be working overtime.\" Like we say in the south, the devil is busy. Now, if I didn't know any better, I'd say he just compared white people to the devil. Which is impossible because I do not do well in the heat. Jefferson also says that people of color can be committed to whiteness. That's his way of addressing any black parent who also dare question mask mandates or critical race theory or voting Republican. Every black who disagrees with him, he Uncle Tom's, claiming they're people of color attracted to their oppressors. No wonder the L.A. Times can freely call Larry Elder, a successful black man, now the face of white supremacy. Elders running for a California Governor against a white liberal who's turned that state -- literally. Watch your step tourists. California's official export is hobo poop. Now, there is a new Ben and Jerry's flavor. Chunky hobo poop. Meanwhile, NFL legend Herschel Walker -- Herschel -- it was like he's a Sex in the City character. Herschel! Herschel Walker is running for senate as a Republican. Now, I doubt, Jefferson would spew this nonsense to Walker primarily to his face. Instead, he'll probably just start an online petition to take his Heisman away."

I don't see the problem there. Apparently, it caused enough outrage among fans that the company took the survey results down from its Web site. The top three offensive mascots were Florida State's Osceola. Is that what it is? And Renegade San Diego State's Aztec warrior. That's when the producers go silent. They don't tell you -- no, I don't know what it is. And Hawaii's vile -- Villy, the warrior. I would like to be called a warrior. As for the Leprechaun, critics referred to him as a disparaging symbol of Irish Catholics. But the school pushback saying there's no comparison to their mascot and the indigenous Warner's use worriers used by other institutions. Speaking of other schools, the new school, which is a private college in New York, has redesigned their mascot to be a gender neutral social justice warrior named Narls Narwhal. Narls holds a dual degree in Communications and Environmental Studies, which actually accurately mirrors new school students by having no employable skills.

Hitting up your buddy, Steven Spielberg for some cash. I think we can all relate to that. So, yes, I think Tom's right.

You don't have to deal with the crime or the inflation or the price -- or the poor, or the prep the prices of real estate.

A recent poll finds that the number of French women sunbathing topless has hit a 40-year low. Thanks, Obama. Apparently just 90 percent of French women son baby topless nowadays, compared to 40 percent in 1984, when Kat was only 20. Among the reasons they're choosing to cover up, 46 percent said they worry about being secretly photographed and posted on social media. Another 48 percent were worried about being harassed by men; and 53 percent said they worry about skin cancer, which makes sense you shouldn't remain unprotected in the sun for long periods of time. We here at GUTFELD support the efforts in prudence sunbathing. I myself no longer sunbathe topless, but bottomless? That's another story. Am I right, Tom Shillue? Party. Yes! You're prepared for that, weren't you? Damn it. DeVito, this is the, this is the, this is a problem."
