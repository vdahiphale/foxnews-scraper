Health care, school, cheeseburgers, free anything is awesome especially if you believe that free anything actually exists. It doesn't.  Take the tuition free joke, more than eight million student borrowers have defaulted on their federal loans for higher education. Why is that? Thanks to all that free and easy money from the loans. There's no incentive for colleges to cut admission cost and no reason not to go to college. Education costs triple, debt exploded, now the streets are paved with English majors.   College administrations balloons because the loans inflated the tuition. It looked like it was free but now you're broke. Which means you can't buy cars, goods, or a home because you're busy paying off Uncle Sam. That's how you kill industries. That's socialism. It's a drag on the economy and it's a drag on you. Still, so many think that if you vote socialist, all your debts are forgiven. If students are debt-free then colleges must be cost-free. Free buildings, free books, free beer, free you, free me. Socialism's talent is getting people like Sanders to lie about free because who doesn't want a free life? Capitalism, it's such a drag like gravity. It's a downer. But if America's slow death is boring then let's just skip to the finish line, to Venezuela where Maduro detained a reporter for showing video of people eating from a garbage truck. Oh, look, free food. In a socialist paradise, that's what you call a Bernie burger.   Welcome back, Dana. See, I wrote that down there. Welcome back, Dana.",

So, how did they figure it out? They didn't just say give it away for free. They figured out a way to work with employers so that employers that think they want to hire you and your junior -- when you're a junior, they think they want to hire you, they start paying you then.

It's just not the same type of national security emergency because on DACA, for as wrong that that was, I think, for going around the congress, it wasn't actually asking for money.

Health care, school, cheeseburgers, free anything is awesome especially if you believe that free anything actually exists. It doesn't. Take the tuition free joke, more than eight million student borrowers have defaulted on their federal loans for higher education. Why is that? Thanks to all that free and easy money from the loans. There's no incentive for colleges to cut admission cost and no reason not to go to college. Education costs triple, debt exploded, now the streets are paved with English majors. College administrations balloons because the loans inflated the tuition. It looked like it was free but now you're broke. Which means you can't buy cars, goods, or a home because you're busy paying off Uncle Sam. That's how you kill industries. That's socialism. It's a drag on the economy and it's a drag on you. Still, so many think that if you vote socialist, all your debts are forgiven. If students are debt-free then colleges must be cost-free. Free buildings, free books, free beer, free you, free me. Socialism's talent is getting people like Sanders to lie about free because who doesn't want a free life? Capitalism, it's such a drag like gravity. It's a downer. But if America's slow death is boring then let's just skip to the finish line, to Venezuela where Maduro detained a reporter for showing video of people eating from a garbage truck.

If you look at somebody like former governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels, who's now the president of Purdue University, they knew that they had a problem with school tuition. It's going up. So, how did they figure it out? They didn't just say give it away for free. They figured out a way to work with employers so that employers that think they want to hire you and your junior -- when you're a junior, they think they want to hire you, they start paying you then. So they helped defray the cost of tuition so that you will then have a job going through, and it's worked really well. But that's an innovative way to do things."

That's the only way you can pay for this stuff. And he doesn't have a plan besides taxing everybody. Donald Trump does. He wants to grow the middle class.

We've really now seen that come full force in American foreign policy because we're simultaneously negotiating with one of the world's nuclear powers, North Korea, while we're negotiating with the Chinese. So, it's just like from my like nerdy geopolitical perspective it's one of the most fascinating times in history. I think what we have -- what we've seen is that the status quo as it relates to North Korea was untenable. What President Trump when he -- inherited when he came into office. And so, I totally, 1000 percent, concur with your point about diplomacy taking time. I don't think that we're going to get some sort of huge expectations out of this summit, but it's about building trust.

But what you see is that Republicans are saying on the Capitol Hill, not the Trumpian popular because the popular support is there for Trump in terms of his base. But in terms of Republicans on Capitol Hill, they're saying, you know what? So you get a Democrat and the Democrats declare a national emergency over guns, or over climate change, etcetera, and we don't want this president, including Mitch McConnell, you know.

You know, Lindsey Graham just tweeted right before we came on the show that Vice President Pence said today that in 2014, Obama declared a national emergency for 120,000 miners that were interdicted at the border. We had 120,000 or over that already in just this fiscal year. So you can argue whether it's humanitarian crisis, whether it's a national emergency, but Democrats, as the senator pointed out, has spent billions of dollars working on the crisis at the border. But what's happened here is anything that Trump is for that they're against. Trump is for capitalism. We're for socialism. Trump is for a free democracy in Venezuela. We're for a dictator. We're for Maduro. You know, we've just heard earlier, you know, as it relates to North Korea, Trump is trying to peace -- potentially peace deal in North Korea, we're suddenly become war hawks and support a more aggressive stance on North Korea.

And why would Colorado, I'm just asking you guys honestly, I know they got a new governor. He's going to sign this bill. Why would you give away your power as a state, why would you do that? What about - what if what if there is like major election fraud in North Carolina, for example? Are you going to tie your vote to North Carolina if there's major election fraud?

States that aren't as populated so if you can't win the electoral college, the next thing to do is to try to change the laws or change the constitution so you can win the next time. I have a better idea how about just win an election by campaigning via the electoral college, go to Wisconsin, go to Michigan, go to places that you didn't want to show up to because you took them for advantage and win an election the old fashioned way. I think if we want to change the constitution, the process as Dana just laid out, is a constitutional amendment, not these silly state laws because bitter liberals can't accept it."

Just see how many people show up at the game and those who have the most people at the game win and then you don't even have to have the game or you could have the game but don't score but it has nothing to do with excellence or competence, just who shows up.

The train is now back at the station in Eugene, Oregon but it took hours because they could only move at two miles per hour. Thankfully no one was injured. Juan, you and I are Amtrak warriors.
