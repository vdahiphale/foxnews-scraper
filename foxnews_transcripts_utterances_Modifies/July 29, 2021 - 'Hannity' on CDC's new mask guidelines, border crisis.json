And at the border, well, migrants, many infected with COVID, they are pouring across in record numbers. Joe is not doing a darn about it. If you're a law-abiding taxpaying American, you better cower in fear under the Biden administration's ever changing and evolving COVID-19 policy recommendations forever and ever. Of course, not an easy task, because over the past six months, the CDC and the NIH have given conflicting and contradictory messages on vaccines, travel, COVID variants, the origins of COVID-19, herd immunity, outdoor transmissibility, indoor transmissibility, asymptomatic spread, et cetera. By the way, none of this is applied to the border. On masks, there have been dozens and dozens of different recommendations. Now, they're actually demanding something they said, if you're vaccinated, you're good to go, you don't have to worry, life gets back to normal -- yeah, even vaccinated Americans now they want to wear masks again and after recommending no mask, two masks, one mask, now after recommending no mask outdoors but mask indoors, and then after you're vaccinated no masks and on and on and on. If you're confused -- well, you probably should be. If you, you know, stuck your finger in the wind, took a wild guess on COVID-related matters, you'd probably be more consistent than Fauci, Walensky and other so-called health experts in our federal government, even Dr. Joe. But don't take my word for it, just take a look at the timeline. You decide.",

You know, is this really what following the science looks like? If it is, we're all in trouble or are they just reacting to the hysteria du jour on fake news CNN and MSDNC and \"The New York Times\"? Either way, the Biden administration -- well, sick and tired of we, the American people not listening to the sage advice coming from, quote, their experts and they know just who to blame. Oh, when all else fails, let's blame Donald Trump and his supporters. But unlike the Biden administration, this program, we've been consistent from the beginning. We told you to take it seriously. We told you to do your own research, to consult with your doctor or doctors. Take into account your current medical condition, your medical history and then in consultation with your doctor, make your own decision as it relates to vaccines. As a talk show host, I know I've gotten a lot of pressure to tell everybody what to do but I will say it again I'm not qualified to make that decision for you. But I do want you to live and to take this seriously and to if you do the following things that I recommend I think you'll get to the answer that's best for you in consultation with your doctor. This program has long touted the belief in science, the belief in the science of vaccines. I can't even list how many vaccines I've had in my life. We hailed Operation Warp Speed from the beginning. We called it a medical miracle. I predicted it would be American doctors and medical researchers and scientists that ultimately saved the world. Well, look at the therapeutics, the three vaccines they developed. And just the last year -- well, you know who wasn't so fond of the vaccines. Guess what? That was Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, the rest of the New Green Deal socialist Democrats, so-called journalists at MSDNC and CNN. We've got the proof that they were anti-vaccine. Take a look.",

So you might be wondering is Joy Reid or Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or any of these left-wing lunatics in the media the Democratic Party ever recanted their anti-vaxxed comments, have they ever apologized, corrected the record? Well, you already know the answer. Have any of them ever put aside their differences and actually said, you know what, Donald Trump did a great job with Operation Warp Speed and with therapeutics and giving people the option of three separate vaccines because of Warp Speed? Have they ever given him any credit on anything at all? The answer is, of course, not hating Donald Trump is the single most important thing to them every second minute hour of every 24-hour day. It's more important than the truth. It's even more important than getting Americans vaccinated. And for them, there's no greater duty than to obsessively hate the 45th president of the United States. And now, they wonder why so many Americans -- yeah, they don't trust them. Record low numbers. And tonight, top Democrats, they wonder why Americans won't get the vaccine -- well maybe they should look in the mirror because of their conflicting messages. Joining us now with reaction, Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, you know, I've gone over this. I could spend an entire program playing your fellow Democrats and the media mob and they're changing and vacillating viewpoint almost by the day. But one thing is sure is that we every American was told again and again -- get the vaccine and guess what your life goes back to normal and you won't have to worry what other people do.

      "sentences": "Well, you're right. And the Democrats have from the beginning of this pandemic, treated it as a matter of politics. From the shutdowns we saw all over the country, to the schools that were closed, and the kids that were hurt, to the jackbooted thugs that went persecuting people of faith, who were going to church and singing in church, we saw a political agenda instead of common sense to keep us safe. And I got to say that culminated yesterday in the CDC's absurd decision that people who have been vaccinated must nonetheless where masks when inside. And that decision, Sean, that's not science. That's politics. It's pure politics. You know what? Yesterday, vaccines work. Today, they still work, but as a political matter, the Democrats decided they want to control your lives. They want everyone to wear a mask. And my view is real simple -- we shouldn't have federal government mandates on COVID. That means no mask mandates, that means no vaccine mandates, that means no vaccine passports. This should be a question of individual choice. Now, look, personally, I've gotten the vaccine. My family's gotten the vaccine. That's the choice we've made. But I also believe in individual freedom and responsibility. It's your choice to decide what's right for you, what's right for your family and you don't need a bunch of meddling bureaucrats from Washington setting a mandate and deciding you have to do this, to go to work, to go to school, to get on a plane to live. And this Democratic Party, you know, the CDC has destroyed their credibility. A year and a half ago, the CDC was one of the most respected scientific organizations in the world, and they allowed themselves to be politicized with Dr. Fauci at the helm of the politicization. And right now, their credibility is in tatters because they behave more like an arm of the DNC than an actual, serious, medical and scientific organization.",

We have kids in overcrowded Biden cages that he built on top of each other in the middle of a pandemic, very little testing. The few illegal immigrants offered the vaccine, about a third of them are saying, no thanks, and they're still being allowed into the U.S. And then they're being transported I guess to the state of their choice. How do you justify the onerous burdens that are being put on the American people and yet they're letting in people with a very high rate of positive COVID -- COVID positivity at the border and doing next to nothing about it with zero control? And even if they test positive, they just get put in a - - you know, in a hotel and nobody checks on them.",

They're more than happy to put all sorts of mandates on American citizens, whether it's mask mandates, whether it's shutdowns of your business. Whether it's shutting down your schools and hurting your kids, they're willing to do all of that. But when it comes to illegal immigrants, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have had a complete open border. We're on a pace to have over million people cross illegally in this country. It's the worst rate of illegal immigration in years. It was caused by Joe Biden and kamala Harris. And I got to say I've spent a lot of time at the border, I've spent a lot of time with Border Patrol agents down in the Rio Grande Valley, and we are seeing -- last month, we saw 180,000 people cross the border illegally. They are being crammed into the Biden cages. You notice much of the corrupt corporate media won't show the Biden cages. They're helping Joe Biden cover it up. But I've seen the Biden cages. I brought 19 senators down to the valley to see the Biden cages of little boys and little girls packed in one on top of each other. When we were there, they had a rate of COVID positivity of over 10 percent. And like a churning revolving door Joe Biden is releasing them. There was just a report this week that the Biden administration has released over 50,000 illegal aliens without even giving them a court date, just release them. And you know what? They're asked to report into ICE. About 13 percent of them report into ICE. It's spreading COVID in our communities. And I'll tell you right now, the election of Joe Biden, Joe Biden becoming president of this country was a COVID super-spreader event because they're releasing illegal aliens in south Texas and all across the country with COVID and they're spreading COVID. And yet their radical policies, they don't want to do anything to protect us.",

Okay, now, the Cleveland Clinic, a very prestigious medical institution, Gregg Jarrett, said if you got COVID, you don't need any vaccine I'm just following the science. They're going to force those people. They're going to mandate a vaccine there. What about people with rare medical conditions? Are there going to be medical exemptions? How hard are those exemptions going to be to get? And is the next thing a vaccine passport which eliminates medical privacy and doctor-patient confidentiality?",

Private employers and government officials can make the decision. There's even a Supreme Court decision decades ago that says it's legal to mandate vaccines. And yes I've heard the arguments for some people who say, oh, wait a minute, that doesn't apply to emergency use authorization. Yes, it does, they're wrong about that. I will agree that the failure to get final approval is one of the reasons why millions of Americans are refusing to get the vaccine, which invites the question, why hasn't Joe Biden pushed the FDA to accelerate approval? You know, cut through the red tape. To his great credit, Donald Trump ordered the FDA to cut through the red tape to provide emergency use authorization for Moderna, for Pfizer, for Johnson and Johnson. What people don't realize is that the testing and standards for the emergency use of the COVID vaccines is just as rigorous as final approval. The FDA is bogged down in red tape and if Joe Biden really cared, as he says he does, about getting millions more Americans vaccinated, he could do what Trump did and cut the red tape. We wouldn't even be having this conversation if he'd exercise the power and the will. And you know, one wonders why he hasn't done it? Is clueless Joe unaware that he has that power or does he just not care enough? Or is he getting really bad advice?",

Quote: We won't go back. We won't mask our children. Joe Biden and his administration learned nothing from the last year. Brave Americans learned how to safely and responsibly live and fight back. Don't surrender to COVID. Here with more: FOX News contributor, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. He's soon to lose his position as one of the best governors in history when his daughter takes over, along with former senior adviser to President Trump and that would be Stephen Miller. You know, I'm looking at this, Governor, and there's a lot of issues here that get really serious. You know, since August of last year, that's nearly a full year, Governor DeSantis has had in-person learning in Florida. And they didn't have the challenges that that many on the left said would happen, just the opposite.

I also wanted to be able to travel and live freely, get rid of the mask. And if they really want people to be vaccinated and I think most of us would like to see a greater level of vaccination -- well, one way to do it is to make sure that there is a benefit of being vaccinated. Not having to wear a mask everywhere was one of those benefits. When the CDC decided to take it away, they destroyed a serious incentive. But here's a question I've got for the Biden administration. Why do you dislike the immigrated -- these immigrant children so much? And if they say, well, no, we love those children. Well, if you care about them so much why are you allowing them to be exposed to COVID, not have vaccinations, not have to wear a mask and be able to travel all over the place and expose people. You must not like them very much. So why don't you explain your disdain and your dislike and your contempt for these precious children because what you're showing is that you really don't care what happens to them and we're seeing that every single day.

The administration has declared war on our kids and it's also declared war on science.

And at the same time, it's your kids are suffering from these onerous restrictions. We are admitting unlimited numbers of people of all ages, including record numbers of alien minors into the country, unscreened, untested, unchecked, unvaccinated and unmasked.

Also breaking tonight, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an executive order restricting the transportation of migrants due to COVID-19. He joins us now with more. Governor, this has been an extraordinarily, challenging legal issue for you, in as much as the when the federal government does not enforce the law of the land, there have been legal precedent -- precedents preventing you from doing so. That has now resulted in you now spending and allocating $250 million to build the wall.

However, because of manpower needs, we need to have the National Guard not just engaged to assist but to engage to arrest that will lead to the jailing of the people who are coming across the border illegally. Now on top of that, what you just talked about -- my new executive order today. This stems from what Sara was talking about, but what happened yesterday in La Jolla, Texas, where it was learned that migrants have been released by Border Patrol. They were in La Jolla found at a Whataburger with extreme signs of illness. And they themselves said they had COVID-19. And then it was learned there was a hotel full of people with COVID-19, and that's exactly why I issued this executive order. It does a couple of things. One is it empowers the Texas Department of Public Safety to stop any vehicle where there is a suspicion that that vehicle may be transporting migrants into and around the state of Texas who may have COVID-19. And second, it orders the Department of Public Safety to return that vehicle to either the point of origin which would be where the Border Patrol officers let them go or to the port of entry. And so, I have a job to protect the safety and health of the people state of Texas and that includes especially now preventing President Biden from importing COVID-19 into Texas, as well as into to the United States.",

And what can we do to prevent this from ever happening again? Because get this -- the national police association is slamming this biased January 6 probe as a, quote, dog and pony show, and is calling for an investigation into last summer's rioting, what, 574 official riots, thousands of cops hurt, 25 dead. And as usual, Democrats are not telling you the entire story, all while making disgusting comparisons between oh, January 6th and September the 11th and the civil war. Now, this, of course, is complete -- a complete rewriting of history. It completely ignores the history of violence -- yes, even at our U.S. Capitol, sadly. Mark Levin made many of these points last night, the great one. Now, for example, 1915, former Harvard professor actually exploded dynamite in the Senate reception room over the 4th of July weekend. 1954, Puerto Rican terrorists entered the U.S. Capitol, fired at lawmakers from the gallery, wounding five. 1971, left-wing extremist members of -- oh, yeah, Barack Obama's good friend Bill Ayers' group, the Weather Underground. Yeah, they set off a bomb in the Capitol. November of '83, leftists also linked to the Weather Underground set off a bomb. That hit the Senate majority leader's office at the time. In '98, an armed gunman, he killed two Capitol police officers while trying to storm the offices of then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay. And just back in April, a 25-year-old reported following -- a follower of Louis Farrakhan attacked the U.S. Capitol with his car, killing one officer and injuring another. Democrats -- well, they want you to ignore all that history, use the hearings, only talk about one riot. Last summer, they actually were in full denial, rarely if ever talked about the rioting last summer and never mentioned it during the Democratic National Convention and Kamala Harris was actually -- well, advocating bail funds to get rioters out of jail. Here with reaction, Congressman Jim Banks, along with former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Jim Banks, once I saw you and Jim Jordan taking off this commission and let's see -- Liz Cheney is on there. Adam Kinzinger is on there, I'm thinking, okay, this is a predetermined outcome. How -- if rioting is wrong and I believe what happened on the 6th is wrong, I've said what happened over the summer last year where thousands of cops hurt, that was wrong. Businesses looted, and arson that took place, city blocks taken over. Where's that commission? This seems like they have a predetermined outcome here.",

The reality is, the reason is, is that this is a predetermined political conclusion. And the conclusion is that Donald Trump is to blame for everything, and that's what the conclusion will be. It's like walking in the court where the judge has already made the decision. This is a commission that's already made its decision. And by the way, the Democrat House already impeached Donald Trump. So they're going at it again from a different angle. The fact of the matter is you're right. Where were the Democrats when Representative Pressley called for when the BLM riots were taking place, she called for unrest in the streets? She didn't call for a peaceful protest. She called for unrest in the streets. And where were the Democrats when Vice President Harris at the time put out a tweet trying to raise money for the Minnesota Freedom Fund to actually bail out people who are committing felonies on the streets which they did and she called for people to donate money to that Minnesota Freedom Fund? Which, by the way, bailed out a felon two times, once for rioting and damaging a police precinct, bail him out $5,000, bailed him out again when he was -- when he got caught with illegal guns, cocaine, mushrooms for $60,000.

If you're a law-abiding taxpaying American, you better cower in fear under the Biden administration's ever changing and evolving COVID-19 policy recommendations forever and ever. Of course, not an easy task, because over the past six months, the CDC and the NIH have given conflicting and contradictory messages on vaccines, travel, COVID variants, the origins of COVID-19, herd immunity, outdoor transmissibility, indoor transmissibility, asymptomatic spread, et cetera. By the way, none of this is applied to the border. On masks, there have been dozens and dozens of different recommendations. Now, they're actually demanding something they said, if you're vaccinated, you're good to go, you don't have to worry, life gets back to normal -- yeah, even vaccinated Americans now they want to wear masks again and after recommending no mask, two masks, one mask, now after recommending no mask outdoors but mask indoors, and then after you're vaccinated no masks and on and on and on.

And I got to say that culminated yesterday in the CDC's absurd decision that people who have been vaccinated must nonetheless where masks when inside. And that decision, Sean, that's not science. That's politics. It's pure politics. You know what? Yesterday, vaccines work. Today, they still work, but as a political matter, the Democrats decided they want to control your lives. They want everyone to wear a mask. And my view is real simple -- we shouldn't have federal government mandates on COVID. That means no mask mandates, that means no vaccine mandates, that means no vaccine passports. This should be a question of individual choice. Now, look, personally, I've gotten the vaccine. My family's gotten the vaccine. That's the choice we've made. But I also believe in individual freedom and responsibility.

How do you justify the onerous burdens that are being put on the American people and yet they're letting in people with a very high rate of positive COVID -- COVID positivity at the border and doing next to nothing about it with zero control? And even if they test positive, they just get put in a - - you know, in a hotel and nobody checks on them."

They're more than happy to put all sorts of mandates on American citizens, whether it's mask mandates, whether it's shutdowns of your business. Whether it's shutting down your schools and hurting your kids, they're willing to do all of that. But when it comes to illegal immigrants, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have had a complete open border. We're on a pace to have over million people cross illegally in this country. It's the worst rate of illegal immigration in years. It was caused by Joe Biden and kamala Harris. And I got to say I've spent a lot of time at the border, I've spent a lot of time with Border Patrol agents down in the Rio Grande Valley, and we are seeing -- last month, we saw 180,000 people cross the border illegally. They are being crammed into the Biden cages. You notice much of the corrupt corporate media won't show the Biden cages. They're helping Joe Biden cover it up. But I've seen the Biden cages. I brought 19 senators down to the valley to see the Biden cages of little boys and little girls packed in one on top of each other. When we were there, they had a rate of COVID positivity of over 10 percent. And like a churning revolving door Joe Biden is releasing them. There was just a report this week that the Biden administration has released over 50,000 illegal aliens without even giving them a court date, just release them. And you know what? They're asked to report into ICE. About 13 percent of them report into ICE. It's spreading COVID in our communities. And I'll tell you right now, the election of Joe Biden, Joe Biden becoming president of this country was a COVID super-spreader event because they're releasing illegal aliens in south Texas and all across the country with COVID and they're spreading COVID. And yet their radical policies, they don't want to do anything to protect us."

They're going to force those people. They're going to mandate a vaccine there. What about people with rare medical conditions? Are there going to be medical exemptions?

Private employers and government officials can make the decision. There's even a Supreme Court decision decades ago that says it's legal to mandate vaccines. And yes I've heard the arguments for some people who say, oh, wait a minute, that doesn't apply to emergency use authorization. Yes, it does, they're wrong about that. I will agree that the failure to get final approval is one of the reasons why millions of Americans are refusing to get the vaccine, which invites the question, why hasn't Joe Biden pushed the FDA to accelerate approval? You know, cut through the red tape. To his great credit, Donald Trump ordered the FDA to cut through the red tape to provide emergency use authorization for Moderna, for Pfizer, for Johnson and Johnson. What people don't realize is that the testing and standards for the emergency use of the COVID vaccines is just as rigorous as final approval. The FDA is bogged down in red tape and if Joe Biden really cared, as he says he does, about getting millions more Americans vaccinated, he could do what Trump did and cut the red tape. We wouldn't even be having this conversation if he'd exercise the power and the will. And you know, one wonders why he hasn't done it?

And if they really want people to be vaccinated and I think most of us would like to see a greater level of vaccination -- well, one way to do it is to make sure that there is a benefit of being vaccinated. Not having to wear a mask everywhere was one of those benefits. When the CDC decided to take it away, they destroyed a serious incentive. But here's a question I've got for the Biden administration. Why do you dislike the immigrated -- these immigrant children so much? And if they say, well, no, we love those children. Well, if you care about them so much why are you allowing them to be exposed to COVID, not have vaccinations, not have to wear a mask and be able to travel all over the place and expose people. You must not like them very much. So why don't you explain your disdain and your dislike and your contempt for these precious children because what you're showing is that you really don't care what happens to them and we're seeing that every single day.

The administration has declared war on our kids and it's also declared war on science. And the best evidence of that is that we have unfettered, unrestrained, unchecked illegal immigration from people who are COVID positive being released into Texas, being released in Arizona, being released all across the country. And at the same time, it's your kids are suffering from these onerous restrictions. We are admitting unlimited numbers of people of all ages, including record numbers of alien minors into the country, unscreened, untested, unchecked, unvaccinated and unmasked.

Governor, this has been an extraordinarily, challenging legal issue for you, in as much as the when the federal government does not enforce the law of the land, there have been legal precedent -- precedents preventing you from doing so.

Up until now, they have been assisting the Texas Department of Public Safety. They've been assisting in the process of clearing the land and getting the land ready for the border wall as well as other activities like that. However, because of manpower needs, we need to have the National Guard not just engaged to assist but to engage to arrest that will lead to the jailing of the people who are coming across the border illegally. Now on top of that, what you just talked about -- my new executive order today. This stems from what Sara was talking about, but what happened yesterday in La Jolla, Texas, where it was learned that migrants have been released by Border Patrol. They were in La Jolla found at a Whataburger with extreme signs of illness. And they themselves said they had COVID-19. And then it was learned there was a hotel full of people with COVID-19, and that's exactly why I issued this executive order. It does a couple of things. One is it empowers the Texas Department of Public Safety to stop any vehicle where there is a suspicion that that vehicle may be transporting migrants into and around the state of Texas who may have COVID-19. And second, it orders the Department of Public Safety to return that vehicle to either the point of origin which would be where the Border Patrol officers let them go or to the port of entry. And so, I have a job to protect the safety and health of the people state of Texas and that includes especially now preventing President Biden from importing COVID-19 into Texas, as well as into to the United States."

And what can we do to prevent this from ever happening again? Because get this -- the national police association is slamming this biased January 6 probe as a, quote, dog and pony show, and is calling for an investigation into last summer's rioting, what, 574 official riots, thousands of cops hurt, 25 dead. And as usual, Democrats are not telling you the entire story, all while making disgusting comparisons between oh, January 6th and September the 11th and the civil war. Now, this, of course, is complete -- a complete rewriting of history. It completely ignores the history of violence -- yes, even at our U.S. Capitol, sadly. Mark Levin made many of these points last night, the great one. Now, for example, 1915, former Harvard professor actually exploded dynamite in the Senate reception room over the 4th of July weekend. 1954, Puerto Rican terrorists entered the U.S. Capitol, fired at lawmakers from the gallery, wounding five. 1971, left-wing extremist members of -- oh, yeah, Barack Obama's good friend Bill Ayers' group, the Weather Underground. Yeah, they set off a bomb in the Capitol. November of '83, leftists also linked to the Weather Underground set off a bomb. That hit the Senate majority leader's office at the time. In '98, an armed gunman, he killed two Capitol police officers while trying to storm the offices of then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay. And just back in April, a 25-year-old reported following -- a follower of Louis Farrakhan attacked the U.S. Capitol with his car, killing one officer and injuring another. Democrats -- well, they want you to ignore all that history, use the hearings, only talk about one riot. Last summer, they actually were in full denial, rarely if ever talked about the rioting last summer and never mentioned it during the Democratic National Convention and Kamala Harris was actually -- well, advocating bail funds to get rioters out of jail. Here with reaction, Congressman Jim Banks, along with former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Jim Banks, once I saw you and Jim Jordan taking off this commission and let's see -- Liz Cheney is on there. Adam Kinzinger is on there, I'm thinking, okay, this is a predetermined outcome. How -- if rioting is wrong and I believe what happened on the 6th is wrong, I've said what happened over the summer last year where thousands of cops hurt, that was wrong. Businesses looted, and arson that took place, city blocks taken over. Where's that commission? This seems like they have a predetermined outcome here."

And that's what makes me angry. I called on the Democrats last week to allow the head of the Capitol Police Union to testify along with these police officers and they said no, not only did they reject me and Jim Jordan, they rejected the head of the police union who represents every single Capitol Police officer, rank-and-file police officer who wanted to come and tell the story of the systemic breakdown of leadership and security at the Capitol. They sent out a press release last night and said since you didn't let us testify, we're going to tell our story to the public, that there was a -- that wasn't just about January. It was a lot of -- it was a lack of leadership leading up to January that was happening for a long time on Nancy Pelosi's watch, a lack of -- a lack of responsibility and leadership at the very top of the food chain.

It's like walking in the court where the judge has already made the decision. This is a commission that's already made its decision. And by the way, the Democrat House already impeached Donald Trump. So they're going at it again from a different angle. The fact of the matter is you're right. Where were the Democrats when Representative Pressley called for when the BLM riots were taking place, she called for unrest in the streets? She didn't call for a peaceful protest. She called for unrest in the streets. And where were the Democrats when Vice President Harris at the time put out a tweet trying to raise money for the Minnesota Freedom Fund to actually bail out people who are committing felonies on the streets which they did and she called for people to donate money to that Minnesota Freedom Fund? Which, by the way, bailed out a felon two times, once for rioting and damaging a police precinct, bail him out $5,000, bailed him out again when he was -- when he got caught with illegal guns, cocaine, mushrooms for $60,000.
