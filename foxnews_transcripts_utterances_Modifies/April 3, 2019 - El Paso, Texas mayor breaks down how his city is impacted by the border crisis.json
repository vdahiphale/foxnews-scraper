Second, with regard to grand jury material, if it's going to be released, it's in there, and it's in the report, it's either going to be redacted, in which case it's withheld, or the attorney general of the Department of Justice has to apply to a court in order to get an order to allow it to be disclosed to Congress.

Now, for the majority of the parents, there was no plea entered today. But there were a couple of interesting things that also came out of the court hearing unrelated to the Hollywood aspect, Loughlin, Huffman, as well of Loughlin's husband, Mossimo Giannulli. There was a set of parents in the afternoon, the first -- or among the first indicted by a grand jury in the case, Dr. Gregory Colburn and his wife, Amy. They're facing an additional charge in this case, but they essentially pled guilty, including that additional charge of money laundering.

Clearly, the attorney general can't release that information, unless there's a declassification by the president of that material. Second, with regard to grand jury material, if it's going to be released, it's in there, and it's in the report, it's either going to be redacted, in which case it's withheld, or the attorney general of the Department of Justice has to apply to a court in order to get an order to allow it to be disclosed to Congress. And that is entirely within the discretion of the Justice Department. I mean, they can't be compelled to file an order with the district court authorizing the release of grand jury information. So that's really the second thing. With regard to peripheral third players who were not charged, but where mentioned in the report..."

Former TV stars Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman traveling here down this road, just like any other defendant, walking in the front door of the courthouse here in Boston, surrounded by cameras and the chaos that had awaited them here in the courthouse. They went before the judge, like any of the other defendants in this case, all of them facing allegations that they bribed through the mastermind of this college admissions scheme to either pay coaches to help fake athletic profiles or to essentially pay someone to cheat on exams, all in an effort to get their kids into elite colleges or universities. Now, for the majority of the parents, there was no plea entered today. But there were a couple of interesting things that also came out of the court hearing unrelated to the Hollywood aspect, Loughlin, Huffman, as well of Loughlin's husband, Mossimo Giannulli. There was a set of parents in the afternoon, the first -- or among the first indicted by a grand jury in the case, Dr. Gregory Colburn and his wife, Amy. They're facing an additional charge in this case, but they essentially pled guilty, including that additional charge of money laundering. And also the first parent in this case that has decided to say he's going to plead guilty, Peter Sartorio, that coming -- information coming out of some court documents this afternoon. Reading now from those documents, that he is asking for a continuance to a court date later on this month and that he intends to plead guilty. He faces the same charge as the majority of parents in this case, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Overall, a very busy day in federal court here in Boston -- Charles, back to you."

Because, right now, we know that there is some evidence we haven't seen. There's communications that these people had with the folks that were running the scheme. And that's all going to play into their sentence, if they really take this all the way through to trial.

So when you have people that are kind of just exchanging information with one other person, and they're exchanging money, it may seem like it's not that big of a deal, but you're crossing interstate lines with financial exchanges, and then that pushes this to federal jurisdiction, which obviously is -- is where they're heading to court."

And what's interesting about this is that they're telling me some of these attacks -- I mean, I know he put out the statement today where he basically showed some contrition, correct, but behind the scenes, he's seething, and he really believes that these are coordinated attacks, at least some of them, from the Sanders campaign, Bernie Sanders."

I think politicians have forgotten that their main objective is serving the people, not their political party or their aligned interests. We the people continue to lose out when politicians grandstand, misrepresent facts or believe their role is to become famous. And we see that with Adam Schiff. I like what the page on FOX News said today, Sheriff Schiff, who says that he has evidence that Trump actually colluded with the Russians. And if that be the case, wouldn't he have supplied this to Mueller? And I know that he doesn't have it, but he wants to continue what the American people, 50 percent, half of Americans say was a witch-hunt. And this is very problematic, because now we get nothing done on Capitol Hill. There's no health care for anybody. And it's just a big mess. And the Democrats have created this pot and they continue to stir it."

And I think, like, the one thing that's clear from the report, or at least from the summary of the report that the attorney general put forth, there's nothing in the report that reveals the president committed an indictable offense. And so I think that a lot of Democrats and people on the left were hoping that -- they kind of put all their eggs in the Mueller basket, whereas now they're putting a lot of the focus on their own investigations, House Oversight, House Judiciary Committee. But this was always going to be a political fight. And I think that to the point that Democrats do want all the evidence, of course, it's in the public interest, because this is the president of the United States, to see the underlying evidence of this report. This has been something that's been going on for the past two years. But at the same time, at the end of the day, I think it's -- you can't lose perspective that this isn't going to be the thing that brings down the Trump presidency."
