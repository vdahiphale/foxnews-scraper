The latest on all this with Las Vegas independent Mayor Carolyn Goodman.  Mayor, very good to have you here. Thanks for coming.",

It's a five-year contract. I do believe hopefully the hotels will work with the union employees to give them some type of technological training. That's very important to them in this issue. But I don't think it's going to happen. Our last major culinary strike was in 1984, when we were a town of less than 500,000. Now we're 2.3 million, with 43 million visitors coming into town every year. So I think it will settle.",
