And Democrats tempted by the door cracked open by Mueller and (INAUDIBLE) to prove their case in impeachment proceedings.  No, we haven't been there since 1998 when family rooms were flooded with images of Monica Lewinsky and the President of the United States was deposed on national television. Producing endless fodder for late-night T.V., political pundits, and water coolers across the country. But the Clinton impeachment saga left a top political legacy as Republicans got burned at the ballot box losing seats in the midterm.

      "sentences": "Good to see you, Martha.  What a day. New this hour, just spoke to a senior campaign adviser to President Trump and said, if you follow logic of his critics, they used a phony dossier paid for by the Democrats to get the FBI investigating and then use the special counsel probe to try and craft an obstruction of justice case all because the president was mad and lashing out at what he believed to be an unfair investigation.  That is why the president and his aides tonight now want to focus on investigating the investigators. While Democrats are shifting a bit from collusion to obstruction. Trying to use this 400 plus page report to open a range of new investigations. Key part of that centers around May 2017 after the president fired James Comey from the FBI, and Comey at leaked memos to help spark the naming of Robert Mueller special counsel.   The president exploded in an Oval Office meeting as then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions briefed him. The report declares, \"The president slumped back in his chair and said, 'Oh my God. This is terrible this is the end of my presidency. I'm f'. Sessions recall that the president said to him, 'you were supposed to protect me,' or words to that effect.\" Now, of course, this leaves out the context that President Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder referred to himself as the president's wingman. And President Trump was not necessarily saying he was guilty, instead, he was venting at the crippling effect. The president saying, \"Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency.\" Now, despite Democrats repeatedly hinting Donald Trump Jr. was going to be indicted over that June 2016 Trumped Tower meeting. Bottom line from Mueller report, it was not criminal. But the report adds a lot of embarrassing details, but the president rejecting advice from aid Hope Hicks, to admit the president son was told the Russians were bringing damaging information on Hillary Clinton.  The president suggesting they lie and put out a public statement that it was about Russian adoption. Part of volume two of the report that's far more damaging in the president than volume one. 10 instances where the president acted in a way that, at least, raised questions about obstruction, allegations the president urge the White House Council Don McGahn to fire Mueller, he, of course, refused.  Later, the president tried to tamper with McGahn's testimony according to the report. Though even Mueller knows the president did not take any action to fire him. Barr, today the attorney general suggested the president was just blowing off steam, though Schiff and other Democrats are not giving in.",

First, I want to read the report, I want to think about it carefully. None of us says that even seen the fully unredacted report. I sit on the House Intelligence Committee, we also need to see all the classified parts of this report. And then, we should form an opinion about it.  I think this much is clear, the Russians attacked our country. We should care about that. The fact is, is that the president's conduct may not have been criminal, and I'll accept that finding. But I don't think it has been -- I don't think it's been correct. I don't think it's been good.  And I think the fact that an improper and unethical unpatriotic conduct is being treated as some sort of indication is an indication of just how far our politics have sunk. What I want us to understand is what's right and what's wrong. And there's a lot of wrong conduct in this report. It stinks to high heaven what the campaign did, what the president did, the way they attempted to get information, were willing to get information.  The way they sought to obstruct the investigation even if in non-criminal ways, none of that is what I want from the president of the United States.  It's not what my kids should see in the actions of their -- of their leader. And I think that all of us should just get clear on what's right and what's wrong. And on, there's a lot to be very concerned about here even if it doesn't rise to the level of being criminal, even if it doesn't rise to the level of impeachment.

Of course, we should have the full report out in the public domain where people can debate it and form their own opinions.  I don't want to see investigations just for the sake of investigation. And ultimately, it's pretty clear, we're going to have an election in a year and a half, and we're going to decide the course our country should pursue. I represent a district that voted for President Trump, I respect the people, they wanted to give him a chance. I respect the fact that a lot of people think some of his policies are good. I may disagree with that, but that's a fair disagreement. But we should all agree that there is no doubt anymore. The Russians attacked our country in a sweeping an unprecedented way. We have not adequately responded to that. We should not excuse conduct that's wrong, lying, covering up, getting in the way of investigations when the public has a right to know.   So our next move it seems to me is to do good oversight to ask fair questions to let the public know the truth and then to let the people decide whether this is the kind of conduct we should get in our president, or whether we can expect more.",

But in every turn as you go through it, it was rebuffed, you know. There's this whole -- I think about Carter Page who just -- you know, whose name became a household word during the course of this whole thing. And so, when I went through it this morning, I was curious to see what they actually found on Carter Page.  Just as one example, and I'm -- and I'm granted, you know, there's a lot here. But this is just one example, right? So, it says, on page 95 in volume one. \"The investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\"  That -- that's a pretty big headline. It's a simple sentence, but it's a pretty big headline given all of the discussion. Then, you go on and there's this back-and-forth. Page was asking if President Trump should go speak at a graduation in Russia, and he also wanted to take a trip to be part of this event in Russia. And he keeps approaching the campaign and Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager responds the same day. Saying, \"If you want to do this it would be outside of your role with DJT for president campaign. I am certain Mr. Trump will not be able to attend.\"  You know, and it's just an example of a very sort of clear-cut moment in all of this that just got so blown out of proportion over the course of two years.

That was Mueller's own problem is that you couldn't figure out where obstruction would have begun, and where Article two would have ended when you look at the legitimate exercise of that activity. And this was a unique circumstance, Martha, where you had the president of the United States who is the leader of the executive branch who knew that the executive branch was doing something, that was hurting the country by advancing this improper investigation. And these things didn't happen in a vacuum. I recall my conversations with the president during this time, and what he was most worried about was North Korea. Obama had told him that North Korea was the biggest problem in the world. And you've got this three-dimensional chess game with Russia, China, and North Korea, and the president wasn't able to really use all the tools so we want our president to use because he was under this domestic assault under this flawed investigation. So, he was doing everything possible to try to wind up the investigation legitimately so that he could go and be the president and the leader of the free world. Nothing wrong or criminal about that. And it's also evident that most of what the president was doing was in public, that's not how people commit crimes.",

Russia wanted the same thing.  But there was no agreement for them to coordinate or collude or conspire to make that happen. That's why we're unable to charge Donald Trump Jr. If there was a meeting of the minds, if there was evidence to support those claims, then I think you would have seen a criminal indictment. But obviously, the people who wrote this report are no fans of the president.  You had Andrew Weissmann who was a Hillary Clinton booster. You had Jeannie Rhee who represented the Clinton Foundation against FOIA requests. So this was a group of people who had an ax to grind.

It's ironic that right about now when he's starting his fundraising apparatus to run for President that he comes up with this idea and this attack. One of the things that really bothers me about this attack is that Mike Pence is a friend of mine. Mike and Karen are great people, they're Godly people, they are followers of Christ. They don't have hate in their heart for anyone. They know my partner. They have accepted us. Now you ask me, do we agree philosophically on every single issue? No, I don't agree philosophically with my hero, Dietrich Bonhoeffer on everything. I don't agree with my partner on everything. But the gay community used to be the community pushing tolerance and diversity. We were the ones that were saying everyone should be able to accept and love each other. Now, suddenly, there's a whole community of people that are demanding that we all think alike. I think it's outrageous. And let me just say one more thing is that when Mayor Pete came out, the Vice President complimented him and said he holds them in high regard.

New this hour, just spoke to a senior campaign adviser to President Trump and said, if you follow logic of his critics, they used a phony dossier paid for by the Democrats to get the FBI investigating and then use the special counsel probe to try and craft an obstruction of justice case all because the president was mad and lashing out at what he believed to be an unfair investigation. That is why the president and his aides tonight now want to focus on investigating the investigators. While Democrats are shifting a bit from collusion to obstruction. Trying to use this 400 plus page report to open a range of new investigations. Key part of that centers around May 2017 after the president fired James Comey from the FBI, and Comey at leaked memos to help spark the naming of Robert Mueller special counsel. The president exploded in an Oval Office meeting as then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions briefed him. The report declares, \"The president slumped back in his chair and said, 'Oh my God. This is terrible this is the end of my presidency. I'm f'. Sessions recall that the president said to him, 'you were supposed to protect me,' or words to that effect.\" Now, of course, this leaves out the context that President Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder referred to himself as the president's wingman. And President Trump was not necessarily saying he was guilty, instead, he was venting at the crippling effect. The president saying, \"Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels, it ruins your presidency.\" Now, despite Democrats repeatedly hinting Donald Trump Jr. was going to be indicted over that June 2016 Trumped Tower meeting. Bottom line from Mueller report, it was not criminal. But the report adds a lot of embarrassing details, but the president rejecting advice from aid Hope Hicks, to admit the president son was told the Russians were bringing damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The president suggesting they lie and put out a public statement that it was about Russian adoption. Part of volume two of the report that's far more damaging in the president than volume one. 10 instances where the president acted in a way that, at least, raised questions about obstruction, allegations the president urge the White House Council Don McGahn to fire Mueller, he, of course, refused. Later, the president tried to tamper with McGahn's testimony according to the report. Though even Mueller knows the president did not take any action to fire him. Barr, today the attorney general suggested the president was just blowing off steam, though Schiff and other Democrats are not giving in."

He does not recall or remember various bits of information. But remember, the president never invoked the executive privilege and his legal team never requested any redactions for the Mueller report that sounds more like cooperation. In fact, when you look through this entire report as you and I have been going through today, Martha. There's a lot of bad details for the president.

First, I want to read the report, I want to think about it carefully. None of us says that even seen the fully unredacted report. I sit on the House Intelligence Committee, we also need to see all the classified parts of this report. And then, we should form an opinion about it. I think this much is clear, the Russians attacked our country. We should care about that. The fact is, is that the president's conduct may not have been criminal, and I'll accept that finding. But I don't think it has been -- I don't think it's been correct. I don't think it's been good. And I think the fact that an improper and unethical unpatriotic conduct is being treated as some sort of indication is an indication of just how far our politics have sunk. What I want us to understand is what's right and what's wrong. And there's a lot of wrong conduct in this report. It stinks to high heaven what the campaign did, what the president did, the way they attempted to get information, were willing to get information.  The way they sought to obstruct the investigation even if in non-criminal ways, none of that is what I want from the president of the United States.  It's not what my kids should see in the actions of their -- of their leader. And I think that all of us should just get clear on what's right and what's wrong. And on, there's a lot to be very concerned about here even if it doesn't rise to the level of being criminal, even if it doesn't rise to the level of impeachment. The president has been absolutely appalling in his conduct and that we should expect better."

Of course, we should have the full report out in the public domain where people can debate it and form their own opinions. I don't want to see investigations just for the sake of investigation. And ultimately, it's pretty clear, we're going to have an election in a year and a half, and we're going to decide the course our country should pursue. I represent a district that voted for President Trump, I respect the people, they wanted to give him a chance. I respect the fact that a lot of people think some of his policies are good. I may disagree with that, but that's a fair disagreement. But we should all agree that there is no doubt anymore. The Russians attacked our country in a sweeping an unprecedented way. We have not adequately responded to that. We should not excuse conduct that's wrong, lying, covering up, getting in the way of investigations when the public has a right to know. So our next move it seems to me is to do good oversight to ask fair questions to let the public know the truth and then to let the people decide whether this is the kind of conduct we should get in our president, or whether we can expect more."

You know, sort of testing the soft spots, trying to figure out if they could make headway with some of these individuals who are involved in the campaign. But in every turn as you go through it, it was rebuffed, you know. There's this whole -- I think about Carter Page who just -- you know, whose name became a household word during the course of this whole thing. And so, when I went through it this morning, I was curious to see what they actually found on Carter Page. Just as one example, and I'm -- and I'm granted, you know, there's a lot here. But this is just one example, right? So, it says, on page 95 in volume one. \"The investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with Russian government in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.\" That -- that's a pretty big headline. It's a simple sentence, but it's a pretty big headline given all of the discussion. Then, you go on and there's this back-and-forth. Page was asking if President Trump should go speak at a graduation in Russia, and he also wanted to take a trip to be part of this event in Russia. And he keeps approaching the campaign and Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager responds the same day. Saying, \"If you want to do this it would be outside of your role with DJT for president campaign. I am certain Mr. Trump will not be able to attend.\" You know, and it's just an example of a very sort of clear-cut moment in all of this that just got so blown out of proportion over the course of two years.

So, at any rate, let's bring in Matt Gaetz, Republican congressman who sits on the House Judiciary Committee. Obviously, there is a lot in this report, and there's a lot that Democrats will grab onto. There is Robert Mueller himself, basically said, now, the door is open to Democrats like Representative Maloney and whoever chooses to continue to pursue this investigation with regard to obstruction, that's their right. And they may choose to do that. They've asked to speak to see Mueller, and they've asked for all of the background information and details on this. And it's their right to try to investigate all of that. Representative, you know, so, what's your -- what are your thoughts in terms of what happens now?"

      "utterance": "There are three reasons why there is no opportunity for any sort of criminal prosecution against the president.  The first is you cannot unwind his actions from legitimate Article two powers. That was Mueller's own problem is that you couldn't figure out where obstruction would have begun, and where Article two would have ended when you look at the legitimate exercise of that activity. And this was a unique circumstance, Martha, where you had the president of the United States who is the leader of the executive branch who knew that the executive branch was doing something, that was hurting the country by advancing this improper investigation. And these things didn't happen in a vacuum. I recall my conversations with the president during this time, and what he was most worried about was North Korea. Obama had told him that North Korea was the biggest problem in the world. And you've got this three-dimensional chess game with Russia, China, and North Korea, and the president wasn't able to really use all the tools so we want our president to use because he was under this domestic assault under this flawed investigation. So, he was doing everything possible to try to wind up the investigation legitimately so that he could go and be the president and the leader of the free world. Nothing wrong or criminal about that. And it's also evident that most of what the president was doing was in public, that's not how people commit crimes."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, I want to put up one section of the report, Congressman Gaetz, which deals with the June 9th meeting which you have highlighted here. It says On June 9th for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump campaign officials Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign Chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the e-mail proposed the meeting described as official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary. The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as \"part of Russia and it's government support for Mr. Trump. Now you use that as an example of why you say that this -- that the Mueller report is aggressively written. What do you mean by that?"

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, there's no meeting of the minds, right? Just because two ships are both sailing in the same direction, it doesn't mean they've agreed with one another to chart the same course. So here you got a circumstance where obviously Donald Trump Jr. wanted bad information about Hillary Clinton to be in the public sphere. Russia wanted the same thing.  But there was no agreement for them to coordinate or collude or conspire to make that happen. That's why we're unable to charge Donald Trump Jr. If there was a meeting of the minds, if there was evidence to support those claims, then I think you would have seen a criminal indictment. But obviously, the people who wrote this report are no fans of the president.  You had Andrew Weissmann who was a Hillary Clinton booster. You had Jeannie Rhee who represented the Clinton Foundation against FOIA requests. So this was a group of people who had an ax to grind. And though they couldn't bring charges because they didn't want to be -- they couldn't sustain them, they still wrote that stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And the fact that the members of the campaign who were approached did not immediately call on the FBI and alert them that this was going on. That you know a lot of people really feel like that was a big mistake on the part of the Trump campaign."

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you see most of that inflow into the campaign from Papadopoulos as he's trying to set up a meeting between Putin and then Candidate Trump but it never happened. It never materialized which is an easy thing to understand if you were part of the Trump campaign because it was largely careening from one rally to another. And so there wasn't this like opportunity for everyone to sit around and figure out what they were going to talk to the FBI about. What is unfortunate is that now international players are trying to influence our elections. Russia is not our friend. I don't think that the Trump campaign viewed Russia as a friend though they did see Russia attempting to achieve some of the same objectives because they had their own ax to grind with Hillary Clinton for their own reasons."

If you look back at the four-page letter that he sent three or four Sundays ago, there isn't a hint or a whiff of the full flavor in there of what the Mueller team found with respect to obstruction of justice, and I think he should have tipped his hand a little bit on that.

The other is you can be charged with obstruction if you obstruct anything. So if I'm going to go into a courthouse to testify against you, god forbid, but in fact with the case, and you tackled me in the street broke my leg and I still made it in there and still testified, you can be charged with obstruction because obstruction rarely succeeds.

This was about him telling him that he wanted to fire Mueller and McGahn is pushing back. It goes on to say, in the same meeting, the President asked McGahn why he had told the special counsel about the President's effort to remove this Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes of their conversations.

McFarland to sign a false affidavit and she resisted.  Obstruction doesn't have to be successful for it to be obstruction.

The one thing that could have blown the roof off of the Trump campaign that Peter Strzok who everybody said was so hostile to Trump that could have done -- he did not do that thing --"

      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes, listen, I think the Mueller report is less than a legal document and more a political narrative. I don't say that is necessarily wrong, because the President is in political office. But you normally don't write a report a declination letter that says, \"Here's all -- if we were going to indict someone, this is all the evidence, and oh, by the way, we don't have enough evidence to indict.\" And that's what this report does. It goes through a long narrative then it says, \"Oh,\" at the end, it's a bad punch line. We're not -- we don't think there's any criminality here. But the President is held to a higher standard than the rest of us. That's an American assumption. But we're two and a half years in, and the Russian collusion narrative is dead. The Russian collusion narrative, that Richard's client, once fomented through the Steele dossier. In the report today, you can't find the Steele dossier mentioned except for one time and the word unverified is in front of it. Why is that? It was bad evidence."

First, the report if you read it, and I encourage your readers to read it and not take any of our word for it basically makes clear that this investigation about Donald Trump and the Russians began long before we even heard about Christopher Steele in July of 2016, one; and two, it's not true to say there is no evidence of collusion and no evidence of obstruction. Mueller -- incidentally, this is not just a garden variety prosecution.  This is an attack by a foreign power. That's why we needed this report.  And that's why Mueller it seems wanted to turn this over to Congress, not have the Attorney General make a decision to kind of shut things off."

The facts don't support that. But I want to say one more thing. He said Peter Strzok could have killed the President by going public. He didn't have to. John Brennan went to Harry Reid and Harry Reid went public, eight or nine days before the election, saying the FBI is covering up an investigation to Donald Trump. Pete Strzok didn't have to do it. John Brennan went to Harry Reid and they made it get out into the public that way."

Read it.\" And of course now Donald Trump says, that's not his deal."

Moscow has just confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will visit Russia later this month in his first ever meeting with Vladimir Putin. The announcement comes on the same day that the rogue regime claims to have tested a tactical guided weapon and says it no longer wishes to negotiate with the United States' Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, but rather someone and this is their quote, \"who is more careful and mature and communicating with us.\" Earlier I spoke exclusively with U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell."

They've used chemical weapons, a weapon of mass destruction on European soil to go after the Skripals, and nothing is off the table for them. They have been interfering in elections for a very long time. I've written this before I became Ambassador.

And I find it really ironic that Mayor Pete stayed silent about this so called, you know, hate hoax on him, and others during 2015, 2016, and 2017, when Mike Pence was Governor, there was total silence. It's ironic that right about now when he's starting his fundraising apparatus to run for President that he comes up with this idea and this attack. One of the things that really bothers me about this attack is that Mike Pence is a friend of mine. Mike and Karen are great people, they're Godly people, they are followers of Christ. They don't have hate in their heart for anyone. They know my partner. They have accepted us. Now you ask me, do we agree philosophically on every single issue? No, I don't agree philosophically with my hero, Dietrich Bonhoeffer on everything. I don't agree with my partner on everything. But the gay community used to be the community pushing tolerance and diversity. We were the ones that were saying everyone should be able to accept and love each other. Now, suddenly, there's a whole community of people that are demanding that we all think alike. I think it's outrageous. And let me just say one more thing is that when Mayor Pete came out, the Vice President complimented him and said he holds them in high regard. The Vice President or the then Governor has said nothing but positive things about Mayor Pete. I think this is a total hate hoax and I think it's outrageous."

Bill Barr has expressed an interest in investigating. I would think everybody would want to know was there sufficient factual predicate for the launching the initiating of this investigation? It'd be great. Great. Martha, if we could agree, we don't need biased FBI agents running counterintelligence investigations. That's something that most Americans do agree on, but Congress cannot. I mean, it'd be great if we had some unanimity. Let's make sure Russia and no one else ever does what they did to us in 2016. But you don't hear anything about that. What could be a unifying finding by Mueller that Russia targeted us and tried to sow the seeds of discord that would be unifying. What you see is Republicans going to investigate the origins and you're going to have Schiff -- by the way, he's not done with collusion.  His political future depends upon there being collusion. He's going to go look into that. And of course, Nadler and the rest of them are going to go look at obstruction of justice. So it's going to last for two years, it will not be bipartisan. The Senate Intel Committee, I think did a reasonably good job on the bipartisanship until they got to collusion. But you'd be hard pressed to find another committee in Congress that did."

If you have sufficient evidence to charge someone with obstruction, then at least do them the courtesy of allowing 12 of their fellow citizens at some point to hear all the evidence and reach a unanimous verdict. But this is like a hung jury, Martha. He issues the report. If you like Trump, you dismiss the obstruction. If you don't like Trump, you're going to seize on that. But there's no resolution. There's no verdict. Which is why I was flabbergasted that my Republican colleagues thought this report should be made public. What has it resolved it? No one's mind has been changed. And it is not the way of our justice system, which is the envy of the world. It's not the way it works."

Mueller is entitled to send whatever he wants to the Attorney General. The Comey press conference is what set this unbelievable precedent about discussing people that you don't charge.
