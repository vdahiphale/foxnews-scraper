And all of a sudden, what does he do? He triangulates and he starts reaching across the aisle, and now he's working with Newt Gingrich, and we've got a balanced budget amendment going on. We've got welfare reform. So all of a sudden, you see things that most of the country was, like, we want both of those things.

Maxine Waters is encouraging Democrats not to watch, but Democrats say they want to hear a lot of talk about health care for example. They want to hear talk about a better spending in terms of government services and products. But Republicans want to hear Donald Trump talk about the wall, immigration, terror. So it's like two sets of agendas from the people who are sitting in front of the TV, not the people who are being televised. I would say in response to what Dana just said that what Clinton was talking about was a growing economy. And, of course, part of it was the triangulation she described, but it was the strength of the economy during the '90s, which, as you recall, was booming.   I think, tonight, President Trump is going to go after an economic message and say this is the good news of the Trump presidency. Look at the growth. Look at the low unemployment. And say this is the basis for us to come together.  That will fold into the unity message. The difficulty, of course, is that the Democrats will say, hey, guess what, the economy was growing under Obama. It's growing under you. This is nothing new, nothing so different. The president, of course, will point to -- I think you'll have a guest there who kept their job because of his tax cut package. And again, the Democrats will holler and hurumph (ph). And it will be just a matter of who's listening. Who's on this side of the -- that side of the TV, and what their previous or, sort of, you know, prior position was, because it's just affirming pre-existing attitudes in a very polarized electorate.",

Now, when the media filters the State of the Union afterwards, and the next day to the American people, I bet all they do is they talk about immigration. They talk about the wall, and they talk about a few viral moments that catches everybody's attention. And those results are not established in the American people's eyes as much as they could be.",

And we are coming off of that jobs report last Friday that showed over 300,000 jobs were added in the latest month.  That being said, the reason why he'll be talking about immigration and the possible shutdown is because this is happening in the backdrop of yet another deadline that's quickly approaching. Next Friday, February 15th. And that is the deadline to fund the government. So the president has to make his case tonight. He could make news on that front, whether he's going to declare a national emergency. He could also make news on the foreign policy front. When is this summit going to happen with Kim Jong-un? There's a couple of big pieces. But, Jesse, Greg, I think many of us and many Americans will be turning in tonight, regardless, but they will be watching the optics of the evening.",

I just think that what you see now, if this is in the '90s and even in the early 2000's, suggest that there's a culture there and Northam might be part of a culture that is absolutely racially toxic and, again, hurt his chances. But the reporting that we've seen out of the cabinet meetings that you've referred to is that his own cabinet, the people that he's appointed, are trying to be loyal to him but look back at that press conference on Saturday and subsequent comments, absolutely devastating, that it's driving down his support among all people, Democrats, you know, Republicans, blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos in the state.

I guess that means Carrey can't burn this painting. You thought his motion pictures stink, turns out the stationary ones are worse.

Those students are a symbolic target of all of us. Covington, like Fox News and red meat, is media shorthand for evil. But it's not about lawsuits. It's about a lesson, one we could all learn in this age where contagious, deceptive social media is manipulated by the media. Fact is, the Covington story spread because the media wanted it to. It matched their assumptions. To them, MAGA hat plus white kids equaled racism. It's a P.C. flash card. No one cared if it was false until others fought back. So maybe the letters recipients will consider what they did wrong and how their bias led to mob action. Maybe they'll embrace this teachable moment.

So as long as the media has influence the way it does over politics, we will never see compromise. It is not even about the Democrats or Republicans anymore.

I don't know exactly what Bill Clinton was doing, but as I recall, Jesse, I think one of the reasons you might have seen that big bump is because, remember, he loses big time in 1994, and the Republicans take over. And all of a sudden, what does he do? He triangulates and he starts reaching across the aisle, and now he's working with Newt Gingrich, and we've got a balanced budget amendment going on. We've got welfare reform. So all of a sudden, you see things that most of the country was, like, we want both of those things.

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, it's all -- a matter of who's watching, right? So whose eyeballs are tuned in. Maxine Waters is encouraging Democrats not to watch, but Democrats say they want to hear a lot of talk about health care for example. They want to hear talk about a better spending in terms of government services and products. But Republicans want to hear Donald Trump talk about the wall, immigration, terror. So it's like two sets of agendas from the people who are sitting in front of the TV, not the people who are being televised. I would say in response to what Dana just said that what Clinton was talking about was a growing economy. And, of course, part of it was the triangulation she described, but it was the strength of the economy during the '90s, which, as you recall, was booming. I think, tonight, President Trump is going to go after an economic message and say this is the good news of the Trump presidency. Look at the growth. Look at the low unemployment. And say this is the basis for us to come together. That will fold into the unity message. The difficulty, of course, is that the Democrats will say, hey, guess what, the economy was growing under Obama. It's growing under you. This is nothing new, nothing so different. The president, of course, will point to -- I think you'll have a guest there who kept their job because of his tax cut package. And again, the Democrats will holler and hurumph (ph). And it will be just a matter of who's listening. Who's on this side of the -- that side of the TV, and what their previous or, sort of, you know, prior position was, because it's just affirming pre-existing attitudes in a very polarized electorate."

And, Sandra, what I think is going to happen as the president is going to hit the economic success message very hard because there's a lot of good things to talk about in the economy and he's been very disruptive on a lot of fronts, but you have to look at the results. Now, when the media filters the State of the Union afterwards, and the next day to the American people, I bet all they do is they talk about immigration. They talk about the wall, and they talk about a few viral moments that catches everybody's attention. And those results are not established in the American people's eyes as much as they could be."

Remember, this is happening a week later because of Nancy Pelosi delaying it because of the government shutdown. And we are coming off of that jobs report last Friday that showed over 300,000 jobs were added in the latest month. That being said, the reason why he'll be talking about immigration and the possible shutdown is because this is happening in the backdrop of yet another deadline that's quickly approaching. Next Friday, February 15th. And that is the deadline to fund the government. So the president has to make his case tonight. He could make news on that front, whether he's going to declare a national emergency. He could also make news on the foreign policy front. When is this summit going to happen with Kim Jong-un? There's a couple of big pieces. But, Jesse, Greg, I think many of us and many Americans will be turning in tonight, regardless, but they will be watching the optics of the evening."

My reading of the Washington Post who has heard of these accusations against Fairfax before and they have looked into them and they never ran with them now, of course. Again, do they afford that courtesy to Brett Kavanaugh? No. But does that mean that shouldn't happen here? I would never want to say that because that would make me a hypocrite. By all accounts, Justin Fairfax is actually a very well-liked person in Virginia, in Virginia politics. He's a liberal that gets along with a lot of people from both sides of the aisle. I think that he probably -- his team probably has a gut instinct as to how this surfaced. Again, because Ralph Northam, when you're in a corner and you're not doing what everyone is asking you to do, which is to resign, you've got to figure out a way to punch some way. And I think that thinking about your second in line taken over from you is sort of -- I mean, this is, like, goes back in ancient history. This is what people used to do. They would always kill the second in line. I don't think that's going to work in this case, but I do think it's amazing that Northam is still governor and he has no plans to resign."

And these are more recent pictures, by the way, Sandra. So it's not even going -- you know, some people say it's back in the '80s. I don't think the '80s is that long ago, but I'm an old dog. I just think that what you see now, if this is in the '90s and even in the early 2000's, suggest that there's a culture there and Northam might be part of a culture that is absolutely racially toxic and, again, hurt his chances. But the reporting that we've seen out of the cabinet meetings that you've referred to is that his own cabinet, the people that he's appointed, are trying to be loyal to him but look back at that press conference on Saturday and subsequent comments, absolutely devastating, that it's driving down his support among all people, Democrats, you know, Republicans, blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos in the state. He's losing his ability to govern. One final point, big-league politics which is the one that broke the Northam story and is now breaking the story about Fairfax, initially indicated that they got there leak on Fairfax from Levar Stoney's supporters.

And then you also have the notion that we must believe everyone. So you had the sexual assaults from going back -- I don't know, 30-some odd years, but they must be believe no matter what, no matter how hazy the accusations may be. So these things -- these events are now in the same case at each other's throats. You have the yearbook and you have a sexual harassment with the lieutenant governor. Both, apparently, are supposed to be believed at the same time. How long can this last? It's an incredible thing. And they're stuck with it.

I guess that means Carrey can't burn this painting. You thought his motion pictures stink, turns out the stationary ones are worse. Now for ages the media loved to hand out teachable moments, as enlightened ones they would school the dumb public on its prehistoric ways. But now the attack is reversed with a truly teachable moment for the arrogant, elite media who for so long loved to demonize you. And it's not just about Covington. Those students are a symbolic target of all of us. Covington, like Fox News and red meat, is media shorthand for evil. But it's not about lawsuits. It's about a lesson, one we could all learn in this age where contagious, deceptive social media is manipulated by the media. Fact is, the Covington story spread because the media wanted it to. It matched their assumptions. To them, MAGA hat plus white kids equaled racism. It's a P.C. flash card. No one cared if it was false until others fought back. So maybe the letters recipients will consider what they did wrong and how their bias led to mob action. Maybe they'll embrace this teachable moment.

So, I think the suggestion is that he has been maligned, and as Sandra was saying that his reputation has been damage to the point of emotional distress.

      "utterance": "All right. We're a little more than 3 hours away from President Trump's State of the Union address where he is expected to make a big push for border security. This comes as Mexican authorities gathered to stop a caravan of nearly 2,000 migrants just South of Texas early this morning. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in warning, \"Illegal crossing into the United States will not be tolerated\". After a contentious few months with Democrats will the President's speech before Congress be able to move the needle on this issue? Let's bring in Martha MacCallum who is co-anchoring tonight's special coverage to preview the big event and we have Bret Baier as well which is a great thing, we have them both. Martha you were with the - at the White House earlier today, and can you tell us anything about the plans and talk about border security?"

      "speaker": "MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, in general, the lunch which is a tradition and is attended by some of the anchors who are covering the State of the Union address that night. By tradition it is off the record and this was it well. But just in terms of the broad strokes, clearly the President is, I think, of a mind to hold pretty steady on where he has been on the wall. I don't think he is that optimistic about the conferees that are meeting. Although, there might be a little bit of movement on that. I don't think that you're going to hear National Emergency declaration tonight. We're 10 days from the next potential shutdown, so I think there's room for negotiation during that period. But I think it's fair to say that the President is not at this point shying away from that option at all. And believes that in the end if he did declare that, that he would probably win the argument over it."

      "utterance": "The State of the Union, usually when people consume it, the next day it's always about that viral moment, the faces that people are making, maybe the silly State of the Union response. But recently it's been about the moment where the President's guest is announced. And the selection of guests is very important. This year they have family members of someone who was killed by an illegal immigrant. They have a human trafficking agent and they have a 6th grader with the last name Trump who was bullied. So explain how you think this dynamics going to play out with the Democrats in the audience and the risks involved?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, you make a good point, Jesse. I mean, in State of the Unions as of late, a lot of it is about storytelling, and about weaving in your guests stories to tell how some specific policy that either you're asking for or you've done has panned out. So expect a lot of the border focus to be personal, to be about families who lost loved ones, because some illegal immigrant committed a murder or something along the border with a border patrol agent, specifically there. As far as the child who's bullied, obviously you've seen a lot of coverage of that already with the last name Trump, and that is the First Lady's specific effort on cyberbullying. And a lot of people are pointing to the President and his use of Twitter and how he needles people time and time again to, whether that's a positive thing or not, and what message comes out of that."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm going to fan Dana and hope some of it gets to you. Martha, let's just talk politics - hardball politics for a second, a lot of talk about the divide within the Republican Party over the possible declaration of a National Emergency. John Cornyn, number two in the Senate behind Mitch McConnell is saying, even if the President declares a National Emergency, it's not likely that the Senate will support him, if there's a resolution of opposition that comes out of the Democratic House and the courts aren't likely to do it. So he thinks this is not a winning hand for the President, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I actually sat down with Mitch McConnell just a short time ago and he was - he believes that the President will still, if he's pushed to it, declare a National Emergency, that that's the option that's on the table. But as you point, out John Cornyn have spoken out against it, so has Roy Blunt - Senator Blunt has also spoken out against, thinking that this is a bad precedent to set in terms of the National Emergency. But I think it's pretty clear that the President doesn't see it that way. And that the President, in terms of this conferee committee, that's been talking about trying to find some kind of solution, the President said that he didn't put much stock in it. He said it was a waste of time if they don't come back to him with wall money. So it looks like there's a rock in a hard place that's developed here Juan, and I think that the President - I don't think he'll do it tonight, as I said earlier, but I think he's holding out that option. It does look like there are some Democrats who might be coming around on this and there's word that perhaps Mick Mulvaney might invite some of them to Camp David this weekend to talk. So I think there's a lot of moving parts, but nobody sees the end of the tunnel as of right now."

We know that the Trump team is saying that he's going to attempt to put out a unifying message. Can the President unite the country with his message tonight?"

He's going to try to on policy, talk about infrastructure, prescription drug prices, potentially touch on successes in the past, the prison reform legislation - that was a bipartisan effort and say there's more possibly to come. But I don't think that this speech is going to be the unifying moment, and as you saw the preamble to the speech, it was a lot of the same back and forth."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I would say this. I'd say, we want about AOC, the woman is bold. She's extremely bold. It's almost the way in Greg has said, Trump is bold. We think about Donald Trump, you know, Muslim ban, confront China, sit down with Kim Jong-un. I think a lot of those bold moves have paid off. But her plan, I believe, is even bold for socialism. She talks about a 10- year plan, that's like what the Soviet Union did, but she's just doubling it. $7 trillion, you can't even count that much money. The point is, it has to take an extremely arrogant person to think that they can totally remake American society in 10 years. I want Americans to remake society. I don't want the green caucus to remake society, but it's going to be a fun debate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, Dana, in fact, the Fox News poll has been point of controversy. Fox News poll show most Americans do support higher taxes, especially on those who make more than $10 million and support more government spending on healthcare. So how do we understand this? Is this Socialism or is this mainstream?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK. But that's not this Green New Deal. And I do think to Jesse's point, she is bold. But Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker, is wiser. So one of the things that happened when she announced this Green New Deal, when they finally roll it out, they want - initially when she first talked about it, they were going to end all fossil fuel use in 10 years. The problem is not taxes. The problem is physics. We just don't have the technology to be able to do that yet. So what Nancy is doing is saying is say - she's giving them a little bit of room to run. We saw, again today, you've mentioned health care, Medicare for All. What is her Chief Advisor on Healthcare tell privately - tells companies, \"Don't worry, we're really not going to do that, no problem\". Same thing on impeachment, she lets him run wild, talk about impeachment. In the meantime, she's like, yes, we're not doing that, that's not happening. So it's a good thing she has a big margin in her caucus, because she has some people that are going to always vote very far Left. She actually has been able to rein them in a little bit."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

Now, Sandra the question is, what happens, though, with this energy and there's lots of energy, as I just indicated, that can be seen in the poll numbers for dealing with not only income inequality, but poverty, high cost of medical care, highest cost of prescription drugs in the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well that's the problem. She throws these ideas out there with a $7 trillion price tag and it's vague. There's not specifics on how she gets there. And then when you have researchers looking into it, who would otherwise, I think support someone like this. Tom Pyle Energy Research Institute, 100 percent renewable energy defies the law laws of physics according - to Dana's point it would be impossible to achieve. Nancy Pelosi hasn't even signed on to this. I don't know where she can get with this. But she's got everybody listening - going back to Jesse's original point. She throws this stuff out there. It's bold ideas, but action is what everybody's waiting for."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I think so. I think would be very exciting. What am I looking over here? It's easy to be a leftist. It's basically Santa Claus without the toy workshop. You don't really have to make anything. I think the problem - you mentioned a lot of problems. But the only people that end up coming up with solutions are innovators, free-market people. I do think that when we have to deal with climate change, when we have to deal with it, we will deal with it, and it'll be innovators who figure out the cheap way to do it. I mean, even if when you look at electric cars, what powers the electric car? Coal. So we have to be realistic. Physics wins. And only $7 trillion? That's a drop in the bucket for a socialist. They could take all our money in a heartbeat."

I spoke to my granddaughter's 1st grade class in Washington D.C. take a look at these photos. My speech was about the power of storytelling - great stories, and especially their stories. And I also mentioned stories about the Civil Rights Movement, this being Black History Month. But most of the stories were about my times, my granddaughter's played tricks on me. Then each of the kids told me a favorite story of their own from their families - frogs, rats and dogs played a big part in the stories they had to tell.
