Text mom and dad and grandma and grandpa say I'm about to be on television. Watch me. Anyway, welcome to CPAC. All of you at home, we are broadcasting from CPAC 2018. We're in National Harbor, Maryland.  A lot of breaking news tonight. Chairman Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee they launched now phase two of their investigation into the phony unverified Russian sourced, right, Clinton bought and paid for dossier. Of course, that was used to influence the election. Also, Sara Carter is here tonight. We have more breaking news. The FBI informant that uncovered Russian bribery and kickbacks and money laundering and racketeering, that on Uranium One, well, they are now demanding that the DOJ launch an investigation into deep state leaks meant to disparage the informant's character. We have a great lineup of guests that will join us on stage.  Dr. Sebastian Gorka is here. Dan Bongino is here tonight. Byron York, Gregg Jarrett, Tomi Lahren, Charlie Kirk, Kaylee McEnany. Wow.   Also tonight, we have a special tribute to the Reverend Billy Graham who sadly passed away today, the conscience of a nation at the age of 99. And, later, tonight, President Trump holds an historic meeting at the White House to talk about how to prevent mass shootings, how to protect our students, our teachers. Very powerful, very emotional day today at the White House. We have the highlights. But, first, it has been one year since we were last right here at CPAC. A lot has happened with President Trump now in office.   There's a long list of accomplishments -- massive tax cuts, booming economy. And then, of course, you have all the destroy Trump forces in this country. They will stop at nothing because they want to topple this president. Now, those forces tonight right here at CPAC will be exposed because, like we have been saying, 2018 is the year of the boomerang. We'll have that and so much more. We're at CPAC. Tonight's breaking news opening monologue.",

They are singularly focused on one thing. It is not truth. It's not evidence. It's not facts. It's about how to tear down this president by any means necessary.  That's why they will never tell you that under President Trump, this is one year. Unemployment in America, 17-year low. African-American, Hispanic unemployment have also reached record lows now under one year of President Trump. Thank you. Jobless claims are at a 45-year low. And since the election, 2.5 million new jobs have been created. And there are 2 million fewer Americans on food stamps in the country.   We have consumer confidence near 17-year high. Business confidence has now reached levels not seen since President Reagan. All of that is before the president's historic tax cuts have even started to kick in. Ninety percent of Americans are expected to see bigger paychecks, 3 million more Americans have received bonuses. Oh, by the way, those bonuses that the Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, they are calling thousands of dollars in bonuses crumbs. It's a crumb if you are $100 million net wealth person like Nancy Pelosi.

ISIS has been crushed because he has allowed the military to do their job. We are now rebuilding the military.  Thank you. And the president is demanding that the border wall be built in any immigration legislation. Now, if the Democrat had accomplished half of what President Trump has at this point in their presidency, the liberal media would be trying to put this individual on Mount Rushmore. They want Obama on Mount Rushmore, in spite of his failure.  But we also have those in the media in this country, that's not how they operate. For over a year, the news media colluding with, of course, liberals in this country and basically advancing their agency. They have been hyperventilating over what we have exposed so far as a hoax, a conspiracy, a fabrication. And that is they created about Donald Trump and Trump-Russia collusion even though the media knows there is no evidence to prove any of this is true after nearly 18 months. There is zero evidence, but, yet, look at the disgraceful coverage you get every single night from your so-called mainstream media.",

      "sentences": "Let me get the reaction--  It just shows you the people in the media are nothing but liars and frauds. And, by the way, they are really just an extension of the Democratic Party. By the way, speaking of liberal Democrats, they have been in lock step with the media. You will notice they all say the same thing. They parrot each other. Their fake, phony talking points and their little bubble.   So, you have had Democrats, the media over a year pushing a made up false narrative about so-called collusion but now it's all beginning to boomeranging back as I predicted at the beginning of this year.  Everything the media has accused Donald Trump of in his campaign of doing with Russia is exactly what Hillary Clinton and the DNC and Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele are all guilty of. And people should go to jail and likely will go to jail over all of this. And that is the real Russia collusion story.   And unlike the media's fake news narrative, we have real concrete, incontrovertible evidence of real crimes and real wrongdoing. Let's look at the phony dossier for example. Hillary Clinton, the DNC, they paid over $12 million plus for the former British spy. Oh, I thought foreigners weren't supposed to influence our elections -- anyway, to create a completely unverified dossier that used government lies and sources. And Steele who hates Donald Trump, didn't want him to win the election, then briefs the media outlets like the 'New York Times, ' 'The Washington Post,' Yahoo News, 'The New Yorker ', fake news the whole network, CNN, and they try to influence the election and manipulate the American voters. And Fusion GPS, their co-founder Glenn Simpson, he testified that the Clinton campaign and DNC weren't aware of all of this media outreach. That sounds an awful lot like that they were using a phony Russian narrative, phony Russian information that they bought and paid for to influence the American people and to win the election that way. And then on top of that, you got Steele meeting with the FBI, Steele giving them all of this Russian sourced information. And we now know from two GOP memos that that dossier was used to lie to a FISA court judge all in an effort to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate and the campaign. That, of course, being Carter Page.   And the memos are also exposing how former FBI director Andrew McCabe, he testified without the dossier, the application for that warrant would never have even been applied for, certainly not approved. And we know from the Grassley-Graham memo that the bulk of that application consisted of Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dossier.  Remember, this is the dossier that James Comey testified under oath was salacious and unverified. The FBI and Fusion GPS, they never bothered to even begin to corroborate this. And then you had Comey, remember back in January of 2017, briefing the president-elect before he is inaugurated about how the dossier existed. And he said it was unverified and salacious. That was only months before when he -- in 2016 in October, well, he was -- that dossier that's unverified was good enough to use as a justification to spy on Carter Page.  This is what we call deep state in action. This is unelected, Obama holdover bureaucrats. They thought they knew better than you, the American people. About who should be the next president and make no mistake about this. The deep state tried to stop Donald Trump from ever becoming president and now, they are doing everything they can possibly do to damage and destroy his presidency. And at one point, remember at the beginning of his administration, over 125 leaks in 126 days.  Here's the thing about all of this. The corrupt officials are all now being exposed. They never thought this would happen. Everything is boomeranging back on them.  And as we like to say on our Twitter account tick-tock. What we have been reporting on for the past year is only a small sample of what is coming. We expect the inspector general's report to have a lot of new information and that will be coming either by the end of this month or early next month.  All right. Joining us here at CPAC with reaction, former deputy assistant to the president, give him a big hand, FOX News contributor, national security strategist Sebastian Gorka. And former Secret Service agent, NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino. Good to see you.",

Text mom and dad and grandma and grandpa say I'm about to be on television. Watch me. Anyway, welcome to CPAC. All of you at home, we are broadcasting from CPAC 2018. We're in National Harbor, Maryland. A lot of breaking news tonight. Chairman Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee they launched now phase two of their investigation into the phony unverified Russian sourced, right, Clinton bought and paid for dossier. Of course, that was used to influence the election. Also, Sara Carter is here tonight. We have more breaking news. The FBI informant that uncovered Russian bribery and kickbacks and money laundering and racketeering, that on Uranium One, well, they are now demanding that the DOJ launch an investigation into deep state leaks meant to disparage the informant's character. We have a great lineup of guests that will join us on stage. Dr. Sebastian Gorka is here. Dan Bongino is here tonight. Byron York, Gregg Jarrett, Tomi Lahren, Charlie Kirk, Kaylee McEnany. Wow. Also tonight, we have a special tribute to the Reverend Billy Graham who sadly passed away today, the conscience of a nation at the age of 99. And, later, tonight, President Trump holds an historic meeting at the White House to talk about how to prevent mass shootings, how to protect our students, our teachers. Very powerful, very emotional day today at the White House. We have the highlights. But, first, it has been one year since we were last right here at CPAC. A lot has happened with President Trump now in office. There's a long list of accomplishments -- massive tax cuts, booming economy. And then, of course, you have all the destroy Trump forces in this country. They will stop at nothing because they want to topple this president. Now, those forces tonight right here at CPAC will be exposed because, like we have been saying, 2018 is the year of the boomerang. We'll have that and so much more. We're at CPAC. Tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

They are singularly focused on one thing. It is not truth. It's not evidence. It's not facts. It's about how to tear down this president by any means necessary. That's why they will never tell you that under President Trump, this is one year. Unemployment in America, 17-year low. African-American, Hispanic unemployment have also reached record lows now under one year of President Trump. Thank you. Jobless claims are at a 45-year low. And since the election, 2.5 million new jobs have been created. And there are 2 million fewer Americans on food stamps in the country. We have consumer confidence near 17-year high. Business confidence has now reached levels not seen since President Reagan. All of that is before the president's historic tax cuts have even started to kick in. Ninety percent of Americans are expected to see bigger paychecks, 3 million more Americans have received bonuses. Oh, by the way, those bonuses that the Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, they are calling thousands of dollars in bonuses crumbs. It's a crumb if you are $100 million net wealth person like Nancy Pelosi. Are those crumbs? I don't think that's a crumb."

ISIS has been crushed because he has allowed the military to do their job. We are now rebuilding the military. Thank you. And the president is demanding that the border wall be built in any immigration legislation. Now, if the Democrat had accomplished half of what President Trump has at this point in their presidency, the liberal media would be trying to put this individual on Mount Rushmore. They want Obama on Mount Rushmore, in spite of his failure. But we also have those in the media in this country, that's not how they operate. For over a year, the news media colluding with, of course, liberals in this country and basically advancing their agency. They have been hyperventilating over what we have exposed so far as a hoax, a conspiracy, a fabrication. And that is they created about Donald Trump and Trump-Russia collusion even though the media knows there is no evidence to prove any of this is true after nearly 18 months. There is zero evidence, but, yet, look at the disgraceful coverage you get every single night from your so-called mainstream media."

      "utterance": "Let me get the reaction-- It just shows you the people in the media are nothing but liars and frauds. And, by the way, they are really just an extension of the Democratic Party. By the way, speaking of liberal Democrats, they have been in lock step with the media. You will notice they all say the same thing. They parrot each other. Their fake, phony talking points and their little bubble. So, you have had Democrats, the media over a year pushing a made up false narrative about so-called collusion but now it's all beginning to boomeranging back as I predicted at the beginning of this year. Everything the media has accused Donald Trump of in his campaign of doing with Russia is exactly what Hillary Clinton and the DNC and Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele are all guilty of. And people should go to jail and likely will go to jail over all of this. And that is the real Russia collusion story. And unlike the media's fake news narrative, we have real concrete, incontrovertible evidence of real crimes and real wrongdoing. Let's look at the phony dossier for example. Hillary Clinton, the DNC, they paid over $12 million plus for the former British spy. Oh, I thought foreigners weren't supposed to influence our elections -- anyway, to create a completely unverified dossier that used government lies and sources. And Steele who hates Donald Trump, didn't want him to win the election, then briefs the media outlets like the 'New York Times, ' 'The Washington Post,' Yahoo News, 'The New Yorker ', fake news the whole network, CNN, and they try to influence the election and manipulate the American voters. And Fusion GPS, their co-founder Glenn Simpson, he testified that the Clinton campaign and DNC weren't aware of all of this media outreach. That sounds an awful lot like that they were using a phony Russian narrative, phony Russian information that they bought and paid for to influence the American people and to win the election that way. And then on top of that, you got Steele meeting with the FBI, Steele giving them all of this Russian sourced information. And we now know from two GOP memos that that dossier was used to lie to a FISA court judge all in an effort to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate and the campaign. That, of course, being Carter Page. And the memos are also exposing how former FBI director Andrew McCabe, he testified without the dossier, the application for that warrant would never have even been applied for, certainly not approved. And we know from the Grassley-Graham memo that the bulk of that application consisted of Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dossier. Remember, this is the dossier that James Comey testified under oath was salacious and unverified. The FBI and Fusion GPS, they never bothered to even begin to corroborate this. And then you had Comey, remember back in January of 2017, briefing the president-elect before he is inaugurated about how the dossier existed. And he said it was unverified and salacious. That was only months before when he -- in 2016 in October, well, he was -- that dossier that's unverified was good enough to use as a justification to spy on Carter Page. This is what we call deep state in action. This is unelected, Obama holdover bureaucrats. They thought they knew better than you, the American people. About who should be the next president and make no mistake about this. The deep state tried to stop Donald Trump from ever becoming president and now, they are doing everything they can possibly do to damage and destroy his presidency. And at one point, remember at the beginning of his administration, over 125 leaks in 126 days. Here's the thing about all of this. The corrupt officials are all now being exposed. They never thought this would happen. Everything is boomeranging back on them. And as we like to say on our Twitter account tick-tock. What we have been reporting on for the past year is only a small sample of what is coming. We expect the inspector general's report to have a lot of new information and that will be coming either by the end of this month or early next month. All right. Joining us here at CPAC with reaction, former deputy assistant to the president, give him a big hand, FOX News contributor, national security strategist Sebastian Gorka. And former Secret Service agent, NRA TV contributor, Dan Bongino. Good to see you."

Sean, numbers don't lie. Sooner or later, they are going to have to come to accept the fact that their secular stagnation theory, in other words, it wasn't Obama's fault. The economy just stunk for all kinds of secular reasons -- is done. It's one year in office and we have had three quarters now of 3 percent growth. Obama never hit it at all. The numbers don't lie. The Obamaites and Obamaphiles are going to have to reconcile that. And on the collusion front, collusion is real. Don't anybody in this room don't think Russian collusion didn't happen. It just didn't happen with the Trump team. There is absolutely no question right now that Hillary Clinton dealt with a foreign agent in Christopher Steele. He is British. He is not from the United States. Who, in turn, dealt with Russian sources. And I'm telling you, you know the tick tock on this one.

And then it's used to get a FISA warrant. But they don't tell the FISA judge that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for it. There is a footnote that says might have some political tainting. It wasn't political tainting. So, that happens in October. In January, Comey is telling the president elect it's salacious and unverified.

And these are questions that the public not only should know and have a right to know but I think they want to know. And that is when did you -- simple questions like when did you learn about the dossier? When did you learn that it was paid for by the Democrats? When did you learn that this was a political piece? Part of what we sent out today questionnaire with 10 questions on it also with a cover letter that says if you don't answer, this we are giving a couple weeks to answer it, you will be subpoenaed and you will be coming before Congress to tell us when you knew about this."

That was the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes saying he is now going to subpoena former high ranching Obama officials if they do not answer 10 simple questions sent to them about the anti-Trump dossier. Now, according to our own Catherine Herridge now these Obama officials include former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Nunes' questionnaire is part of what he calls stage two of the House Republicans investigation into this phony anti-Trump Hillary bought and paid for dossier. Now, meanwhile Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, soon to be MSNBC contributor, he expressed his party's FISA memo will be released this week with reductions after President Trump rightfully blocked it initially because it contains sources and methods and other sensitive information. And also tonight, ABC News is reporting that congressional investigators are unable to locate an alleged source for the anti-Trump dossier. Really?

Then we found out that people in the Justice Department, the larger Justice Department knew about it, going up pretty high.

So that they could continue to collect information. And in the end, they paid him $50,000, congratulated him, thanked him and then when he got back was a threat from the United States Attorney General's office under Loretta Lynch, from the DOJ saying if you say anything, if you make this public, we will ruin your reputation and we will go after you."

The more they trash Doug Campbell, the more they discourage people from doing the courageous work that he did. He served his country for 30 years. They have made up a story. I know they know it's false. Here is how I know it. After the first stories came out. I reads these stories and thought that can't be true. Sara and I are looking at the FBI file. These documents are here. He did tell them about uranium one. He did tell them about bribe payments. He laid out all these things and we have the documents.

This is really where it is going to take to us double down and say you know what? We do think we should have mental health checks, but we shouldn't sacrifice second amendment rights."

      "utterance": "There is common sense like you said the threat assessment, securing these schools, we heard the father who lost his daughter in sound bite. When 9/11 happened guess what we secured our airports. It should have taken one of these not several. I just want to point out Darryl Scott, I sent on the board of Rachel's challenge who lost his daughter. Rachel who lost his daughter in the columbine massacre he has been working on solutions for 20 years. When Tomi talks about the cultural change she is spot on there. We have lost the sense of connection with one another. Respect to your fellow student, your classmate is your friend that needs to be implemented more than anything."

Like you mentioned people are buried in their phones and not paying tension. Taking pictures on Instagram. They are not seeing what is around them and that leads to less safety in our schools in our airports, malls and the streets."
