Because like the Planet Fitness steam room after 8:00 p.m. there's a lot going on in that pack train. Obviously, this video shows a crazed dude slugging a chick in the face after she tells him to take a chill pill. Now maybe I'm wrong. But punching someone who tells you to take a chill pill is the worst way to prove that you don't need a chill. It happened on the D-train which apparently stands for dangerous or deadly or damn, why am I still living in New York City? God, please help me get the (BLEEP) out of here. Amazing. Getting worse. Every day it's getting worse. Now the man had been shouting, say it to my face, regarding her chill pill comment, which she does. And for what it's worth that shows a tremendous amount of bravery or stupidity. Mind your business. He says that again. And then he says, I'm dealing with my effing kids, whom I'm sure will grow up normal having that for a dad. Hopefully Child Protective Services notices what a great father he really is. So he smacks her hard and no one did a damn thing to intervene or check on the woman or subdue the perp. Chivalry is dead. And it probably got killed by a guy with a long rap sheet who was led out of jail by Democrats. No wonder far left politicians are hiring all those security guards, which means it's time for.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's time for what would you do in this situation and seriously, be honest. OK? Because when I watched this I became enraged at the by standards who after appearing shocked seem to do nothing. Except to look at their phones and avoid eye contact. They act like me when kill me talks about his phlebitis. I don't even know what that is. I hope it's nothing serious. Now this is the second such story where people witness a horrible crime and do nothing. In Philly, recently, an incapacitated woman was allegedly raped by an illegal alien sex fiend on a subway train and no one did anything. But as I keep thinking about this, I wonder what would I have done? I'd like to think I would have rushed to the woman's aid, scolded the guy. And if he lunged at me, I would have clocked him, sending him writhing to the floor. But let's be honest, as guys, we replay these heroic fantasies in our heads. It's one of many. Some fantasize catching the winning past at the Super Bowl. I fantasize about rescuing a child from a well which isn't that helpful, since in the fantasy I also threw him down the well. But reality sets in. Maybe on the subway, I would have done nothing. Here's why. A man who slugs a woman sends a message that he do anything. Chivalry is dead because bystanders know if they step in, there'll be dead too. And then of course, he created a force field by claiming he was a victim of racism. The sad part is because this is NYC, half the people on the train probably agreed with him. And if a white man stepped in the story would become about race. And all those folks who just looked down at their phones would be sure to point the phone at the melee. And we would view that clip thousands of times, but with a context of a black man accosted by a white guy on a train. Accusations of race keep everyone in their place. Everything is judged not by context, but by group identity. Just like MLK didn't dream about. Remember, a cop prevented a fatal stabbing of a black woman only to be called out by LeBron James. If you dare address bad behavior anywhere, it's you who becomes the oppressor. Doesn't matter that the crime was riddled with sexism because a strong man was pounding on a young woman. Women are equal to men now, remember? She should expect to get clocked just as hard as a man would. Don't step in, man, the independent woman can do it alone. It's a sad state of affairs. And danger is the only mistress. The fact is our world doesn't get worse overnight. It sneaks up on you like male pattern baldness, Robby. Without reacting -- without reacting we let it unfold. When our heads are down, crime goes up. It started with the soft bigotry of low expectations followed by the notion that cops and prosecutors are part of the problem. Finally, criminals are let loose and there's nothing we can do about it but capture their crimes on our phones. Perhaps fresh after 9/11 the spirit of unity would have crushed this perp. But now in this strange new world, we've lowered the bar for behavior. It went from a low bar to no bar to headlines like man or woman beat to death in a bar, leaving society fubar. But hey, maybe someone should have called a social worker.",

It's an actual solution for a series of lawsuits being brought by the ACLU. And some private attorneys on behalf of migrant families who had children separated at the border during only, only the Trump administration apparently. They claimed the government subjected them to lasting psychological trauma by not sending them to prison with their parents. It raises the question, why don't I get any money for the long lasting psychological trauma I entered after accidentally seeing Jerrold Nadler in his pants? I still don't understand. But rather than fighting these claims in court, Biden's government wants to settle these claims with your cash, the average payout would be roughly 450 grand. It's amazing. But in lieu of money, maybe some migrants will agree to a Hunter Biden painting. 500 grand. The total potential payout could be over one billion. Congressman Dan Crenshaw put it in perspective. Biden wants to pay illegal immigrants 450 grand for their hardship while breaking our laws. It's for service members killed in action. They're next to Kin gets an insurance payment of 400,000. Yes.

Here we go: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was booed off stage at a recent union event. Lightfoot took it in stride, saying at least it covered the sound of the gunfire. That was good. Start one for one. A Kentucky school district is investigating a homecoming event where teen boys gave lap dances to fellow students and their principal. Officials apologizing said we don't condone that kind of behavior here at Kevin Spacey High School. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has, was officially charged with a crime that could force him to register as a sex offender. Cuomo said, he's made all the right decisions to beat the case and referred questions to his lawyer, Eliot Spitzer. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio accidentally referred to himself as Captain Kirk while wearing the Blue Star Trek uniform favored by Mr. Spock. De Blasio apologized saying he would never support someone wearing blue. Good one. The self-proclaimed Trekkie then uttered more inaccuracies like \"may the force be with you,\" \"E.T. phone home,\" and \"I am a competent mayor.\" In a recent interview, CNN Anderson Cooper -- admitted he created a bogus Instagram account to help sell his late mother's artwork. Cybersecurity experts say, the fake persona was nearly as phony as Cooper in person. The World Series is underway in Atlanta after the Braves lost to the Astros, 72, in game one, Stacey Abrams demanded a recount. Saw that one common like a frisbee in the desert. The Biden administration released a 42-page plan to promote gender equality. It's a 42-page recipe book. That's funny in itself. Instructing men how to make their own sandwiches. That was pretty good. You're not laughing. The plan calls for shrinking the pay gap, increased funding for Obamacare and tough new consent rules before you can sniff a woman's hair. Government has given out the first passport with 'x' as the sex for those who have a difficult time identifying as male or female. Congratulations, and I hope you have a wonderful time traveling, Steven Tyler. Our reject jokes are better than the late-night jokes on other shows. Former MSNBC Contributor Tore or Toray says Condoleezza Rice's stance on Critical Race Theory proves she's a foot soldier for white supremacy. But Rice debunked the theory that white people are superior just by sitting next to Joy Behar. San Francisco families say they no longer feel safe and the crime spree and they've hired a private security. Security agents conduct overnight patrols looking for suspicious looking people, like anyone not (BLEEP) in the street. Internal documents revealed that Instagram displays images of anorexic girls to kids with eating disorders. To combat the problem, all accounts will now auto follow Michael Moore. Finally, COVID restrictions could force 43 percent of caregivers to have to choose between their jobs and their responsibilities at home next year. Try not showing up for two months and not telling anyone said Pete Buttigieg. Those were pretty good. All right. Now, before we go, we want to wish a big Happy Birthday to Winona Ryder. It is her birthday but it's also Kat's, right? As always, we always get her a nice big plate of perogies, but knowing that it's Kat's birthday, and we know what goes well with pierogies, and that's of course, the meth.",

Because like the Planet Fitness steam room after 8:00 p.m. there's a lot going on in that pack train. Obviously, this video shows a crazed dude slugging a chick in the face after she tells him to take a chill pill. Now maybe I'm wrong. But punching someone who tells you to take a chill pill is the worst way to prove that you don't need a chill. It happened on the D-train which apparently stands for dangerous or deadly or damn, why am I still living in New York City? God, please help me get the (BLEEP) out of here. Amazing. Getting worse. Every day it's getting worse. Now the man had been shouting, say it to my face, regarding her chill pill comment, which she does. And for what it's worth that shows a tremendous amount of bravery or stupidity. Mind your business. He says that again. And then he says, I'm dealing with my effing kids, whom I'm sure will grow up normal having that for a dad. Hopefully Child Protective Services notices what a great father he really is. So he smacks her hard and no one did a damn thing to intervene or check on the woman or subdue the perp. Chivalry is dead. And it probably got killed by a guy with a long rap sheet who was led out of jail by Democrats. No wonder far left politicians are hiring all those security guards, which means it's time for."

      "utterance": "Yes, it's time for what would you do in this situation and seriously, be honest. OK? Because when I watched this I became enraged at the by standards who after appearing shocked seem to do nothing. Except to look at their phones and avoid eye contact. They act like me when kill me talks about his phlebitis. I don't even know what that is. I hope it's nothing serious. Now this is the second such story where people witness a horrible crime and do nothing. In Philly, recently, an incapacitated woman was allegedly raped by an illegal alien sex fiend on a subway train and no one did anything. But as I keep thinking about this, I wonder what would I have done? I'd like to think I would have rushed to the woman's aid, scolded the guy. And if he lunged at me, I would have clocked him, sending him writhing to the floor. But let's be honest, as guys, we replay these heroic fantasies in our heads. It's one of many. Some fantasize catching the winning past at the Super Bowl. I fantasize about rescuing a child from a well which isn't that helpful, since in the fantasy I also threw him down the well. But reality sets in. Maybe on the subway, I would have done nothing. Here's why. A man who slugs a woman sends a message that he do anything. Chivalry is dead because bystanders know if they step in, there'll be dead too. And then of course, he created a force field by claiming he was a victim of racism. The sad part is because this is NYC, half the people on the train probably agreed with him. And if a white man stepped in the story would become about race. And all those folks who just looked down at their phones would be sure to point the phone at the melee. And we would view that clip thousands of times, but with a context of a black man accosted by a white guy on a train. Accusations of race keep everyone in their place. Everything is judged not by context, but by group identity. Just like MLK didn't dream about. Remember, a cop prevented a fatal stabbing of a black woman only to be called out by LeBron James. If you dare address bad behavior anywhere, it's you who becomes the oppressor. Doesn't matter that the crime was riddled with sexism because a strong man was pounding on a young woman. Women are equal to men now, remember? She should expect to get clocked just as hard as a man would. Don't step in, man, the independent woman can do it alone. It's a sad state of affairs. And danger is the only mistress. The fact is our world doesn't get worse overnight. It sneaks up on you like male pattern baldness, Robby. Without reacting -- without reacting we let it unfold. When our heads are down, crime goes up. It started with the soft bigotry of low expectations followed by the notion that cops and prosecutors are part of the problem. Finally, criminals are let loose and there's nothing we can do about it but capture their crimes on our phones. Perhaps fresh after 9/11 the spirit of unity would have crushed this perp. But now in this strange new world, we've lowered the bar for behavior. It went from a low bar to no bar to headlines like man or woman beat to death in a bar, leaving society fubar. But hey, maybe someone should have called a social worker."

It's an actual solution for a series of lawsuits being brought by the ACLU. And some private attorneys on behalf of migrant families who had children separated at the border during only, only the Trump administration apparently. They claimed the government subjected them to lasting psychological trauma by not sending them to prison with their parents. It raises the question, why don't I get any money for the long lasting psychological trauma I entered after accidentally seeing Jerrold Nadler in his pants? I still don't understand. But rather than fighting these claims in court, Biden's government wants to settle these claims with your cash, the average payout would be roughly 450 grand. It's amazing. But in lieu of money, maybe some migrants will agree to a Hunter Biden painting. 500 grand. The total potential payout could be over one billion. Congressman Dan Crenshaw put it in perspective. Biden wants to pay illegal immigrants 450 grand for their hardship while breaking our laws. It's for service members killed in action. They're next to Kin gets an insurance payment of 400,000. Yes.

Here we go: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was booed off stage at a recent union event. Lightfoot took it in stride, saying at least it covered the sound of the gunfire. That was good. Start one for one. A Kentucky school district is investigating a homecoming event where teen boys gave lap dances to fellow students and their principal. Officials apologizing said we don't condone that kind of behavior here at Kevin Spacey High School. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has, was officially charged with a crime that could force him to register as a sex offender. Cuomo said, he's made all the right decisions to beat the case and referred questions to his lawyer, Eliot Spitzer. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio accidentally referred to himself as Captain Kirk while wearing the Blue Star Trek uniform favored by Mr. Spock. De Blasio apologized saying he would never support someone wearing blue. Good one. The self-proclaimed Trekkie then uttered more inaccuracies like \"may the force be with you,\" \"E.T. phone home,\" and \"I am a competent mayor.\" In a recent interview, CNN Anderson Cooper -- admitted he created a bogus Instagram account to help sell his late mother's artwork. Cybersecurity experts say, the fake persona was nearly as phony as Cooper in person. The World Series is underway in Atlanta after the Braves lost to the Astros, 72, in game one, Stacey Abrams demanded a recount. Saw that one common like a frisbee in the desert. The Biden administration released a 42-page plan to promote gender equality. It's a 42-page recipe book. That's funny in itself. Instructing men how to make their own sandwiches. That was pretty good. You're not laughing. The plan calls for shrinking the pay gap, increased funding for Obamacare and tough new consent rules before you can sniff a woman's hair. Government has given out the first passport with 'x' as the sex for those who have a difficult time identifying as male or female. Congratulations, and I hope you have a wonderful time traveling, Steven Tyler. Our reject jokes are better than the late-night jokes on other shows. Former MSNBC Contributor Tore or Toray says Condoleezza Rice's stance on Critical Race Theory proves she's a foot soldier for white supremacy. But Rice debunked the theory that white people are superior just by sitting next to Joy Behar. San Francisco families say they no longer feel safe and the crime spree and they've hired a private security. Security agents conduct overnight patrols looking for suspicious looking people, like anyone not (BLEEP) in the street. Internal documents revealed that Instagram displays images of anorexic girls to kids with eating disorders. To combat the problem, all accounts will now auto follow Michael Moore. Finally, COVID restrictions could force 43 percent of caregivers to have to choose between their jobs and their responsibilities at home next year. Try not showing up for two months and not telling anyone said Pete Buttigieg. Those were pretty good. All right. Now, before we go, we want to wish a big Happy Birthday to Winona Ryder. It is her birthday but it's also Kat's, right? As always, we always get her a nice big plate of perogies, but knowing that it's Kat's birthday, and we know what goes well with pierogies, and that's of course, the meth."
