Clearly, he hasn't checked his cholesterol. And what of CNN? I fear their next step will be reporting the news from underneath their desks. I don't remember this reaction when Obama went through three Secretary of Defense's each with shorter runs. Here's a thought. Could it be Mattis did the job Trump asked him to do and now that it's done Trump wanted a new guy to do a new thing? Mattis kind of said that thing in his lair he said that under Trump, Mattis says the Defense Department improved, our force's readiness and lethality, boosting capabilities and global influence. I guess the press missed that.  Even more, the script has flipped. You've got lefties praising Trump over Syria and righties screaming their bloody heads off, but this is what happens when you have a President with a vision untethered to ideology. The House passed a bill to fund the wall which upsets one side, Trump pulls out of Syria which pisses off the other, he passes criminal justice reform which no side could do before. It seems like the alarm is more emotional than factual. It's about Trump, not the actions themselves. So should you be worried that Trump wants to leave Syria? Well, consider who Trump is. He wanted to kill terrorists and their families; yes, their families. That's going the extra-mile. So I think it would be out of character for him to put America in harm's way.

I've heard people have a hard time working at CNN and MSNBC due to the smell of burning hair. Trump is right about the media. He is the product and because Trump's actually gotten stuff done, the media must focus on what he's not done yet, so in two years, he rewrote NAFTA, passed a tax cut, deregulated like a madman, created record unemployment for minorities, women and the youth, meted income and real wage compensation jump, four million people left food stamps, investments returned to America as consumer confidence rose, but, but, but what about the staff changes?   Please, that's like shouting at Santa after he bought you a car, but forgot the air freshener. Look at prison reform, a big humanitarian story the press largely ignored because it was Trump, then there's gun control. Trump banned bump stocks. Remember when the media was screaming for that?

Tickets for both shows are on sale now. They make the perfect Christmas present. Go to ggutfeld.com for ticket information. But coming up, does old Saint Nick need a new shtick. A look at what modern Santa would look like next. Gingerbread man is now gingerbread band. Scotland's Parliament has removed the phrase gingerbread man from the coffee shop in its building and it said will be selling the holiday cookies as gingerbread people, so as not to appear sexist. In other news, Scotland has a Parliament. But that's not the only holiday crap that makes us want to puke. A survey conducted by Graphic Springs, a design company shows people would prefer to modernize Santa by ditching the big red suit for skinny jeans, the reindeer would be replaced by a flying car and giving the guy a few tattoos and an iPhone. Great, so we emasculate gingerbread man. We ban holiday songs because they're sexist and we want Santa to look like a member of Maroon 5. So if that's what those people want, fine.

She says he was executed for thieving on the high seas in the 1700s and I believe her. They married in January in a private ceremony in international waters off the Irish coast. Good for her, I say, but it wasn't meant to be. Tweeted the bride, \"Jack was not who he led me to believe. He used me as an energy source,\" even a dead guy does this, \"And is a negative attachment that is refusing to leave.\" He's a freeloading ghost. \"It had serious implications on my physical health. I'm looking if there are ways to dissolve the Union legally, spiritually, possibly by exorcism.\" Well, if it's an exorcism you need, may I recommend this fellow. I believe Satan is inside that dog.

I don't remember this reaction when Obama went through three Secretary of Defense's each with shorter runs. Here's a thought. Could it be Mattis did the job Trump asked him to do and now that it's done Trump wanted a new guy to do a new thing? Mattis kind of said that thing in his lair he said that under Trump, Mattis says the Defense Department improved, our force's readiness and lethality, boosting capabilities and global influence. I guess the press missed that. Even more, the script has flipped. You've got lefties praising Trump over Syria and righties screaming their bloody heads off, but this is what happens when you have a President with a vision untethered to ideology. The House passed a bill to fund the wall which upsets one side, Trump pulls out of Syria which pisses off the other, he passes criminal justice reform which no side could do before. It seems like the alarm is more emotional than factual. It's about Trump, not the actions themselves. So should you be worried that Trump wants to leave Syria? Well, consider who Trump is. He wanted to kill terrorists and their families; yes, their families. That's going the extra-mile. So I think it would be out of character for him to put America in harm's way.

At times - I'm watching the news and I do get upset about what's going on, but then I realized, as it gets ramped up.

Tickets for both shows are on sale now. They make the perfect Christmas present. Go to ggutfeld.com for ticket information. But coming up, does old Saint Nick need a new shtick. A look at what modern Santa would look like next. Gingerbread man is now gingerbread band. Scotland's Parliament has removed the phrase gingerbread man from the coffee shop in its building and it said will be selling the holiday cookies as gingerbread people, so as not to appear sexist. In other news, Scotland has a Parliament. But that's not the only holiday crap that makes us want to puke. A survey conducted by Graphic Springs, a design company shows people would prefer to modernize Santa by ditching the big red suit for skinny jeans, the reindeer would be replaced by a flying car and giving the guy a few tattoos and an iPhone. Great, so we emasculate gingerbread man. We ban holiday songs because they're sexist and we want Santa to look like a member of Maroon 5. So if that's what those people want, fine. Here's your PC Santa."

Hundreds are injured and several are missing. Authorities say the tsunami was triggered by under seas landslides caused by a volcanic eruption. It hit beaches in Sunda Strait which is between the islands of Java and Sumatra. Authorities say hundreds of homes and businesses have been damaged. Some people fled to shelters after the disaster. President Trump has reportedly discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. That's according to reports in multiple media outlets. The president is reportedly angry that the Fed raised interest rates last week, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pushed back against those reports, he says the President never suggested firing the chairman.

One of these files - CIA files was declassified through a Freedom of Information Act request and among the thousands of pages was a dossier on the otter, an Otter Dossier. They studied the otters behavior, its lifecycle and what the otter could offer the Feds. Among its abilities quote, \"Can open zipper, climb ladder, chew through zinc sheet, turn on water tap, carry stones and marbles, throw objects with head from mouth, hold slippery objects,\" that's more than Doocey can do, plus, and I mean both Dooceys. Plus an otter can put together a kick-ass jug band. Remember them? So did the CIA want otters as field operatives? Did otters contribute to the fall of communism?

She says he was executed for thieving on the high seas in the 1700s and I believe her. They married in January in a private ceremony in international waters off the Irish coast. Good for her, I say, but it wasn't meant to be. Tweeted the bride, \"Jack was not who he led me to believe. He used me as an energy source,\" even a dead guy does this, \"And is a negative attachment that is refusing to leave.\" He's a freeloading ghost. \"It had serious implications on my physical health. I'm looking if there are ways to dissolve the Union legally, spiritually, possibly by exorcism.\" Well, if it's an exorcism you need, may I recommend this fellow. I believe Satan is inside that dog. Kat, here's a relationship you could probably identify with."

I think it's always sad when a relationship ends, but it must be especially sad when the relationship is a figment of your own imagination because you would think going into that that seeing as it's a figment of your own imagination that you'd be able to make sure that it worked out. I mean you're the only one who that's really up to."

I can't predict sports games, but I can predict Kat and relationship talk. If we could make money on it, I wouldn't be here. I've been next to you - we have a podcast, \"Tyrus and Timpf\" it's really good."

This is a weird thing."
