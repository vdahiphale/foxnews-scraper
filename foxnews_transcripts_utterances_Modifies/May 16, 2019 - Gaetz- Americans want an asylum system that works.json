But American voters do tend to set the bar a bit higher when it comes to your qualifications and your experience in life beyond those very basic markers.  This was the cover of de Blasio's hometown newspaper here today. The New York Post with people howling laughing on the cover wrote a scathing editorial. Listing what they sees as de Blasio's myriad of failures from an increasingly bad homeless problem in New York, to hundreds of millions of dollars spent on mental health and education that they say had no results. He differs with that. And then, there was a debacle at housing. The person he put in charge of housing people in New York City, which is very difficult. That person had to step down. The federal government had to come in because it was such a mess. And worse than all of that, child services also failed to protect New York's children despite his promise to make sure this program was overseen carefully with tragic consequences.  Now, the other big city newspaper here in New York City, which is usually more favorable to Mayor de Blasio, said, \"Don't scoff at Bill's candidacy. Mayor de Blasio is a formidable 2020 candidate, but beware him taking his eye off the New York City ball.\"   Now, just think back a moment, because the last time a New York City mayor ran for president, it was the man that Time magazine and national publication called America's mayor after 9/11. Some at the time were urging Rudy Giuliani to stay on longer despite term limits. He left the office with an 89 percent approval rating and then, of course, he ran for president of the United States. So, here's what you've got now. 76 percent of New Yorkers say that de Blasio should not run for president. But de Blasio is unfazed by his unpopularity. This is a protest outside of Trump Tower the other day in his current job and seeks the highest office in the land. He says this.",

But they both agreed today that this mayor has been a disaster. And you cited some of the reasons. For example, people who live in public housing in New York are suffering without heat in the winter, without elevator service. So bad that the federal government had to step in.  He has doubled what the city has spent on homelessness. But the problem is bigger than ever. And most tragically, as you mentioned, toddlers and small children have died. Died of terrible abuse at the hands of foster parents and parents, while Child Protective Services was mismanaged. In fact, in one instance, a child died of a brutal beating when Child Protective Services had visited that home 13 times. And even Juan will probably agree that the mayor's resistance to school choice has trapped so many children in failing public schools.",

I think Donald Trump is more unpopular in New York than he is. But he's been elected and re-elected, and the question is, what does he bring to this race that would make him distinct, Martha, in such a large field? Now, he ran a video today talking about working people first. I think that Elizabeth Warren has that lane to herself. And she has real proposals, real solutions and she's already articulated.  And if you look at the Fox News poll that's out today, Elizabeth Warren's at nine percent. She's up in since March into April.

He seized what funds he can and applied them to the wall. And frankly, we need the Congress to be more engaged to prioritize that element of border security.

Then between Cotentin Peninsula and the Britney Peninsula another submarine flashed us signals and at that point we turned left and we entered the Cotentin Peninsula at jump altitude which was 750 feet.",

      "utterance": "Well, we will see and the United States, as you know, you have to be over 35, you have to be a natural born U.S. citizen. But American voters do tend to set the bar a bit higher when it comes to your qualifications and your experience in life beyond those very basic markers. This was the cover of de Blasio's hometown newspaper here today. The New York Post with people howling laughing on the cover wrote a scathing editorial. Listing what they sees as de Blasio's myriad of failures from an increasingly bad homeless problem in New York, to hundreds of millions of dollars spent on mental health and education that they say had no results. He differs with that. And then, there was a debacle at housing. The person he put in charge of housing people in New York City, which is very difficult. That person had to step down. The federal government had to come in because it was such a mess. And worse than all of that, child services also failed to protect New York's children despite his promise to make sure this program was overseen carefully with tragic consequences. Now, the other big city newspaper here in New York City, which is usually more favorable to Mayor de Blasio, said, \"Don't scoff at Bill's candidacy. Mayor de Blasio is a formidable 2020 candidate, but beware him taking his eye off the New York City ball.\" Now, just think back a moment, because the last time a New York City mayor ran for president, it was the man that Time magazine and national publication called America's mayor after 9/11. Some at the time were urging Rudy Giuliani to stay on longer despite term limits. He left the office with an 89 percent approval rating and then, of course, he ran for president of the United States. So, here's what you've got now. 76 percent of New Yorkers say that de Blasio should not run for president. But de Blasio is unfazed by his unpopularity. This is a protest outside of Trump Tower the other day in his current job and seeks the highest office in the land. He says this."

In moments, Andrew Yang, he is one of the 22 candidates who is going to run against Mayor de Blasio and all of the others. He has a controversial economic plan that turns a lot of heads, gotten a lot of attention. So, we can talk to him in just a moment.

But they both agreed today that this mayor has been a disaster. And you cited some of the reasons. For example, people who live in public housing in New York are suffering without heat in the winter, without elevator service. So bad that the federal government had to step in. He has doubled what the city has spent on homelessness. But the problem is bigger than ever. And most tragically, as you mentioned, toddlers and small children have died. Died of terrible abuse at the hands of foster parents and parents, while Child Protective Services was mismanaged. In fact, in one instance, a child died of a brutal beating when Child Protective Services had visited that home 13 times. And even Juan will probably agree that the mayor's resistance to school choice has trapped so many children in failing public schools."

What strikes me as we've never had a New York City mayor who was elevated and runs successfully for president of the United States? New York is the biggest city, people might think, oh, my gosh, if you're running in New York and he's been reelected, remember that I talking about unpopular. I think Donald Trump is more unpopular in New York than he is. But he's been elected and re-elected, and the question is, what does he bring to this race that would make him distinct, Martha, in such a large field? Now, he ran a video today talking about working people first. I think that Elizabeth Warren has that lane to herself. And she has real proposals, real solutions and she's already articulated. And if you look at the Fox News poll that's out today, Elizabeth Warren's at nine percent. She's up in since March into April. She's up, and now we're into the position where if she has that territory, what is it that Bill de Blasio can bring to the table that would make him really other than his height stand up."

That money is in everything from readiness, the ability of the military to operate, to have fuel, to have the other armaments including the munitions that they need as well as military construction programs that have all been vetted and found to be of absolutely essential to do. What's happening here and reason that we're putting in this legislation is that the President without Congressional authority, without the appropriation process, is reaching into the Pentagon's programs and taking money without authorization from the Congress that has the appropriation power to transfer that money onto what he believes to be a higher priority."

But at the very same -- at this moment, the President -- the Department of Defense tells us that we have to put into the Persian Gulf an aircraft carrier, a contingent of marines, and B-52 bombers because there is a crisis in the Persian Gulf. That's what the military is for. The military money was appropriated for the purpose of protecting this nation from all kinds of threats.

What you have now is a 58-year winning streak for the National Defense Authorization Act. In partisan times and divided government, it has always been effective to do right by our troops in the absence of poison pills. Now, we see the circumstance where there could be a poison pill and Democrats could put our troops in danger by creating a partisan environment around what we all should agree on, and that's authorized the activities of our military."

Do you want frivolous asylum claims sent immediately back to their home country or not? These aren't views that are -- that are outside the norm. I think most American people would want an asylum system that works. But what we have right now, Martha, is catch-and-release. The Democrats are against the catch, we're against the release. And I think that with the president's new plan, we have a framework that really shows the contrasts between the parties heading into the next election."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, look, we agree that the legislation doesn't reduce legal immigration. It is not the intent of the President to reduce legal immigration when it can help the American people, when it can be an updraft for the American economy. The question is whether or not we have an immigration policy that is America first or one that is Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador first and putting the interests of the cartels in place. So I think Ann Coulter's criticism on the substance is accurate as it relates to the wall, but the President's budget lays out billions of dollars more for the wall. He seized what funds he can and applied them to the wall. And frankly, we need the Congress to be more engaged to prioritize that element of border security. As your segment pointed out, 100,000 people last month, and in just the last six months, one percent of Guatemala has moved into the United States. That's really bad for us, but it's really bad for them too."

Now, that score will be shared with the colleges, but it will be hidden from the students. It's going to rate their socioeconomic background using 15 factors in three categories. Neighborhood environment, where you grew up, what kind of neighborhood you live in, your family environment, how many parents do you have? All of that kind of thing. High school environment, where you go, how challenging it is. So, this new score is sparking a very big debate over whether or not this is truly fair to all students. Joining me now, Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute Scholar and Fox News contributor, and Jason Nichols, American Studies professor at the University of Maryland.

Right? I've got to perform. I've got to make a good point on the air here. I don't get to say an adversity score. I don't get to -- I don't get to say an adversity score. So, life is meritocracy.

And I do believe the overall impression he was trying to relay to us is that when he took the job a few months ago he asked a lot of questions. And kept asking questions and did not get answers that essentially added up. Here is how he phrased it just about an hour ago."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "I've been trying to get answers to questions. And I found that a lot of the answers have been inadequate. And I've also found that some of the explanations I've gotten don't hang together. So, so in a sense I have more questions today than I did when I first started."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "Some of what things don't hang together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Some of the explanations of what occurred."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "Why does that matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Because I think people have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we're worried about foreign influence for the very same reason, we should be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so, I'm not saying that happened, but I'm saying that we have to look at that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "That phrase 'don't hang together' is something I really want to impress upon you, Martha and our viewers. He has used it several times in this trip already. So, what does that mean? A very specific question. You will hear the rest of that context tomorrow when we air the entire interview is the following. Between election day of November 2016 and the inauguration, what decisions were made within the Obama administration and the intel community that perhaps may have justified the actions they took. And the one example he would say, Martha, was the Trump tower meeting in January 6. He clearly has a lot of questions about that. Beyond that, not a lot of specifics. However, he responds to the accusation of lying before Congress. The contempt before Congress. The obstruction allegation that he did not go forward with, the question about witness tampering. So, we get into all of this and he talks about James Comey as well. I think there is a lot of new material in this interview that he has not given just yet until the first, as you mentioned, television interview he has given as A.G."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, we look forward to that. Because James Comey said about Attorney General Barr, I think he has lost most of his reputation. It's very clear that James Comey does not like where this attorney general is poking around."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "I will tell you the interview ended on that very question. And his answer was interesting. He pretty much suggested that not a lot of people are going to care about him in the end. He clearly believes he is now the target of a Democratic-led House, and, Martha, he expected that when he took the job. Very interesting stuff and a lot more throughout this interview coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Fascinating, Bill. We all are looking forward to seeing it. Great job. And thanks for sharing that little sneak peek with us this evening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "Sure. You bet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And we'll be watching tomorrow. Safe home. Thank you very much. Coming up next tonight. You don't want to miss this gentleman and his incredible story as a World War II paratrooper into Normandy and why he now goes back every year. He is 97. He is about to jump out of the plane again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, tonight, THE STORY continues to honor the greatest generation as the 75th anniversary of D-Day approaches. Army paratrooper Tom Rice was just 22, he is a handsome young man when he jumped into Normandy on June 6th, 1944. Member of the 101st Airborne Division known as the Screaming Eagles. He would go down to earn a Purple Heart and bronze star for his service. But now, at the age of 97. Tom Rice will jump again next month to honor the sacrifice of those who never came home. I recently spoke to the \"Trial by Combat\" author about that, a tradition he has bravely carried on in their memory for the past six D-Day anniversaries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let's go back to D-Day 1944 if we could for a moment. What do you remember about the first time you jumped out of the plane?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THOMAS RICE, WORLD WAR II VETERAN",
      "utterance": "The first time I jumped out was in Fort Benning, Georgia. I had seen airplanes, had never touched one. But this was the opportunity to do it. So, we did our -- we did our practice jumps in several places. And we jumped once a month for about 48 months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, when you went to D-Day and you got a chance to do the real thing and, you know, people were shooting at you, what was that like? What was going through your mind when the door opened of the plane and it was time to go? You were the first one out, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, we have no door on the aircraft. It was wide open."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I stand corrected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "What I was thinking was my mind was going microseconds. Dealing with detail, detail, detail. And make sure everything is working right and it's going to be proper and we were going to take off at the appropriate time. So, we took off at 10.41 English double summertime. Assembled at 55,000 feet. Moved south and east toward Portsmouth. The code name was Portsmouth Bill. We dropped down to 1,500 feet to get under the German radar as we crossed the English Channel. About the middle of the channel was the American submarine we flashed our lights that we were on time and flew in the right direction. Then between Cotentin Peninsula and the Britney Peninsula another submarine flashed us signals and at that point we turned left and we entered the Cotentin Peninsula at jump altitude which was 750 feet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I read that your arm got caught when you jumped out of the plane. Can you tell me about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "I always jumped number one. I weighed 268 pounds when I left that aircraft. Loaded with all kinds of death dealing bric-a-brac that for the most part I threw away when I got on the ground. We were traveling 176 miles an hour which was too fast. We were below jump altitude. So, as I stepped out of the door and the green light went on, I got -- and the paraPAC were released at the same time by number two and three men. The plane went up about 50 feet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "And I was -- as I went out, I was hit by that prop blast and my arm got caught in the lower left-hand corner of the door at the armpit. So, I swung out at arm's length and back again. Hit the side of the aircraft. Swung out. Came back again and I straightened my arm just enough to get loose. And so, in a matter of a second or so, the parachute opened and I think I was far too low, maybe about two or three oscillations and I was on the ground."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Incredible. It's an incredible story. I want to just fast forward for a moment. And talk about what has motivated you over the past six years to go back and to jump every year on D-Day as part of this ceremony?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm a risk taker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "No kidding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "My father -- my father was killed in a naval aircraft in Panama in 1932. And so, for the most part I was on my own. So, I was out in the jungle doing a lot of crazy things, camping, et cetera. I was a runner. I run the marathons and my 10k is my favorite race. I was a soldier and a teacher for 44 years. Taught government and U.S. history. So, all of this began to impact me and I came from a city where you contribute, you don't consume. You contribute. Coronado, California. Just overloaded with just great people. So, all of this impacted me and I was going to do something."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Sergeant --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICE",
      "utterance": "I did it as best I could. And the best way would be to show the individuals in the 501-parachute infantry that they will never be forgotten because we had 38 percent casualty in Normandy. So, I remember all of those. And I know every guy that was in my aircraft when we jumped into Normandy. Every guy in my aircraft when we jumped into Holland."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Sergeant, thank you. You are an incredible story and you are a great tribute to all of those that you served with and all of those individuals that you say you will never forget and whose honor you will jump -- and whose honor you'll jump on June the 5th this year and we'll be there to watch. And we'd love to hear more of your story when we are in France. So, thank you very much for joining us this evening. Sergeant Tom Rice. Thank you for your service, sir."
