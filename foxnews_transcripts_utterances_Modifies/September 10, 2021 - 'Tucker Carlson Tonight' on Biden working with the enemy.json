      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to a Special Edition of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. I'm Lara Logan in for Tucker. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA was established in the 1970s to inspect workplaces and establish standards to prevent industrial accidents but starting this summer the Biden administration gave OSHA a new role.  Joe Biden told OSHA to start hiding information from the public to promote the COVID vaccine. Until this summer, OSHA required employers to retain records of any worker who suffered a serious side effect from the vaccine, then in June, OSHA's guidance suddenly changed to this, quote: \"OSHA will not enforce Federal recording requirements that require any employers to record worker side effects from COVID-19 vaccination.\"  That was a major change especially since we're still learning so much about these vaccines and their possible side effects.  Just hours ago, for example, \"The Telegraph\" in Britain reported that quote: \"Teenage boys are six times more likely to suffer from heart problems from the vaccine than be hospitalized from COVID-19.\" And in Israel, where more than 80 percent of adults are vaccinated, COVID cases are spiking. Israel now has one of the world's highest daily infection rates.  So what explains that? In his remarks to the nation, Joe Biden didn't answer that. Instead, he put OSHA, the same agency that's been hiding evidence of vaccine side effects in charge of forcing millions of Americans to take the covet vaccine.  Joe Biden didn't even bother to ask Congress. He said the new mandate is justified because COVID is a quote, \"emergency.\" Then he walked away without taking questions once again.   But let's look at the facts. On average, more than 98 percent of COVID-19 patients in the United States survive. That number is well over 99 percent for every age group except for the very elderly, whether they're vaccinated or not. Meanwhile, we know that millions of Americans have natural immunity from previous COVID infections. Studies show they have far greater protection than the vaccine can provide. Tony Fauci was just asked about this on CNN, if people have natural immunity why do they need the vaccine? He couldn't answer.",

The shocking report basically shows a step-by-step video of Zemari Ahmadi reportedly loading canisters of water into his trunk to bring to his family. The U.S. military was surveilling the man and thought those jugs of water could be explosives and that Ahmadi was communicating with ISIS, so the U.S. launched a hellfire missile obliterating the man's car in his driveway in a dense residential neighborhood.   Military officials said the drone strike might have killed three civilians, but \"The New York Times\" now tallies 10 innocent people killed. Army General Mark Milley said the strike was valid because there was reasonable conclusion that there were explosives in the white Toyota and that the U.S.  had very good intelligence that ISIS was planning some type of vehicle attack. But \"The New York Times\" reports it spoke to witnesses on the ground who say Mr. Ahmadi had multiple passengers in his car that day, that denied loading or seeing any explosives and that Ahmadi was not related to ISIS.  Ahmadi had worked as an electrical engineer since 2006 for a California- based aid and lobbying group. Ahmadi's family insists he was innocent and applied for a refugee settlement here in the United States, Lara. We will keep you updated on this developing story.",

That's a question that just isn't asked, and yesterday, a spokeswoman for Joe Biden's National Security Council named Emily Horne, well, she praised the Taliban who have been murdering their way across Afghanistan for their quote, \"cooperation\" in allowing U.S. citizens to board a commercial flight out of Afghanistan, saying quote: \"They have shown flexibility and they've been businesslike and professional in our dealings with them in this effort.\" They haven't allowed green card holders and our Afghan allies who are most vulnerable and high risk to leave, but who exactly is the White House praising as businesslike and professional? It's a question that is worth asking, so we looked into it. Shortly after the Taliban entered Kabul in mid-August, its Deputy Commander, a man named Siraj Haqqani who also runs his own terrorist organization known as the Haqqani Network, he put his uncle Khalil ur Rahman Haqqani, in charge of security in the Afghan capital, so with the exception of the airport itself, which was being secured and operated by U.S. forces, the rest of Kabul and the country is what Joe Biden called behind enemy lines. Well, that was under control of the Haqqani Network.  So who are they? Well, according to the U.S. government, the Haqqani Network is a foreign terrorist organization. The United Nations agrees with that. This network has been on the United Nations Security Council sanction list since 2012, and in fact Siraj Haqqani and many members of his family are among the most wanted terrorists in the world. The F.B.I. has been looking for him for some time. They want him so badly they put a $10 million bounty on his head and a $5 million bounty on his uncle's head. Well, you know, we've got news for the F.B.I. tonight if they're still looking for Siraj Haqqani and his uncle, they can look up the address of the Interior Ministry in Kabul because Siraj Haqqani has been rewarded for his murderous efforts by being made the country's new Interior Minister and he is in charge of all of the borders and the security. So, if you -- you know, if you're looking to claim that reward perhaps you'd want to donate it to the Taliban's humanitarian crisis because that's the excuse that the U.S. is using to send yes, you guessed it, more of your tax dollars to terrorists. These people aren't on these lists for no reason. They've killed people. They've killed a lot of people. Many of them U.S. soldiers, hundreds by some conservative estimates, also hundreds of NATO forces. They've killed thousands of Afghan civilians and according to most estimates, more than 10,000 Afghan soldiers and policemen. So it might surprise you to learn that these are the very same people the Biden administration turned to for help in the last desperate days of the evacuation that they handled so poorly. The Biden administration actually asked the terrorists of the Haqqani Network to secure a safe passage to the airport for U.S. citizens and green card holders.  One source told us, there is no way that the commercial flights with American citizens that just left Kabul Airport could have done so without the coordination and approval from the Haqqani Network, which is also illegal under U.S. law, negotiating with and speaking to and supporting terrorists, but is it any wonder that 13 Americans and so many Afghan civilians were killed at that airport when that's your security partner? It doesn't seem to bode well for the future of counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan because as you all remember, the very same people are the ones the Biden administration says are going to help the U.S. as a counterterrorism partner. General McKenzie has so much confidence in these people who have been killing Americans for the last two decades that he said, we're sharing information with them now, too.",

This is cold as I can ever remember, he looks at me and says, \"Your son has a fatal defect and is going to die.\" And so, this was during my time where I'm sort of growing in my faith and having this experience that I talked to you about finding the Lord, taking on this this great -- what I thought was an important moral cause for the country and then boom. You know, I remember having this conversation with God and said, you know, here I am trying to follow your path and you take my son? And so it was devastating. We did everything we could to try to save his life.

He lived for two hours. And I thought, you know, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? And you know, it's just -- you know God why? Why? Why? You know all the greatest question everybody who goes through tragedy is why? Why did this happen to me? And what happened, my wife -- it wasn't me, it was my wife who made it all come together. Every time we got pregnant, Karen would keep a diary to describe the pregnancy so she could share it with the kids and say oh, this is what it was like and share these notes. That was, you know, she was a neonatal intensive care nurse so she always -- pregnancies were just a really joyful time and she would keep notes.  And she was keeping notes about our son, so she kept writing these letters to him, hoping someday, he'd read them, so she wrote these letters and at the end, when he died, she kept writing because it was her way to just get this stuff out. So she wrote this and her mother read it who had lost a child 50 years ago, and -- from the SIDS death -- and it just broke her up and she said, \"You have to publish this. You have to publish these letters.\" And so anyway, eventually, a little Catholic publisher published it, sold out 25,000 copies and it's still around, but it's called \"Letters to Gabriel.\"",

Look, here is what we're really seeing when you look at this border surge and what's breaking down. The thing that we really have to think about is, we can't look at the border the way we used to. It's not a U.S.-Mexico issue. The world is coming and the data from the United States Customs and Border Protection proves that. I mean, they have apprehended people from over 148 countries in the first 10 months of this fiscal year. Now, in addition, we're also seeing more fentanyl from the cartels specifically Sinaloa and Cartel Jalisco New Generation that we have ever seen, which is perpetuating this overdose crisis at unbelievable levels. And then the third and final thing that we're really seeing that's very concerning is this adjustment from the cartels from human smuggling into human trafficking, and to just make everyone aware of just how this is really playing out across that southern border, especially within the Gulf Cartel area at South Texas, what you're seeing is wristbands. Now these bands we've collected along the southwest border and this is what they're putting on men, women, and children and when you see these where they're tight like this, they haven't been broken off, this is because they are placed on a child. And it goes to show how the cartels and the alien smuggling groups treat people as a commodity. And what the bands really represent is a process, just like law enforcement is having a difficult time keeping up with the amount of people crossing at the southwest border, so are the cartels. So, they're literally tagging people like a commodity. Some of the latest things that we're seeing -- we've seen this since February, some of the latest tactics that we're seeing because they're always changing is even single males and single females who are always runners because look, if they're apprehended, they go back to Mexico, so they're running. Now, what agents are seeing in just the last few weeks is they're wearing two wristbands and that's breaking news right here on the show. First is that the peso has been paid, which is what one represents; the second is the city in the State of Texas or around the country where they're going. So we've never been here before.",

They use what we refer to as long-haul smugglers, where Afghans will pay usually historically about $15,000.00 to $20,000.00 per person. They'll receive fake passports, they'll fly usually into the Gulf states of Qatar or Saudi Arabia, then they'll take an additional flight over to South America to Brazil. And then from there, the smuggling groups just basically daisy chain just like they do everyone else, all the way up through the Darien Gap into Mexico, and then from there, that's where the cartels start charging these incredible fees to get them in, and we've seen that for some time. Now where I'm concerned right now with what has been happening is that we're seeing mass groups of people surging into all the -istan countries surrounding Afghanistan. You're going to see very soon, we've got about a six to eight-week window before we're starting to see people hit the southern part of South America. And the reason that's important, Lara, is because the Homeland Security enterprise and programs that we have downrange have already been derailed because of the amount of people crossing through the Darien and other areas and I won't go into much detail there except to say, now we're adding this crisis in Afghanistan to an already crisis going on at the southern border and the world knows that if you come to the southern border, you're going to make it into the country.",

The United States invaded Afghanistan to hold the Taliban accountable for their role in aiding and protecting al-Qaeda in those attacks. Now, the Taliban is back in power and with billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment. Tom Joscelyn is a senior fellow and senior editor of \"FDD's Long War Journal\" who is one of the few people who's been on this subject from the very start. He joins us now to assess the last two decades in Afghanistan. Tom, one of the things I've been wanting to ask you to explain for a very long time is this complete and utter farce that the administration is perpetuating that the Taliban and al-Qaeda and ISIS-K and all of these groups are entirely distinct entities and there is no relationship between them. Nobody knows more about this than you. Please, break it down for us. TOM JOSCELYN, SENIOR FELLOW AND SENIOR EDITOR OF \"FDD'S LONG WAR JOURNAL\": Well you know, Lara, you know in an earlier segment you were focusing on Sirajuddin Haqqani, and rightfully so. So Sirajuddin Haqqani has been the Deputy Emir of the Taliban since 2015. He is going to be the Interior Minister in the new regime. And I want to put this in context for your viewers tonight a little bit, so Sirajuddin Haqqani's father, Jalaluddin, was Osama bin Laden's first benefactor. He was the first guy who actually protected and sponsored Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and in fact al-Qaeda was incubated in Jalaluddin Haqqani's camps in Eastern Afghanistan. So his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani has carried on the jihad for him, and for the last 20 years, really, Siraj has worked closely with al-Qaeda, so closely that when we went through the files we recovered in Osama bin Laden's compound, those files show that al-Qaeda was working with him on the battlefields in Afghanistan, working with him politically, working with him and his family members for a ransom exchange for an Afghan ambassador that al-Qaeda had taken hostage. Really working with him all the time, and this is something that Siraj has even admitted, and in fact, al-Qaeda has worked so closely with him that when Hamza bin Laden, Osama's son had to be protected from the U.S., it was actually Sirajuddin Haqqani's right hand man, a guy named Qari Zakir who was responsible for protecting Hamza bin Laden. So when we look at the Haqqani's and their senior leadership roles in the Taliban, the question we have to ask ourselves here is, is this really the Taliban or the Haqqani's or are they just part of al-Qaeda? I think there's plenty of evidence showing that they're so intertwined with al-Qaeda that doesn't really make any sense to play disconnect the dots between the two.",

The idea they're going to try -- that some people -- we don't know if this is the policy yet, but some people want to recognize the Taliban's Islamic Emirate as legitimate, is unbelievably disgraceful. You know just days after they took power in mid-August, okay, and took over most of Afghanistan in mid-August, just days afterwards, they took control of Afghan National Television and they ran a documentary called \"Victorious Force 3.\" In that documentary, they glorified 9/11 on Afghan National TV, so all Afghans who could turn into TV that night saw a documentary not from the perspective of Americans remembering this solemn day and sort of in in a remorseful type of manner, no, it was a glorification of 9/11 and actually blaming America for the attack. They wouldn't blame al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, they said, no, America deserved it and so the idea that the Taliban is our counterterrorism partner, that the Taliban is something that's separate from al-Qaeda or that we can trust to basically keep the terrorists at bay is really ludicrous.",

      "utterance": "\"OSHA will not enforce Federal recording requirements that require any employers to record worker side effects from COVID-19 vaccination.\" That was a major change especially since we're still learning so much about these vaccines and their possible side effects. Just hours ago, for example, \"The Telegraph\" in Britain reported that quote: \"Teenage boys are six times more likely to suffer from heart problems from the vaccine than be hospitalized from COVID-19.\" And in Israel, where more than 80 percent of adults are vaccinated, COVID cases are spiking. Israel now has one of the world's highest daily infection rates. So what explains that? In his remarks to the nation, Joe Biden didn't answer that. Instead, he put OSHA, the same agency that's been hiding evidence of vaccine side effects in charge of forcing millions of Americans to take the covet vaccine. Joe Biden didn't even bother to ask Congress. He said the new mandate is justified because COVID is a quote, \"emergency.\" Then he walked away without taking questions once again. But let's look at the facts. On average, more than 98 percent of COVID-19 patients in the United States survive. That number is well over 99 percent for every age group except for the very elderly, whether they're vaccinated or not. Meanwhile, we know that millions of Americans have natural immunity from previous COVID infections. Studies show they have far greater protection than the vaccine can provide. Tony Fauci was just asked about this on CNN, if people have natural immunity why do they need the vaccine? He couldn't answer."

The U.S. military was surveilling the man and thought those jugs of water could be explosives and that Ahmadi was communicating with ISIS, so the U.S. launched a hellfire missile obliterating the man's car in his driveway in a dense residential neighborhood. Military officials said the drone strike might have killed three civilians, but \"The New York Times\" now tallies 10 innocent people killed. Army General Mark Milley said the strike was valid because there was reasonable conclusion that there were explosives in the white Toyota and that the U.S. had very good intelligence that ISIS was planning some type of vehicle attack. But \"The New York Times\" reports it spoke to witnesses on the ground who say Mr. Ahmadi had multiple passengers in his car that day, that denied loading or seeing any explosives and that Ahmadi was not related to ISIS. Ahmadi had worked as an electrical engineer since 2006 for a California- based aid and lobbying group. Ahmadi's family insists he was innocent and applied for a refugee settlement here in the United States, Lara. We will keep you updated on this developing story."

The news cycle and the Biden administration, well, they want you to move on, and in many ways they're doing everything they can to make sure you do. They use COVID and vaccine mandates to distract from the chaos that they've created. But we all remember the scenes they want us to forget. Afghans desperately clinging to a U.S. Air Force plane on the airport runway, Afghan mothers passing their children to American soldiers over an airport wall, and videos of the Taliban showcasing their new state-of-the-art military arsenal, bought and paid for by you, the U.S. taxpayer. Everything we saw unfold, it wasn't only preventable, it still is and worse than that, we allowed it to happen. We're not doing anything to change the outcome here. At any moment, Joe Biden and his officials in his administration could stop this.

It is the last standing province in the entire country that these terrorists do not control and the Taliban, what they do control is the information flow. They want you to think it's all been conquered, it's all over, while the democratically elected head of the country, Amrullah Saleh, who was Vice President at the time the President fled and became acting President, they want you to believe that he, along with all the forces, that soldiers in this country have fought beside, and all of our allies there for decades have not been abandoned by Joe Biden. They are there continuing to fight the Islamic terrorists who are responsible for 9/11 with no help from the U.S. at all, while the enemy they face is supported by their allies -- Pakistan, China, Iran, and others.

      "utterance": "How is turning a terrorist group into a nation state in the interests of the United States? That's a question that just isn't asked, and yesterday, a spokeswoman for Joe Biden's National Security Council named Emily Horne, well, she praised the Taliban who have been murdering their way across Afghanistan for their quote, \"cooperation\" in allowing U.S. citizens to board a commercial flight out of Afghanistan, saying quote: \"They have shown flexibility and they've been businesslike and professional in our dealings with them in this effort.\" They haven't allowed green card holders and our Afghan allies who are most vulnerable and high risk to leave, but who exactly is the White House praising as businesslike and professional? It's a question that is worth asking, so we looked into it. Shortly after the Taliban entered Kabul in mid-August, its Deputy Commander, a man named Siraj Haqqani who also runs his own terrorist organization known as the Haqqani Network, he put his uncle Khalil ur Rahman Haqqani, in charge of security in the Afghan capital, so with the exception of the airport itself, which was being secured and operated by U.S. forces, the rest of Kabul and the country is what Joe Biden called behind enemy lines. Well, that was under control of the Haqqani Network. So who are they? Well, according to the U.S. government, the Haqqani Network is a foreign terrorist organization. The United Nations agrees with that. This network has been on the United Nations Security Council sanction list since 2012, and in fact Siraj Haqqani and many members of his family are among the most wanted terrorists in the world. The F.B.I. has been looking for him for some time. They want him so badly they put a $10 million bounty on his head and a $5 million bounty on his uncle's head. Well, you know, we've got news for the F.B.I. tonight if they're still looking for Siraj Haqqani and his uncle, they can look up the address of the Interior Ministry in Kabul because Siraj Haqqani has been rewarded for his murderous efforts by being made the country's new Interior Minister and he is in charge of all of the borders and the security. So, if you -- you know, if you're looking to claim that reward perhaps you'd want to donate it to the Taliban's humanitarian crisis because that's the excuse that the U.S. is using to send yes, you guessed it, more of your tax dollars to terrorists. These people aren't on these lists for no reason. They've killed people. They've killed a lot of people. Many of them U.S. soldiers, hundreds by some conservative estimates, also hundreds of NATO forces. They've killed thousands of Afghan civilians and according to most estimates, more than 10,000 Afghan soldiers and policemen. So it might surprise you to learn that these are the very same people the Biden administration turned to for help in the last desperate days of the evacuation that they handled so poorly. The Biden administration actually asked the terrorists of the Haqqani Network to secure a safe passage to the airport for U.S. citizens and green card holders. One source told us, there is no way that the commercial flights with American citizens that just left Kabul Airport could have done so without the coordination and approval from the Haqqani Network, which is also illegal under U.S. law, negotiating with and speaking to and supporting terrorists, but is it any wonder that 13 Americans and so many Afghan civilians were killed at that airport when that's your security partner? It doesn't seem to bode well for the future of counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan because as you all remember, the very same people are the ones the Biden administration says are going to help the U.S. as a counterterrorism partner. General McKenzie has so much confidence in these people who have been killing Americans for the last two decades that he said, we're sharing information with them now, too."

And now tonight, we can confirm that there is one type of Intelligence the U.S. has left behind in the hands of the Taliban. This is the biometric database and the scanners that come with that capability that are called Interagency Identity Detection Equipment. There are multiple reports of these devices being used not by the U.S. in Kabul when people were boarding those planes, but by the Taliban and the Islamic terrorists that they work with at the checkpoints that we were sending our American citizens and vulnerable Afghan allies through to get to the airport to try to leave the country. Sensitive biometric data like iris scans and fingerprints of every single person who worked with American and NATO forces. These are people the Taliban consider collaborators and those devices enable the Taliban and al- Qaeda to hunt them down anywhere. They can find anyone who worked with and for the U.S. or the Afghan government or anyone who believes in the idea of freedom, they can find them anywhere they are. These individuals are the ones who are relying on us, who turn to us to help after we turned and relied on them. We don't have to imagine what their fates will be.

But as you mentioned, he is going to be there tomorrow, so maybe you and I could split the reward because I know the Department of State has a $10 million reward for information on where he is, and my understanding is he is going to be on the second floor."

This is cold as I can ever remember, he looks at me and says, \"Your son has a fatal defect and is going to die.\" And so, this was during my time where I'm sort of growing in my faith and having this experience that I talked to you about finding the Lord, taking on this this great -- what I thought was an important moral cause for the country and then boom. You know, I remember having this conversation with God and said, you know, here I am trying to follow your path and you take my son? And so it was devastating. We did everything we could to try to save his life. We had -- we went up to Children's Hospital in Philadelphia and had intrauterine surgery to try to fix the problem and end up -- Karen got an infection and delivered our little boy. He lived for two hours. And I thought, you know, what are you doing? Why are you doing this? And you know, it's just -- you know God why? Why? Why? You know all the greatest question everybody who goes through tragedy is why? Why did this happen to me? And what happened, my wife -- it wasn't me, it was my wife who made it all come together. Every time we got pregnant, Karen would keep a diary to describe the pregnancy so she could share it with the kids and say oh, this is what it was like and share these notes. That was, you know, she was a neonatal intensive care nurse so she always -- pregnancies were just a really joyful time and she would keep notes. And she was keeping notes about our son, so she kept writing these letters to him, hoping someday, he'd read them, so she wrote these letters and at the end, when he died, she kept writing because it was her way to just get this stuff out. So she wrote this and her mother read it who had lost a child 50 years ago, and -- from the SIDS death -- and it just broke her up and she said, \"You have to publish this. You have to publish these letters.\" And so anyway, eventually, a little Catholic publisher published it, sold out 25,000 copies and it's still around, but it's called \"Letters to Gabriel.\""

Look, here is what we're really seeing when you look at this border surge and what's breaking down. The thing that we really have to think about is, we can't look at the border the way we used to. It's not a U.S.-Mexico issue. The world is coming and the data from the United States Customs and Border Protection proves that. I mean, they have apprehended people from over 148 countries in the first 10 months of this fiscal year. Now, in addition, we're also seeing more fentanyl from the cartels specifically Sinaloa and Cartel Jalisco New Generation that we have ever seen, which is perpetuating this overdose crisis at unbelievable levels. And then the third and final thing that we're really seeing that's very concerning is this adjustment from the cartels from human smuggling into human trafficking, and to just make everyone aware of just how this is really playing out across that southern border, especially within the Gulf Cartel area at South Texas, what you're seeing is wristbands. Now these bands we've collected along the southwest border and this is what they're putting on men, women, and children and when you see these where they're tight like this, they haven't been broken off, this is because they are placed on a child. And it goes to show how the cartels and the alien smuggling groups treat people as a commodity. And what the bands really represent is a process, just like law enforcement is having a difficult time keeping up with the amount of people crossing at the southwest border, so are the cartels. So, they're literally tagging people like a commodity. Some of the latest things that we're seeing -- we've seen this since February, some of the latest tactics that we're seeing because they're always changing is even single males and single females who are always runners because look, if they're apprehended, they go back to Mexico, so they're running. Now, what agents are seeing in just the last few weeks is they're wearing two wristbands and that's breaking news right here on the show. First is that the peso has been paid, which is what one represents; the second is the city in the State of Texas or around the country where they're going. So we've never been here before."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. So there's already been historically smuggling rounds that go from Afghanistan over to Brazil and then up -- and I'll let me explain a little bit. They use what we refer to as long-haul smugglers, where Afghans will pay usually historically about $15,000.00 to $20,000.00 per person. They'll receive fake passports, they'll fly usually into the Gulf states of Qatar or Saudi Arabia, then they'll take an additional flight over to South America to Brazil. And then from there, the smuggling groups just basically daisy chain just like they do everyone else, all the way up through the Darien Gap into Mexico, and then from there, that's where the cartels start charging these incredible fees to get them in, and we've seen that for some time. Now where I'm concerned right now with what has been happening is that we're seeing mass groups of people surging into all the -istan countries surrounding Afghanistan. You're going to see very soon, we've got about a six to eight-week window before we're starting to see people hit the southern part of South America. And the reason that's important, Lara, is because the Homeland Security enterprise and programs that we have downrange have already been derailed because of the amount of people crossing through the Darien and other areas and I won't go into much detail there except to say, now we're adding this crisis in Afghanistan to an already crisis going on at the southern border and the world knows that if you come to the southern border, you're going to make it into the country."

The United States invaded Afghanistan to hold the Taliban accountable for their role in aiding and protecting al-Qaeda in those attacks. Now, the Taliban is back in power and with billions of dollars in U.S. military equipment. Tom Joscelyn is a senior fellow and senior editor of \"FDD's Long War Journal\" who is one of the few people who's been on this subject from the very start. He joins us now to assess the last two decades in Afghanistan. Tom, one of the things I've been wanting to ask you to explain for a very long time is this complete and utter farce that the administration is perpetuating that the Taliban and al-Qaeda and ISIS-K and all of these groups are entirely distinct entities and there is no relationship between them. Nobody knows more about this than you. Please, break it down for us. TOM JOSCELYN, SENIOR FELLOW AND SENIOR EDITOR OF \"FDD'S LONG WAR JOURNAL\": Well you know, Lara, you know in an earlier segment you were focusing on Sirajuddin Haqqani, and rightfully so. So Sirajuddin Haqqani has been the Deputy Emir of the Taliban since 2015. He is going to be the Interior Minister in the new regime. And I want to put this in context for your viewers tonight a little bit, so Sirajuddin Haqqani's father, Jalaluddin, was Osama bin Laden's first benefactor. He was the first guy who actually protected and sponsored Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and in fact al-Qaeda was incubated in Jalaluddin Haqqani's camps in Eastern Afghanistan. So his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani has carried on the jihad for him, and for the last 20 years, really, Siraj has worked closely with al-Qaeda, so closely that when we went through the files we recovered in Osama bin Laden's compound, those files show that al-Qaeda was working with him on the battlefields in Afghanistan, working with him politically, working with him and his family members for a ransom exchange for an Afghan ambassador that al-Qaeda had taken hostage. Really working with him all the time, and this is something that Siraj has even admitted, and in fact, al-Qaeda has worked so closely with him that when Hamza bin Laden, Osama's son had to be protected from the U.S., it was actually Sirajuddin Haqqani's right hand man, a guy named Qari Zakir who was responsible for protecting Hamza bin Laden. So when we look at the Haqqani's and their senior leadership roles in the Taliban, the question we have to ask ourselves here is, is this really the Taliban or the Haqqani's or are they just part of al-Qaeda? I think there's plenty of evidence showing that they're so intertwined with al-Qaeda that doesn't really make any sense to play disconnect the dots between the two."

Ayman al-Zawahri, Osama bin Laden's successor has called the nucleus of the Caliphate that they imagined that they want to resurrect. You know, Lara, you brought up something that's very important here. Washington's policy here is really morally intellectually, just disgraceful. The idea they're going to try -- that some people -- we don't know if this is the policy yet, but some people want to recognize the Taliban's Islamic Emirate as legitimate, is unbelievably disgraceful. You know just days after they took power in mid-August, okay, and took over most of Afghanistan in mid-August, just days afterwards, they took control of Afghan National Television and they ran a documentary called \"Victorious Force 3.\" In that documentary, they glorified 9/11 on Afghan National TV, so all Afghans who could turn into TV that night saw a documentary not from the perspective of Americans remembering this solemn day and sort of in in a remorseful type of manner, no, it was a glorification of 9/11 and actually blaming America for the attack. They wouldn't blame al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, they said, no, America deserved it and so the idea that the Taliban is our counterterrorism partner, that the Taliban is something that's separate from al-Qaeda or that we can trust to basically keep the terrorists at bay is really ludicrous."

And I just want to say thank you to you, Tom, because nobody has done more on this through all the years with all the lying about al-Qaeda, you have never wavered it from telling the truth. It's greatly appreciated. That's about it for us tonight. Tune in every weeknight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. You can watch my show on FOX Nation right now, it's called \"Lara Logan has No Agenda,\" and while you're on FOX Nation, don't forget to watch the best show on there, Tucker's interview with Rick Santorum on a brand new episode of \"Tucker Carlson Today.\" Tucker will be back hosting the show on Monday.
