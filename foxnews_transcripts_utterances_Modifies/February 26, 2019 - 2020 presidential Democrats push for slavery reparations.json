I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight, what a show we have for you. President Trump is going to be making his first public appearance in Vietnam later in the hour.  Participating in the arrival greeting at the presidential palace, we're going to have live reports for you throughout the show. And ahead of that, we want to hit on some key cultural issues and then sometimes members of the media don't want to touch these, but we will. And these are poised to become flash points in the 2020 election.  The Left's radical turn when it comes to life itself, plus the push to racialize every segment of our cultural, entertainment, political lives. Tonight we're going to be joined by one of the most influential voices in American politics and the culture, Shelby Steele of the Hoover Institution in a rare interview. What does he think of the 2020 Democrat calls for reparations, and his response to the repeated charges that Donald Trump is just a racist. Well, don't miss this.  But first, the Left's dark evangelism, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” With every passing day, the Democratic Party reveals what its true intentions are. Well, they claim to be the party of science and facts. Their advocacy and voting patterns show they're anything but. Yesterday the Senate voted on a bill that would require a doctor to use all of his skills to preserve the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill came in a reaction to grisly macabre efforts in New York, Virginia and elsewhere to essentially legalize infanticide.  Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia, specifically, verbally supported efforts to legalize it, so Trump called him out during the State of the Union.",

In what way is it anti-woman or anti-family to protect the life of that child? It's craziness. Now the President correctly summarized the vote in a pair of tweets yesterday. \"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth. This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress\".  But my friends once a party embraces this nihilism, this this dark religion by treating abortion itself like a sacrament, all reason goes out the window. What happened to safe legal and rare. Their unwavering defense of abortion-on-demand, even if it leads to infanticide, or - well, let's say the embrace of other issues like gender fluidity. Even if that leads to rank unfairness, we're going to get that - get to that issue later on the show.   It akin to a secular Sharia law among the Left. You deviate from what the social justice warriors stipulate today and they'll decapitate you in the workplace and in school if they have their way. These people are fanatics, they're zealots, hell-bent on a complete up ending of the social order and upending of just about everything that embodies or even comes close to embodying tradition.

And notice how Steinem practices the art of self- protection, Hitler just like Planned Parenthood practiced and defended mass extermination, all in the name of racial purity, which is exactly what the founder of Planned Parenthood believed.   Margaret Sanger believed deeply in eugenics. Check out this article from 1926 about Sanger's advocacy for birth control clinics. She said, \"We want a world freer, happier, cleaner. We want a race of thoroughbreds\". It shouldn't surprise you that Sanger established her first full-service clinic in Harlem in 1930. Well, why Harlem? Well as The Washington Times, explains that's where a lot of the black people, she often referred to as human weeds, lived. Sanger described it as an experimental clinic established for the benefit of Colored People. Well, for her, the word benefit really just meant elimination.  And in her infamous letter to Clarence Gamble of Procter & Gamble, it was about the need to use the cover of ministers to set up these clinics. She wrote to him, \"The most successful educational approach to the population it's through a religious appeal.  We don't want the word to get out that we might - want we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it should occur to they're more rebellious members\". Can't believe that was written. The left then and the left today has this insatiable appetite for this death culture, which by the way, reminds me of another baby story.",

Oh, come on, please.  But there is some sunshine and the forecast my friends. A new Marist Poll finds that after a 17 point gap last month, Americans are now just as likely to identify as Pro-Life, as Pro-Choice and Democrats are where the movement is happening.  Last month 20 percent of Democrats claimed to be Pro-Life. This month that number is up to 34 percent, massive increase. And Americans are overwhelmingly believing that third trimester abortions should be outlawed - 71 to 25 percent. The poor people in the 25 percent, but we'll pray for them.  Now the Left blinded by their dogmatic attachment to abortion, can't see that Americans don't want what they're selling. If AOC really wanted to be edgy, she'd couple her love of creation and all things green with a love of life and defending the most defenseless. And that's THE ANGLE. Here in our Dinesh D'Souza, Conservative Author and Filmmaker, and Kelly Hyman a social justice attorney. Dinesh, let's start with you. There's something strange here going on with today's Democrats. Because one of their radical members proposes something, which most people think, it's absolutely insane.  And yet then they all rush in to get behind it and just state it as their actually - their actual opinions. So what's going on here? DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, this may seem like a radical turn in the Democratic Party, but it's actually anchored in the deep history of progressivism and the early 20th century Democrats. Of course, in the early 20th Century, it wasn't abortion. But the two issues that progressives were very fascinated by, one, was forced sterilization and the other was forced euthanasia, basically killing. And Margaret Sanger, for example, was a champion of the sterilization side - forced sterilization, and she was an admirer of the Nazi sterilization program of 1933. Now the Nazi euthanasia program of 1935 was also directly lifted from blueprints supplied by American progressive. So this is the actual deep dark history of the Democratic Party. It's been kind of papered over by progressive historiography, but it's all coming back in a nightmarish fashion.",

I think this is the heart of the debate, because as long as the fetus has considered an extension of the woman's body, the argument is, the woman should have every right to dispose of it as she sees fit.  But the important thing is that even in Roe V. Wade and the early abortion decisions the Supreme Court acknowledged that this issue of viability, the argument shifts the moment that the fetus can live outside a womb. Of course, the fetus is still dependent on the mother, but a two-year-old is also dependent on the mother. So viability was a critical reasoning pivot of the early abortion decisions and it seems like that's gone out the window. And the basic idea now is that even if the fetus is viable outside the womb, if we feel like killing it, we should be able to do that.",

It's kind of unimaginable to me that you would have the hubris to think you could resolve slavery. And I think reparations generally is - that's the problem with this. This holding on to an idea of justice, there's absolutely impossible. Not only is it impossible, but it's self-defeating, because you have to continue to see yourself as a victim, waiting around in life to be resurrected by the beneficence of the larger society - by white guilt. And once again, you put your fate in the hands of other people, rather than yourself.

It's ruinous to your career, to your life.  And so whites then are hungry for a way to prove that they are innocent of racism, that they're not racist. And this is where the trouble begins. We've had 60 years now of the federal government and institutions across society bending over backwards, supposedly dealing with the problem of race and inequality and so forth.

They're going to have about 20 minutes of one on one time, then they're going to open it up to two guests each, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and at the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. That dinner is expected to last for about 90 minutes. So the two sides are really going to have some good time to try to break the ice ahead of those more formal meetings tomorrow. Even though the White House press corps is staying at the same hotel as Kim Jong-un, several members of the White House press corps, I should say, including myself, we don't have any visibility into what his schedule is like today except for that dinner with President Trump tonight. We do now that yesterday he spent the afternoon visiting the North Korean embassy here in Hanoi, but that's about it. As for President Trump, we should see him very soon for the first time. in about 30 minutes he'll be arriving at the presidential palace where he will meet with the president of Vietnam and sign a commercial trade agreement. In a tweet about an hour ago President Trump said \"Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize. The potential is awesome, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history for my friend Kim Jong-un.\" So that is the president's pitch to Kim Jong-un in a nutshell, if you commit to denuclearization, then your country could enjoy the same kind of economic prosperity and growth as another former enemy of the United States, the host country here, Vietnam.

I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight, what a show we have for you. President Trump is going to be making his first public appearance in Vietnam later in the hour. Participating in the arrival greeting at the presidential palace, we're going to have live reports for you throughout the show. And ahead of that, we want to hit on some key cultural issues and then sometimes members of the media don't want to touch these, but we will. And these are poised to become flash points in the 2020 election. The Left's radical turn when it comes to life itself, plus the push to racialize every segment of our cultural, entertainment, political lives. Tonight we're going to be joined by one of the most influential voices in American politics and the culture, Shelby Steele of the Hoover Institution in a rare interview. What does he think of the 2020 Democrat calls for reparations, and his response to the repeated charges that Donald Trump is just a racist. Well, don't miss this. But first, the Left's dark evangelism, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” With every passing day, the Democratic Party reveals what its true intentions are. Well, they claim to be the party of science and facts. Their advocacy and voting patterns show they're anything but. Yesterday the Senate voted on a bill that would require a doctor to use all of his skills to preserve the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion. The bill came in a reaction to grisly macabre efforts in New York, Virginia and elsewhere to essentially legalize infanticide. Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia, specifically, verbally supported efforts to legalize it, so Trump called him out during the State of the Union."

And what Murray didn't mention is that she and her party's opposition to this common-sense bill is itself anti-science. We have a viable child that has been born. In what way is it anti-woman or anti-family to protect the life of that child? It's craziness. Now the President correctly summarized the vote in a pair of tweets yesterday. \"The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth. This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress\". But my friends once a party embraces this nihilism, this this dark religion by treating abortion itself like a sacrament, all reason goes out the window. What happened to safe legal and rare. Their unwavering defense of abortion-on-demand, even if it leads to infanticide, or - well, let's say the embrace of other issues like gender fluidity. Even if that leads to rank unfairness, we're going to get that - get to that issue later on the show. It akin to a secular Sharia law among the Left. You deviate from what the social justice warriors stipulate today and they'll decapitate you in the workplace and in school if they have their way. These people are fanatics, they're zealots, hell-bent on a complete up ending of the social order and upending of just about everything that embodies or even comes close to embodying tradition. Leftist icon, feminist Gloria Steinem was on \"The Today Show\" promoting a book of old essays.

And notice how Steinem practices the art of self- protection, Hitler just like Planned Parenthood practiced and defended mass extermination, all in the name of racial purity, which is exactly what the founder of Planned Parenthood believed. Margaret Sanger believed deeply in eugenics. Check out this article from 1926 about Sanger's advocacy for birth control clinics. She said, \"We want a world freer, happier, cleaner. We want a race of thoroughbreds\". It shouldn't surprise you that Sanger established her first full-service clinic in Harlem in 1930. Well, why Harlem? Well as The Washington Times, explains that's where a lot of the black people, she often referred to as human weeds, lived. Sanger described it as an experimental clinic established for the benefit of Colored People. Well, for her, the word benefit really just meant elimination. And in her infamous letter to Clarence Gamble of Procter & Gamble, it was about the need to use the cover of ministers to set up these clinics. She wrote to him, \"The most successful educational approach to the population it's through a religious appeal. We don't want the word to get out that we might - want we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it should occur to they're more rebellious members\". Can't believe that was written. The left then and the left today has this insatiable appetite for this death culture, which by the way, reminds me of another baby story."

Oh, come on, please. But there is some sunshine and the forecast my friends. A new Marist Poll finds that after a 17 point gap last month, Americans are now just as likely to identify as Pro-Life, as Pro-Choice and Democrats are where the movement is happening. Last month 20 percent of Democrats claimed to be Pro-Life. This month that number is up to 34 percent, massive increase. And Americans are overwhelmingly believing that third trimester abortions should be outlawed - 71 to 25 percent. The poor people in the 25 percent, but we'll pray for them. Now the Left blinded by their dogmatic attachment to abortion, can't see that Americans don't want what they're selling. If AOC really wanted to be edgy, she'd couple her love of creation and all things green with a love of life and defending the most defenseless. And that's THE ANGLE. Here in our Dinesh D'Souza, Conservative Author and Filmmaker, and Kelly Hyman a social justice attorney. Dinesh, let's start with you. There's something strange here going on with today's Democrats. Because one of their radical members proposes something, which most people think, it's absolutely insane. And yet then they all rush in to get behind it and just state it as their actually - their actual opinions. So what's going on here? DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, this may seem like a radical turn in the Democratic Party, but it's actually anchored in the deep history of progressivism and the early 20th century Democrats. Of course, in the early 20th Century, it wasn't abortion. But the two issues that progressives were very fascinated by, one, was forced sterilization and the other was forced euthanasia, basically killing. And Margaret Sanger, for example, was a champion of the sterilization side - forced sterilization, and she was an admirer of the Nazi sterilization program of 1933. Now the Nazi euthanasia program of 1935 was also directly lifted from blueprints supplied by American progressive. So this is the actual deep dark history of the Democratic Party. It's been kind of papered over by progressive historiography, but it's all coming back in a nightmarish fashion."

We're talking about infants who are actually born. And the U.S. Congress can't get itself together to protect an infant that is born alive. Now people think it's unfair, because Mitch McConnell brought that to fore. Well, this is a person and the person is living. And now the Democrat Party has gotten so - it's just - they're just in totally smothered by this abortion deal, that they can't even see the lack of basic humanity in that moment. Now how did we get there and how do we get past this? Because this is - forget whether it's bad for the Democrats. I frankly, don't care whether it's bad for the Democrats. These are people, including girls - little girls, who have very few people to speak for them, that's my concern here. It's not the - teen pregnancies are going down.

I think this is the heart of the debate, because as long as the fetus has considered an extension of the woman's body, the argument is, the woman should have every right to dispose of it as she sees fit. But the important thing is that even in Roe V. Wade and the early abortion decisions the Supreme Court acknowledged that this issue of viability, the argument shifts the moment that the fetus can live outside a womb. Of course, the fetus is still dependent on the mother, but a two-year-old is also dependent on the mother. So viability was a critical reasoning pivot of the early abortion decisions and it seems like that's gone out the window. And the basic idea now is that even if the fetus is viable outside the womb, if we feel like killing it, we should be able to do that."

SHELBY STEELE, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER, SR FELLOW, THE HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I liked the word resolve. It's kind of unimaginable to me that you would have the hubris to think you could resolve slavery. And I think reparations generally is - that's the problem with this. This holding on to an idea of justice, there's absolutely impossible. Not only is it impossible, but it's self-defeating, because you have to continue to see yourself as a victim, waiting around in life to be resurrected by the beneficence of the larger society - by white guilt.

And white guilt is not the feeling of guilt. White guilt is acting guiltily because you are terrorized by being seen as a racist. To be seen as a racist in American life is a terrible thing. It's ruinous to your career, to your life. And so whites then are hungry for a way to prove that they are innocent of racism, that they're not racist. And this is where the trouble begins. We've had 60 years now of the federal government and institutions across society bending over backwards, supposedly dealing with the problem of race and inequality and so forth. And again, whites taking the position, liberalism itself really is a response to our history of evil racism. Liberalism is going to sort of redeem us from that. But the problem with that is that you steal the thunder of the people you are trying to help, you cut them off from the human part of themselves that wants to aspire, that wants to make a life no matter what, the part that is fearless, that wants to engage the world.

What came along is a kind of gift to them was Donald Trump, who could be built up into a huge menace. He is an enemy of civilization itself, and we have to rally against him.

They're going to have about 20 minutes of one on one time, then they're going to open it up to two guests each, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and at the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. That dinner is expected to last for about 90 minutes. So the two sides are really going to have some good time to try to break the ice ahead of those more formal meetings tomorrow. Even though the White House press corps is staying at the same hotel as Kim Jong-un, several members of the White House press corps, I should say, including myself, we don't have any visibility into what his schedule is like today except for that dinner with President Trump tonight. We do now that yesterday he spent the afternoon visiting the North Korean embassy here in Hanoi, but that's about it. As for President Trump, we should see him very soon for the first time. in about 30 minutes he'll be arriving at the presidential palace where he will meet with the president of Vietnam and sign a commercial trade agreement. In a tweet about an hour ago President Trump said \"Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize. The potential is awesome, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history for my friend Kim Jong-un.\" So that is the president's pitch to Kim Jong-un in a nutshell, if you commit to denuclearization, then your country could enjoy the same kind of economic prosperity and growth as another former enemy of the United States, the host country here, Vietnam.

They today identify, they say, as girls. Now, one of the girls participating in that race, Selina Soule, finished in eighth place, missing out on a chance to compete in front of college coaches by just two spots. She said this is about competing versus Miller and Yearwood. And she said \"We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts. It's demoralizing.\" Well, here now herself, Selina Soule. Selina, you go to Glastonbury High School where I went to high school and was a decent athlete myself in the day.

And I was -- I played field hockey, softball, and basketball in Glastonbury High School, and I know how hard it is to compete at that level because they are a really very strong conference. What happens -- forget about people identifying -- what happens to every sport? What happens to field hockey when the soccer players start to play? What happens with girls' basketball? What happens with girls' volleyball? What happens with tennis? Martina Navratilova said basically it's going to completely change competition in an unfair way to girls, and I don't think you can get anyone who is more pro-equality for people identifying as different things, and she is.

Females are around 30 to 35 percent muscle by weight, while males are 40 to 50 percent muscles. Females ligaments are thinner and softer than males. The internal organs of men tend to be bigger, broader, more capable of taking in oxygen, shoulder size -- no matter if you are taking hormones or not taking hormones, the structure of the anatomy is different, period. And you are not going to see a lot of girls winning first, second or third if this continues. However people want to identify, that's fine if they want to do that.

FOX Chief national correspondent Ed Henry is live in Vietnam tonight with a look at what's at stake at this second summit. Ed, are you on a scooter? No, you are sitting and not moving. I love it."

    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Laura, good to see you. You can see the picture screen left where it appears the beginning of President Trump's motorcade is arriving at that presidential palace here in Hanoi. The key is that President Trump will be meeting with President Trong, his counterpart, to sign a trade deal between the U.S. and Vietnam, maybe showing Kim Jong-un the fact that the economy here in Vietnam is very strong, and they have communism mixed with some market reforms, it may be a taste of what he can get if he signs a nuclear pact with President Trump. But later at the main event, this will happen about 7:00 p.m. local time, here, 7:00 a.m. back home where you are. So when you are having breakfast, President Trump will be having dinner with Kim Jong-un at the Metropole hotel. It's a very famous hotel, French Colonial style. Look at that picture on the right. I got this exclusively from a source who is inside the hotel. It appears to be where the leaders will be having dinner. You can see it's very close and intimate, just a few seats, as Kristin Fisher said, and reported earlier, the president, secretary of state, chief of staff, Kim Jong-un and his counterparts. We've got some other photos from inside the hotel, we will be showing them as well, 1:00 a.m. eastern. I'll be reporting all night live. You see the flags being set up at the Metropole hotel. So we have sources inside the summit. They are giving us an inside look. You mentioned the stakes, they are enormous. The president walking into the presidential palace right now as we speak, Laura."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Right now, sorry to interrupt, but he is walking in, and we are watching him now. Again, this is the first time he has walked in formally at the presidential palace. Ed, there are lots of doubters out there about this second summit, saying we didn't get much out of the first summit. There was a lot of hope, but as far as substantial process on denuclearization, other than stopping tests, not much. But these pictures are something. Close it out for us."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "They are. And a lot of naysayers, you're right, think about the A.P. story a few days ago saying a nightmare scenario they said would be the president signing a bad deal. You know what, actually a nightmare scenario would be a nuclear conflict. That's the nightmare scenario. So far because of the president's diplomacy we have avoided that, Laura."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "De-escalation of a very difficult situation. We certainly hope for the best. Thanks for that photo of the taste tester, the food tester there, Ed, testing that food for Kim Jong-un. That's all the time we have tonight.
