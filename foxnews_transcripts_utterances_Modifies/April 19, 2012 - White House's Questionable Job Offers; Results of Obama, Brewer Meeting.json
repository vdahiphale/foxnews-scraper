This, of course, comes after the Joe Sestak scenario, and there are still questions about what was offered specifically and how many times he was talked to about that Senate primary in Pennsylvania, which he is now the nominee.

But Gibbs admitted what the quo was when he said the president has an interest in clearing the field. So clearly the objective was to get him out of the race. That's the quo. And the quid was the three jobs. So I think it's really out there. This is pretty on the line. In the Sestak case I think there is less evidence of bribery, but the real issue there is veracity and lying. The story from Sestak and the White House don't stack up. The statement from the White House lawyer said there were inquiries made over the month of June and July. Sestak said there was one call, under a minute. Well, that doesn't match.  So there are lies here, there is something being covered up. What were the other offers who made them? So I think it is two different cases but each of them looks real bad.

The executive is required under our constitution to execute the laws. We have laws about immigration. The government by its own acknowledgment has failed 10 million times to enforce it since there are that many illegals in the United States.  And now it says we'll only enforce it if we get comprehensive reform, i.e., we are not going to enforce an existing law until we get a change in a law or new law. You can't hold an existing law hostage, the enforcement of an existing law if you are the executive, to a legislative agenda you have. You have to enforce the law. I do not understand how they can say this with a straight face in a constitutional democracy. You have to enforce the law. Secondly, politically, it makes no sense. If you want to get a national consensus on legalization, you will get it only if and when Americans are convinced this is the last cohort of illegals who are going to be legalized, not if the door remains open and you're going to get a flood of new people if you enforce legal immigration.

      "utterance": "It sounds like the meeting was really kind of \"nothing burger,\" if you will. They had some pleasantries. It was cordial. They talked about border security, something they both agree on. Obama apparently pressed for immigration reform, comprehensive reform, and asked Governor Brewer to join with him in tht effort. She obviously cares about shoring up the border first. She made that clear. Did it advance the ball? I don't think so. It didn't appear to. It was more of a meet and greet. We're back to where we are."

That is the fundamental problem with the law is it is discriminatory in effect. That is a pretty stout thing to say, hard to walk back from that. You heard Robert Gibbs say today, the clearest explanation of the president's policy I've heard, to date, saying the governor of Arizona is interested in first securing the border and moving forward from that. The president is interested in comprehensive immigration reform first. His first priority is not securing the borders, which is honest, if nothing else. He won't win a lot of swing voters but maybe it will help his base."

      "utterance": "Right, which makes the show of sending the 1,200 National Guard pure show. Gibbs is honest about this. There is something very odd about this. The executive is required under our constitution to execute the laws. We have laws about immigration. The government by its own acknowledgment has failed 10 million times to enforce it since there are that many illegals in the United States. And now it says we'll only enforce it if we get comprehensive reform, i.e., we are not going to enforce an existing law until we get a change in a law or new law. You can't hold an existing law hostage, the enforcement of an existing law if you are the executive, to a legislative agenda you have. You have to enforce the law. I do not understand how they can say this with a straight face in a constitutional democracy. You have to enforce the law. Secondly, politically, it makes no sense. If you want to get a national consensus on legalization, you will get it only if and when Americans are convinced this is the last cohort of illegals who are going to be legalized, not if the door remains open and you're going to get a flood of new people if you enforce legal immigration. You shut the border, you'll get a majority of Americans who want to have comprehensive legalization."
