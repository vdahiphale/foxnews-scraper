And this is \"Your World.\"  This is what it looks like in parts of Ohio right now, after multiple twisters strike the Midwest. Here's the very latest we have for you. Rescue workers are going door to door right now searching for survivors throughout the Dayton, Ohio, area. At least one person in nearby Toledo, Ohio, has been killed.  Power companies scrambling to restore electricity to more than five million people across the state without it. We're about to get an update from the mayor of Dayton on all of it.  Then there's the flooding, a lot of flooding, so bad in parts of Oklahoma and Arkansas, that evacuations are under way. And so is our coverage with Mike Tobin on the cleanup that is just beginning, Adam Klotz, on where the next set of storms is heading, and Matt Finn in flood-ravaged Arkansas, where the rain is coming.  First to Mike in Harrison Township, Ohio. Hey, Mike.",

The National Weather Service now confirms that at least two of the tornadoes that touched down here in the Dayton area reached a 3 out of 5 on the enhanced Fujita scale, so very significant tornadoes that have been touching down around here. And you had more than 50 that popped up in this line of storms that formed up around the nation's midsection. So it just stands to reason that some of them are going to hit population centers or residential areas like Harrison Township here, when we look around and we can see so much of this destruction. Now, the people in this area heard the warnings, they took them seriously. They got into their basements or they got to the center of the house. Now what they are doing, they luckily, because they heeded the warnings, they survived.   Now what we're seeing in these areas are people who have friends and family that are coming out here. They're coming out with tarp, with particle board to bolt up the windows, get tarps up over the roof, minimize the damage, get the belongings that they can salvage out to safety. And they're all very thankful that they made it through this one -- Neil.",

So this is the line we're talking about really just now beginning able to form.  A couple of spots to really pay attention to, even moving a little farther east, so areas all around Pennsylvania. That is a tornado watch in place. That means the ingredients are there. Every one of these pink boxes, that's a tornado warning storm. So we already begin to see those pop up this afternoon. It will only intensify as we get a little bit later in the day. Everything in the yellow highlighted box across Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, that is a thunderstorm watch, which means the ingredients are there to see 60 mile-an-hour winds, hail, very heavy rain. That's going to continue to be an issue. And then we stretch even farther west and everything again in the red, those are tornado watches. It is a large system that could produce a lot of storms from now overnight, really highlighting an area for tornadoes would be cross portions of Missouri and a little farther off Kansas.   This is a spot to pay attention to where we could see some big tornadoes here over the next several hours into tomorrow morning. Unfortunately, the setup for severe weather again looks very similar for tomorrow.  This is from the National Weather Service. It's a place to watch, severe weather again tomorrow. You don't see a whole lot of movement there. So we are stuck in this pattern where the same places are getting heavy rain, getting those tornadoes. And then that's, of course, been causing a lot of this flooding. These are the rainfall totals over the last week, widespread, five to 10 inches. And when you see that much rain, Neil, no surprise here, even with rain getting up into Illinois -- or -- excuse me -- Iowa, all of that has to funnel its way south.  The rivers are going to continue to rise, as we deal with this over the next week and even longer.",

It took the pump stations, because we have no electricity. So we have been working to get our water back online. We're on a boil advisory for about 400,000 residents right now.   So even if you didn't have some of the devastation here, you're still not having water that you can consume. So we're in the process of working that back with the EPA.

And it's a classic setup, and you could see it coming a couple of weeks, two, three weeks ago, this pattern setting up. May is the tornado month. It's sort of like September and the hurricane season is the highlight of the hurricane season.  And the reason that happens is, the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere are still cold enough, so that you get these clashes going on. Generally, when Mays are very warm, like last year -- let's remember last year. I believe there were less than 100 tornadoes the entire month of May. Last year was one of the lowest tornado totals on record. This is much more like 2008 and 2011. And it was the same story, a lot of cold air around, relative to averages, enough warm air around to fight. And that's what you have got going on. This is going to last another three days, Neil, and then we're going to turn it around. You folks out in the West and the Northern Plains,you have been so very, very cold. There has been no spring to speak of. That's going all turn around. You're going to have some summer develop in there. The cool air is going to push off to the east and southeast.

And what happens is, the atmosphere -- and no one wants to talk about how brutally cold it's been in the West. The strength of the cold in the West has been stronger than the strength of the warmth in the Southeastern part of the United States.

He told the judge on each of the counts, he wasn't just not guilty, but 100 percent not guilty. He just pleaded not guilty on the charges that he tried to shake down Nike for up to $25 million, threatening to release damaging information ahead of Nike's quarterly earnings call and the start of the NCAA men's college basketball tournament. Prosecutors say he told the company's lawyers he wasn't messing around and if they didn't pay up, he would take $10 billion off Nike's market cap. Then, earlier today, in his first appearance, he pleaded not guilty in a kind of robbing Peter to Pay Paul scheme involving adult actress Stormy Daniels, where prosecutors say he took the money that was supposed to go to Daniels for her book deal, spent it, and then hounded the publisher for the next payment to reimburse what he had taken. Avenatti is accused of taking about $300,000 of Daniels' money by having the payment sent into his account, even faking her signature and then spending it on lavish things like Ferrari payments, hotels, restaurants, even payroll checks to employees at his coffee company and law firm. In all, he's accused of taking about $300,000. Avenatti has maintained that he is innocent and even said he wants the investigators investigated, in this tweet saying: \"I have trust in the system that I have devoted nearly 20 years of my professional life to. I'm confident that I will be fully exonerated by a jury once all relevant evidence and documents are presented. And I look forward to a full inquiry into the motivations behind the charges.\" These cases from today in New York carry a maximum possible sentence of 69 years in prison. But don't forget he's also facing some other charges in California that carry additional time, alleged crimes such as stealing from other clients and tax fraud.  So, in total, he's facing 404 possible years in prison. And, of course, as you just saw, he is pleading not guilty to all of it -- Neil.",

This is a mistake, because, if you put yourself in Kim's position, you see how the United States has broken previous agreements that were made. You look at what happened to Gadhafi in Libya, where Gadhafi was promised, hey, if you get rid of your nuclear weapons program, we're not going to come after you. Well, the United States went after him, toppled Gadhafi. Kim looks at the Iran nuclear deal that was made to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. President Trump came in and made a decision to tear that agreement up. So, if you're in Kim's position, you're wondering, why should I step into making an agreement to get rid of nuclear weapons, when I don't know if this president or a future president is going to decide to go back on that agreement, wage a regime change war, or do something else. So this is the problem with President Trump's kind of shoot-from-the-hip, unpredictable foreign policy. It's shortsighted.

And you had more than 50 that popped up in this line of storms that formed up around the nation's midsection. So it just stands to reason that some of them are going to hit population centers or residential areas like Harrison Township here, when we look around and we can see so much of this destruction. Now, the people in this area heard the warnings, they took them seriously. They got into their basements or they got to the center of the house. Now what they are doing, they luckily, because they heeded the warnings, they survived. Now what we're seeing in these areas are people who have friends and family that are coming out here. They're coming out with tarp, with particle board to bolt up the windows, get tarps up over the roof, minimize the damage, get the belongings that they can salvage out to safety.

So this is the line we're talking about really just now beginning able to form. A couple of spots to really pay attention to, even moving a little farther east, so areas all around Pennsylvania. That is a tornado watch in place. That means the ingredients are there. Every one of these pink boxes, that's a tornado warning storm. So we already begin to see those pop up this afternoon. It will only intensify as we get a little bit later in the day. Everything in the yellow highlighted box across Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, that is a thunderstorm watch, which means the ingredients are there to see 60 mile-an-hour winds, hail, very heavy rain. That's going to continue to be an issue. And then we stretch even farther west and everything again in the red, those are tornado watches. It is a large system that could produce a lot of storms from now overnight, really highlighting an area for tornadoes would be cross portions of Missouri and a little farther off Kansas. This is a spot to pay attention to where we could see some big tornadoes here over the next several hours into tomorrow morning. Unfortunately, the setup for severe weather again looks very similar for tomorrow. This is from the National Weather Service. It's a place to watch, severe weather again tomorrow. You don't see a whole lot of movement there. So we are stuck in this pattern where the same places are getting heavy rain, getting those tornadoes. And then that's, of course, been causing a lot of this flooding. These are the rainfall totals over the last week, widespread, five to 10 inches. And when you see that much rain, Neil, no surprise here, even with rain getting up into Illinois -- or -- excuse me -- Iowa, all of that has to funnel its way south. The rivers are going to continue to rise, as we deal with this over the next week and even longer."

It took the pump stations, because we have no electricity. So we have been working to get our water back online. We're on a boil advisory for about 400,000 residents right now. So even if you didn't have some of the devastation here, you're still not having water that you can consume. So we're in the process of working that back with the EPA. Again, we have gotten electricity back to them. So those kind of things that you think of every day, it's definitely water, electricity and gas that have affected people's lives here.

      "utterance": "Thank you very, very much. All right, let's get a read on all this and why it keeps happening with WeatherBELL chief meteorologist Joe Bastardi. Joe, I was reading one report that said, in the last 30-some-odd days, we have had more than 500 tornadoes. Now, obviously, they can be of all sizes. The more severe ones get the attention. But what is going on?"

      "speaker": "JOE BASTARDI, WEATHERBELL CHIEF FORECASTER",
      "utterance": "Well, we have had a persistent pattern of unseasonably cold air in the Western and Northern United States and the heat in the Southeast. And it's a classic setup, and you could see it coming a couple of weeks, two, three weeks ago, this pattern setting up. May is the tornado month. It's sort of like September and the hurricane season is the highlight of the hurricane season. And the reason that happens is, the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere are still cold enough, so that you get these clashes going on. Generally, when Mays are very warm, like last year -- let's remember last year. I believe there were less than 100 tornadoes the entire month of May. Last year was one of the lowest tornado totals on record. This is much more like 2008 and 2011. And it was the same story, a lot of cold air around, relative to averages, enough warm air around to fight. And that's what you have got going on. This is going to last another three days, Neil, and then we're going to turn it around. You folks out in the West and the Northern Plains,you have been so very, very cold. There has been no spring to speak of. That's going all turn around. You're going to have some summer develop in there. The cool air is going to push off to the east and southeast. And you will probably find that June is near to below normal tornado activity and certainly a lot less active than May."

It was between 95 and 100 in Southeast Pennsylvania Easter Sunday, 1976. You look at the great May 77 heat wave or July '66 heat way. You see these things go on. And what happens is, the atmosphere -- and no one wants to talk about how brutally cold it's been in the West. The strength of the cold in the West has been stronger than the strength of the warmth in the Southeastern part of the United States. But you got to remember, when you have these real high normal temperatures, like the normal high in Columbia is 86 right now, Columbia, South Carolina. It's tougher to get it spread -- spread far enough away."

A yield on a 10-year Treasury note, which a lot of mortgages, refinancing, equity loans and the like are pegged to, down to 2.27 percent, the lowest in almost two years. And that has a lot of firms, Morgan Stanley among them, saying, it keeps up like this, we could be on a recession watch. They're often wrong. And then these turns and twists are standard fare, watching the markets. But those low interest rates, a lot of people like to believe were going to provide a floor for this market. Also want to update you on the Avenatti -- the Michael Avenatti arraignment. He was just coming out of the courthouse a little while ago. This was on separate charges to extort $20 million from Nike. But among the quick and interesting comments he made is that he is blaming this against -- life against the ultimate Goliath, the Trump administration.

He told the judge on each of the counts, he wasn't just not guilty, but 100 percent not guilty. He just pleaded not guilty on the charges that he tried to shake down Nike for up to $25 million, threatening to release damaging information ahead of Nike's quarterly earnings call and the start of the NCAA men's college basketball tournament. Prosecutors say he told the company's lawyers he wasn't messing around and if they didn't pay up, he would take $10 billion off Nike's market cap. Then, earlier today, in his first appearance, he pleaded not guilty in a kind of robbing Peter to Pay Paul scheme involving adult actress Stormy Daniels, where prosecutors say he took the money that was supposed to go to Daniels for her book deal, spent it, and then hounded the publisher for the next payment to reimburse what he had taken. Avenatti is accused of taking about $300,000 of Daniels' money by having the payment sent into his account, even faking her signature and then spending it on lavish things like Ferrari payments, hotels, restaurants, even payroll checks to employees at his coffee company and law firm. In all, he's accused of taking about $300,000."

But don't forget he's also facing some other charges in California that carry additional time, alleged crimes such as stealing from other clients and tax fraud. So, in total, he's facing 404 possible years in prison. And, of course, as you just saw, he is pleading not guilty to all of it -- Neil."

But, to your point, I know innocent until proven guilty, but they wouldn't willy-nilly make a case without having a lot of stuff to make that case. What do you think?"

That's something where it looks as though the prosecutors have fairly ably documented the payments that were coming in, the payments that were going out, the payments Avenatti said he hadn't received, what he was using the money for. And so it seems as though they have done their homework and put together a fairly compelling case that Avenatti was ripping off Stormy Daniels. Of course, Avenatti hasn't yet had his day in court. He may well have a defense. I think we got a preview of where he's going with his defense today when he blamed the president and other political actors for his troubles. But at some point, there will be a day of reckoning for Michael Avenatti."

I mean, that's pretty easy to follow, right?"

      "speaker": "DUPREE",

I mean, certainly, when you have a situation where a lawyer is getting a payment intended for a client, it really should go without saying that the lawyer doesn't or cannot spend that money on, say, a Ferrari payment, for example.

We saw when he entered the political fray at various points in the last year or so he had no hesitation about attacking his opponents very aggressively, making claims that often could not be substantiated, and really skirting close to the line. You may remember how he made a fairly dramatic appearance in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, of all things, which I think even many liberals said was just a bridge too far."

Every single day that goes by is a day that North Korea can continue to try to strengthen their nuclear capabilities. So I think President Trump is making a big mistake here in thinking that his own personal charm or his relationship or friendship with Kim Jong-un is going to be enough to make a deal that will achieve our objective of ultimately denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. This is a mistake, because, if you put yourself in Kim's position, you see how the United States has broken previous agreements that were made. You look at what happened to Gadhafi in Libya, where Gadhafi was promised, hey, if you get rid of your nuclear weapons program, we're not going to come after you. Well, the United States went after him, toppled Gadhafi. Kim looks at the Iran nuclear deal that was made to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. President Trump came in and made a decision to tear that agreement up. So, if you're in Kim's position, you're wondering, why should I step into making an agreement to get rid of nuclear weapons, when I don't know if this president or a future president is going to decide to go back on that agreement, wage a regime change war, or do something else. So this is the problem with President Trump's kind of shoot-from-the-hip, unpredictable foreign policy. It's shortsighted. It undermines our national security, and it makes the American people less safe."

This is something that our -- our families and constituents and people in Hawaii had a huge wakeup call to over a year ago, when we got that message that went across over a million people's cell phones, saying, seek shelter immediately, missile incoming, this is not a drill. So, people were running. They were terrified, looking, where can we find shelter? And the insanity is, there is no shelter. So, yes, you have people from both political parties, people here in Washington, who are ratcheting up tensions between the United States and nuclear-armed countries, like Russia and China, pushing us closer and closer to a nuclear war as the inevitable outcome, if we continue down this path. Yet they're not providing shelter for people, if that -- if that outcome occurs. And that's why I'm speaking out so strongly, speaking to voters across this country. As president and commander in chief, I will work to end this new cold war and nuclear arms race, de-escalate these tensions, and walk us back away from this brink of nuclear catastrophe that will devastate, not only our entire country.

You could make a very good argument, since we blame presidents when the economy or the markets are doing horribly, we might as well credit them when they do well. They have done very, very well among all key demographics, many of them, of course, key Democratic demographics. Unemployment is at record lows. Job surges are now picking up. Employment, which used to be stuck with average wage increases around 2.82 to 2.9 percent, handily about 3.2 percent. How long that lasts is anyone's guess. But the trend is his friend.

But, look, like you, I'm kind of stunned that, with things going as well as they are now, that he's not up by 10 points. But my party has got to bring -- as Gianno just correctly pointed out, we have got to bring strong policy messages here about what we actually bring to the table as an alternative.

I'm wondering, what Democrat do you see out there that's finding a way to do that in this economy?"

      "utterance": "Right. Well, I haven't, Neil. And I wrote a piece about this a few weeks ago, saying the Democrats had no answer for a strong Trump economy, and they had no way to leverage his extreme vulnerability on trade, because they're protectionists, just like Donald Trump. So they have lost the ability to talk to the farmers who are flooded, who are suffering long-term damage, perhaps fatal to their professional viability, because of the Trump trade war. So they are sort of mute on this issue, Biden being the most pro-trade of all of them, but afraid to catch heat from his left flank. He stays silent on that. When pressed recently, he's defended his vote for NAFTA. But he's not talking about the damage that President Trump's trade war is doing. So I do think -- there was a piece in New York Times recently that Youngstown, Ohio, is not doing any better, but they're still with Trump. So there's a case where the economy won't -- won't really help him, but these voters are with him anyway. You will see a lot of anecdotes about the midterm elections in 2018, where -- and polls like Quinnipiac out of Pennsylvania two weeks ago, where 54 percent of the state says the economy is terrific, 54 percent of the state says they're not voting for Trump again. So you can see these examples where it's not going to help."

Those farmers, they know a lot about trade, OK? And they don't need to be talked down to by President Trump saying that the Chinese are paying the tariffs. They know exactly who's paying the tariffs. They know that the Chinese used to buy half of our soybeans, and now the Brazilians are buying -- or the Chinese are buying Brazilian soybeans."

So, yes, when thinking about that, I do find that to be fairly interesting. A lot of people can point to President Trump's behavior. If you look at my home state of Illinois, in the last midterms, the reason why a lot of Republicans lost seats, either there or Orange County, was because of suburban moms who viewed his behavior on Twitter or his language as deplorable."

If you look at the settlement, the $275 million in cash that Purdue pharmaceutical, the manufacturer, the principal manufacturer of these opioids, paid to the state in order to avoid a trial, in order to avoid the wrath of a jury -- by the way, this J&J case is non-jury.

So I don't know where that's going to go. But I will tell you an interesting story. When he was the chief justice of the United States, Bill Rehnquist was stopped for DWI in Virginia on the way home from the Supreme Court. He wasn't drunk. He had had a back problem. And he overtook the opioid medication. And it gave every indication of being drunk, but there was no alcohol involved. So, they may very well argue, you made this so addictive, that patients can't resist waiting the four- or six- or 12-hour time period that the bottle says on it, that they just naturally want to take these things like they're candy. That's probably what they're going to say. Response? We didn't make it any more addictive than the Food and Drug Administration permitted us to."

It looks like a river. And it is in fact Riverside Drive, normally would have cars on it, traffic, people riding their bikes. It is now full of water from the overspilling Arkansas River. Over in West Tulsa, that's where we're seeing a lot of the evacuations. But the main concern at the moment are the levees. They're 70 years old, and officials say they are holding strong at the moment. But there are some spots where there are some seepage from all that floodwater.
