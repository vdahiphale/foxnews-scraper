We're keeping an eye on that. This is an important development for the markets as well today, because there was a startling turnaround on Wall Street on the notion that maybe a debt ceiling problem what would make a lot of people feel very sick might be resolved right now. It kind of pushes the can down the road for another couple of months. We have to live on a very strict diet of $480 billion in spending for the next couple of months, as we work out those details. We will get to the details on all of that with Chad Pergram and get a read on the implications of all of this shortly. But for the corner and wall and broad, this was a welcome development.

So you saw Wall Street ripping higher when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that they had a deal. And now we are on track for a winning week, Neil, despite the big sell-off that we started with on Monday. Stock markets have now been up three straight days. And that's the S&P 500's biggest three-day rally that we have seen in three months. So, yes, it's just short-term debt limit extension to December the 3rd, which lifts the debt ceiling by that skinny $480 billion that you mentioned. Still good enough for stock markets, which are sweating the days, pushing closer to that October 18 deadline, when the U.S. would run out of cash, threatening an historic and catastrophic debt default. So, the deal lifted most sectors of the market from technology to more industrial stocks, like carmakers GM and Ford. And it was interesting that stocks rallied, despite oil prices going up again closer to those seven- year highs and the 10 year Treasury yield also hitting its highest since June at 1.57 percent. Because, as you know, stocks usually go down when that happens, when investors start selling stocks in order to chase that guaranteed money, more guaranteed money on government bonds. But there was also some good news on the economy and the jobs front, so weekly jobless claims this morning falling the most in three weeks, down to 326,000, and combining the better jobless claims now to that private payrolls report that we had earlier this week. Neil, we're looking at a pretty solid September jobs report tomorrow. Economists are forecasting 500,000 new jobs. And the jobless rate should come down a little bit to 5.1 percent. All right, we will watch it closely, Susan Li following all those developments. In the meantime, here, you do begin to wonder, are the markets getting ahead of themselves? After all, this just sort of puts this off for another couple of months. And that that's assuming that everyone OKs the whole thing. Chad Pergram following that.

McConnell was saying, no, you guys have to do this on your own. Reconciliation literally exists for this purpose of moving forward the debt ceiling. Republicans, you have to cater to your base. So people do need to project some performative dismay what McConnell is doing. But the truth is, when you have the CEO of Raytheon and Nasdaq in the White House explaining how dire the situation is, McConnell knows that, even though it would probably harm Democrats more than Republicans if we did hit that crucial crisis of hitting that fiscal cliff, that it would still be devastating to ordinary Americans, right, and effectively create a constitutional crisis by forcing the Treasury to decide who gets the funds allocated by Congress, which has the power of the purse. So, I mean, quite frankly, McConnell knows what he's doing. He knows that this is a short-term allowance. And, quite frankly, Dems right now are in a circular firing squad. He is not interrupting the enemy while they are attacking themselves.",

It's too much money chasing too few of goods. We definitely have too few of goods. I mean, that that's evident everywhere around the country today. But the wage thing, the too much money chasing those goods, may or may not be really the case here. So I think, until that pans out to where we have both sides of those things fighting it out, I think -- that's why I still think Jay Powell has it right. I think a lot of this stuff is transitory. It's probably lasting a little bit longer than a lot of folks predicted, but we're going to start to see - - we get a jobs number tomorrow.

There really isn't a sphere of life that hasn't been touched by this pandemic. And we're now over 20 months into it. We have administered over six billion doses of vaccine worldwide. That's nearly half of all humanity. These vaccines really have been proven to be safe. They have been very effective at preventing serious illness and death from COVID. And the FDA has fully approved one. So whatever people are waiting for to convince them to take a shot, I do think that time has passed. And I think for health care workers to be enduring this volume of sick patients is really unsafe and unreal for us. Vaccination really is our most powerful tool to control this pandemic, and, in addition to the use of non pharmaceutical interventions, we can return to a largely normal life. But it's going to take an immense effort. It's going to take everyone pitching in when they can. And asking people to take a very simple step that also truly confers amazing protection to themselves, in addition to the rest of society, is certainly reasonable. I think it would be preferable for people to take the vaccine without being compelled by mandates, but we face an ongoing, unprecedented public health emergency.

Of course, it comes at a time when, for seven days running now, we have had a steady decline in hospitalizations and deaths. The trend, the president will say, is our friend. We're keeping an eye on that. This is an important development for the markets as well today, because there was a startling turnaround on Wall Street on the notion that maybe a debt ceiling problem what would make a lot of people feel very sick might be resolved right now. It kind of pushes the can down the road for another couple of months. We have to live on a very strict diet of $480 billion in spending for the next couple of months, as we work out those details. We will get to the details on all of that with Chad Pergram and get a read on the implications of all of this shortly. But for the corner and wall and broad, this was a welcome development.

      "utterance": "That's right, so relief that the debt limit was extended, yes, even if it's just for a few more weeks, but that puts off a possible government debt default for at least a few more months. So you saw Wall Street ripping higher when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that they had a deal. And now we are on track for a winning week, Neil, despite the big sell-off that we started with on Monday. Stock markets have now been up three straight days. And that's the S&P 500's biggest three-day rally that we have seen in three months. So, yes, it's just short-term debt limit extension to December the 3rd, which lifts the debt ceiling by that skinny $480 billion that you mentioned. Still good enough for stock markets, which are sweating the days, pushing closer to that October 18 deadline, when the U.S. would run out of cash, threatening an historic and catastrophic debt default. So, the deal lifted most sectors of the market from technology to more industrial stocks, like carmakers GM and Ford. And it was interesting that stocks rallied, despite oil prices going up again closer to those seven- year highs and the 10 year Treasury yield also hitting its highest since June at 1.57 percent. Because, as you know, stocks usually go down when that happens, when investors start selling stocks in order to chase that guaranteed money, more guaranteed money on government bonds. But there was also some good news on the economy and the jobs front, so weekly jobless claims this morning falling the most in three weeks, down to 326,000, and combining the better jobless claims now to that private payrolls report that we had earlier this week. Neil, we're looking at a pretty solid September jobs report tomorrow. Economists are forecasting 500,000 new jobs. And the jobless rate should come down a little bit to 5.1 percent. All right, we will watch it closely, Susan Li following all those developments. In the meantime, here, you do begin to wonder, are the markets getting ahead of themselves? After all, this just sort of puts this off for another couple of months. And that that's assuming that everyone OKs the whole thing. Chad Pergram following that.

In this particular development here on the whole debt ceiling thing, fellow Republicans, as you saw there, concerned that he blinked. Let's go to Tiana Lowe, the Washington Examiner reporter extraordinaire. Tiana, what do you make of the role that Mitch McConnell played here? Some are welcoming just moving the ball forward. Other Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, said he made a bad move. What's the fallout?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIANA LOWE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "So, McConnell has always been playing the long game. I think that Democrats gravely miscalculated when they thought that he was going to fold two months ago. McConnell was saying, no, you guys have to do this on your own. Reconciliation literally exists for this purpose of moving forward the debt ceiling. Republicans, you have to cater to your base. So people do need to project some performative dismay what McConnell is doing. But the truth is, when you have the CEO of Raytheon and Nasdaq in the White House explaining how dire the situation is, McConnell knows that, even though it would probably harm Democrats more than Republicans if we did hit that crucial crisis of hitting that fiscal cliff, that it would still be devastating to ordinary Americans, right, and effectively create a constitutional crisis by forcing the Treasury to decide who gets the funds allocated by Congress, which has the power of the purse. So, I mean, quite frankly, McConnell knows what he's doing. He knows that this is a short-term allowance. And, quite frankly, Dems right now are in a circular firing squad. He is not interrupting the enemy while they are attacking themselves."
    },
    {

And on top of that, you do have Lloyd Austin warning that, if we did pass that debt ceiling crisis, that he wouldn't be able to pay service members. We do not know how the Treasury would choose to allocate funds. And so McConnell is trying to put Democrats in the hard place, which is either use their one of three reconciliation attempts to raise the debt ceiling or do the short-term business. And the fact is, if he thinks that he has enough to go through just for the short-term increase, that's not giving Democrats a lot of lateral space. They're still fighting about things as basic as the Hyde Amendment."

That used to be the entire budget not too many years ago of the United States government. That's our strict allowance Don't spend a penny over the next two months, $480 billion. By the way, we are still trying to, with this increase in the debt ceiling, to deal with this for the time being. Our debt is still rapidly closing on overall debt an $30 trillion.

I think it basically pans itself out in wage inflation, because our good buddy Milton Friedman, who, yes, I have read about, didn't actually get a chance to meet him, which was the old talk of saying inflation is basically a monetary phenomenon. It's too much money chasing too few of goods. We definitely have too few of goods. I mean, that that's evident everywhere around the country today. But the wage thing, the too much money chasing those goods, may or may not be really the case here. So I think, until that pans out to where we have both sides of those things fighting it out, I think -- that's why I still think Jay Powell has it right. I think a lot of this stuff is transitory. It's probably lasting a little bit longer than a lot of folks predicted, but we're going to start to see - - we get a jobs number tomorrow.

If you think that will not happen again, then you may not be anywhere near smart enough to be running this country. And that's what really -- it doesn't just irritate me. It's a scary thought that this administration didn't recognize what they were doing. They were allowing Russia to come back in and put a stranglehold on Europe. Look at the polls. The polls have understood this for a long time. A year ago today I was in -- excuse me -- I think, four years ago today, I was in Latvia doing an event there with the leadership of Europe talking about how to bring more American liquefied natural gas into that market, so that they would not be held hostage by the Russians. And in nine months, this administration has completely turned all of that great and good economic and national security policy around. The -- President Trump understood this, is, you bring American energy into Europe, and they will not be held hostage by the Russians."

Federal health officials could give the green lights for these kids, these younger kids, to get their shots by the end of October. Neil, COVID is still a significant risk, even for children. And we have seen tremendous rises in the burden of disease due to the Delta variant and large numbers of deaths and hospitalizations in kids. In a typical year, just for context, we document about 200 pediatric flu deaths, usually a bit less. Since the start of the pandemic, nearly 600 American children are documented to have died from COVID. So, this readily makes COVID a leading cause of death in children. So, vaccinating kids is going to help make schools safer as well. The FDA is going to be reviewing a whole lot of data over the next few weeks, looking at it very, very carefully, and then make a decision on the next steps."

As a doctor, how do you feel about that?"

      "speaker": "UNGERLEIDER",

There really isn't a sphere of life that hasn't been touched by this pandemic. And we're now over 20 months into it. We have administered over six billion doses of vaccine worldwide. That's nearly half of all humanity. These vaccines really have been proven to be safe. They have been very effective at preventing serious illness and death from COVID. And the FDA has fully approved one. So whatever people are waiting for to convince them to take a shot, I do think that time has passed. And I think for health care workers to be enduring this volume of sick patients is really unsafe and unreal for us. Vaccination really is our most powerful tool to control this pandemic, and, in addition to the use of non pharmaceutical interventions, we can return to a largely normal life. But it's going to take an immense effort. It's going to take everyone pitching in when they can. And asking people to take a very simple step that also truly confers amazing protection to themselves, in addition to the rest of society, is certainly reasonable. I think it would be preferable for people to take the vaccine without being compelled by mandates, but we face an ongoing, unprecedented public health emergency. And for our vaccine uptake in this country to be where it is, is hugely problematic."
