Hillary Clinton rigged the primary election against Bernie Sanders. She stole it from him. President Trump was right all along. Also tonight, Hillary Clinton is now defending this discredited, phony, anti-Trump dossier. The real Russia collusion that happened in last year's campaign, and we have all the details.  And also breaking tonight, exclusive here on \"Hannity,\" The Hill's John Solomon has a shocking report on the Uranium One scandal despite assurances that no nuclear fuel would leave the United States. Guess what? Well memos now show that American uranium did get exported out of this country. We will detail all of the painful steps that the Obama administration took to allow this and cover it up.  That is all coming up in tonight's breaking news, opening monologue.  All right. Our big story tonight, the former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile is now saying that she has the smoking gun evidence that Hillary Clinton rigged the DNC in order to keep socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, from winning the Democratic primary. Donna Brazile is making the revelations in her new book which will be out next week. This is massive. Now, keep in mind, this is something that President Trump, he has been saying for months. You may remember this.",

She hadn't been very interested in controlling the party -- she let Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn do as it so desired. She didn't have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I had been trying to uncover for the last few weeks. By September 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.\" Wow! That is powerful. And this shows just how low the Clintons will go to get what they want.

      "sentences": "Rigged and stolen election primary. Earlier today, Wasserman Schultz gave a statement to the Fox News Channel that completely avoided the topic at hand. It reads this in part. \"With Donald Trump in the White House, Democrats must stay focused on acting a progressive agenda to protect our citizens, our values and our democracy and remain united towards our goal of electing Democratic congressional majorities in 2018.\"  OK. That is not a denial of anything. But it is a clear example of just what Senator Bernie Sanders was up against in the 2016 Democratic primary. I had said it many times.  Now just moments ago, the President, Donald Trump, he tweeted, \"Donna Brazile just stated the DNC rigged the system to illegally steal the primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by crooked Hillary. This is real collusion, and dishonesty. Major violation of campaign finance laws, and money laundering, where is our Justice Department?\" Great questions. Now, this Clinton crime family, because that's what they really are and their political machine, was willing to put all ethics aside, do nothing, anything, everything they could do to mow down the one man, anybody, that stood in their way.  Now stop and think about this for a minute. Could you just imagine if today it was just revealed President Trump, if he was accused and there was evidence that he rigged the RNC in the primary in his favor to help him and steal an election. Could you imagine the outrage from the alt-left mainstream media? There would be calls for investigations into this all day. But today, because this is a bad story for Democrats, your media, which is so corrupt, they are barely covering it.   This is a breathtaking moment. Hillary Clinton -- she's a former secretary of state, former first lady of our country, the former senator, former first lady of Arkansas -- rigged and stole a primary election. Just look at Clinton right there at the Democratic National Convention. She stole those moments. Think about that for a minute. What is the most basic things you teach your children in life? Let's see. You need to be fair, honest, trustworthy, you should not lie, and you should not cheat, and should not steal. When it comes to Hillary Clinton, she did not embody one of those principles, and approves nothing was going to stop Hillary Clinton's blind ambition. Now, when it comes to emails, after they were subpoenaed -- if we had subpoenaed emails, we'd have to turned them over. She did not want you to see them. What did she do? Oh, she deleted them, acid washed them. She used bleach, smashed devices with hammers.  When it comes to Hillary Clinton, there's zero stopping this woman. No law, no subpoena, no warrant, no ethics guide this woman's life. This is by far the worst thing -- and I covered the Clintons for years -- they have ever done. Hillary Clinton accuses President Trump of collusion, and she stole, bought, and paid for the fake anti-Trump dossier? And it doesn't matter in the process? She sold our security out in this country, Uranium One.  We are talking about the most unethical person I've ever seen in my entire life. And by the way, Bernie Sanders, he never stood a shot. And speaking to you, Bernie, you should be ashamed of yourself. You knew. You knew, you were told there was evidence that that primary was stolen. And you ended up supporting her anyway? You said nothing? This woman had zero ethics. Bernie Sanders would have literally elected a person, and he covered for a person, who stole the election with him. Apparently he was OK with that. I don't know what's wrong with you, Bernie.   After all of you that voted tonight, for Hillary Clinton, this is the person that you wanted to be your president. This disgrace will follow her the rest of her life. Also tonight, while Hillary Clinton was apparently running the DNC, she was in charge of it, she was also using their funds to pay a former foreign spy to make up those salacious, untrue, accusations in the dossier about President Trump, then-candidate Trump.  Now, Hillary Clinton has broken her silence on the dossier, finally, the one she helped fund that she was running through a law firm. Here's what she told \"The Daily Show's\" Trevor Noah last night.",

      "sentences": "Beyond a disgrace. That was all designed to manipulate the American people. The president is right. Crooked Hillary Clinton was caught in the act using a foreign source to influence the election, steal the election, again. If you need any more evidence that Hillary Clinton was willing to do anything and everything to win the 2016 election, you need to look no further than that dossier. Now remember, that was full of lies, propaganda, salacious details. She lost miserably in the election, and now America is really, truly getting to know the dark, ruthless side of Hillary Clinton. Now, we will going to get to back to that in just a few minutes. But first, we have another story almost too shocking to believe. Twitter's lawyer admitted earlier today, this week, to lawmakers, that the social media giant -- you know, Twitter, we all use Twitter -- that they literally hid tweets and hashtags that were connected to the DNC and John Podesta's emails.   Now, in his prepared testimony before the Senate subcommittee on crime and terrorism, Twitter's acting general counsel acknowledged Twitter hid over 60 tweets with #DNCleak and hid another 106,000 tweets with #Podestaemails. Now, could this be a serious violation of federal law? We'll have an investigation in a minute. Either way, it is clear evidence that Twitter was holding water for the Clinton campaign, and Democrats have the gall to complain about fake news on Facebook? The hypocrisy is breathtaking. We'll follow that story.  And also tonight, for months we've been exposing the most dangerous Clinton scandal of all, that is the Uranium One scandal. Tonight, we have even more new damning information to bring you. The Hill's John Solomon, Alison Spann, they are out tonight with another absolutely stunning report, the headline is this. \"Uranium One deal lead to some exports to Europe.\" This is been the number one excuse they've been telling us. John Solomon is reporting tonight that after the Obama administration approved the sale of Uranium One -- now remember, 2009, we know about lies and bribes and kickbacks and extortion, money laundering, and racketeering, and they still allowed the deal through. But anyway, the nuclear regulatory commission gave assurances the raw nuclear fuel would never be exported out of this country.  But Solomon, he obtained the NRC memos, they did approve the shipment of yellowcake uranium from the U.S. to Canada through a third-party trucking company, and unbelievably, some of that nuclear material made its way all the way to Europe, maybe even Asia. John Solomon writes, quote, \"Uranium One exports flowed from Wyoming to Canada on to Europe between 2012 and 2014, and the approval involved a process with multiple agencies.\"  Now, the American branch of Uranium One gave a statement to The Hill confirming it did export uranium to Canada through the trucking firm, and that 25 percent of that nuclear fuel made its way outside of North America to Europe and Asia. Wow.  This has been their number one excuse. They stressed the exports complied with federal law. Yes, because they used the company and then they didn't have to get their own license. And a statement from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reads in part, \"The NRC licensing actions complied with the Atomic Energy Act section 123 agreement where the receiving country, in this case, Canada is required to commit to use the material for only peaceful purposes.\"  By the way, does anyone at home know, we import uranium, because we do not have enough. So, when the uranium made its way to Canada to Europe, what then? How did that happen? Now, if this material is crossing the Atlantic, what is preventing it from getting into Russia? And the question remains, why in the in the hell would anybody approve the sale of 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the bad actor he is, and the hostile regime Russia, government approved by Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, other high ranking officials in the Obama administration.  John Solomon, Sara Carter, they will join us. They will give us a full investigative report. All right. But first, a lot of ground to cover. Joining us now, the author of \"Clinton Cash,\" the President of the Government Accountability Institute, Peter Schweitzer, Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, I'll start on the legal side. She stole a primary. She funneled money into a law form. Both controlling the DNC, and her funds to pay for a phony dossier and she now admits it. Crimes?",

So then they go out on these joint fund-raisers during the campaign, they raised up to $100 million, and here's the other deception. The states take their share, but immediately kick it back to the DNC which kicks their share and the states share back to Hillary Clinton for her use. That could be a violation of three laws. Campaign contribution limits, the finance reporting laws, and it looks to me like money laundering. Illegally money being moved around to look legitimate.",

I think they are under assault right now from the Obama team, from the Bernie Sanders supporters, but all of these things come together as it relates to the infrastructure of acquiring money and using money, and what they ran into in 2008 with Barack Obama, and in 2016, were basically populous or popular campaigns that defeated their attempt to bite the nomination and the election in 2008 and 2016.",

Also tonight, Hillary Clinton is now defending this discredited, phony, anti-Trump dossier. The real Russia collusion that happened in last year's campaign, and we have all the details. And also breaking tonight, exclusive here on \"Hannity,\" The Hill's John Solomon has a shocking report on the Uranium One scandal despite assurances that no nuclear fuel would leave the United States. Guess what? Well memos now show that American uranium did get exported out of this country. We will detail all of the painful steps that the Obama administration took to allow this and cover it up. That is all coming up in tonight's breaking news, opening monologue. All right. Our big story tonight, the former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile is now saying that she has the smoking gun evidence that Hillary Clinton rigged the DNC in order to keep socialist from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, from winning the Democratic primary. Donna Brazile is making the revelations in her new book which will be out next week. This is massive. Now, keep in mind, this is something that President Trump, he has been saying for months.

She hadn't been very interested in controlling the party -- she let Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn do as it so desired. She didn't have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I had been trying to uncover for the last few weeks. By September 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.\" Wow! That is powerful. And this shows just how low the Clintons will go to get what they want.

It reads this in part. \"With Donald Trump in the White House, Democrats must stay focused on acting a progressive agenda to protect our citizens, our values and our democracy and remain united towards our goal of electing Democratic congressional majorities in 2018.\" OK. That is not a denial of anything. But it is a clear example of just what Senator Bernie Sanders was up against in the 2016 Democratic primary. I had said it many times. Now just moments ago, the President, Donald Trump, he tweeted, \"Donna Brazile just stated the DNC rigged the system to illegally steal the primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by crooked Hillary. This is real collusion, and dishonesty. Major violation of campaign finance laws, and money laundering, where is our Justice Department?\" Great questions. Now, this Clinton crime family, because that's what they really are and their political machine, was willing to put all ethics aside, do nothing, anything, everything they could do to mow down the one man, anybody, that stood in their way. Now stop and think about this for a minute. Could you just imagine if today it was just revealed President Trump, if he was accused and there was evidence that he rigged the RNC in the primary in his favor to help him and steal an election. Could you imagine the outrage from the alt-left mainstream media? There would be calls for investigations into this all day. But today, because this is a bad story for Democrats, your media, which is so corrupt, they are barely covering it. This is a breathtaking moment. Hillary Clinton -- she's a former secretary of state, former first lady of our country, the former senator, former first lady of Arkansas -- rigged and stole a primary election. Just look at Clinton right there at the Democratic National Convention. She stole those moments. Think about that for a minute. What is the most basic things you teach your children in life? Let's see. You need to be fair, honest, trustworthy, you should not lie, and you should not cheat, and should not steal. When it comes to Hillary Clinton, she did not embody one of those principles, and approves nothing was going to stop Hillary Clinton's blind ambition. Now, when it comes to emails, after they were subpoenaed -- if we had subpoenaed emails, we'd have to turned them over. She did not want you to see them. What did she do? Oh, she deleted them, acid washed them. She used bleach, smashed devices with hammers. When it comes to Hillary Clinton, there's zero stopping this woman. No law, no subpoena, no warrant, no ethics guide this woman's life. This is by far the worst thing -- and I covered the Clintons for years -- they have ever done. Hillary Clinton accuses President Trump of collusion, and she stole, bought, and paid for the fake anti-Trump dossier? And it doesn't matter in the process? She sold our security out in this country, Uranium One. We are talking about the most unethical person I've ever seen in my entire life. And by the way, Bernie Sanders, he never stood a shot. And speaking to you, Bernie, you should be ashamed of yourself. You knew. You knew, you were told there was evidence that that primary was stolen. And you ended up supporting her anyway? You said nothing? This woman had zero ethics. Bernie Sanders would have literally elected a person, and he covered for a person, who stole the election with him. Apparently he was OK with that. I don't know what's wrong with you, Bernie. After all of you that voted tonight, for Hillary Clinton, this is the person that you wanted to be your president. This disgrace will follow her the rest of her life. Also tonight, while Hillary Clinton was apparently running the DNC, she was in charge of it, she was also using their funds to pay a former foreign spy to make up those salacious, untrue, accusations in the dossier about President Trump, then-candidate Trump. Now, Hillary Clinton has broken her silence on the dossier, finally, the one she helped fund that she was running through a law firm. Here's what she told \"The Daily Show's\" Trevor Noah last night."

      "utterance": "Beyond a disgrace. That was all designed to manipulate the American people. The president is right. Crooked Hillary Clinton was caught in the act using a foreign source to influence the election, steal the election, again. If you need any more evidence that Hillary Clinton was willing to do anything and everything to win the 2016 election, you need to look no further than that dossier. Now remember, that was full of lies, propaganda, salacious details. She lost miserably in the election, and now America is really, truly getting to know the dark, ruthless side of Hillary Clinton. Now, we will going to get to back to that in just a few minutes. But first, we have another story almost too shocking to believe. Twitter's lawyer admitted earlier today, this week, to lawmakers, that the social media giant -- you know, Twitter, we all use Twitter -- that they literally hid tweets and hashtags that were connected to the DNC and John Podesta's emails. Now, in his prepared testimony before the Senate subcommittee on crime and terrorism, Twitter's acting general counsel acknowledged Twitter hid over 60 tweets with #DNCleak and hid another 106,000 tweets with #Podestaemails. Now, could this be a serious violation of federal law? We'll have an investigation in a minute. Either way, it is clear evidence that Twitter was holding water for the Clinton campaign, and Democrats have the gall to complain about fake news on Facebook? The hypocrisy is breathtaking. We'll follow that story. And also tonight, for months we've been exposing the most dangerous Clinton scandal of all, that is the Uranium One scandal. Tonight, we have even more new damning information to bring you. The Hill's John Solomon, Alison Spann, they are out tonight with another absolutely stunning report, the headline is this. \"Uranium One deal lead to some exports to Europe.\" This is been the number one excuse they've been telling us. John Solomon is reporting tonight that after the Obama administration approved the sale of Uranium One -- now remember, 2009, we know about lies and bribes and kickbacks and extortion, money laundering, and racketeering, and they still allowed the deal through. But anyway, the nuclear regulatory commission gave assurances the raw nuclear fuel would never be exported out of this country. But Solomon, he obtained the NRC memos, they did approve the shipment of yellowcake uranium from the U.S. to Canada through a third-party trucking company, and unbelievably, some of that nuclear material made its way all the way to Europe, maybe even Asia. John Solomon writes, quote, \"Uranium One exports flowed from Wyoming to Canada on to Europe between 2012 and 2014, and the approval involved a process with multiple agencies.\" Now, the American branch of Uranium One gave a statement to The Hill confirming it did export uranium to Canada through the trucking firm, and that 25 percent of that nuclear fuel made its way outside of North America to Europe and Asia. Wow. This has been their number one excuse. They stressed the exports complied with federal law. Yes, because they used the company and then they didn't have to get their own license. And a statement from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reads in part, \"The NRC licensing actions complied with the Atomic Energy Act section 123 agreement where the receiving country, in this case, Canada is required to commit to use the material for only peaceful purposes.\" By the way, does anyone at home know, we import uranium, because we do not have enough. So, when the uranium made its way to Canada to Europe, what then? How did that happen? Now, if this material is crossing the Atlantic, what is preventing it from getting into Russia? And the question remains, why in the in the hell would anybody approve the sale of 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin and the bad actor he is, and the hostile regime Russia, government approved by Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, other high ranking officials in the Obama administration. John Solomon, Sara Carter, they will join us. They will give us a full investigative report. All right. But first, a lot of ground to cover. Joining us now, the author of \"Clinton Cash,\" the President of the Government Accountability Institute, Peter Schweitzer, Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, I'll start on the legal side. She stole a primary. She funneled money into a law form. Both controlling the DNC, and her funds to pay for a phony dossier and she now admits it. Crimes?"

      "utterance": "A lot of crimes. This would appear to be an elaborate, clever scheme by Hillary Clinton. The DNC was broke, so Hillary bails them out with 20 million, but in exchange, she gets the DNC to sign an agreement that she gets control over their finances, their strategy, their support. So then they go out on these joint fund-raisers during the campaign, they raised up to $100 million, and here's the other deception. The states take their share, but immediately kick it back to the DNC which kicks their share and the states share back to Hillary Clinton for her use. That could be a violation of three laws. Campaign contribution limits, the finance reporting laws, and it looks to me like money laundering. Illegally money being moved around to look legitimate."

I do not think we ever imagined this bad. But it is worse than that. It's worst that it's bad. Stealing an election, taking over the DNC, admitting to funding the phony Russian lies propaganda. She funded the whole thing either through her campaign or through the DNC she was controlling now. The whole thing. She is admitting the whole thing. Then that Uranium One deal. You know, everyone in the media says, Hannity, why are you talking about Clinton? Because we have a constitution. Rule of law, equal justice under the law, and they are not living by the same rules as the rest of us. They do whatever they want. They smashed blackberries, they bleach subpoenaed emails, they delete emails, and then they get kickbacks for selling out America's securities. This is not a game, this is not funny. And then poor Bernie Sanders, the sucker sap he is, he accepts all this. And says nothing. He covers it up for her. Your thoughts? PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, \"CLINTON CASH\": Yes. I know, you are right, Sean. I mean, look, the Clinton message has always been that, you know, the attacks on them are sort of from the right wing, vast right wing conspiracy. You cannot say that about Donna Brazile. I mean, she was one of their most loyal lieutenants for a very long time."

The Clintons had been since they've been in public life going back to the days in Arkansas, they have been about controlling money, acquiring money, using money as a weapon. Using money as a means to power. And they really are the one political machine left at the national level in American politics. I think they are under assault right now from the Obama team, from the Bernie Sanders supporters, but all of these things come together as it relates to the infrastructure of acquiring money and using money, and what they ran into in 2008 with Barack Obama, and in 2016, were basically populous or popular campaigns that defeated their attempt to bite the nomination and the election in 2008 and 2016."

What she did appears to have been a crime, it is a crime to give money to a foreign national and a political campaign. That is what she did. It is not a crime for Donald Trump, Jr., to talk to a Russian lawyer or George Papadopoulos to talk to a Russian during the campaign."

And they funnel it through the same law firm, the whole thing. Oh, yes. Mark alliance who represents not just as general counsel of the DNC. He is also the lawyer for the Hillary Clinton campaign, and he represents the Podesta group or the Podestas. Talk about a conflict of interests."

Because the number one excuse that they have been using, it never left the United States. Well, first of all, we import uranium. The idea that we will going to give 20 percent of uranium to Putin never made sense. We do not have enough for ourselves. We have to bring in uranium to this country. Your reaction to that?"

Rosatom, the Russian state atomic agency does not like our Department of Agency. Rosatom and the Russia, it controls the Russian nuclear arsenal, it is involved in nuclear programs, in Iran, North Korea, and elsewhere. So, it is not a surprise. It is not a surprise that if you give them control of uranium assets, they are not going to worry about export licenses or promises that they made to the Obama administration about what they were going to use with the uranium. It is just laughable. And this another reason needs to be investigated."

The Joint Fund-Raising Agreement between the DNC, the Hillary Victory Fund, and Hillary for America.\" Then it goes on, \"The agreement signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, Robby Mook was the manager, with a copy of Marc Elias,\" remember that name. And I'll tell you more later, \"specified that in exchange for raising money and investigating the DNC, Hillary would control the party's finances, their strategy and all the money raised.\" And then it goes on, her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party's communications director, and it would make final decision on all the other staff.\" Now, this to me coming directly from Donna Brazile, and like you, I have known Donna Brazile for years. She never would have taken the job. She has ethics. I understand on the question, and I know she regretted it, a lot, and she took a lot heat for it. But put it aside. She is admitting.

Remember, Sean, during this time. In 2010, there were so many people in congress that were outraged, they did not want this deal to go through. They were really concerned about Russia and Iran, and that connection made them scared. Terrified them about this deal. But Sharia assured the Russians in this analysis, look, and the 2009 Iran sanctions bill that has been in the past.

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" President Trump is continuing his call for tough justice against the jihadists that terrorize New York City, killed eight on Tuesday. The president tweeted quote, NYC, terrorist was happy and you have to hang the ISIS flag in her hospital room. He killed 8 innocent people. Badly injured 12, he should get the death penalty. He then followed up with two more tweets saying, would love to send the New York City terrorist to Gitmo, but statically that process, takes much longer to go in the federal system. Also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. Death penalty. Amen. Joining us now, reaction from the author, Defeating Jihad, former assistant to president, Sebastian Gorka, and also from the Islamic house of wisdom, Imam Mohammad Ali Elahi. Do you think Iran is good country, don't you, Imam?"

I have to admit, with the briefings I received with the meetings I had, in the sit room and the NSC, over very short period of time, I realized, that we will crush the Sunni extremists. ISIS is on the ropes. I've come to the conclusion, Sean, the biggest threat to America is the Shia jihadist of Iran."
