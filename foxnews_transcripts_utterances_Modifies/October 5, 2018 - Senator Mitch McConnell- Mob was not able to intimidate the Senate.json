      "sentences": "Hello, from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Tonight, Senator Susan Collins driving what could be the final nail in the coffin for the Democrat's resistance against Brett Kavanaugh. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will join me exclusively in moments revealing what he said to Collins in today's lunch meeting just moments before she said yes to Kavanaugh. And amidst the Kavanaugh fight, the MeToo Movement is now hitting the board room. But not in the way that you might think.  Raymond Arroyo is here with me from Friday Follies and you would want to stick around for diamond and silk. It's not Friday without diamond and silk. But first, the Democrats' phony victim play, that's the focus of tonight's angle.  The Democrats and many on the left worked around the clock to kill Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. But I think they made a fatal miscalculation. They thought it was okay along the way to jettison the principle of due process, and to use victims to pursue a radical political agenda.  And on the first year anniversary of the MeToo Movement, I think it's important to remember that this all started with liberal Democrat Harvey Weinstein, friend of Bill and Hillary, and of course Barack Obama. And remember he, the Hollywood mogul, big mega donor. I mean this guy is where it all happened. And remember, the abuse there started the cultural moment of MeToo. This notion of objectifying women and using them for the pleasure of the powerful has been long nurtured by the left. At the same time, it was also pro-women as we abuse women on the casting couch, et cetera.  And entertainment industry had the target on its back. But now we see the same mentality at play in the Kavanaugh struggle. (Inaudible) claims to be defenders of women, the Democrats cynically and I think cruelly used Christine Ford in a desperate attempt to derail a Supreme Court nominee. Remember, she didn't initially want to come forward to tell her story. She was dragged into the open by political leaks to the Washington Post and other media outlets. And remember, reporters surrounded her home, and then she was forced to tell her story.  And today, we learned of more dirty tricks from these activist lawyers behind the scenes. Remember Leland Keyser? She was the person who Ford claimed was at the party where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her, one of her close friends. Well, Keyser previously told the senate committee that she didn't know of such party, didn't even know Kavanaugh to begin with.   Today, though, she told the \"Wall Street Journal\" that in -- and the FBI that a former agent, another friend of Christine Ford, Monica McLean, pressured her to change her account to corroborate Ford's account. Unbelievable. Well, in a speech announcing her decision to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation today, Senator Susan Collins perfectly summed up the callousness of the Democrats.",

They'd rather have people dependent on government, helpless without it, especially certain groups, minorities, immigrants, and even women.  We're supposed to believe that we can't survive and thrive without an activist court making up new rights, finding them in the constitution. And they demand that we believe anyone who claims victim status. We have to take them at their word regardless of where the facts lie. But for all of their screaming and their tiresome chanting, the left basically come up empty this time. Most Americans don't see themselves as victims. We're not powerless or weak. We're strong and independent. This was the Democrats' miscalculation. They thought emotional extortion and protester histrionics would be enough to block a well-qualified Supreme Court nominee.   But once again, they let their rabid political ideology blind them to the fact that Americans are fair-minded, have a basic goodness about them, and they're optimistic about the future. They don't need an activist Supreme Court to see the light, to know where we are as a people, to see our future. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Code Pink's co-founder Medea Benjamin and former Kavanaugh colleague, Helgi Walker. She also served as associate counsel to President George W. Bush and clerked for Justice Thomas in the Supreme Court. Great to have you both on. Medea, do you deny that the left ended up sadly using Christine Ford as a political cudgel in this battle?",

Now, we've shown you the evidence of that, but for daring to raise this possibility, Senator Chuck Grassley was called an anti-Semite. A \"New York Times\" op-ed writer, David Leonhardt writes, \"Let's be clear here, Charles Grassley is a United States Senator. He is responsible for his words. And his words here amount to an anti-Semitic smear.\" Michelle Malkin joins us now with reaction to the craziness and how it's crazy, kind of sometimes mob mentality seems to be taking over politics and certainly Capitol Hill.

      "utterance": "Hello, from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Tonight, Senator Susan Collins driving what could be the final nail in the coffin for the Democrat's resistance against Brett Kavanaugh. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will join me exclusively in moments revealing what he said to Collins in today's lunch meeting just moments before she said yes to Kavanaugh. And amidst the Kavanaugh fight, the MeToo Movement is now hitting the board room. But not in the way that you might think. Raymond Arroyo is here with me from Friday Follies and you would want to stick around for diamond and silk. It's not Friday without diamond and silk. But first, the Democrats' phony victim play, that's the focus of tonight's angle. The Democrats and many on the left worked around the clock to kill Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. But I think they made a fatal miscalculation. They thought it was okay along the way to jettison the principle of due process, and to use victims to pursue a radical political agenda. And on the first year anniversary of the MeToo Movement, I think it's important to remember that this all started with liberal Democrat Harvey Weinstein, friend of Bill and Hillary, and of course Barack Obama. And remember he, the Hollywood mogul, big mega donor. I mean this guy is where it all happened. And remember, the abuse there started the cultural moment of MeToo. This notion of objectifying women and using them for the pleasure of the powerful has been long nurtured by the left. At the same time, it was also pro-women as we abuse women on the casting couch, et cetera. And entertainment industry had the target on its back. But now we see the same mentality at play in the Kavanaugh struggle. (Inaudible) claims to be defenders of women, the Democrats cynically and I think cruelly used Christine Ford in a desperate attempt to derail a Supreme Court nominee. Remember, she didn't initially want to come forward to tell her story. She was dragged into the open by political leaks to the Washington Post and other media outlets. And remember, reporters surrounded her home, and then she was forced to tell her story. And today, we learned of more dirty tricks from these activist lawyers behind the scenes. Remember Leland Keyser? She was the person who Ford claimed was at the party where Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her, one of her close friends. Well, Keyser previously told the senate committee that she didn't know of such party, didn't even know Kavanaugh to begin with. Today, though, she told the \"Wall Street Journal\" that in -- and the FBI that a former agent, another friend of Christine Ford, Monica McLean, pressured her to change her account to corroborate Ford's account. Unbelievable. Well, in a speech announcing her decision to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation today, Senator Susan Collins perfectly summed up the callousness of the Democrats."

They'd rather have people dependent on government, helpless without it, especially certain groups, minorities, immigrants, and even women. We're supposed to believe that we can't survive and thrive without an activist court making up new rights, finding them in the constitution. And they demand that we believe anyone who claims victim status. We have to take them at their word regardless of where the facts lie. But for all of their screaming and their tiresome chanting, the left basically come up empty this time. Most Americans don't see themselves as victims. We're not powerless or weak. We're strong and independent. This was the Democrats' miscalculation. They thought emotional extortion and protester histrionics would be enough to block a well-qualified Supreme Court nominee. But once again, they let their rabid political ideology blind them to the fact that Americans are fair-minded, have a basic goodness about them, and they're optimistic about the future. They don't need an activist Supreme Court to see the light, to know where we are as a people, to see our future. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Code Pink's co-founder Medea Benjamin and former Kavanaugh colleague, Helgi Walker. She also served as associate counsel to President George W. Bush and clerked for Justice Thomas in the Supreme Court. Great to have you both on. Medea, do you deny that the left ended up sadly using Christine Ford as a political cudgel in this battle?"

It's great to see you. And it's no secret at this point that the grassroots protesters at the Capitol are often funded either directly or indirectly by some George Soros affiliated groups. Now, we've shown you the evidence of that, but for daring to raise this possibility, Senator Chuck Grassley was called an anti-Semite. A \"New York Times\" op-ed writer, David Leonhardt writes, \"Let's be clear here, Charles Grassley is a United States Senator. He is responsible for his words. And his words here amount to an anti-Semitic smear.\" Michelle Malkin joins us now with reaction to the craziness and how it's crazy, kind of sometimes mob mentality seems to be taking over politics and certainly Capitol Hill. Michelle, did George Soros have any involvement in the funding of like this-- what is it, the Center for Popular Democracy, where the ladies cornered poor old Jeff Flake in the elevator (inaudible) and he looked very scared."

Now, there's a new generation of these groups and CPD is one of them, along with Code Pink 2.0, ultraviolet (ph). And it is the protest orchestration I think that really needs to be investigated. Not only among the funders and the philanthropists that back these professional mobsters, but also the people that they were coordinating with within the Senate Judiciary Committee. It's still not has answered who gave the Senate gallery passes to people like Linda Sarsour and Piper Perabo and these others who from day one, second one, minute one of the hearings were enacting the plan that they have announced ever since Donald Trump won office. And I think that the Senate Democrat wrecking machine is not going to give up after Judge Kavanaugh is nominated and approved tomorrow. They're going to go on all the way through the midterms and 2020. And I think it behooves the right and the conservative movement, Laura, to make sure that we don't leave a vacuum in these spaces."

      "utterance": "Guys, we'll have you both back.  We've got a lot more on this to cover. And by the way, a Women's March cofounder saying support for Kavanaugh equals support for bigotry and racism.  Seems like a pretty big jump to me. Diamond and Silk here to respond, next."

      "speaker": "MALLORY",
      "utterance": "So let me tell you who was laughing.  White women were standing there laughing with their white husbands.  Do not allow people to be comfortable around you supporting racists and bigots.  And it is not OK."

      "utterance": "That was women's march co-chair Tamika Mallory with a message to white women following the president's fact check of Christine Ford the other night.  Here with their reaction are Diamond and Silk.  Ladies, great to see you.  Thanks for being here.  Diamond, what's your reaction to Ms. Mallory here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIAMOND, POLITICAL ACTIVIST",
      "utterance": "You have to understand that, first of all, the president wasn't mocking anybody.  What he was doing was calling out inconsistencies in Dr. Ford's story, and we all was agreeing with him, the people in his audience and the people at home.  That's the first thing. The second thing, this is what the Democrats do, the liberals do.  When they can't beat with you the race card they use the sex card, they say you're a mark and they call you a bigot.  That's why we have to march to the polls and vote right, vote for red, vote Republican."

      "utterance": "Silk, there's this actress, singer, Bette Midler, I know, remember, \"Beaches.\" She said this in a tweet on Thursday, yesterday, \"Women are the n-word of the world.\"  She has since deleted the world. \"Raped, beaten, enslaved, married off, worked like dumb animals, denied education, inheritance, enduring the pain of childbirth and life in silence for thousands of years.  They are the most disrespected creatures on earth.\" Silk?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SILK, POLITICAL ACTIVIST",
      "utterance": "I really believe that is really a shame how you tie, want to tie beautiful women and women to the n-word.  When I look at, Bette, I look at the fact she's a Democrat.  This is exactly what they do. If you look at the liberals, and the Democrats, they are the party of slavery.  And look at the slave masters, what did they call their slaves? So she understands the n-word, she knows what it means to be the n-word. However, I think that she should not tie women to the n-word.  And she shouldn't even be saying the n-word.  I thought we laid that word to rest."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Diamond, did you have any thoughts when you see the very angry, rage-filled protesters, filling the capitol, filling the Senate, Hart Office Building, celebrities, Amy Schumer standing up in her prison garb with her fist raised in the air.  Thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIAMOND",
      "utterance": "My only thoughts on that is that we have to look at that, and what we have to do as a Republican Party is galvanize the Republicans and go to the polls and we have to vote.  When I look at the left and how they use the Me Too movement, and how they took that movement and politicized it, and then used it as a weapon to weaponize it against somebody to try to character assassinate them, we don't need that happening to us.  Today it was Kavanaugh, tomorrow it could be your brother, your husband, your son, or your father.  So you're going to have to vote red and vote Republican."

She's a little Ingraham angel.  There she is.  They actually let, the O'Tooles (ph) let me actually hold the baby."
