Especially, that someone is a shirtless Kilmeade and he's handing me a magic marker. But usually what follows that is an insane conspiracy theory involving extra-terrestrials, satanic rituals, and lizard people, which sounds like one of Bill Hemmer's hot tub parties.  But whenever I hear of another terrible crime, I keep asking why and how? It's the same thing E.R. doctors asked me after looking at an x-ray of my colon.   But this time, connecting the dots is super easy because the left has given us more dots than a braille edition of Moby Dick. First, Chicago, so far, it's had the most homicides since 1994, more than 1,000. During Kim Foxx's first three years as the county's top prosecutor, her office dropped all charges against 30 percent of felony defendants, a massive increase over her predecessor. And despite having video evidence and witnesses to crimes connected to death, she declined charging anyone. Of course, she also fell for Jussie Smollett who's on trial for a hoax that was as believable as a Tom Cruise marriage.  She treated Smollett like he was the second coming of MLK, even as his story fell apart like a bridge designed by a woman studies major.",

Now, you know that the Waukesha madman had been released on a small bail despite having a history that would make Ivan the Terrible blush. The least they could do was take away his car keys, which is good advice for violent criminals or Joe Biden. John Chisholm, the D.A. who set him free had pledged to work with the San Francisco D.A., Chesa Boudin. San Francisco, have you seen that hellhole since Boudin's been in office? Now, the San Francisco treat means stepping on a use syringe while a tramp defecates on your shoes.",

      "sentences": "And yes Boudin was put in office using Soros' foundation money, another dot. In Philly, homicides have more than doubled since Larry Krasner was elected D.A. in 2017. The City of Brotherly Love is now the city of duck and run, which is what happens when a D.A. would rather release criminals than prosecute them. And the criminals who get second chances, they get arrested again, sometimes for murder. Krasner received 1.7 million in backing from Soros. Anybody else connecting the blood splatter dots?   Then, there's LA's George Gascon, another far-left reformer bankrolled by Soros's millions. He's now like Boudin, facing a recall after replacing the rule of law with weak sentencing for violent thugs.  Gascon redefined victimhood. So, victims aren't just those targeted by criminals, but the criminals themselves. So, wherever crimes exploding, you find these dots, progressive Soros-back prosecutors. Like Maroon 5's latest tour, wherever they go, people suffer.  It's like the radical left is running a medical experiment and we're the lab rats. And if there's collateral damage, well, the overarching mission justifies it, they've said so. It's like making an omelet. If you want to make remake society, you can have to crack a few skulls.  Unlike scientists who conduct medical experiments, they're well protected, but the rats aren't. So, you see the pattern. Eliminate bail requirements, stop prosecuting crimes, and use the pandemic to release even more violent thugs. Because God forbid, a rapist has to suffer mild flu symptoms at Rikers. All of these dots end up creating a line pointing you to widespread brutality against minorities, the elderly, and now even the rich. But you can't blame Soros alone. It's not like he created these people. He may not be a dot, but he sure knows how to connect them.  But it's like blaming the Jets' owner for the team's horrible record the last 10 years. He didn't create these bad players, he just pays them. He's writing checks for their mayhem, just like the one Jussie Smollett wrote to his fake assailants. Except here and now, the damage they do is real.",

They even created a Black Christmas website, listing off shops that are owned by black people, which now white racist can use as a list of stores to avoid.

Figuratively, and recently alleged she was sexually assaulted by an official in the Chinese Communist Party. That's the Chinese version of the Democrats. And China's authoritarian government is accused of covering up the story, silencing Peng and refusing to investigate the situation. They're now as silent as their shill, LeBron James. Yesterday, chairman of the WTA, Steve Simon, called for a thorough investigation of Peng's allegations. But with the WTA pulling out of China indefinitely, the organization stands to lose over $100 million in contracts and sponsorships. So, they're putting their principles before their money.

But nothing says the holiday spirit like boarded up storefronts and high-end shopping districts. Sorry rich Bay Area liberals, your stocking is going to be emptier than Joy Reid's head. Thanks to the rise in smash and grabs, places like Union Square in San Fran are boarding up more businesses than Minneapolis did, while waiting for the Chauvin verdict. Deck the halls has been replaced with deck the security guard. Who needs mistletoe when you can kiss your ass goodbye? Whether it's brutal home invasions or grisly street attacks, Santa's naughty list is growing faster than Alec Baldwin's legal bills. Police officers have been shot and killed this year at all-time highs. 314 officers were shot so far, a 43 percent increase since 2018. Ambush attacks are up 126 percent since 2020, and in almost every major city, murder rates are the highest in 30 years. Merry Christmas. Crime's up because crime pays. And the only people getting punished are people who don't break the law. Even the kids are catching on."

Especially, that someone is a shirtless Kilmeade and he's handing me a magic marker. But usually what follows that is an insane conspiracy theory involving extra-terrestrials, satanic rituals, and lizard people, which sounds like one of Bill Hemmer's hot tub parties. But whenever I hear of another terrible crime, I keep asking why and how? It's the same thing E.R. doctors asked me after looking at an x-ray of my colon. But this time, connecting the dots is super easy because the left has given us more dots than a braille edition of Moby Dick. First, Chicago, so far, it's had the most homicides since 1994, more than 1,000. During Kim Foxx's first three years as the county's top prosecutor, her office dropped all charges against 30 percent of felony defendants, a massive increase over her predecessor. And despite having video evidence and witnesses to crimes connected to death, she declined charging anyone. Of course, she also fell for Jussie Smollett who's on trial for a hoax that was as believable as a Tom Cruise marriage. She treated Smollett like he was the second coming of MLK, even as his story fell apart like a bridge designed by a woman studies major."

      "utterance": "Thank you. But -- a sexist would say. But, she got millions, millions from George Soros. 2 million to be exact, and that's a dot. Now, you know that the Waukesha madman had been released on a small bail despite having a history that would make Ivan the Terrible blush. The least they could do was take away his car keys, which is good advice for violent criminals or Joe Biden. John Chisholm, the D.A. who set him free had pledged to work with the San Francisco D.A., Chesa Boudin. San Francisco, have you seen that hellhole since Boudin's been in office? Now, the San Francisco treat means stepping on a use syringe while a tramp defecates on your shoes."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "And yes Boudin was put in office using Soros' foundation money, another dot. In Philly, homicides have more than doubled since Larry Krasner was elected D.A. in 2017. The City of Brotherly Love is now the city of duck and run, which is what happens when a D.A. would rather release criminals than prosecute them. And the criminals who get second chances, they get arrested again, sometimes for murder. Krasner received 1.7 million in backing from Soros. Anybody else connecting the blood splatter dots? Then, there's LA's George Gascon, another far-left reformer bankrolled by Soros's millions. He's now like Boudin, facing a recall after replacing the rule of law with weak sentencing for violent thugs. Gascon redefined victimhood. So, victims aren't just those targeted by criminals, but the criminals themselves. So, wherever crimes exploding, you find these dots, progressive Soros-back prosecutors. Like Maroon 5's latest tour, wherever they go, people suffer. It's like the radical left is running a medical experiment and we're the lab rats. And if there's collateral damage, well, the overarching mission justifies it, they've said so. It's like making an omelet. If you want to make remake society, you can have to crack a few skulls. Unlike scientists who conduct medical experiments, they're well protected, but the rats aren't. So, you see the pattern. Eliminate bail requirements, stop prosecuting crimes, and use the pandemic to release even more violent thugs. Because God forbid, a rapist has to suffer mild flu symptoms at Rikers. All of these dots end up creating a line pointing you to widespread brutality against minorities, the elderly, and now even the rich. But you can't blame Soros alone. It's not like he created these people. He may not be a dot, but he sure knows how to connect them. But it's like blaming the Jets' owner for the team's horrible record the last 10 years. He didn't create these bad players, he just pays them. He's writing checks for their mayhem, just like the one Jussie Smollett wrote to his fake assailants. Except here and now, the damage they do is real."

So, I think people realize, it turns out when you put loons who are like, let's let all the criminals out of prison or not punish people harshly who are criminals, that things happen in cities. And it's not even just the big ones. Lansing, Wichita, you got a midsize cities all across America. They have progressive prosecutors too, by the way. Places like Milwaukee, progressive prosecutors."

The organization announced it on Instagram with hashtags like build black, buy black, bank black, and black Christmas. BLM would prefer you to do all your Christmas shopping at black-owned stores citing, quote, \"White supremacist capitalism that uses policing to protect profits and steal black life.\" That makes no sense. But wait, don't black stores want to protect profits too? And I wonder if their list includes black and minority owned businesses that were destroyed by rioters or the neighborhood stores that closed due to white supremacist ideas like beating up employees and shoplifting. They even created a Black Christmas website, listing off shops that are owned by black people, which now white racist can use as a list of stores to avoid. Isn't that the real point that what BLM is demanding is exactly what a white supremacist would want as well? Separatism. We went to a racist for comment."

Who knew women play tennis? A sexist. A sexist might say. But, ironically, the WTA is the first sports organization to show some balls. Figuratively, and recently alleged she was sexually assaulted by an official in the Chinese Communist Party. That's the Chinese version of the Democrats. And China's authoritarian government is accused of covering up the story, silencing Peng and refusing to investigate the situation. They're now as silent as their shill, LeBron James. Yesterday, chairman of the WTA, Steve Simon, called for a thorough investigation of Peng's allegations. But with the WTA pulling out of China indefinitely, the organization stands to lose over $100 million in contracts and sponsorships. So, they're putting their principles before their money.
