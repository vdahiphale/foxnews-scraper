Yes, they're still saying that inflation isn't bad because the government printed all this money and gave it to you to spend, which of course drives up prices since money becomes cheaper once you print more of it. Dems know the economy about as well as I know the layout of the big and tall men store. With their logic why does it the government just print a trillion- dollar bill for everyone?

But our portly prevaricator thinks we get all of our two percent low fat dairy from the only finest regions in France. You may have also said let them eat cake, but that's what his answer is to everything. I'm surprised he didn't include a picture of a woman breastfeeding and write, see no supply chain delay there. But Brian hosts a dying show called ironically reliable sources, which is yet to admit that the four-year narrative they pushed on Russian collusion was as real as a strippers boobs.

Gentle rumble of laughter. Bernie tweeted: \"We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period.\" It only took three hours to write that tweet with those mittens on, to which the world's richest man responded: \"I keep forgetting that you're still alive.\" Elon gets a bigger laugh than I do. Want to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word. So, Elon recently sold roughly $7 billion worth of Tesla stock after conducting a twitter poll asking his followers if he should, which is exactly how you should make investment decisions by Twitter poll.

Apparently, students at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts got into a heated debate with faculty after being told they'd have to help with an exhibition to honor Chappelle on the day of the event. Some even said they'd walk out if it went forward. Here's hoping the door hits them in the ass on the way out, although they're so fragile that might kill them. The event was supposed to raise money for a new theater named after Chappelle was scheduled for next week, but has now been moved to April. And in a move that surprises no one, the school will hold listening sessions with the students and expand their curriculum to include content related activism, political activism, among other crap. The school also said it recognizes not everyone will agree with Chappelle, but added that rejects the idea that cancel culture is healthy or constructive. They then went through the faculty and fired everyone who ever smiled that a Republican.

That's one area where Biden's excelled at job creation. Fact is the media is impervious to any of the challenges and struggles a regular Americans face. Largely because those in the media make a lot of money and they're stupid. For some reason those things go together like dating apps and STDs. Also, unlike the media, regular Americans get fired for waving their weenies in the workplace. At least that's how I got fired from Burger King. But it's that combination of wealth cause arrogance and stupidity that results in all kinds of laughable analysis. The kind that would give the best ALF episode a run for its money.

But it's not surprising. The media's brazen defense of Joe's downfall is as irrational as the attacks on Trump but in reverse. Perhaps they know what a mistake they made trading peace and prosperity in exchange for fewer mean tweets. Was it worth less food on the table? Was it worth shortages and $4.00 gas?

I'm only going to accept food in New York City from the white guy or from the -- from whoever, like, no white guy is allowed. I mean, come on, if you really want to go down that road, it'll be very, very bad for you.

Apparently, students at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts got into a heated debate with faculty after being told they'd have to help with an exhibition to honor Chappelle on the day of the event. Some even said they'd walk out if it went forward. Here's hoping the door hits them in the ass on the way out, although they're so fragile that might kill them. The event was supposed to raise money for a new theater named after Chappelle was scheduled for next week, but has now been moved to April. And in a move that surprises no one, the school will hold listening sessions with the students and expand their curriculum to include content related activism, political activism, among other crap. The school also said it recognizes not everyone will agree with Chappelle, but added that rejects the idea that cancel culture is healthy or constructive. They then went through the faculty and fired everyone who ever smiled that a Republican.

We're protesting. And I remember the principal saying he is going to be marked absent. But by all means, gentlemen, if you want to protest, go ahead and protest. And we did. We walked out in the quad. And we stood there for about 45 minutes and did our protest, the school went on. And we felt empowered or whatever, but school went on."

But it's a faculty member that's pushing it, then the principal comes and goes, we're going to postpone it. Because there wasn't enough -- if they if he would have said, Chappelle is coming, and you have every right, you will have the quad and you we will give you the stage to give out your grievances.

Three and five Americans say they're banning unbox relatives from their holiday gatherings according to a new survey. Yes, nothing says Christmas spirit, quite like interrogating your loved ones about their medical history to decide if they're qualified to come over and eat ham with you. So, who's -- so screw who's been naughty or nice. We need to know, did you get vaccinated twice? Regardless of status, 53 percent said that the politicizing of the shot has divided their families at 56 percent expect to argue about it at the table. That's if you can hear each other through your masks and face shields. But I feel bad for all of you, because I'm small enough to sit at the kids' table.
