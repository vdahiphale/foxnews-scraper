Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley; columnist, Mary Anastasia O'Grady; and editorial board member, Joe Rago. Dan, let's put this week into context. Step back and start with a question, do you think that the Comey firing -- on the merits, the legal merits, we'll get to the politics in a second, but on the legal merits -- was justified. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, Paul, it was absolutely justified. And as you and Judge Mukasey just made clear, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's memo on this makes it clear that Mr. Comey had arrogated to himself powers that do not belong to the director of the FBI. Those powers should have belonged to the deputy attorney general after Loretta Lynch recused herself. And secondly, it was not, as he made clear, Mr. Comey's responsibility to decide whether any prosecutions were warranted in the email server case. That was something that should have been handed up to his superiors at Justice Department. So Mr. Comey was way outside his brief, and it would have been best if Mr. Trump had fired him the day after the inauguration and put a new FBI director in place to proceed with whatever investigation of the Russia connection was onboard. So that there was no question at all that there was a basis for firing him.",

And it's a shame she was not allowed to explain her vision for bringing educational opportunities to low income black families.",

But is that the best way to get to the bottom of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign? Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger; columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley; columnist, Mary Anastasia O'Grady; and editorial board member, Joe Rago. Dan, let's put this week into context. Step back and start with a question, do you think that the Comey firing -- on the merits, the legal merits, we'll get to the politics in a second, but on the legal merits -- was justified. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, Paul, it was absolutely justified. And as you and Judge Mukasey just made clear, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's memo on this makes it clear that Mr. Comey had arrogated to himself powers that do not belong to the director of the FBI. Those powers should have belonged to the deputy attorney general after Loretta Lynch recused herself. And secondly, it was not, as he made clear, Mr. Comey's responsibility to decide whether any prosecutions were warranted in the email server case. That was something that should have been handed up to his superiors at Justice Department. So Mr. Comey was way outside his brief, and it would have been best if Mr. Trump had fired him the day after the inauguration and put a new FBI director in place to proceed with whatever investigation of the Russia connection was onboard. So that there was no question at all that there was a basis for firing him."

And so, yes, their confidence is shaken, even though, as Dan says, he was completely within his rights to fire him. But I think that Donald Trump is also right when he says there was no good time, because had he fired him when he first came into office, after everything happened with John Podesta's emails being hacked and so forth, he would also have been accused of trying to cover something up. So --"

You have to get your ducks in order? You have to get everyone on the same page, Paul. This is a very important decision. Why not hold a press conference, give a speech to the American people: This is why we need a new FBI director, he has damaged the credibility of the institution, and he has to go, and here's why. He could have anticipated all of the responses to this and handled them in a press conference. And the leaking that has gone on, daily, it's been a very exhausting week in that sense.

You're trying to -- he's trying to -- Comey was serious about the information which, of course -- the investigation which, of course, no doubt he was. If you fire Comey, you're covering up. That's not likely to be the case, is it?"

The interesting thing is, if there's actually evidence that Trump was colluding with the Russians or there was some kind of nexus between his campaign and the Kremlin, that evidence would probably be coming out right about now. We haven't seen that. So for all the outrage, it's a lot of innuendo that hasn't actually gotten to the merits of the case."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

And I think McCabe really rained on the parade of the Democrats by saying, look, this investigation is going to go on. But to Jason's point, the bigger problem that we see here, not just related to this issue, is Donald Trump's lack of discipline. And, you know, you look at this, another mistake in the same vein, and you kind of wonder, is this guy going to learn, because it's going to be a long four years if he doesn't figure this out."

Representative, Republican, Tom MacArthur, of New Jersey, held a town hall less than five hours that essentially consisted of people yelling at him. There was one guy that stood this close to his face for 10 minutes shrieking into his face. The Republicans are going to have to get their own people out to these town halls to counteract the Democrats. And I'll tell you something, if a melee ensues, so be it, but they have got to get their story out there, they've got to get their people supporting them, or they're going to have a problem in 2018."

Let's -- let's talk about Russia, because, this week, the president met with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, with a photo-op that Vladimir Putin loved and wanted, and yet the timing was very awkward, given what we've been having in domestic politics with the Russian probe and at the FBI. How do you see Trump's Russia policy so far?"

And the fact that it is so low and will stay so low, because of Trump's policies and because, generally, the fracking revolution, does much more to limit Russian power than all the diplomatic notes you could write."

Accepting the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award last weekend, President Obama defended his signature health care law and called on Congress to do what's right to protect the sick and vulnerable. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is reportedly set to launch a new political action committee, calling herself part of the resistance during an appearance last week in New York City. We're back with Dan Henninger, Jason Riley, Mary Anastasia O'Grady and Joe Rago. Mary, first, let's take Hillary Clinton. What's she doing here? Is she running for president again?"

      "speaker": "MARY ANASTASIA O'GRADY, COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "You know, Hillary Clinton reminds me of one of those blow-up dolls that you -- with the weight in the bottom that you punch and it goes down and pops back up? She's just irrepressible. But I think the problem with her launching this, she has something called Onwards Together. She wants to sort of restore energy in the party and so forth. But, basically, Hillary Clinton has maxed out on the number of people she's going to draw. And she can't expand beyond, basically, who supported her in the last election. And the other problem with what she's doing, which is sort of amusing, is that she describes herself as -- that she's going to be a connector between big money and political actors. And if that doesn't sound familiar, I mean, that's basically what the Clintons have built their whole political career on. And as the money passes through, somehow, they've done very well."

And the two big names they still have going for them are Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Hillary is still in denial about why she lost. She's still blaming it on James Comey and Russia and so forth, but so are a lot of her fellow Democrats. Something like 60 percent tell pollsters, Hillary, you know, the Russians are why Hillary wasn't elected. So joining the resistance seems like a natural thing for her to do at point."

And he's making fairly pronounced shots at the Republican agenda and President Trump's agenda. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, he is. And I don't believe the Democrats are particularly happy about it. Look, when they were running for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, both Tom Perez and Keith Ellison said in public forums that they thought the Obama presidency had sucked too many resources towards that presidency and starved the Democratic grassroots, and that had to change. But consider Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are media superstars, and it is unlikely that CNN or MSNBC are going to start interviewing second-level Democrats when they can interview these two superstars. They are siphoning the oxygen out of the political air for young Democrats. If I were a Republican, I'd be cheering them on."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Let me push back against that a little bit, Joe, in this sense. The 2018 election is going to be, in large part, about mobilization and energy. Are Republicans fired up enough to deter Democrats who are going to be fired up? So is Obama and Clinton coming out now to mobilize Democrats against Republicans maybe doesn't hurt the party, on Dan's point. It could in 2020 if they basically dwarf anybody else and make it difficult for anybody else to emerge."

      "speaker": "JOE RAGO, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think that could be part of it. I mean, Hillary Clinton and Obama, I think, are different. I mean, Hillary spent a billion dollars to lose to a reality TV star. So for all the disorder that we're seeing in Washington today, I think she should probably maybe reflect a little bit more on what just happened."

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "About Obama, however, he continues to be personally popular. I mean, he left office pushing a 60 percent approval rating. The problem he's had, though, is transferring that popularity to his party. And we saw what happened in the off-year elections when he was president. That's what he'll be out there trying to do right now. Historically, it hasn't been very successful. So I can understand why they might want to go that route. But historically, it has not been -- gotten them where they want to be."

      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "A politician with the popularity that Barack Obama had has to be willing to groom successors. And it seems like he's not really willing to do that. He likes being in the limelight. I think, as Dan says, that is going to suck oxygen out of room for many years to come."

You also have a long tradition in this country of college graduates protesting speakers, turning their backs and so forth. And that's all been on steroids in this Trump era. She was a stand-in for the Trump administration, which is very unpopular on college campuses. And I think that's what we saw a reaction to. It's particularly unsettling in her case, however, because if there is one member of the administration who, in a previous life, had done a lot more for black Americans, particularly in offering educational choices to them, in working to get low-income blacks better access to better schools, it is Betsy DeVos. And it's a shame she was not allowed to explain her vision for bringing educational opportunities to low income black families."

And I wondered when I was listening to those students, you know, what they had learned in the four years when they were at that school because, obviously, tolerance was not one of the items on the agenda. By the way, Betsy DeVos' organization was the Foundation for Excellence in Education. And I agree with Jason, she has done an enormous amount and particularly, which is the most important thing in this country, K-12. She's worked in the K-12. And some people said that these students were complaining because there's a threat of university education being cut. If we don't fix the K-12 education in this country, you can forget about the, you know, the opportunities underprivileged people will have in universities."

And, you know, there was a very specific, discreet incident which caused this, which was a signing statement that Donald Trump issued last Friday on the budget, had about 11 paragraphs in it. In the final paragraph, there was something a lot of people interpreted to say he was going to withhold $20 million from the historically black colleges. This became a firestorm on black social media. It was fed into those students, and they reacted to it. And this is why White House staff really flyspeck everything that a president puts his name to. This wasn't justified, but there was this issue behind it that drove this kind of reaction."

But I do wonder about the priorities of the liberal activists who place so much time and energy into these gestures. New Orleans is a place where the murder rate last year was the highest it's been since 2012. The black/white student achievement gap has been widening in recent years. Last year, black unemployment in Louisiana was double digits. A statue of Jefferson Davis coming down is not going to solve any of those problems, so I'm kind of wondering why they're so focused on things like this."

He said that the crimes that they committed should not go unpunished, but amnesty for the terrorists is the centerpiece of the deal.
