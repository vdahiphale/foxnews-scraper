But first, chief of staff John Kelly issuing an emotional defense at the White House this afternoon, following backlash over the president's outreach to Gold Star families. As some of you may know, General Kelly's own son was killed in Afghanistan while serving in the marines. He rarely speaks about losing a child to war. But today, he issued a sobering message to those politicizing the deaths of the brave servicemen who died fighting for their country.",

      "sentences": "He called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could. And he said to me, what do I say? I said to him, sir, there's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families. But let me tell you what I tell them. Let me tell you what my best friend told me because he was my casualty officer. He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we're at war. And when he died, in the four cases we're talking about Niger, my son case in Afghanistan, when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this earth, his friends. That's what the president tried to say to four families the other day.  I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, broken-hearted, at what I saw and member of congress doing. A member of congress who listened in on the phone call from the president of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion. That he was a brave man, a fallen hero. He knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted, there's no reason to enlist, he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken. That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted. It stuns me that a member of congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. Life, the dignity of life, was sacred. That's gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.  I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred. I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America that let's not let this maybe last thing that is sacred in our society. A young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country. Let's try to somehow keep that sacred. But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of congress.",

People join the military because they think it would be a great way to serve their country. Good way to learn and to become leaders like General John Kelly has proven to be. And grief is uniquely personal. So is the consoling part of grief. So if you're in that position and you have to figure out a way that you have the responsibility to reach out in some way as we've said all week, it could be a letter, it could a phone call, whatever it is, that is very private moment. And I wish that none of this had ever happened all week. I think we all know why we are here at this moment. Frederica Wilson, the congresswoman who is at the subject of this issue, she has just told Politico that General Kelly is trying to keep his job. He will say anything.

There's no longer a no-go zone in the media. We will go anywhere. Wherever the story takes us. The controversy is disgusting. No one walks away from this feeling good.

When I heard Kelly talk today that what's really he reminded me of. He looked like an adult lecturing children out there. And he's a huge asset. Trump should deploy him much more. Reince Priebus couldn't never pulled this off. So my hat is off to General Kelly. Now to be fair and balance, totally unnecessary for the president the other day to come out and say, well, I make calls, some other presidents don't call. Those calls are so hard to make. We've seen the president say how hard they are to make. He told me personally how hard they are to make.  And it goes back to, I believe, John Kelly told the president, that President Obama never called him when his son died in combat in Afghanistan. But I don't want to pick that wound any more. And I think that's over. I think the president knows that President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, all have a very special bond with the men that serve our country and their families as well. And that it doesn't need to be questioned, but I think President Trump has a need to contrast himself with past presidents of both parties, Republican and Democrat, in almost all of the time it serves him very well and in this case it didn't.   But this congresswoman totally disrespected the sanctity of this call. This is a solemn moment between the commander in chief and a grieving family. It's a private moment. It's an extremely personal moment. And to snoop in that call, where the president was saying how brave Sergeant Johnson was knowing that he would put his life at risk to serve the country, yet still did that. And he did it in his Trump's blunt way, I'm sure, and she completely mischaracterized it, totally disrespectful, and I doubt her sincerity about defending military families, because her voting record, she's voted against giving widows money for burial rights. She voted against funding the V.A. veterans benefits. She does not have her money where her mouth is.",

The question mark that remains is why did it take 48 hours to find the body of Sergeant La David Johnson. That is a mystery. That at this point they are trying to sort through the facts, that's why they have sent a team to Niger to interview witnesses.  But what we learned today and in the last few hours from General McKenzie is that there were French troops, Niger troops, as well as U.S. troops on the ground during that entire 48-hour period. They had a beacon, we understand, that was pinging in those first hours after the gunfight occurred once Sergeant Johnson got separated from his teammates. And in the chaos, somehow he got separated, and that pinging beacon, if you will, that special operators sometimes have on them, they weren't sure whether he was a hostage, whether he was involved in some sort of evasion operation.  And so they didn't want to put out any statements in those initial hours, and even in the first two days, because they didn't want to jeopardize his life. They eventually found him. They recovered the body. And that's where we are at this point. The investigation is ongoing. There's frustration on Capitol Hill. We've heard from Senator McCain today, bipartisan frustration that they haven't been briefed enough. But from what I can tell you, talking to Pentagon officials, and Africa officials, the problem with operating in Africa, the distances are great, the communications are difficult, and they don't always have surveillance and drones up above when these troops go out to engage in these remote areas.",

Remember, the French troops went in to Mali when ISIS and these al Qaeda linked groups, and remember ISIS and al Qaeda are really overlapping groups in this sub Saharan Africa, because on one day they change their shirts and call themselves ISIS. On another day they're al Qaeda. But the French troops three years ago, went in when ISIS have taken over northern part of Mali, they had traditional ties to that area. And after that, there was a realization that as ISIS was being pushed out of the Middle East, out of Syria and Iraq that they were popping up in these African countries. So we have green berets, Special Forces on the ground in Niger working with local forces as they do in many African countries to try and stop these ISIS affiliates, these al Qaeda affiliates, these jihadists from popping up and taking over ungoverned spaces. That's why they're there. There are about 100 green berets there. There about 800 U.S. troops all together. They've set up drone bases. In fact, they're two drone bases in Niger.

Quote, \"It really does now look like President Donald J. Trump. And markets are plunging. When might we expect them to recover? A first-pass answer is never.\" That's pretty awesome for a garden gnome. But he's no garden gnome. He's a Nobel Prize-winning economist. A garden gnome could run circles around this bearded butthead. And every time he gets it wrong, he gets a raise. So he must be loaded now, as the stock market broke 23,000 and filings for unemployment benefits plunged to the lowest level since 1973. So will Paulie admit how wrong he was? I doubt it. Look at him. Put simply, so many would rather see the economy crash than admit Trump's made it great. Just like those who'd rather ignore the defeat of ISIS than admit Trump's direct approach worked. Or that his straight talk on North Korea has finally gotten China to act. But the Krugmans of the world see Trump behind every rainy day. After all, just weeks ago, Krugman blamed Trump for a nonexistent cholera outbreak in Puerto Rico. He deserves another prize for that, too. Or a pink slip. Bottom line: So many in the media have made a mint out of picking at wounds. Stories about kneeling, oppression, division, phone calls. But turn off that noise for a minute and ask yourself: Has America changed much since the election as the economy grows and ISIS dies? Yes, it got better. You know, I was thinking, you know, he is so wrong. Krugman is so wrong he deserves another -- another Nobel Prize, Dana. So me and Sean created an application video to the Nobel committee for Krugman, featuring his greatest comments. Roll it!",

Eric Holder signs off on the deal. Meanwhile, Eric Holder's own FBI, run by Comey and Miller at the time -- Mueller, were aware of this investigation into the bribery and extortion scheme. And they sat on it and did nothing. And they tried to silence some one that wanted to come out and talk about it. I also saw this, the Associated Press reported more than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary while she was secretary of state donated to her foundation. So she's playing the access game. Now it looks like she's playing the influence game. There's some charges that they could bring up her, besides the racketeering. You have anti-corruption laws, a slew of them that you could throw at this case. And I'm waiting. Do you think they're going to do anything about it? Knowing Hillary, probably not.",

But first, chief of staff John Kelly issuing an emotional defense at the White House this afternoon, following backlash over the president's outreach to Gold Star families. As some of you may know, General Kelly's own son was killed in Afghanistan while serving in the marines. He rarely speaks about losing a child to war. But today, he issued a sobering message to those politicizing the deaths of the brave servicemen who died fighting for their country."

I said to him, sir, there's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families. But let me tell you what I tell them. Let me tell you what my best friend told me because he was my casualty officer. He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we're at war. And when he died, in the four cases we're talking about Niger, my son case in Afghanistan, when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this earth, his friends. That's what the president tried to say to four families the other day. I was stunned when I came to work yesterday morning, broken-hearted, at what I saw and member of congress doing. A member of congress who listened in on the phone call from the president of the United States to a young wife, and in his way tried to express that opinion. That he was a brave man, a fallen hero. He knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted, there's no reason to enlist, he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken. That was the message. That was the message that was transmitted. It stuns me that a member of congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. Life, the dignity of life, was sacred. That's gone. Religion, that seems to be gone as well. Gold Star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer. I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred. I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America that let's not let this maybe last thing that is sacred in our society. A young man, young woman going out and giving his or her life for our country. Let's try to somehow keep that sacred. But it eroded a great deal yesterday by the selfish behavior of a member of congress."

People join the military because they think it would be a great way to serve their country. Good way to learn and to become leaders like General John Kelly has proven to be. And grief is uniquely personal. So is the consoling part of grief. So if you're in that position and you have to figure out a way that you have the responsibility to reach out in some way as we've said all week, it could be a letter, it could a phone call, whatever it is, that is very private moment. And I wish that none of this had ever happened all week. I think we all know why we are here at this moment. Frederica Wilson, the congresswoman who is at the subject of this issue, she has just told Politico that General Kelly is trying to keep his job. He will say anything.

I mean, he was clearly directing this at Frederica Wilson, no colorful hat is going to hide her shame after that -- after that thing. But this thing has snowballed into this ghoulish political theater, in part because of the media, because we have no interest in stopping this snowball. So we just keep adding on. We love picking at the scabs, you know. And this is a scab. And we keep picking at it. And so, that helps, that encourages people to call up these families and make this a story. There's no longer a no-go zone in the media. We will go anywhere. Wherever the story takes us. The controversy is disgusting. No one walks away from this feeling good. And I just wish that maybe the best thing that General Kelly did, which was beautiful what he did, was that he put a period at the end of this sentence, but it sounds like Frederica wants to keep talking."

      "utterance": "It is. I mean, I think America is in good hands with John Kelly as the White House chief of staff. People said Kimmel was the conscience of the nation. When I heard Kelly talk today that what's really he reminded me of. He looked like an adult lecturing children out there. And he's a huge asset. Trump should deploy him much more. Reince Priebus couldn't never pulled this off. So my hat is off to General Kelly. Now to be fair and balance, totally unnecessary for the president the other day to come out and say, well, I make calls, some other presidents don't call. Those calls are so hard to make. We've seen the president say how hard they are to make. He told me personally how hard they are to make. And it goes back to, I believe, John Kelly told the president, that President Obama never called him when his son died in combat in Afghanistan. But I don't want to pick that wound any more. And I think that's over. I think the president knows that President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, all have a very special bond with the men that serve our country and their families as well. And that it doesn't need to be questioned, but I think President Trump has a need to contrast himself with past presidents of both parties, Republican and Democrat, in almost all of the time it serves him very well and in this case it didn't. But this congresswoman totally disrespected the sanctity of this call. This is a solemn moment between the commander in chief and a grieving family. It's a private moment. It's an extremely personal moment. And to snoop in that call, where the president was saying how brave Sergeant Johnson was knowing that he would put his life at risk to serve the country, yet still did that. And he did it in his Trump's blunt way, I'm sure, and she completely mischaracterized it, totally disrespectful, and I doubt her sincerity about defending military families, because her voting record, she's voted against giving widows money for burial rights. She voted against funding the V.A. veterans benefits. She does not have her money where her mouth is."

You can imagine everybody in the car gets quiet, the president of the United States is on the phone with the widow. But initially, it was said, oh, no, he never said that. Oh, OK. Well then, you know, Frederica Wilson, maybe it is political. Who knows? But then he suggested, oh, Frederica Wilson better watch herself, and maybe the thought was there's a tape. He taped the phone call. No, it turns out he didn't. I don't know.

What's interesting is that often the family members become the consolers to the commander in chief. And it is true -- and I've heard it myself, you sometimes will have a mom or a dad say, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do. He knew that he was serving his country and that there was danger involved, but he would have done it again. Or you go to Walter Reed, where you have the wounded, the first thing they say to the president when they come in, I want to get back there with my guys, I want to go back and fight again, because that's the kind of leaders that we have trained in our military.

I don't believe that. I don't think people actually really believe that. I think you want to see it in the way that is beneficial to the left that can't give the president credit for anything.

      "utterance": "Well, Dana, I think the most important thing is that not only Defense Secretary Mattis, but also Lt. General Frank McKenzie, just came to the briefing room. And they are pushing back very hard on this narrative that evolved in the last few days that somehow the U.S. troops there on the ground left a fallen comrade behind. The question mark that remains is why did it take 48 hours to find the body of Sergeant La David Johnson. That is a mystery. That at this point they are trying to sort through the facts, that's why they have sent a team to Niger to interview witnesses. But what we learned today and in the last few hours from General McKenzie is that there were French troops, Niger troops, as well as U.S. troops on the ground during that entire 48-hour period. They had a beacon, we understand, that was pinging in those first hours after the gunfight occurred once Sergeant Johnson got separated from his teammates. And in the chaos, somehow he got separated, and that pinging beacon, if you will, that special operators sometimes have on them, they weren't sure whether he was a hostage, whether he was involved in some sort of evasion operation. And so they didn't want to put out any statements in those initial hours, and even in the first two days, because they didn't want to jeopardize his life. They eventually found him. They recovered the body. And that's where we are at this point. The investigation is ongoing. There's frustration on Capitol Hill. We've heard from Senator McCain today, bipartisan frustration that they haven't been briefed enough. But from what I can tell you, talking to Pentagon officials, and Africa officials, the problem with operating in Africa, the distances are great, the communications are difficult, and they don't always have surveillance and drones up above when these troops go out to engage in these remote areas."

      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",

Remember, the French troops went in to Mali when ISIS and these al Qaeda linked groups, and remember ISIS and al Qaeda are really overlapping groups in this sub Saharan Africa, because on one day they change their shirts and call themselves ISIS. On another day they're al Qaeda. But the French troops three years ago, went in when ISIS have taken over northern part of Mali, they had traditional ties to that area. And after that, there was a realization that as ISIS was being pushed out of the Middle East, out of Syria and Iraq that they were popping up in these African countries. So we have green berets, Special Forces on the ground in Niger working with local forces as they do in many African countries to try and stop these ISIS affiliates, these al Qaeda affiliates, these jihadists from popping up and taking over ungoverned spaces. That's why they're there. There are about 100 green berets there. There about 800 U.S. troops all together. They've set up drone bases. In fact, they're two drone bases in Niger.

I think we're seeing a narrative being constructed now, that it's the Trump administration is stonewalling, and I get the sense that it's a Benghazi payback. It's an albatross to be tied around Trump's neck the way Benghazi was around Obama. But my question is -- you brought up drones and technology, and this is always my thing, is that why aren't drones sent ahead? And it seems in these certain situations a drone upfront -- I assume that was already happening and that would be a question here is why there isn't a drone set in front to see -- because they can see everything."

We would become a very, very cautious military, if we had to have a drone up above every time a soldier went on a mission. And so, there's some places it's more feasible, they're setting up drone bases in Niger for that reason. But this was seen as a very routine operation. They had done 29 of these missions in the last six months to no avail. And you've heard Secretary Mattis say today, this was not an intelligence failure because they had deemed that they did not believe there was going to be any hostile contact.

We are not allowed to employ offensive air cover that would have protected these troops. We had to call on the French. Is this the heart and soul of the issue at this moment?"

So this notion that you can't fly anything armed up above once an incident like this takes place, I'm not sure if that's true. The question about armed drones, that's another question.

A first-pass answer is never.\" That's pretty awesome for a garden gnome. But he's no garden gnome. He's a Nobel Prize-winning economist. A garden gnome could run circles around this bearded butthead. And every time he gets it wrong, he gets a raise. So he must be loaded now, as the stock market broke 23,000 and filings for unemployment benefits plunged to the lowest level since 1973. So will Paulie admit how wrong he was? I doubt it. Look at him. Put simply, so many would rather see the economy crash than admit Trump's made it great. Just like those who'd rather ignore the defeat of ISIS than admit Trump's direct approach worked. Or that his straight talk on North Korea has finally gotten China to act. But the Krugmans of the world see Trump behind every rainy day.

And they sat on it and did nothing. And they tried to silence some one that wanted to come out and talk about it. I also saw this, the Associated Press reported more than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary while she was secretary of state donated to her foundation.

This is where the committee of the government looks at whether or not to approve these deals. And he sends another -- he basically is rebuffed. He sends another letter in 2011, nothing. May of 2015. There is actually, I think, a case to be made that it's possible the Obama administration was either just not paying attention, either didn't know what was going on, or was deliberately stalling a member of Congress.

She has to leave the CIA; she doesn't get the job. But she got adopted by her handler, and now she gets to play with the kids and with the squirrels and other dogs. That's a dog named Harry.
