Makes sense: When you're young or famous, you never have to connect any dots between belief and behavior, between truth and consequences. You're either really, really rich or mom and dad are footing the bill.  For celebrities it's far worse. The arrested development that comes with early fame creates a loathing insecurity about their own intellectual death. Liberalism is the soothing ointment. For a student it's just easier to fit in mouthing all that crud.   But before we mock them, consider the Republican counterparts. The doom [SIC] -- the dorms, they get Miley and Katy. The conservatives get Chuck Norris and Ted Nugent. See, we have stars, too. They're just older. I guess it takes celebrities decades to see the error of their ways. But what's really ironic is how these outspoken pop singers fail to see the stereotype they gladly fill. Their assimilation into cultish obedience to leftism is so swift. How rebellious is that? And what of our greatest rebel? Last week Madonna promised to have sex with you if you vote for Hillary, which could be why Hillary's lead just shrunk.",
