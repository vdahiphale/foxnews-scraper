It's 5:00 in New York City, this is THE FIVE. Liberal cities spending millions to fight the homeless crisis, but the problem, it just keeps getting worse. There are heart breaking images of those living in deplorable conditions on the streets becoming all too common. As Democrat leaders get accused of dumping billions of taxpayer dollars into failed programs that do little to solve the issue, we ran through the numbers and the amounts spent are just staggering. Look at this, San Francisco spends an astonishing $100,000 for homeless person. New York shells out $58,000 per year for homeless person, but it hasn't helped. A recent report says homelessness in the Big Apple has reached the highest level since the Great Depression, and Chicago spends about $9,000 per homeless person. The unmanageable homelessness problem in the Windy City putting McDonald CEO in a tough spot. They've been trying to entice employees back to headquarters in Chicago and called on city and business leaders to address problems that have arisen since the pandemic.",

And that's why if you don't have law and order, then what you have is anarchy, and then you have businesses that are not going to be able to survive. This homelessness, in addition to the look that is unsavory, I mean, I know people that we send to jail for less than $106,000, which is what they pay in San Francisco. So, I mean, the issue is what are we going to do with these people? Some of these are criminals, there's no question about it, who have mental health that illicit (ph) at the genesis of whatever crime they are involved in. But everything is in crisis. It's a violent crime. It's drug abuse. It's the overall depression. And we've gone back as a nation a good three or four decades in terms of inflation and crime, and now this homelessness, which just is like the topping on the cake, and it's a sad situation. And there is nothing else that we can do except make sure that people who run these cities understand that it's not just about safety anymore. It's about everything that spins off of law and order.",

I don't think the conversation about homelessness actually exists because you have to speak these unspeakable truths, but that means you have to be risk -- you have to risk being called uncompassionate, heartless, and cold. But you to -- the unspeakable truths are this. A majority of law-abiding citizens are at the mercy of a few thousand, 10,000, 50,000, maybe half a million nationwide, of people who exist independent of our rules, laws, and manners, right? We have defined a heinous lifestyle, homelessness, as a lifestyle choice, right? And I'm saying exempt from like the tiny exceptions, right? I'm talking largely men -- when you see these pictures, they are mostly men. They are not hanging out like the jovial transients and hobos that you used to see in cartoons.

You can't bring your property into the shelter either because that -- because they don't allow that. So, you prefer to be outside with your bags of stuff and do your drugs. All you got to do is spend one afternoon in New York City and you see the reality and it flies in the face of everybody there that it tells you, you have to be more compassionate because their compassion is allowing this to happen. Throwing money at that -- they're like the tourists that give that, the healthy beggar with the little dog, money, and that beggar is in front of your house. And it's like I want to go to your damn house where you are in Germany or Spain and do the same thing and see how you feel because all you do is you keep these people here making money. I do have a solution. It is a progressive solution. Give the homeless what they want because there is no way you can have a conversation with them. You can't reason with the unreasonable. Give them what they want, but not in the city. The city allows this to happen. Move it out onto government property and let them run it. Camp away. Give them the autonomy to truly run their lives into the ground, harm each other, don't harm us anymore. That's the only thing you can do because it can't get any worse than it is now.

I'd like to speak directly to the homeless people right now. Take some money, go get an hour in a hotel. Take a shower, do a shave, then go to the barbershop. Have a get a little haircut. Then go to the thrift shop, buy new clothes, get a bus ticket, and get the hell out of the city and away from all of these drugs.

He said when women left the home and entered the workforce, the parents both of them then stopped paying attention to what was happening at their children's schools.

It's 5:00 in New York City, this is THE FIVE. Liberal cities spending millions to fight the homeless crisis, but the problem, it just keeps getting worse. There are heart breaking images of those living in deplorable conditions on the streets becoming all too common. As Democrat leaders get accused of dumping billions of taxpayer dollars into failed programs that do little to solve the issue, we ran through the numbers and the amounts spent are just staggering. Look at this, San Francisco spends an astonishing $100,000 for homeless person. New York shells out $58,000 per year for homeless person, but it hasn't helped. A recent report says homelessness in the Big Apple has reached the highest level since the Great Depression, and Chicago spends about $9,000 per homeless person. The unmanageable homelessness problem in the Windy City putting McDonald CEO in a tough spot. They've been trying to entice employees back to headquarters in Chicago and called on city and business leaders to address problems that have arisen since the pandemic."

      "utterance": "Everywhere I go I am confronted by the same question these days. What's going on in Chicago? There is a general sense out there that our city is in crisis. The truth is it's more difficult today for me to convince a promising McDonald's executive to relocate to Chicago from one of our other offices than it was just a few years ago."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Judge, we can talk about any American city, but you know Chicago very well and what he's saying, do you think that's happening for other businesses as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And I give him credit. I absolutely give the CEO of McDonald's credit for actually making an issue of this. Look, the big cities are in crisis but not just the cities and the people who live there, but businesses are now recognizing the impact that crime has on their bottom line. And that's why if you don't have law and order, then what you have is anarchy, and then you have businesses that are not going to be able to survive. This homelessness, in addition to the look that is unsavory, I mean, I know people that we send to jail for less than $106,000, which is what they pay in San Francisco. So, I mean, the issue is what are we going to do with these people? Some of these are criminals, there's no question about it, who have mental health that illicit (ph) at the genesis of whatever crime they are involved in. But everything is in crisis. It's a violent crime. It's drug abuse. It's the overall depression. And we've gone back as a nation a good three or four decades in terms of inflation and crime, and now this homelessness, which just is like the topping on the cake, and it's a sad situation. And there is nothing else that we can do except make sure that people who run these cities understand that it's not just about safety anymore. It's about everything that spins off of law and order."

Liberals love throwing money at problems because it's not their money, it's our money and they get to parade themselves based on this phony compassion that they're doing something, 800 and somewhat million dollars went to this thrive program in New York, we never saw it again. I don't think the conversation about homelessness actually exists because you have to speak these unspeakable truths, but that means you have to be risk -- you have to risk being called uncompassionate, heartless, and cold. But you to -- the unspeakable truths are this. A majority of law-abiding citizens are at the mercy of a few thousand, 10,000, 50,000, maybe half a million nationwide, of people who exist independent of our rules, laws, and manners, right? We have defined a heinous lifestyle, homelessness, as a lifestyle choice, right? And I'm saying exempt from like the tiny exceptions, right? I'm talking largely men -- when you see these pictures, they are mostly men. They are not hanging out like the jovial transients and hobos that you used to see in cartoons. These are strung out, manic, unfriendly, aggressive people. And you are lucky if they are unconscious because then they won't hurt you."

      "utterance": "I walk this city all the time. I drive up in the morning. I count them, I recognized them, I know them. They prefer the shelter -- they don't prefer shelters to the streets because you can't do drugs and score drugs in shelters. That's why they are out there. That's a choice, right? You can't bring your property into the shelter either because that -- because they don't allow that. So, you prefer to be outside with your bags of stuff and do your drugs. All you got to do is spend one afternoon in New York City and you see the reality and it flies in the face of everybody there that it tells you, you have to be more compassionate because their compassion is allowing this to happen. Throwing money at that -- they're like the tourists that give that, the healthy beggar with the little dog, money, and that beggar is in front of your house. And it's like I want to go to your damn house where you are in Germany or Spain and do the same thing and see how you feel because all you do is you keep these people here making money. I do have a solution. It is a progressive solution. Give the homeless what they want because there is no way you can have a conversation with them. You can't reason with the unreasonable. Give them what they want, but not in the city. The city allows this to happen. Move it out onto government property and let them run it. Camp away. Give them the autonomy to truly run their lives into the ground, harm each other, don't harm us anymore. That's the only thing you can do because it can't get any worse than it is now. You got to move them to a place where they can live their lives."

The San Francisco officials also use taxpayer dollars to buy liquor and beer for the homeless people, and then they got caught. Look what they're doing in all of these non-for-profits. The profits are all going to the scam artists that run them. They take in $10 million to help the homeless, and what do they do with the money? This woman went on a shopping spree to Tiffany's, Ferragamo, Bergdorf Goodman, I know you're shaking your head. You've been there a few times, judge.

They actually don't want to reduce homelessness. They want to keep the people on the streets so they can fleece the taxpayers. It's all a big grift. Why are there so many homeless people right now? Well, they emptied the prisons. They shut down the economy. They brought in all these illegal aliens. And they've decriminalized drugs. So, what do you expect to happen? I understand Greg's point. I'd like to speak directly to the homeless people right now. Take some money, go get an hour in a hotel. Take a shower, do a shave, then go to the barbershop. Have a get a little haircut. Then go to the thrift shop, buy new clothes, get a bus ticket, and get the hell out of the city and away from all of these drugs. Then get yourself a job, go to sleep, read a book, take a walk, do some push-ups, drink some water, save a little money from each paycheck, and then call your parents because your parents will come take you in."

      "speaker": "RIVERA",
      "utterance": "Yeah, because the bitter irony, Dana, is that the more services you provide, the more homeless people there'll be. Plus, who doesn't want to live in San Francisco or Venice Beach? You know, I remember during ed Koch's administration, they used to give out bus tickets. Where do you want to go? Any place but here. And Jesse's idea is not that outrageous. The whole notion -- it goes with Greg's ideas of not in the city. Any place you want to go, we'll give you a place -- a way to get there. Not unlike Texas and Florida are doing right now. But I think the idea of some kind of encampment, some kind of idyllic place, someplace -- but you have to have some payback. You have to have some responsibility. For instance, my big beef with progressives is they demand nothing of the recipient. Why not sobriety? Why not drug abuse counseling? Why not getting yourself cleaned up? You know, you can't have anyone evolving out of that sorry condition unless you give them some responsibility."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

Imagine being like loud, you are homeless, you have a mental illness, you're a drug -- loud noises, buses, trains, everything, why are you here when you can actually be -- there is a reason why people go to nature and that is something that could be done. But again, you sound like you're speaking out of lack of compassion by saying move them out. No, we're saying that they're not helping themselves. They're destroying themselves and others."

Here's the thing, the burglary, it's a residential burglary which in California, the most that you can serve is six years according to their penal statute of residential burglary. And it occurs on September 9th. They make it an arrest on September 13th. Now that's a pretty good -- that's a pretty good closure rate. So, I said let me check the closure rate in San Francisco as it relates to burglaries. Los Angeles, I'm sorry. The closure rate is 9 percent. That means 91 percent of the cases are not solved. But her case is solved. Why is her case solved? Why is her place in disarray when there are valuables, there's cash, there's all kinds of -- what did she say, electronics that were available? And they go to a lockbox. So, I look up a Brinx, the lockbox. It doesn't have a mirror on it. It doesn't say gun. It's just a box that she said is stashed in the closet. How do they know what's in the box that's in the closet that's stashed and they forego everything else? There's something screwy about this and I got to tell you, I got another point here. I felt so safe in this city. You uncaring public servant. If -- yeah, I'm going to call her uncaring. If you don't feel the pain that your constituents' pain -- feel, and you're in congress, now you're looking to run for mayor, then you don't deserve to represent the people, because the people in your jurisdiction are suffering from crime and criminality."

They are too busy hobnobbing with teachers' union boss, Randi Weingarten, who posted this photo, of course, of herself at Biden's inflation party. And talk about bad optics. Biden's unmasked education secretary recently visited schools packed with masked kids and they insist they were just following protocol.

The Democrats said butt out and if you raise your voice, we're going to spy on you. Now, Randi Weingarten is showing up there. That's probably she's a fan of James Taylor. That's all that is. She loves James Taylor and she was rewarded by Biden for, you know, getting out the vote. So, she's a political player. That's all that is. Steve Jobs, do you remember him. Said something very interesting many, many years ago that if he said today, he'd be called a sexist. He said when women left the home and entered the workforce, the parents both of them then stopped paying attention to what was happening at their children's schools. And that's when the school really started to go downhill because the consumer, or the customer, the person paying the taxes to get the education had no idea what was going on behind the counter. And so, the teachers and the administrators started pushing all this crazy stuff. And the next thing you know the pandemic comes in you're looking at zoom, you're like, that's what my child's learning? So, this is now better that they're now also focused on the schools like we used to not."

I mean, we didn't know -- in science, we were bumbling our way through and the results were catastrophic for the children, obviously. But I think that people make a mistake. They don't differentiate between the teachers and the teachers union, so it's a very, very different. When you look at Randi Weingarten, it's easy to say, oh, remember why we idealize teachers. They work for less, they put the kids first, they often sacrifice. They buy the erases themselves out of their own meager funds and so forth. The teachers union though can be ruthless. I mean, no one can suggest for a minute that the stay out in Chicago, for instance, was motivated by science. I mean, they went -- remember they wanted to put in a new ventilating system. They put a new ventilation system and then they had to do other you know -- until it became ridiculous. So, don't confuse it. The teachers union is just like the -- it's just like every other union. They're there to get the most -- the trains now, the strike just averted today. They're out in a $24 raises per hour. You know, I like the unions. I love unions. Unions are great for workers. Unions raise the level of the standard of living, but remember what it is. Randi Weingarten is not Mrs. Flores who brings you the cookies? She's a labor boss."

They damaged our kids. They don't give a damn about what happened to our kids they only care about themselves, as evidenced by the fact that the Education Secretary Cardona was speaking to kids, a whole room had -- the kids have masks on, he didn't have a mask on, which was a replay of Stacey Abrams in Georgia when don't mask, another Democrat, talking to kids who were all masked up.

You're going to fight climate change, but nobody's talking about China. All they want to do is talk about capitalism and how that's a problem. China is building like 10 nuclear -- coal-fired power plants a week. And they don't have to do anything until 2030 to start reducing emissions. Like, we believe they will even do that.
