But will it cost into those profits and cut into those jobs? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  First, I would like to thank my colleagues and friends, Deirdre Bolton, Sandra Smith, and Charles Payne, for filling in while I was out.  Thanks, guys.  Well, Elizabeth Warren isn't the only Democrat pushing tax hikes to pay for social and related programs, but where she is targeting and from whom she hopes to get the money, well, that's a different story. FOX Business Network's Susan Li has been crunching those numbers -- Susan.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil, welcome back. So, according to Elizabeth Warren, no loopholes, no exemptions, according to her new tax policy, with a 7 percent proposed corporate tax on those big, big companies with revenues above $100 million. And that's on top, by the way, of the corporate taxes that they already owe, which should be at above 21 percent, and that, she says, could net the government a trillion dollars.  Now, Amazon made headlines because they paid zero corporate taxes last year, according to some reports, but, under Warren's plan, they would pay close to $700 million. Now, Warren isn't the only 2020 Democratic candidate that wants more money from the powerful and the wealthy.   That includes Bernie Sanders. He wants a higher estate tax to start at a lower rate of $3.5 million in inheritance. And that goes up to 77 percent if you're going to inherit something over a billion dollars. Now, Bernie Sanders is also calling for a payroll tax hike and also a death tax increase as well. And very similarly to Kirsten Gillibrand, he also wants to tax trade. So, Gillibrand here is proposing a half-percent levy on stock trades and also a 0.1 percent levy on bond trades. So that would impact the investor and the capital markets here in the U.S. And we have Kamala Harris, and she says she wants to provide more tax credits and more credits for the lower income, but she wants to reel back some of those tax cuts. And in the end, they're looking to, as they say, soak the rich to pay for the poor -- back to you, Neil.",

That money wouldn't be there, because the whole reason Amazon didn't pay taxes is because they were able to instantly expense this year in the new tax code a lot of the cap-backs. So, if what she actually wants to propose is that we take away incentives for capital expenditures, if she's really willing to do that to the productivity of the economy, there wouldn't be those profits to tax, let alone all the downstream implications for jobs and wage growth.

So, God bless him. He was saying for all his big plans, I have got to find a way to pay for it. Now, whether the math added up in his case a few years ago is just as questionable as what these candidates, whether it does today.

Maybe we shouldn't totally do away with the entire system. But with that said, the goalposts have moved in the Democratic primary, there's no question. Now it's really a litmus test that you have to sign on to this concept. And I think that campaigns are more value statements than they actually are the financial statements in many respects.

Along with Congressman John Ratcliffe, they are prepared to brief Mr. Barr in person on the evidence for allegations of conspiracy, lying, misleading, obstructing congressional investigators that has grown out of their two- year Russia investigation. Also, a seven-page Virginia indictment was unsealed earlier today accusing Julian Assange of one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history. It states that the WikiLeaks founder engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army, to crack a Defense Department computer network password. In addition, Julian Assange and his lawyer put out a statement today defending his client as a reporter and publisher of accurate information. It reads in part -- quote -- \"Once his\" -- Assange's -- \"health care needs have been addressed, the U.K. courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information.\"  Also today, a high-profile Democrat, Greg Craig, was indicted for lying over his lobbying work in the Ukraine.

So it's much closer to what maybe Jane Fonda did or what other actual spies did, and it resulted directly, I would argue, in deaths out on the battlefield. And then, separately, more strategically, Neil, it's important to understand the effect. Post-9/11, we determined that we weren't connecting the dots between agencies. So we made a big move to share information and make that information very accessible to those out on the battlefield that needed it very quickly. Well, then you have Bradley Manning that -- to go in and take advantage of that and expose it to our enemies. So the result is then all that information became compartmentalized again, making it much harder for all of us to fight the war on terror and to be successful in keeping Americans safe.

It's up to the president to decide who he wants in these agencies to advise him, but the fact the matter is what's fueling this crisis are loopholes and legal precedents that reward and incentivize unaccompanied children and people coming into this country as family units.

So we have to first create a -- have a more accurate initial determination, so that we only -- so that the people that actually are let into this country based on asylum claim have a far greater opportunity of having that be a valid claim. Otherwise, we have to be able to hold those individuals, make that determination. And if they don't have a valid asylum claim, we have to return them to the home country.

But will it cost into those profits and cut into those jobs? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. First, I would like to thank my colleagues and friends, Deirdre Bolton, Sandra Smith, and Charles Payne, for filling in while I was out. Thanks, guys. Well, Elizabeth Warren isn't the only Democrat pushing tax hikes to pay for social and related programs, but where she is targeting and from whom she hopes to get the money, well, that's a different story. FOX Business Network's Susan Li has been crunching those numbers -- Susan."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil, welcome back. So, according to Elizabeth Warren, no loopholes, no exemptions, according to her new tax policy, with a 7 percent proposed corporate tax on those big, big companies with revenues above $100 million. And that's on top, by the way, of the corporate taxes that they already owe, which should be at above 21 percent, and that, she says, could net the government a trillion dollars. Now, Amazon made headlines because they paid zero corporate taxes last year, according to some reports, but, under Warren's plan, they would pay close to $700 million. Now, Warren isn't the only 2020 Democratic candidate that wants more money from the powerful and the wealthy. That includes Bernie Sanders. He wants a higher estate tax to start at a lower rate of $3.5 million in inheritance. And that goes up to 77 percent if you're going to inherit something over a billion dollars. Now, Bernie Sanders is also calling for a payroll tax hike and also a death tax increase as well. And very similarly to Kirsten Gillibrand, he also wants to tax trade. So, Gillibrand here is proposing a half-percent levy on stock trades and also a 0.1 percent levy on bond trades. So that would impact the investor and the capital markets here in the U.S. And we have Kamala Harris, and she says she wants to provide more tax credits and more credits for the lower income, but she wants to reel back some of those tax cuts. And in the end, they're looking to, as they say, soak the rich to pay for the poor -- back to you, Neil."

Democratic strategist Zach Friend. We have also got The National Review contributor David Bahnsen, and last, but not least, The Wall Street Journal's resident genius Mary O'Grady.

    {
      "speaker": "DAVID BAHNSEN, NATIONAL REVIEW",
      "utterance": "Yes, but in this case, her point is exactly right, what Mary said. That money wouldn't be there, because the whole reason Amazon didn't pay taxes is because they were able to instantly expense this year in the new tax code a lot of the cap-backs. So, if what she actually wants to propose is that we take away incentives for capital expenditures, if she's really willing to do that to the productivity of the economy, there wouldn't be those profits to tax, let alone all the downstream implications for jobs and wage growth. It's a just completely unserious idea."

But, again, one of the things I did point out Zach, is that, look, Bernie Sanders was famous for this in his last run, that he said he wasn't going to just tax the rich, he was going to bring it down a little to some in the middle class. So, God bless him. He was saying for all his big plans, I have got to find a way to pay for it. Now, whether the math added up in his case a few years ago is just as questionable as what these candidates, whether it does today. But what do you think that message that's being sent for a general election nominee, not the person who ultimately gets the nomination, where this is popular?"

Maybe we shouldn't totally do away with the entire system. But with that said, the goalposts have moved in the Democratic primary, there's no question. Now it's really a litmus test that you have to sign on to this concept. And I think that campaigns are more value statements than they actually are the financial statements in many respects.

Also, a seven-page Virginia indictment was unsealed earlier today accusing Julian Assange of one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history. It states that the WikiLeaks founder engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army, to crack a Defense Department computer network password. In addition, Julian Assange and his lawyer put out a statement today defending his client as a reporter and publisher of accurate information. It reads in part -- quote -- \"Once his\" -- Assange's -- \"health care needs have been addressed, the U.K. courts will need to resolve what appears to be an unprecedented effort by the United States seeking to extradite a foreign journalist to face criminal charges for publishing truthful information.\" Also today, a high-profile Democrat, Greg Craig, was indicted for lying over his lobbying work in the Ukraine.

And I hope the Justice Department throws the book at them. I'm looking forward to seeing them extradited back to the United States. And let's just talk for a second about what they did. They took all of our operational files. As a Green Beret in Afghanistan, we were conducting operations night after night after night against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, later on ISIS. They took all of our operational files, and particularly the sources, the local Afghans that were working with us -- they did this in Iraq as well -- and put them all over the Internet. We know that Al Qaeda had a specific intelligence unit scouring through WikiLeaks and using that -- using that information to then target not only American soldiers, but the local Afghans, the local Iraqis and any other source that we use helping us in the war on terror.

That's very different. We have whistle-blower -- we have whistle-blower laws. What we -- what it didn't do, though, was take operational data, individual names, their locations, where they lived, and expose that in the middle of a -- in the middle of a war. So it's much closer to what maybe Jane Fonda did or what other actual spies did, and it resulted directly, I would argue, in deaths out on the battlefield. And then, separately, more strategically, Neil, it's important to understand the effect. Post-9/11, we determined that we weren't connecting the dots between agencies. So we made a big move to share information and make that information very accessible to those out on the battlefield that needed it very quickly. Well, then you have Bradley Manning that -- to go in and take advantage of that and expose it to our enemies. So the result is then all that information became compartmentalized again, making it much harder for all of us to fight the war on terror and to be successful in keeping Americans safe. So, it not only had tactical ramifications. It had strategic ramifications. And what they did was, they broke the law. They made -- and they made Americans less safe. And they resulted directly in the killing of sources out on the ground."

      "speaker": "THOMAS HOMAN, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "This president is actually walking the walk. So he's actually doing everything can within a legal framework to try to secure the border. Congress isn't helping him. They haven't offered him one fix. The Ninth Circuit is constantly issuing temporary restraining orders on everything he does. But he hasn't given up and he's going to keep changing. That's why I think you're seeing this change right now in DHS. He's hitting the reset button. He wants fresh ideas, fresh people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, that was former ICE Director Tom Homan telling me on FOX Business that the shakeup going on in Homeland Security was done to give the president fresh ideas on what's going on at the border and that we sorely need that right now. That shakeup, though, has some Republicans worried about a major void at the agency. Let's go to the Senate Homeland Security chairman, Senator Ron Johnson. Senator, good to have you back. How are you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. RON JOHNSON, R-WIS.",
      "utterance": "Great, Neil. how about yourself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Fine. Let me ask you, then, about what you make of what former Director Homan is saying here, that there is a crisis at that border. This calls for sweeping action. He said of the president's replacement for Kirstjen Nielsen, Kevin McAleenan, that Kevin will put his foot on the gas, meaning that he will take dramatic action. What do you think that means?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, there absolutely is a humanitarian and national security crisis at the border. Back in 2014, President Trump declared a humanitarian crisis, when 120,000 unaccompanied children and people came into this country illegally as family units. In just the first six months of this year, 240,000 have come. It's overwhelming our system. But from my standpoint, the ball is in Congress' court. It's been the dysfunction in Congress. We have to change Laws. Listen, we need better barriers. It's up to the president to decide who he wants in these agencies to advise him, but the fact the matter is what's fueling this crisis are loopholes and legal precedents that reward and incentivize unaccompanied children and people coming into this country as family units. It's basically, through no fault of their own, reduced CBP to a mere speed bump on the path of long-term residency for unaccompanied children and people coming in as family units. We have to change these laws."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, the fact that there's been what some have called the purge going on at Homeland Security, maybe warranted -- it sounds, from what you're saying, Senator, you believe it is warranted. But will this complicate actions in the meantime at the border at a very difficult time? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I am concerned about a leadership void. I have talked to Mick Mulvaney. This sounds like this was a planned action. I have got a great deal of confidence in the CBP Commissioner and now acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan. He's choosing his team. I think that's probably appropriate. You still have seasoned managers in DHS. So I'm not panicked. I'm concerned, because leadership matters, particularly when you're in the midst of a crisis. But, again, let me emphasize the ball is in Congress' court. The president can't fix this without Congress changing some of these laws."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So we're told, sir, that White House senior adviser Stephen Miller has been very involved in this process, very dissatisfied, and maybe sharing the president's own anger at what's going on at the border. What do you think of the role he could be playing here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the problem with executive action, even if it's proper, even if it's legal, they shop it to a court that overturns his decision or puts an injunction, which, again, emphasizes we have to change these laws. Neil, only about 15 percent of the asylum claims that are made by people coming in as family units are granted. So we have to first create a -- have a more accurate initial determination, so that we only -- so that the people that actually are let into this country based on asylum claim have a far greater opportunity of having that be a valid claim. Otherwise, we have to be able to hold those individuals, make that determination. And if they don't have a valid asylum claim, we have to return them to the home country. That would be a real deterrent. Michael Chertoff faced this with an influx, a surge of Brazilians in 2005, small -- far smaller numbers, but 31,000. He instituted a program of rapid removal called Texas Hold' Em. The next year, only 1,400 came in. So, we know what works. There has to be a consequence. We have to remove people that don't have a valid asylum claim. It has to be rapid, but fair adjudication of those claims."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm wondering what you make, separately, if you will indulge me, sir. The president has two picks for the Federal Reserve that obviously have to get Senate OKs. And the one that just got a fourth no-vote among your Republican colleagues is Herman Cain, a former presidential candidate, fast food titan. Is he toast?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "It will depend on whether he can make it first through the Banking Committee. But he's been a former governor -- governor chair in the past. He is a businessperson. I think he's a capable individual. I'm certainly not disqualifying him. I would want to listen to his testimony. I would want to evaluate him if he comes through the Banking Committee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So I know he's at the limit of no votes among Republicans, assuming he doesn't get a single Democratic vote. I know how divided the Senate is these days and Washington in general. Is it your understanding that there are other Republicans who would similarly say, no, you're not the guy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "I really have no idea. From my standpoint, I kind of wait to see how the nominees work their way through the committees, what information they provide, how they go through that confirmation process. Then I will make my final decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "If you had a choice between the two of them, Steve Moore and Herman Cain, because obviously two rejections for the president would be a bit much, is it your sense it's going to be Steve Moore who will survive all this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Again, I really can't make that prediction. I will -- again, I will wait for these individuals to go through the confirmation process, provide the committees the information, go through the hearings, and then we will make our determination."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Alexa, quit spying on me. There's a new report revealing that thousands of Amazon workers may be listening to what you're saying when you're talking to Alexa. Amazon says that it simply monitors some conversations to improve Alexa's understanding of human speech. But just how concerning is this? Attorney Leeza Garber joins us, Fox News contributor Kat Timpf. Now, Leeza, apparently, the start of this was concerns about picking up comments I believe said among some guys talking in Romania, I believe, that might have been plans for a rape and simply because some of the words sounded like Alexa. I don't know the details that -- you probably know better than I. But that they were just trying to monitor that kind of thing to see what they would do in that event. But what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, this has happened in the U.S. too. Apart from even criminal -- Alexa has been used in criminal cases too, where they were trying to pick up sounds taking place during a murder investigation. But it's happened in the U.S. And the problem is, the way to activate Alexa with certain buzzwords, like Alexa, computer. You have to say it."

Like, instead of photo albums, now we have Facebook. Well, they're selling your data. Now with Alexa, you don't have to get up and turn off the light anymore, but some dude over in wherever knows that you were up at 3:00 a.m. on a Monday wondering what happened to Gunther from friends, right?"

I have some loud neighbors who are constantly fighting over some guy doing the same thing over and over again to this girl. And I know exactly about everything in this saga because they're so loud. And I turn down my TV and I listen on purpose. Is that kind? No, but it's interesting. And if I had this job, I might be interested in seeing what other people are asking Alexa."

Now, I will try to get the benefit of the doubt here that you're trying to perfect the language and talking about something and then seeing what might come up and responding to people who they might be telling Alexa to do something and she's not responding or doing anything. But that's a scary leap."
    },

But on the positive side, it's necessary. It's kind of a necessary evil if you want to take part in using this technology because they need it to get better and better. They have to review it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUJAN",
      "utterance": "Look, Neil, I have said consistently that I believe there's a humanitarian crisis at the border, but one that has been caused by President Trump and his administration with their failed policies. Rather than reaching out to work in a bipartisan basis with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, the president continues to threaten to either shut down the border with Mexico or to cut off funding to the Northern Triangle, to the three countries, or even shutting down to the government over the wall, and now threatening to militarize the border once again. We can find a bipartisan solution to this. The Senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform agreement not long ago, and Speaker Boehner and Speaker Ryan wouldn't let us vote on it. So I'm hopeful that we can find some common ground and bring order to the border and make sure that we work together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUJAN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, these are challenges that we have been facing for some time. And that's why it was important to pass a comprehensive immigration reform package as well. And even under President Barack Obama, when the Senate worked and pass a bipartisan agreement, Speaker Boehner and Speaker Ryan got in the way of a bipartisan agreement. If we can pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package out of the Senate, I'm certain that we can work with Speaker Pelosi, House Democrats and Republicans in the House, to get this thing passed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it just seems to me, Representative, that each party is talking past the each other. They both agree on the broad structure of a deal that includes doing something with these illegals who are here or the kids are those illegals who are here, the so-called DACA members in this country. They also seem to be open for tighter border security, whether you wanted to define that by a wall or what have you. So what is keeping the two apart? Now, the White House, surprisingly, has been saying, even though you said the president has made things worse, that it's Democrats who refuse to give an inch or do anything. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUJAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I disagree with that assessment. Look, there are 11 million or more undocumented people in the country, over half that are here with expired visas. Clearly, there's a broken system that we have to deal with. So passing a comprehensive package should be at the top of the list."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUJAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the United States should be working with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries and see how we can all work together, rather than the president constantly threatening the Mexicans that they're going to close the border, when, in fact, closing of the U.S. border with Mexico would devastate the U.S. economy and even the auto industry."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUJAN",
      "utterance": "But, Neil, the problem is that the president makes a threat and then he walks away from it. And he only alienates those that we're trying to work with. The president cutting off the Northern Triangle countries with Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador is going to increase violence there. And so, again, how can we work together? It means that the president needs to be willing to keep his word, in the same way that he made a commitment, President Donald Trump, when he invited the cameras in, and said, let's solve this problem, let's pass a comprehensive immigration reform package. And it took, what, less than 48 hours before the president walked away from the agreement. If the president can come up with his approach, his plan, let's..."

And I think that's just a problem. There's a willingness to work together here. Senator Lindsey Graham was instrumental. And so let's do it."

That's kind of the bullseye from the storm, although still more energy coming out in across parts of the West with more snow across all of the mountains. But take a look at this. This has been very heavy snow and along with it is the wind. You got a lot of winds gusting to, say, 40 to 45 miles an hour. Haven't seen a ton of sustained blizzard conditions, but we still have the blizzard warnings in effect there. Those will be out of here by tomorrow night. We still have a number of hours to get through. Probably have another, say, six inches of snow primarily across parts of Minnesota. And then the other problem will be is, all that snow is going to have to melt, and we have a flooding problem going on across there -- Neil, back to you."
