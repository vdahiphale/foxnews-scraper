But I want to bring Leon Panetta into this, the former secretary of defense.  Secretary, thank you for taking the time. One thing that keeps coming up as it goes along, by and large, party lines, but criticism about the way all of this was handled did seem to be a bipartisan theme, some going further back to say it's the fault of other administrations.  But you did recently, say, Secretary, that you thought this was Joe Biden's Bay of Pigs, his worst nightmare. Do you still feel that way, in light of some of the follow-up incidents that have happened, some say provocative acts, that might look random, like what's going on in North Korea launching more missiles, China getting particularly bellicose of late? What do you think?",

But my biggest concern, frankly, is that we need to look forward and ask ourselves, how do we protect our national security? And protecting our national security is -- yes, it's about China. It's about Russia. It's about North Korea. It's about Iran. But it's also about terrorism. And the greatest concern I have is that the Taliban that is now in charge of Afghanistan is pretty much the same Taliban that was in charge of Afghanistan on 9/11. And that tells me that one of the dangers here is that Afghanistan could clearly become a safe haven for terrorists, for Al Qaeda, for ISIS, for the Haqqani terrorists, and that that could represent a real threat to our national security.   So, I'm more interested, and trying to determine, what steps does the United States have to take now to make sure that we can protect our national security in the future?",

      "sentences": "Well, the issue for this president and for our country is to do what's necessary to protect our national security.   We have just been through a 9/11 20th anniversary, where we saw what Al Qaeda was willing to do and attacking our country, and killing almost 3,000 people. We went to war to try to make sure that Al Qaeda would never get the chance to attack our country again and that, hopefully, Afghanistan would not become a safe haven for terrorists. Well, the danger right now is that this Afghanistan under Taliban control, I think, will become a safe haven for terrorism. And that means that Al Qaeda is going to be free to reorganize itself and to expand its work and to continue to plan attacks.  That's what Al Qaeda does. They're interested in attacking the United States of America. That's always been their goal, and killing Americans, as well as killing others. And that's true for ISIS. And it's true, frankly, for the Haqqanis. Their interest is in killing people. And so what we need to have is intelligence on the ground. We need to make sure that we have strong intelligence capabilities, yes, in a Taliban Afghanistan. Intelligence is smart enough to know how to do that. We have ways and technologies to be able to gather that kind of intelligence. We do need people on the ground, so that we are monitoring just exactly what Al Qaeda is doing or what other terrorists are doing.  And, secondly, we need to have the capability to use counterterrorism operations against those targets. The president himself has said we have got to use counterterrorism. It's called over the horizon. But regardless of what you call it, we need to have Special Forces capabilities that can move if we identify terrorist targets who are threatening the United States of America.  That is important in order to protect our security.",

If that's what that individual believes, and that represents the leadership's view in Afghanistan of the role of Al Qaeda, what it tells me is that they are going to allow Al Qaeda to do whatever the hell they want.

It was tough enough to do it when we were involved in working with the Afghan government to be able to cover that country and determine where the threats were coming from. Now it's even more difficult with the Taliban in charge.   In addition to that, to do counterterrorism operations, I mean, if we have to do them from bases outside of Afghanistan, whether it's a carrier, whether it's Pakistan, whether it's a Uzbekistan, wherever, it's going to take more time to be able to go after those targets. And that's going to make it much, much more difficult to be able to hit the targets that could represent a threat to our security.

We have a responsibility to get them out. We can't just turn our backs on them. And we can't just allow the Taliban to tell us that they're going to cooperate, when, in fact, they're not cooperating. So we have got to -- we have got to push through this. That's number one. Number two, as I said, I think we have really got to develop our intelligence capabilities and our counterterrorism capabilities. Three, we have got to continue to put pressure on this Taliban, working with our allies, to make sure that the -- if they say they're not going to support terrorism, if they say they're going to provide women's rights, then let's see them, in fact, implement that, not just use words, but, in fact, do that.   And then, lastly, I think we have got to learn the lessons of what's happened here in Afghanistan. If we're going to deploy United States forces any place, we need to have a clear mission, we need to have a strategy for achieving that mission, and we need to have an exit strategy.  That's the lesson we should have learned from Vietnam. And it's a lesson that we now should learn from Afghanistan.",

That's OK. That's what senators are responsible for doing, is to ask questions. And, very frankly, as vice president, he asked the same questions. I don't have any problem with that.  I think that it's important, when a president has to make decisions, to have people in the room that are saying and raising questions about whether or not these are the right steps to take. I think that -- I think that's important to do.  And, frankly, I think every president, including this president, needs to have people in the room that are saying, wait a minute, I don't think this is the right decision. There are problems here. There are consequences that you have to look at. That's important to do.  So, I don't -- I don't question Joe Biden's knowledge or his capability or his willingness to ask questions. I think that's a good thing to have. I think more questions should have been asked with regards to Afghanistan as to what the potential consequences would be, so that we could take steps to deal with that. For some reason, that didn't happen. But now the issue is, we have a situation in Afghanistan that represents a national security threat. We damn well better do what we have to do to protect our security.",

And I think he would have -- he would have gotten us out of Afghanistan as quickly as he could, and probably made some of the same mistakes. So, look, I -- in some ways, I guess I don't question the fact that the president made the decision that it was time to take our forces out of Afghanistan.  I think the question comes down to execution. And were the right questions asked, in terms of, were we going to effectively execute that decision in a way that would accomplish his decision. and yet do it in a way that would also protect our people and the Afghans who fought with us? That's the question that I think hopefully Congress will continue to ask, and one that we need to know the answers to in order to make sure that we don't make the same mistakes in the future.",

Do you think that some of the things that have occurred since the collapse of Afghanistan, including now North Korea launching still more long-range cruise missiles, China getting very provocative, recommending that it send ships to our seas, as we send ships to their seas, even though they're not their seas -- but you get my point, that these things are not happening in a vacuum, they're happening post this collapse, and it is because of that that they're getting increasingly provocative and in our face?",

And it's been dangerous for a while, because I think our adversaries have read weakness on the part of the United States. I think that's why Russia has been more aggressive in the way they have handled themselves and come after us. I think China reads weakness. And so they're being much more aggressive. And I think that's true for other adversaries. We have got a dangerous world. We have got to confront not just China and Russia. We have got to confront Iran. We have got to confront North Korea and the testing that they're doing. We have got to confront terrorism. We have got to confront cyberattacks, which are without question the battlefield of the future. So there's a lot that we have to worry about as a country in terms of protecting our national security. When -- any time something happens that sends a message out to our adversaries that somehow the United States doesn't have its act together, clearly, that creates a certain vacuum.  It is very important for the president, for this administration to make very clear that the United States is going to be a world leader, in terms of dealing with national security, that we are going to work with our allies in trying to protect our national security and try to advance peace in the world. And it is very important for the United States to make clear that, when we give our word about what we're going to do, that we stick to it. So, I think, without question, the United States now has to make clear that we have a strong, steady foreign policy, a strong, set, steady national security policy, and that we have a clear vision about what is going to be necessary in order to tell our adversaries, wherever they are, that the United States is strong and will stand up to protect the United States of America.

One thing that keeps coming up as it goes along, by and large, party lines, but criticism about the way all of this was handled did seem to be a bipartisan theme, some going further back to say it's the fault of other administrations. But you did recently, say, Secretary, that you thought this was Joe Biden's Bay of Pigs, his worst nightmare.

It's about Russia. It's about North Korea. It's about Iran. But it's also about terrorism. And the greatest concern I have is that the Taliban that is now in charge of Afghanistan is pretty much the same Taliban that was in charge of Afghanistan on 9/11. And that tells me that one of the dangers here is that Afghanistan could clearly become a safe haven for terrorists, for Al Qaeda, for ISIS, for the Haqqani terrorists, and that that could represent a real threat to our national security.

We have just been through a 9/11 20th anniversary, where we saw what Al Qaeda was willing to do and attacking our country, and killing almost 3,000 people. We went to war to try to make sure that Al Qaeda would never get the chance to attack our country again and that, hopefully, Afghanistan would not become a safe haven for terrorists. Well, the danger right now is that this Afghanistan under Taliban control, I think, will become a safe haven for terrorism. And that means that Al Qaeda is going to be free to reorganize itself and to expand its work and to continue to plan attacks. That's what Al Qaeda does. They're interested in attacking the United States of America. That's always been their goal, and killing Americans, as well as killing others. And that's true for ISIS. And it's true, frankly, for the Haqqanis. Their interest is in killing people. And so what we need to have is intelligence on the ground. We need to make sure that we have strong intelligence capabilities, yes, in a Taliban Afghanistan. Intelligence is smart enough to know how to do that. We have ways and technologies to be able to gather that kind of intelligence. We do need people on the ground, so that we are monitoring just exactly what Al Qaeda is doing or what other terrorists are doing. And, secondly, we need to have the capability to use counterterrorism operations against those targets. The president himself has said we have got to use counterterrorism. It's called over the horizon. But regardless of what you call it, we need to have Special Forces capabilities that can move if we identify terrorist targets who are threatening the United States of America. That is important in order to protect our security."

Do you buy that?"

I heard a spokesman for the Taliban being interviewed by a national network in which the interviewer asked the Taliban spokesman about bin Laden's role in the attack on 9/11. And the response was that that individual saw no evidence that bin Laden was involved in the 9/11 attack. If that's what that individual believes, and that represents the leadership's view in Afghanistan of the role of Al Qaeda, what it tells me is that they are going to allow Al Qaeda to do whatever the hell they want. And that's dangerous."

      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "Oh, there's no question. It's tougher when the Taliban are in full control of Afghanistan to be able to have good intelligence. It's a big country. It was tough enough to do it when we were involved in working with the Afghan government to be able to cover that country and determine where the threats were coming from. Now it's even more difficult with the Taliban in charge. In addition to that, to do counterterrorism operations, I mean, if we have to do them from bases outside of Afghanistan, whether it's a carrier, whether it's Pakistan, whether it's a Uzbekistan, wherever, it's going to take more time to be able to go after those targets. And that's going to make it much, much more difficult to be able to hit the targets that could represent a threat to our security. So, there's a lot of work that needs to be done here in order to protect our national security. We have that obligation."

Number one, they have a responsibility to get all of U.S. -- our U.S. personnel out of Afghanistan. Whether it's 100, or 150, whatever the number is, we have a responsibility to them to do everything necessary to get them out. And the same thing is true for the Afghans who fought alongside of us. Those Afghans..."

      "utterance": "Well, we have a responsibility to do whatever the hell is necessary to get them out. Now, that means we have got to be able to track them. That means we have to be able to guide them. That means that we have to be able to find ways to be able to get them out of Afghanistan, whether they go to Pakistan, whether they go to a particular location where we can try to retrieve them. We have a responsibility to get them out. We can't just turn our backs on them. And we can't just allow the Taliban to tell us that they're going to cooperate, when, in fact, they're not cooperating. So we have got to -- we have got to push through this. That's number one. Number two, as I said, I think we have really got to develop our intelligence capabilities and our counterterrorism capabilities. Three, we have got to continue to put pressure on this Taliban, working with our allies, to make sure that the -- if they say they're not going to support terrorism, if they say they're going to provide women's rights, then let's see them, in fact, implement that, not just use words, but, in fact, do that. And then, lastly, I think we have got to learn the lessons of what's happened here in Afghanistan. If we're going to deploy United States forces any place, we need to have a clear mission, we need to have a strategy for achieving that mission, and we need to have an exit strategy. That's the lesson we should have learned from Vietnam. And it's a lesson that we now should learn from Afghanistan."

He knows that -- the adversaries that face our country and what needs to be done to deal with our adversaries. Look, presidents make mistakes, just like anybody else. I think the most important thing for this president to do is to be willing to accept responsibility for the mistakes and to move on, and to basically do what is necessary now to protect our national security. He made the decision. Some will support that decision. Some will oppose the decision. But, in the end, I think the important thing for the United States of America and for this president is, what are we going to do to make sure that America never again experiences another 9/11 attack?"

And some have criticized him for being on the wrong side of almost every important foreign policy initiative. He was against the taking out of the Usama bin Laden, when you were leading the charge to take out of some Usama bin Laden. His concern at the time was about collateral damage. Obviously, the effort to take him out succeeded. But it was a reminder that, on these key areas, maybe the president isn't as steeped or well-schooled in this or accurate in this or expert in this as he likes to say."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "Neil, look, I have known Joe Biden for a long time. And one thing he's always done is, he has raised questions about the decisions that impact on foreign policy. And that's OK. That's OK. That's what senators are responsible for doing, is to ask questions. And, very frankly, as vice president, he asked the same questions. I don't have any problem with that. I think that it's important, when a president has to make decisions, to have people in the room that are saying and raising questions about whether or not these are the right steps to take. I think that -- I think that's important to do. And, frankly, I think every president, including this president, needs to have people in the room that are saying, wait a minute, I don't think this is the right decision. There are problems here. There are consequences that you have to look at. That's important to do. So, I don't -- I don't question Joe Biden's knowledge or his capability or his willingness to ask questions. I think that's a good thing to have. I think more questions should have been asked with regards to Afghanistan as to what the potential consequences would be, so that we could take steps to deal with that. For some reason, that didn't happen. But now the issue is, we have a situation in Afghanistan that represents a national security threat. We damn well better do what we have to do to protect our security."

And I think the Taliban, very frankly, got the best of us at Doha. They got everything they wanted. And we got very little in return. And I think he would have -- he would have gotten us out of Afghanistan as quickly as he could, and probably made some of the same mistakes. So, look, I -- in some ways, I guess I don't question the fact that the president made the decision that it was time to take our forces out of Afghanistan. I think the question comes down to execution. And were the right questions asked, in terms of, were we going to effectively execute that decision in a way that would accomplish his decision. and yet do it in a way that would also protect our people and the Afghans who fought with us? That's the question that I think hopefully Congress will continue to ask, and one that we need to know the answers to in order to make sure that we don't make the same mistakes in the future."

Some say the biggest, of course, was the setup of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Do you think that some of the things that have occurred since the collapse of Afghanistan, including now North Korea launching still more long-range cruise missiles, China getting very provocative, recommending that it send ships to our seas, as we send ships to their seas, even though they're not their seas -- but you get my point, that these things are not happening in a vacuum, they're happening post this collapse, and it is because of that that they're getting increasingly provocative and in our face?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, look, I think -- I think the United States is confronting a dangerous world. And it's been dangerous for a while, because I think our adversaries have read weakness on the part of the United States. I think that's why Russia has been more aggressive in the way they have handled themselves and come after us. I think China reads weakness. And so they're being much more aggressive. And I think that's true for other adversaries. We have got a dangerous world. We have got to confront not just China and Russia. We have got to confront Iran. We have got to confront North Korea and the testing that they're doing. We have got to confront terrorism. We have got to confront cyberattacks, which are without question the battlefield of the future. So there's a lot that we have to worry about as a country in terms of protecting our national security. When -- any time something happens that sends a message out to our adversaries that somehow the United States doesn't have its act together, clearly, that creates a certain vacuum. It is very important for the president, for this administration to make very clear that the United States is going to be a world leader, in terms of dealing with national security, that we are going to work with our allies in trying to protect our national security and try to advance peace in the world. And it is very important for the United States to make clear that, when we give our word about what we're going to do, that we stick to it. So, I think, without question, the United States now has to make clear that we have a strong, steady foreign policy, a strong, set, steady national security policy, and that we have a clear vision about what is going to be necessary in order to tell our adversaries, wherever they are, that the United States is strong and will stand up to protect the United States of America. That is a message that now has to go out to the world."

A couple of things, Neil, to note about Secretary Blinken's testimony and the questioning here. Towards the end, when you had questions about how many Americans are on the ground, the number keeps coming back to roughly 100. Well, it's been roughly 100 for a couple of weeks from the administration, even after those two flights from Doha went to Qatar from Kabul."

When asked about SIVs, the Special Immigrant Visa holders, there is no number. They're trying to get a handle, the secretary said. Well, we're told that number is tens of thousands. So, now you're looking at a situation where the people who helped us for two decades on the ground who are threatened by the Taliban are really running for their lives still, and we can't get a firm number on what that is or what we're doing to get them out."

You saw Secretary Blinken say, we inherited a deadline, but we didn't inherit a plan as far as withdrawal. That doesn't cut it, Neil, because they inherited a deadline negotiated with conditions-based negotiations, as pointed out by some of the Republicans, of May 1, but then they renegotiated that deal to make it September 11. They renegotiated it. But they didn't, in the interim, come up with a plan about how to get Americans and other people out by that date, which is what led to the situation that we saw."

So why stop at this particular one, when it was indeed adjusted, to your point? I guess what I'm asking, as we could put a forward sort of spin on this now, Bret, is this notion that the Taliban will continue cooperating with us, working with us to get these 100 or so Americans out, these thousands of Afghan nationals out. The latter seems a little bit of a steep climb here. But, in the interim, the vacuum is filled by the Chinese, Russians, others. How do you see this playing out for the administration?"

And trusting the Taliban that has a pretty bad record, Neil, is a -- is thin, as far as wanting to get real results. I think there's an effort, obviously, that continues every day. And there's also a private effort that continues with former special ops officers. And we have heard a lot about that in recent days.

But the real number is in the thousands of people that we should be getting out, if you talk to anybody in this business, including Leon Panetta, who said we have an obligation to those people on the ground. The one thing I thought Secretary Panetta said that I don't know if I jibe with by who -- the people I talked to in the military circles and also up on Capitol Hill is that, would it have been the exact same under a Trump administration, this -- how this went? I don't think that's possible, because, as bad as this went, there were conditions baked into the Taliban withdrawal.

And now to say that the Taliban suddenly is going to be trusted, even though the document that they signed, they never lived up to, but now they're going to be trusted to get all of these people out, again, is a lot of hope.

Virtually all of Afghanistan's foreign reserves are here in the United States. They are frozen. International financial institutions are not going forward with their own assistance or the ability for Afghanistan to engage in international financial transactions.

I'm talking about the heavy equipment, the tanks, the Humvees, the Black Hawk helicopters, aircraft, sir, all this is GPS-tracked. We can identify this, where it's at. Why did we not destroy it or don't we destroy it now?"

I know my colleagues from the Defense Department, the Joint Chiefs, et cetera, will have an opportunity to speak to you, to speak to Congress in the weeks ahead. They're the experts on this. About since 2004, roughly, something like $80 billion in defense articles was provided to Afghanistan. So that goes back over the last roughly..."

That was the reality we were dealing with. And the judgment of all of us, starting with our military commanders, including people on the ground, was that our job was to work to get as many people out as possible, American citizens, Afghans at risk. And because the Taliban controlled the city, that required some coordination with them to get people through and to the airport."

When I served on active duty in the United States Air Force, I participated in Operation Pacific Haven, where we airlifted thousands and thousands of Kurds out of Northern Iraq because Saddam Hussein was then going to kill them. We worked with the State Department and other U.S. agencies, and it was a very difficult mission. So I want to commend you and the State Department and all the U.S. personnel who executed an evacuation of over 120,000 people under immense danger. That was a remarkable feat that all of you did. And I also want to honor the 13 Marines that gave their lives in service to our country. What I'd like to ask you about is the document that started all this, the February 29 document, 2020. That document was negotiated by the Trump administration with the Taliban, correct?"
