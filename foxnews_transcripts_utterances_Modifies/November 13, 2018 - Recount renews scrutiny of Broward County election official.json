The other race called last night after a concession from Martha McSally. Arizona, the spread 38,000 votes for Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat who is now heading to Washington. The difference there with the Arizona governor's race was really stark. Doug Ducey, the Republican, getting 326,000 votes over the Democrat there. And you see the difference between McSally and Sinema was at 38,000. With all of that and the changes on Capitol Hill, let's bring in our panel: Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon; Kimberley Strassel is a member of the editorial board at The Wall Street Journal, and James Pindell is a political reporter for The Boston Globe. OK, Matthew, your assessment of what we are looking at in Florida and the results of Arizona?",

In Arizona, though, it's very interesting. There's been this debate about Democrats, about strategy going from 2018 to 2020, should they continue to really rally the progressive base or should they try to move to the center? I think if you look at Sinema and her success, and you see that split to ticket voting happening between the top of the ticket and her Senate race, that shows for Democrats moving to the center like Sinema did since she was first elected to Congress, is a winning strategy.",

She looked to be ahead and so she stopped taking chances, didn't campaign as hard. There is a belief that she ran too negative of a campaign.

They flipped Nevada and Arizona. Obviously they lost in Missouri, Indiana, and likely Florida, but you've got the House netting at least 32 seats, governors picked up seven Republican held governorships. State legislatures, they are putting the number at 323 Republican legislative seats that they picked up. And they picked up seven legislative chambers.

And I think the answer really is much more muddled if we are going to be honest about it. Joe Donnelly, as you mentioned, ran as a moderate, ran as a pro-life Democrat incumbent who said he would agree with and ran ads saying he agreed with President Trump, lost. Heidi Heitkamp of course lost, and Claire McCaskill lost. Opponents would say they are big liberals, but they basically ran as moderates.
