We don't know the specifics of this call, but we do know that the White House put out a statement saying \"President Biden urged Russia to deescalate tensions with Ukraine.

Let's bring this our panel, FOX News media analyst and host of FOX's MEDIA BUZZ Howard Kurtz, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Kevin Walling, Democratic strategist and former Biden campaign surrogate.   Mollie, let me start with you. It seems like this is very tense. We don't have a lot of specifics on this call, but Putin asked for the call. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It was interesting that he asked for the call ahead of another discussion that they are planning here soon. But Putin is going to do what he determines is in his best interest, the best interest of Russia, but also how he perceives the strength of the United States. So it is important that we are clear in our communications with Russia about the seriousness of what they are threatening there on the border.

At the same time, Russia is acting in hostile manner, and they are an adversary to many of these countries in that region. People in the U.S. are rightfully concerned about appeasement. That is one of the lessons that we learned from World War II, that appeasement does not work out well for the world. There's also the lesson from World War I that undue entanglements can also lead to global conflict. And that's why it's important for NATO to be strong, to have an appropriate size so that it can be effective. Remember, we agree that we will help out any other country that is invaded, it's in the NATO alliance. The larger that NATO gets, the less that is a guarantee that makes sense. And this is one of the lessons we have learned in recent decades, that we need make sure that our word means something, that our interventions make sense, and that they can be defended.",

U.S. defense officials confirming to FOX News, 206 marines have been kicked out of the service. The Pentagon requires all service members to get the vaccine. It does not yet require them to get a booster, but it highly recommends it. But 206 marines are not serving because of that.   We're back with our panel. Howie, what about the coverage of COVID as you have looked at it across the spectrum and, specifically, Omicron? It seems like sometimes it goes overhand, and they don't really look at the severity of the cases.",

What the media is doing is struggling to cover a reverse shutdown, a bottom up shutdown, not any government edict but because you have all these infected workers, and have gone easy, I think, on the Biden administration for having the CDC suddenly and mysteriously saying, we only really need a five-day quarantine period. And it's not about the science. It's about keeping businesses open and planes in the sky. The other fascinating development here, Bret, is that more experts, and this is getting a lot of media play, saying even though the cases are surging, we should just stop counting because the authorities can't track at home tests, even though there is a shortage of those due to the earlier miscalculation by the Biden administration. Now, that may well be true, but isn't it politically convenient for Joe Biden if the obsession with the number of new daily cases and the drumbeat that we saw under Donald Trump and earlier this year were simply to vanish?",

I think it was a failure to some degree on this administration to not anticipate the desire for testing, to obviously protect yourselves and protect others during the holiday season, to have that negative test before traveling home. So certainly, I think you are seeing an administration refocusing on the testing issue, especially in light with the schools now coming out of winter break into January, wanting to have that negative test for teachers and students, especially as you saw that clip with Mayor Bowser of Washington, D.C. So that's obviously going to be critical. You have those 500 million tests that are being produced right now that will be available to Americans to request through the mail. That will help also to identify where those hotspots are so that the federal government can respond accordingly and to move resources to where we see these kinds of surges with Omicron, certainly.",

      "utterance": "And that is understandably viewed as hostile by Russia in the same way that other countries would, if alliances were forming right up their border. At the same time, Russia is acting in hostile manner, and they are an adversary to many of these countries in that region. People in the U.S. are rightfully concerned about appeasement. That is one of the lessons that we learned from World War II, that appeasement does not work out well for the world. There's also the lesson from World War I that undue entanglements can also lead to global conflict. And that's why it's important for NATO to be strong, to have an appropriate size so that it can be effective. Remember, we agree that we will help out any other country that is invaded, it's in the NATO alliance. The larger that NATO gets, the less that is a guarantee that makes sense. And this is one of the lessons we have learned in recent decades, that we need make sure that our word means something, that our interventions make sense, and that they can be defended."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, a lot of mixed messages on the guidance from the CDC, from the administration, what people are facing around the country. But we are just getting breaking news regarding COVID from the Pentagon. We are confirming that 206 U.S. marines have been kicked out since late November over their refusal to get the COVID vaccine. U.S. defense officials confirming to FOX News, 206 marines have been kicked out of the service. The Pentagon requires all service members to get the vaccine. It does not yet require them to get a booster, but it highly recommends it. But 206 marines are not serving because of that. We're back with our panel. Howie, what about the coverage of COVID as you have looked at it across the spectrum and, specifically, Omicron? It seems like sometimes it goes overhand, and they don't really look at the severity of the cases."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, the coverage has been downright confusing to the average person because there are so many mixed messages and the fact that cases are surging, but, of course, the death rate hasn't gone up very much thankfully because it seems to be milder. What the media is doing is struggling to cover a reverse shutdown, a bottom up shutdown, not any government edict but because you have all these infected workers, and have gone easy, I think, on the Biden administration for having the CDC suddenly and mysteriously saying, we only really need a five-day quarantine period. And it's not about the science. It's about keeping businesses open and planes in the sky. The other fascinating development here, Bret, is that more experts, and this is getting a lot of media play, saying even though the cases are surging, we should just stop counting because the authorities can't track at home tests, even though there is a shortage of those due to the earlier miscalculation by the Biden administration. Now, that may well be true, but isn't it politically convenient for Joe Biden if the obsession with the number of new daily cases and the drumbeat that we saw under Donald Trump and earlier this year were simply to vanish?"

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Kevin, understanding that you support the administration, but in the analysis here, the testing issue seems like it really has been a troublesome spot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLING",
      "utterance": "Yes, Bret, it certainly has been. And there have been frustrations around the country with regards to long lines with testing. I think it was a failure to some degree on this administration to not anticipate the desire for testing, to obviously protect yourselves and protect others during the holiday season, to have that negative test before traveling home. So certainly, I think you are seeing an administration refocusing on the testing issue, especially in light with the schools now coming out of winter break into January, wanting to have that negative test for teachers and students, especially as you saw that clip with Mayor Bowser of Washington, D.C. So that's obviously going to be critical. You have those 500 million tests that are being produced right now that will be available to Americans to request through the mail. That will help also to identify where those hotspots are so that the federal government can respond accordingly and to move resources to where we see these kinds of surges with Omicron, certainly."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It's been nothing but mixed messages for two years now. And the Biden administration, it is worth remembering, Biden campaigned and was elected on a promise to shut down the virus. He inherited a robust vaccination program, multiple vaccines that were obtained through this Operation Warp Speed, a tremendous accomplishment by the Trump administration, and has done just next to nothing when it comes to testing, and has been pushing vaccines not for the vulnerable elderly who really have a strong case to be made for getting the vaccine and getting boosted, but for younger and younger cohorts even as we learn more about the vaccine and how, contrary to what was claimed by some of these same bureaucratic elites at the onset, that the vaccine, we were told would prevent transmission, it would prevent people from getting COVID. We now know those things aren't true. And yet, their rhetoric has not changed. It's just a mess."
