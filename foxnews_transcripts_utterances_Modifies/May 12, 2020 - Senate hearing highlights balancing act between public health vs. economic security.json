While also in the nation's capital trying to find out which Obama administration officials unmasked Michael Flynn as the American speaking with the Russian ambassador in surveillance.  The names of the people who requested that action had been declassified. But will they be released?  First up, safely reopening the U.S. That was the focus of a first of its kind remote Senate hearing today. While members of the medical community are warning against reopening the country too soon.  The specter of massive unemployment, the possible permanent damage to the financial infrastructure, all posing what could be a generation-defining dilemma. We have \"FOX TEAM COVERAGE\" tonight. John Roberts at the White House with the administration's position on the virus today. Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel starts us off tonight though with an extraordinary hearing.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": And there have been people who think until a vaccine is found or until treatment is found that we can't reopen the economy. That could never happen. There are plenty of things that affect humanity where we have not found vaccines. So obviously that's not a viable solution, even if it's been played around with by some people. It's important to remember, though, Americans were told we needed a couple weeks to slow the spread and make sure that hospitals weren't overwhelmed. It has morphed into multiple months of destroying the economy. And Dr. Fauci is a great expert to listen to, and clearly people like listening to him. He's really focused on a very narrow issue, which is just deaths and illness related to coronavirus. He is a public health person but not someone who is even focused on all the other public health issues that come into play when you flatten hospitals and you keep people from getting the treatment that they need for things that are not related to coronavirus. And he is not an expert on the economy or all of the other deleterious effects that are related to shutdown, whether it's mental health, drug addiction, keeping kids out of school, which particularly hurts low income children, or any of the other issues. So he is just one of many experts that people should be listening to, and it seems that the media think he is the only expert that needs to be listened to.",

Fox 10 in Phoenix where a group of law enforcement officers rode from Tempe Beach Park to the Arizona Peace Officers Memorial in Phoenix the event replaces a 3-day 250-mile ride meant to raise funds for a memorial wall in Washington. That ride was canceled due to the coronavirus. WDRB in Louisville, as the family of a black woman who was fatally shot by Kentucky police in her home, hires prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump. Breonna Taylor was killed as officers entered her Louisville home early on March 13th as part of a narcotics investigation. Police, say they were returning fire after one officer was shot and wounded. Attorney, say police had the wrong home. Fox 23 in Tulsa, as the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on a proposition that a large chunk of eastern Oklahoma remains an American Indian reservation. The justices heard arguments by phone and an appeal by a Native American man, who claims state courts had no authority to try him for a crime committed on reservation land.

That purpose got hijacked a bit by partisan politics. And all of a sudden, the narrative became, if you want to go to work, you're on the far right, if you don't want to go to work and you want to stay home, you're on the far-left. And now, even the mask-wearing is getting politicized, where if you want to wear a mask, you wear a mask you're a liberal. And if you don't, you're conservative. And that's just not true. So, this created a false divide, sort of two wars in the -- in the -- in America. An us versus them war, and an us versus the virus war. And you know, if we try to fight both of those wars, we're going to lose both of them.

And I hope we wear a masks as a badge of honor, and not something that we feel like somebody told us we had to wear that takes away our identity. I think wearing a mask is not propaganda.

The president, of course, has been a really, really pushing for the country to reopen. But Dr. Fauci came out with a warning, saying that if we move too quickly, if states move too quickly, that there could be smaller outbreaks that become bigger outbreaks later in the fall.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": And there have been people who think until a vaccine is found or until treatment is found that we can't reopen the economy. That could never happen. There are plenty of things that affect humanity where we have not found vaccines. So obviously that's not a viable solution, even if it's been played around with by some people. It's important to remember, though, Americans were told we needed a couple weeks to slow the spread and make sure that hospitals weren't overwhelmed. It has morphed into multiple months of destroying the economy. And Dr. Fauci is a great expert to listen to, and clearly people like listening to him. He's really focused on a very narrow issue, which is just deaths and illness related to coronavirus. He is a public health person but not someone who is even focused on all the other public health issues that come into play when you flatten hospitals and you keep people from getting the treatment that they need for things that are not related to coronavirus. And he is not an expert on the economy or all of the other deleterious effects that are related to shutdown, whether it's mental health, drug addiction, keeping kids out of school, which particularly hurts low income children, or any of the other issues. So he is just one of many experts that people should be listening to, and it seems that the media think he is the only expert that needs to be listened to."

But I also found that it's interesting that we are this many weeks into this, and there was some exchange between the senators and the doctor about the fact that we have applied this one-size-fits-all approach. And that's not how this virus is presenting itself around the country. Quite frankly, I thought there was not enough focus on trying to protect the people who are most vulnerable. And we talk about nursing homes and the number of deaths that are in nursing homes, and we should be pouring resources into protecting nursing homes and long-term care facilities. And there was some of that today, but not as much as I had hoped and expected."

Direct payments, $1,200 per family, up to $6,000 per household. It goes on. There's a long list outside of the coronavirus list that includes the post office and other things. Some senators, including Lindsey Graham, Jeff, saying that because of that it's dead on arrival up on Capitol Hill. What about this effort by House Democrats?"

      "utterance": "This is their opening gambit. And then they are setting out in the next phase basically what they are looking for. And whether it's realistic or not, I think the quote from Senator Graham is probably a pretty good indication that it's not going to go very far in the Senate. But for the last few phases of economic aid, the two sides of been able to come up with compromises, and no doubt at some point that's what they'll be trying to do in phase four. But I think there does seem to be more reluctance now, certainly among some Republicans, and perhaps even here in the White House, to keep pushing that price tag up, and that may end up being a big issue in the campaign this fall as well."

Meantime, there are efforts afoot in Washington to unmask the unmaskers, and that is the people who requested that Michael Flynn's name be revealed in this surveillance that was going on with the Russian ambassador. The Director of National Intelligence, Ric Grenell, the acting director now, is likely the one that's going to make that decision. We're back with the panel. Mollie, where are we in this fact case about what's happening?"

      "utterance": "We have learned more in the last week than we probably have in the previous three years combined in terms of what this was from the Obama administration and top officials to undermine the Trump administration and hamper the peaceful transfer of power. We have learned a great deal, and I laid out a piece last week at \"The Federalist,\" that showed how important leaks were to accomplishing so much of what was done. When we find out who unmasked, that might help us find out a little bit more about who was engaged in those criminal leaks where people would share information with the media, and the media wouldn't ask questions. They would just print it. That's how we learned about the dossier, about the phone calls with Flynn, about Jeff Sessions having meetings with the Russians. These were all spun as horrible and nefarious. It turned out they were all nothing, but they really did hamper the Trump administration and led even to the launch of a special counsel with undermined the administration for another few years. This is a staggering, staggering collection of facts that we have learned in the last few weeks, and we need to have people focused a lot more in the media, in the Senate, and everyone who cares about finding out the truth about this needs to be all hands on deck at this point."

I've said on your program, Bret, we've talked about this, we need radical transparency when it comes to everything that's gone on here, because it's clear now that the American people have been lied to for years, and we need to get to the bottom of it. It's the only way that we can restore public trust in these institutions. And that is, as much as this might be uncomfortable for the intelligence community, as much as it might be uncomfortable for Democrats, even, that is so critical for every American. It's a nonpartisan issue because we don't want this kind of thing happening in our government moving forward against a Republican or a Democrat. So I think we will see more. It sounds like Ric Grenell is going to be -- this is just one piece of information among many. And so I'm sure President Trump is going to stay focused on moving forward."

It does seem likely that it would be Ric Grenell who would release the list and not DOJ. The one thing I'm certain of, Bret, I think based on this conversation and this information, is that it is going to be an issue in the campaign, and you are seeing the president talking about it certainly on Twitter and elsewhere. That clip from Vice President Biden will no doubt be played again as well."

The 102-year-old woman in Iceland who survived the Spanish Flu has now recovered from COVID-19. The U.N. saying that she was declared virus free just day before her 103rd birthday. So there's that. For mental health awareness month, police officers in Australia participated in the push-up challenged with the help of their drug detection dog, Whiskey. Good dog. And Carolyn Ellis, who lives in Ontario, Canada, was not going to let the pandemic stop her from giving her mom a hug on Mother's Day. She and her husband devised a safe way to do it by making a hug glove out of plastic sheets with sleeves. There you go. Innovation. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced, and unafraid. Here's Martha. Hug glove, maybe. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
