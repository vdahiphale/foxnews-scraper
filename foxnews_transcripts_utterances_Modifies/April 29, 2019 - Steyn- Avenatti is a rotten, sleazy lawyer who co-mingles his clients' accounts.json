For the third year in a row, Donald Trump was invited but took a pass and didn't show up. That has never happened in the long history of the dinner. Presidents always show up. They always show in a tuxedo and head downtown to suck up to the White House Correspondents' Association. They don't want to do that. They hate going -- every one of them -- all Presidents deeply despised the news media, but they make themselves go. They have no choice. It is a hostage situation. If you blow off the dinner, the press will punish you -- guaranteed. They won't admit it, of course, they won't say it's personal, they will make up some story.  Here for example is Jeff Zucker's spokesman, claiming that not going to media dinner is the same as attacking the media.",

Spying on former Fox reporter, James Rosen and his parents because you don't like what he is covering.  The Obama administration actually did that and then Obama went to eight separate White House Correspondents' Association dinners. Nobody ever denounced him as immoral. Obama hated reporters, by the way, most people do hate reporters for good reason. But reporters loved him back anyway. They agreed with his politics. That's what happens.

I think you are doing noble work to preserve democracy at a time when a rising tide of misinformation masquerading as news threatens to make a mockery of the First Amendment.  Donald J. Trump is not the first and won't be the last American President to create jitters about the First Amendment.   But what is happening today is perhaps even more insidious, a relentless campaign against the very credibility of the news media. This is a glorious tradition.

      "sentences": "People are doubting the news media. That's wrong. We are seeing misinformation masquerading as news, they are telling us, and actually they are right, we have seen a lot of that recently. How about the last two years of Russia coverage on CNN for example? Michael Cohen met secretly with Russian spies in Prague. Don, Jr. is about to be indicted. The Steele dossier is entirely real. They told us all of that, and much more, all of it wrong and stupid and totally dishonest.  \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post\" won Pulitzers for what turned out to be misinformation masquerading as news. Last Saturday night would have been a perfect moment, actually, to apologize for that debacle and return the prizes they won, but no. Nobody apologized. Nobody returned a Pulitzer. Instead, they celebrated themselves. No surprise there. That's what they do. What was odd though was hearing them talk about free speech.  The First Amendment is in fact under ferocious attack, really more than any time in the first 50 years, at least, and yet the people in that room don't seem to notice. Where were these same people last summer when the big tech companies colluded to silence broadcaster, Alex Jones? Alex Jones, he is bad. CNN literally led the effort to make can be quiet. Jeff Zucker doesn't agree with Alex Jones' political views, therefore he thinks Alex Jones shouldn't be allowed to talk. So Zucker shut him up by force.   Did anyone at Saturday's dinner mention any of that? And where were they when Facebook and Twitter blocked ads supporting Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn because they criticized abortion? Where were they when Tommy Robinson went to prison in the U.K. for having unfashionable these about immigration? Where were they when James Damore got fired and then slandered by Google for questioning the company's diversity theology? Where were they when Peter Vlaming lost his job teaching in Virginia because he wouldn't use male pronouns to describe a female student? Did any of the First Amendment defenders -- \"Here is to the First Amendment,\" they say -- at the dinner on Saturday say did they say a single word about any of this? Of course they didn't. Their job, they say, is to hold the powerful to account, but when given the chance to push back against the truly powerful, the actually powerful, the we-are-not-even- kidding-powerful -- Google, Amazon, Facebook, PayPal -- do they say anything? Ever? None. Of course not. They suck up every single time. They suck up to power. Because that's who they are. Dutiful toadies to the powerful, defending class interests and pretending it is principle. Fine. That's who they are. Just don't lecture us about free speech, please.  Chris Plante hosts the \"Chris Plante Show\" right here in Washington and he joins us here tonight. And I should also say, by way of intro, that you are a member of the media of the White House press corps actually of 30 years standing. This seems like the one group that ought to be defending free speech, but that isn't.  CHRIS PLANTE, HOST, \"THE CHRIS PLANTE SHOW\": No. It's a catastrophic fail. I didn't watch it live, but I did DVR the dinner, and I have been to many of the dinners, as you have over the years, and I watched it yesterday morning and I took notes because it's my job. And I'm really embarrassed for them, I think they are unembarrassable, but for eight years, President Obama racked up what has to be, and what the ACLU described as one of the worst First Amendment records and presidential history.   The ACLU described him as a terrible First Amendment President, all right. A terrible First Amendment President. On the campaign, they had three newspapers on the press plane for Obama in 2008 that did not endorse Barack Obama for President but endorsed John McCain for President. All three of those reporters, those three newspapers were kicked off of Barack Obama's campaign plane. That was in 2008. That was just sort of getting the ball rolling. During the course of the eight years, they squeezed out Fox News. Anita Dunn who was the Communications Director for Obama refused to allow Fox to participate in very important conference calls having to do with Benghazi, CI briefings having to do with Benghazi. They know where their bread is buttered and those people at the dinner are lackeys for the Obama administration for the Democratic Party.  Fox News didn't sing from the sheet music, so they were targeted by the Obama administration. The Obama administration also spied on the Associated Press because there was a leak that they were not happy with. They liked to control their leaks.  So, phones used by at least 100 reporters with the Associated Press were tapped. The records were -- they listened to the conversations, but they got the phone records to see who they were talking to. The Associated Press called it an unprecedented intrusion, and it was in fact an unprecedented intrusion. They spied on James Risen at \"The New York Times\" because he received a leak. They spied on phone records and other communications and so on. And at \"The New York Times\" and his work and home e-mail and phones were targeted. James Rosen, who you know, formerly of the Fox News Channel now, they spied on. You mentioned they spied on his parents who live in New York. They got phone records. This is the Obama administration, which is the heartthrob, still of the news media.",

Eight years of Obama and it was a lovefest at the White House Correspondents' Dinner year after year after year.  And now, suddenly the First Amendment is under threat, not because their President has kicked news organizations that provide him with unfavorable coverage off of Air Force One or out of the press pool. They have that Jim Acosta problem. But honestly, CNN, if it were an actual news organization, would have pulled Jim Acosta out of the White House long ago. He is a legitimate reporter.

So we have from Facebook the following explanation that in three cases, you said insulting things to people, you used one naughty word, one semi- naughty word and in the third case, you said someone was dumb and they said that this were against Community Guidelines, which strikes me as ridiculous given the level of vitriol on Facebook and Twitter.

You know, last time they did it right before I gave a speech on the main stage of CPAC, this time two days before we relaunch humanevents.com and that locks me out of being able to reach to 800,000 people that Human Events has historically put together on its Facebook platform. But it's not about, you know, one person I've got so many testimonies from ordinary people out there who have the same recourse as I do -- to come on the Tucker Carlson show and I'm very grateful for it and talk about how they're getting banned, people who have had eight accounts banned at a time. And if I can just say something about your opening monologue as well, I mean you really hit the nail on the head. Firstly, the journalist in question at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, they'll back the First Amendment ostensibly, but where's their backing for the Second Amendment?   You know, they seem to want to pick and choose and they also want to pick and choose the issues. You know nothing about these to Australian journalists who were detained by the FBI at LAX last week, nothing about members of the European Parliament who are having their platforms taken down right ahead of a European parliamentary election campaign and actually, this is becoming quite an embarrassment for America on the national stage -- on the international stage because these are American corporates putting their finger on the scales of elections taking place all around the world. And I really do believe, I mean, I know people like Donald Trump Jr. are doing excellent work to raise awareness of this, but I really do believe and I hope that it's time for this President actually took some executive action to make sure this isn't happening because what they're doing is tantamount to the thing that they complain about all the time -- collusion.",

O'Brien who says she has no agenda except finding the truth and restoring public confidence has subpoenaed Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and her top deputy Joseph Magats to a hearing this Thursday. O'Brien is also trying to compel Smollett to appear at the hearing, but his attorneys are now pushing back and court documents show that Sheila O'Brien is requesting that Kim Foxx, Joseph Magats and Jussie Smollett produced their original files and documents to make sure they have not been altered or destroyed.  O'Brien's petition says Foxx's actions created quote, \"an appearance of impropriety, a perception that justice was not served here, that Mr. Smollett received special treatment.\" Smollett's attorneys say a special prosecutor can only be appointed if a case is still pending and this one has been dropped. Meantime, in the college cheating scandal Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli and 15 other parents are apparently planning to fight the Feds. Today, they all officially pleaded not guilty. Loughlin is accused of paying a $500,000.00 bribe to get her daughters into the University of Southern California. Pleading not guilty certainly does not rule out a plea deal, but at this point cutting a deal would likely require jail time.

Well, the decline of families in this country ultimately is about the disappearance of fathers from so many homes. One in five American children, 15 million kids overall live with a single mother, no father present. Fathers are also disappearing in another way. Fewer men are marrying and more of them are not having any kids once they do. Michael Brendan Dougherty is a senior editor at \"National Review.\" He has a new book out, it's called \"My Father Left Me Ireland: An American's Son Search For Home,\" and it deals extensively with the role of fatherhood in his life and the success or decline of civilizations.

They told us all of that, and much more, all of it wrong and stupid and totally dishonest. \"The New York Times,\" \"The Washington Post\" won Pulitzers for what turned out to be misinformation masquerading as news. Last Saturday night would have been a perfect moment, actually, to apologize for that debacle and return the prizes they won, but no. Nobody apologized. Nobody returned a Pulitzer. Instead, they celebrated themselves. No surprise there. That's what they do. What was odd though was hearing them talk about free speech. The First Amendment is in fact under ferocious attack, really more than any time in the first 50 years, at least, and yet the people in that room don't seem to notice. Where were these same people last summer when the big tech companies colluded to silence broadcaster, Alex Jones? Alex Jones, he is bad. CNN literally led the effort to make can be quiet. Jeff Zucker doesn't agree with Alex Jones' political views, therefore he thinks Alex Jones shouldn't be allowed to talk. So Zucker shut him up by force. Did anyone at Saturday's dinner mention any of that? And where were they when Facebook and Twitter blocked ads supporting Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn because they criticized abortion? Where were they when Tommy Robinson went to prison in the U.K. for having unfashionable these about immigration? Where were they when James Damore got fired and then slandered by Google for questioning the company's diversity theology? Where were they when Peter Vlaming lost his job teaching in Virginia because he wouldn't use male pronouns to describe a female student? Did any of the First Amendment defenders -- \"Here is to the First Amendment,\" they say -- at the dinner on Saturday say did they say a single word about any of this? Of course they didn't. Their job, they say, is to hold the powerful to account, but when given the chance to push back against the truly powerful, the actually powerful, the we-are-not-even- kidding-powerful -- Google, Amazon, Facebook, PayPal -- do they say anything? Ever? None. Of course not. They suck up every single time. They suck up to power. Because that's who they are. Dutiful toadies to the powerful, defending class interests and pretending it is principle. Fine. That's who they are. Just don't lecture us about free speech, please. Chris Plante hosts the \"Chris Plante Show\" right here in Washington and he joins us here tonight. And I should also say, by way of intro, that you are a member of the media of the White House press corps actually of 30 years standing. This seems like the one group that ought to be defending free speech, but that isn't. CHRIS PLANTE, HOST, \"THE CHRIS PLANTE SHOW\": No. It's a catastrophic fail. I didn't watch it live, but I did DVR the dinner, and I have been to many of the dinners, as you have over the years, and I watched it yesterday morning and I took notes because it's my job. And I'm really embarrassed for them, I think they are unembarrassable, but for eight years, President Obama racked up what has to be, and what the ACLU described as one of the worst First Amendment records and presidential history. The ACLU described him as a terrible First Amendment President, all right. A terrible First Amendment President. On the campaign, they had three newspapers on the press plane for Obama in 2008 that did not endorse Barack Obama for President but endorsed John McCain for President. All three of those reporters, those three newspapers were kicked off of Barack Obama's campaign plane. That was in 2008. That was just sort of getting the ball rolling. During the course of the eight years, they squeezed out Fox News. Anita Dunn who was the Communications Director for Obama refused to allow Fox to participate in very important conference calls having to do with Benghazi, CI briefings having to do with Benghazi. They know where their bread is buttered and those people at the dinner are lackeys for the Obama administration for the Democratic Party. Fox News didn't sing from the sheet music, so they were targeted by the Obama administration. The Obama administration also spied on the Associated Press because there was a leak that they were not happy with. They liked to control their leaks. So, phones used by at least 100 reporters with the Associated Press were tapped. The records were -- they listened to the conversations, but they got the phone records to see who they were talking to. The Associated Press called it an unprecedented intrusion, and it was in fact an unprecedented intrusion. They spied on James Risen at \"The New York Times\" because he received a leak. They spied on phone records and other communications and so on. And at \"The New York Times\" and his work and home e-mail and phones were targeted. James Rosen, who you know, formerly of the Fox News Channel now, they spied on. You mentioned they spied on his parents who live in New York. They got phone records. This is the Obama administration, which is the heartthrob, still of the news media."

Raheem, thanks very much for joining us. So we have from Facebook the following explanation that in three cases, you said insulting things to people, you used one naughty word, one semi- naughty word and in the third case, you said someone was dumb and they said that this were against Community Guidelines, which strikes me as ridiculous given the level of vitriol on Facebook and Twitter.

I'm beginning to wonder if there's actually not an algorithm that's looking at this stuff anymore, but some little nerd in Facebook HQ who is just constantly refreshing my page looking for excuses to ban me. You know, last time they did it right before I gave a speech on the main stage of CPAC, this time two days before we relaunch humanevents.com and that locks me out of being able to reach to 800,000 people that Human Events has historically put together on its Facebook platform. But it's not about, you know, one person I've got so many testimonies from ordinary people out there who have the same recourse as I do -- to come on the Tucker Carlson show and I'm very grateful for it and talk about how they're getting banned, people who have had eight accounts banned at a time. And if I can just say something about your opening monologue as well, I mean you really hit the nail on the head. Firstly, the journalist in question at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, they'll back the First Amendment ostensibly, but where's their backing for the Second Amendment? You know, they seem to want to pick and choose and they also want to pick and choose the issues. You know nothing about these to Australian journalists who were detained by the FBI at LAX last week, nothing about members of the European Parliament who are having their platforms taken down right ahead of a European parliamentary election campaign and actually, this is becoming quite an embarrassment for America on the national stage -- on the international stage because these are American corporates putting their finger on the scales of elections taking place all around the world. And I really do believe, I mean, I know people like Donald Trump Jr. are doing excellent work to raise awareness of this, but I really do believe and I hope that it's time for this President actually took some executive action to make sure this isn't happening because what they're doing is tantamount to the thing that they complain about all the time -- collusion."

O'Brien is also trying to compel Smollett to appear at the hearing, but his attorneys are now pushing back and court documents show that Sheila O'Brien is requesting that Kim Foxx, Joseph Magats and Jussie Smollett produced their original files and documents to make sure they have not been altered or destroyed. O'Brien's petition says Foxx's actions created quote, \"an appearance of impropriety, a perception that justice was not served here, that Mr. Smollett received special treatment.\" Smollett's attorneys say a special prosecutor can only be appointed if a case is still pending and this one has been dropped. Meantime, in the college cheating scandal Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli and 15 other parents are apparently planning to fight the Feds. Today, they all officially pleaded not guilty. Loughlin is accused of paying a $500,000.00 bribe to get her daughters into the University of Southern California. Pleading not guilty certainly does not rule out a plea deal, but at this point cutting a deal would likely require jail time.

Well, the decline of families in this country ultimately is about the disappearance of fathers from so many homes. One in five American children, 15 million kids overall live with a single mother, no father present. Fathers are also disappearing in another way. Fewer men are marrying and more of them are not having any kids once they do. Michael Brendan Dougherty is a senior editor at \"National Review.\" He has a new book out, it's called \"My Father Left Me Ireland: An American's Son Search For Home,\" and it deals extensively with the role of fatherhood in his life and the success or decline of civilizations. Michael Brendan Dougherty joins us tonight. Thanks very much for coming on. MICHAEL BRENDAN DOUGHERTY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Thank you."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "This is a very personal and heavy duty and beautifully written book, but it sort of turns on the question of fatherhood. You grew up without a father in your home."

      "speaker": "DOUGHERTY",
      "utterance": "Right."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUGHERTY",
      "utterance": "Well, this is the foundational relationship -- this is the primordial fact of your life, it is who your parents are."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUGHERTY",
      "utterance": "And your father has a duty -- a father has a duty to protect and care for and provide for his children and a father also links his children to the society around him -- its institutions, its traditions, its heritage, what it has to teach him. And so growing up without a father can leave you feeling not only alienated from this primordial person in your life, but alienated from your whole society and your country. And in a sense, when fatherlessness is epidemic in society, it absents children from the conscience of their nation even, not just this one man, but everything he links his children to as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. So if we have 15 million kids growing up without fathers, that means there are millions and millions of fathers who have essentially walked out or just aren't present. You have this kind of amazing experience with your own father and a lesson really for a lot of those dads who aren't with their kids. What is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUGHERTY",
      "utterance": "Well, one thing is, you know, to say to any father out there is that many fathers are estranged from their children for reasons may be out of their control, maybe they were divorced and they didn't want to be -- and they're tempted to give up, you know, their own children turned against them and told, \"Oh, you don't need a father. You don't need this person in your life.\" And what I found is my father, he lived across the sea in Ireland and what I found out as I became an adult as I was becoming a father is that my father actually took risks, sometimes even dangerous risks to get to know me and to be known by me and that level of willingness to even put himself up to humiliation from his own son allowed us to reconcile as adults. And it began to connect me to him, to his whole family and to his nation of Ireland, which whose national stories kind of filled with this idea of sacrificing in the present for the future."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I just -- I love that and I wish we had more time, but I love the fact that he was willing to put up with the humiliation from you. Most people would not be willing to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOUGHERTY",
      "utterance": "Right, I mean, listen most teenagers are kind of callow -- but especially in this situation where a teenager feels who grew up in a fatherless home feels the right to kind of let his father have it and the fact that my father was willing to stand up to that and stand up through that eventually allowed us to reconcile and allowed him to be a good grandfather to his young grandchildren."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Modern life is making people stressed and miserable. It's also causing what appears to be biological collapse of the species, I'm not making this up. Male sperm counts have fallen by 50 percent in just 40 years. Huh? No one reports on that. We're about to. Stay tuned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Everyone knows someone who has struggled to have kids, to get pregnant. The question is why is this happening more than it used to happen? Well, here's part of the answer. Over the past four decades, sperm counts in men in the West have declined by more than 50 percent and they're still dropping. New statistics out last week show that many men are taking extreme measures like freezing their sperm in record numbers. So this is a huge change. It's gotten very little attention in the United States for reasons you can imagine, it's not something the left is interested in talking about. But in Israel, people are talking about it and one of the researchers taking the closest look is a physician called Haggai Levine and we spoke to him about it. Here it is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Dr. Levine, thank you very much for joining us tonight. As you know, testosterone levels and sperm counts are dropping among men throughout the West in every Western country where they've been measured. Very few people in the United States seem interested in why this is happening. You are interested. Why do you think it's happening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGAI LEVINE, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all it's really worrisome. There is not only decline, there is a dramatic decline of over 50 percent in sperm count among Western men. We don't really know the reason because so far, we have neglected to study what are the reasons for the decline of Western man at least of Western man fertility; however, we do know some of the factors which hamper and hurt male fertility and mainly man-made chemicals, endocrine-disrupting chemicals which harm testosterone at testicular development during the fetal period and also during adult life. In addition to chemicals, modern lifestyle which harm our health also harm our fertility, such as obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So the last three factors are well known in this country. People with sedentary lifestyles, overweight, smokers, of course they face health consequences. Dig down a little bit on what you just said about chemicals, which chemicals are affecting sperm counts and testosterone levels? And how does the average person encounter these chemicals?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVINE",
      "utterance": "So again, we did not study that well enough. We know for certain that certain pesticides, which I am personally studying here in Israel are definitely harmful to sperm. This makes a lot of sense because these are chemicals that were selected because they can harm reproduction and life itself at least of the past. But besides pesticides, chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenol A were proven to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals and they can especially harm the very sensitive development of the testicle in-utero between week eight to week fourteen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Give us a scope of the problem and why should the average American care that sperm counts are falling and testosterone levels are falling?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVINE",
      "utterance": "This is a great question, so not only that fertility is essential for extension and every young man may ask himself, do I want with children and be very worried if he is unable and we know already now that many Americans are sub-fertile, but more than that, we now know that semen quality is a good indicator of overall male morbidity and mortality. Low sperm count is associated with higher mortality, so the decline in sperm count means that we have poorer health of Americans, of Israelis and for other populations. More than that, this is a very sensitive marker of the environment. So the decline in sperm count means that we cannot keep living the way we live and the effect could be transgenerational, so even if we do something now, we can still see the consequences for ourselves and for next generations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Does lower sperm count, lower testosterone affect quality of life beyond the obvious? You can't perpetuate the species if your reproductive ability is impaired, but does the average man feel differently, do you believe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVINE",
      "utterance": "I definitely believe so. It is linked to many other diseases. The decline in sperm count, it's not only a problem by itself infertility, but it signifies a general health problem. So if we don't tackle the causes, we will continue to have many problems and you know, we know that there is a difference in longevity between men and women. Does it have to be so? Not necessarily. Maybe we see shorter longevity for Americans and for other men because of factors in the environment that we can prevent, and this is very important for every American and for every man in the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So my final question, what you've described is a global emergency that is destroying millions of lives. Why does nobody talk about this? Ever?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVINE",
      "utterance": "That's a bit of the problem in public health, because we don't see dead bodies on the street right now. People are dying everywhere and we have many health problems and we have huge economic problems due to these chemicals exposure, but we don't see it immediately. So that is the problem and many times with public health, unlike in medicine you cannot identify the specific person with the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The fact that it is affecting men, I think is part of the problem because men are bad, we keep hearing. Doctor, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight and thank you for sounding the alarm on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVINE",
      "utterance": "Thank you very much and I totally agree that men's reproductive health and health in general is neglected and this is a wake-up call for all of us. Thank you."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "utterance": "Before we go tonight, we want to pass on our congratulations to someone we love. There's something called the Six Marathon Majors, one of our favorite producers here Alex McCaskill plans to run all six of them. He just completed his third in London over the weekend. He has already raced in New York and Berlin, but yesterday in London, he was hoping to beat his previous times and he did by six minutes. He finished the race in three hours and 23 seconds, which is unbelievably fast, if you think about it. That mean he was going faster than eight minutes a mile for all 26.2 miles. The guy is a complete savage. Anyway, we just want to congratulate him, Alex McCaskill -- and a very good guy. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and especially groupthink. Good night from Washington. Great news on the horizon, Sean Hannity from New York City right now.
