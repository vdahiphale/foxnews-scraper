      "sentences": "Happy New Year to all. Welcome to \"Hannity.\"  Buckle up.  We have a lot to cover tonight, including an absolute beat-down of Hollywood by Ricky Gervais.  You just heard Tucker.  We'll play that tape.  We've got a lot more to get into.  Oh, Colin Kaepernick back in the news, too.  We'll touch that.  Plus, a lot of trouble tonight for Joe 30330. But, first, this is where we begin.  We're only 302 days away from the 2020 presidential election where you get the final say.  In less than a year, you will decide the future of this great country of ours.  Now, we promise the best election coverage on television with the latest developments.  We'll have breaking reports on the radical socialist Democrats, their liberal insanity, the impact to the country and the world, and, of course, the complicit media mob.  In other words, the corrupt, lying, state-run DNC TV. And unlike the media mob, we will thoroughly vet on this program the 2020 Democrats.  Make no mistake: our great American way of life, our prosperity, our security, our liberties, our freedoms, our values, it is all at stake and in play in 302 days.  And we'll also be launching, by the way, tomorrow morning on Hannity.com everything you need to know about voting -- all the deadlines in your state, your congressional races, early voting dates, absentee voting dates -- to be a more informed electorate.  It's now more clear than ever, Democrats care more about bashing this president than about literally anything else.   For example, the strike that took out Iranians terrorist leader Soleimani, a huge success.  The world is safer.  One of the world's worst terrorists, most powerful terrorist is dead. The mob and the media, the Democratic Party, they just seem distraught.  In fact, today, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, announced a resolution trying to tell the commander-in-chief what he can do and cannot do in Iran. Pelosi, obviously, again, knows nothing about the U.S. Constitution, separations of powers.  Yes, he is the elected commander-in-chief, not her. And this totally unenforceable, non-binding resolution is nothing more than the latest political hit job to undermine the president and, frankly, make us less safe as a country.  It also gives the mullahs of Iran, oh, another talking point.  Oh, the Democrats, they even say.   Now, we are getting lectures, get this, from the Benghazi Democrats, the bribe Iranian mullah appeasers, and the swamp -- how did that Biden/Obama $150 billion bribe work out for any of us?  The answer we now know -- it was a disaster. And now, the president is cleaning up their created mess.  Even Obama's DHS secretary believes President Trump utilized his full constitutional authority to take this action and, yes, we are better off. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "The hypocrisy, as usual, palpable.  And let's not forget, Secretary Johnson's former boss, President Obama, he himself launched 2,800 strikes in Iraq and Syria, guess what, Nancy?  No congressional approval. The speaker had no problem with any of that.  Now, when President Trump, he takes out the leading terrorist and American soldier killer outside of Baghdad, and she wants answers.  All this is, are repulsive, continuous, never-ending double standards, more feign, selective moral outrage -- only this time, it impacts our safety and security at home, our fellow American citizens abroad, our interest abroad.  So, let me educate Nancy Pelosi.  Let me educate all the other far left, rage-filled idiots in the media mob and elsewhere.  We have a new segment we're starting right now tonight called \"How to deal with the world's most evil terrorists for dummies\". First and foremost, you can't live in fear.  Second, you can't bribe your sworn enemies into liking you.  That is called appeasement.  Appeasement, when you try it, always results in further aggression.  What you're doing is you're literally teaching our enemies how to blackmail you.  Iranian aggression must be checked or it will get worse.  And it has gotten worse and worse and worse.  They must know their hostile actions have consequences.   And they don't get to shoot at our drones and take them out of the sky. They don't get to take oil tankers hostage in a very narrow Straits of Hormuz.  They don't get to disrupt the world's oil supply, the lifeblood of the world's economy by then hitting the Saudis so they can make more money. They don't get to kill our fellow Americans in Iraq.  They don't get to actively plot the murder of American State Department employees abroad. They don't get to orchestrate attacks on our embassy, our family, our U.S. family, our interests, American territory. They don't get to fund terrorism worldwide.  They can't fight their proxy wars all across the globe as they've been doing, and they can't try and take over the entire region and not expect some reprisals.  The Iranians frankly fighting -- have been fighting against us and the civilized world since 1979.  That is a fact.  A hundred and fifty billion in cash and other currencies did nothing to change that.  And tonight, the hostile regime in Iran is reeling.  Their top terrorist, Soleimani, will never see the light of day.  Good riddance.  Bye. His daughter proclaiming American soldiers will now be murdered all over world in retaliation.  Iran's government vowing to take revenge.  On state TV, one official offering an $80 million bounty for President Trump's head.   Now, that would be called saber-rattling.  By the way, this for the Iranians is pretty much an average day.  They hate America.  They hate Israel.  They threatened to wipe Israel off the map and they want to take America too.  That's a daily filling (ph).  It's been that way since 1979. They are bad, evil actors in Iran.  They're evil, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are stupid.  They know that there's a new sheriff in town tonight.  They now know tonight, the days of $150 million dollars in bribes and cash and other currencies dropped on their tarmac are now over. And they better know that if any retribution does occur, it will result in serious and lethal consequences.  I warned them that this would happen, oh, just a couple of months ago.  They will pay the deadliest of prices.  And without a doubt, they are now in a position of weakness, and we control the single, most powerful, advance, sophisticated military in the entire world with the greatest intelligence agencies.  Remember, I kept saying the 99 percent.  We saw this in action.  President Trump has already identified at least 52 Iranian targets that the U.S. will take out if needed. And no, we can't and we won't be going with boots on the ground in Iran. That's not going to happen.  And, frankly, it's not necessary. Instead, the president has been clear: we will strategically take out the mullah's ability to continue this reckless behavior, this saber-rattling, these attempts to bribe other countries or get paid or blackmail other countries.  They are not going to be able to disrupt the lifeblood of the world's economy, oil, as much as they have been trying.   Now, we are not -- and let me be clear -- I do not support boots on the ground.  After Vietnam and Iraq and the swamp creatures, they send our brave men and women, our national treasure door-to-door, endless wars, and then they say \"never mind\" -- those days must forever be over.  I've been saying this for sometime.  This is about what I've been calling the next generation of weaponry, offensive and defensive, much of which is already at our disposal.  In other words, that can and will be utilized to strike Iran's dictatorship where it will hurt them the most.  They've got three major oil refineries and we know where they are.  They have nuclear facilities, we know where they are. We know Iran's terrorists network.  Maybe even the mullahs themselves, maybe the mullahs, they're so brave.  Maybe President Rouhani, maybe he and the mullahs can hang out in one of those three major refineries, good luck if they do, because at this very moment, I can promise you, the United States military has the power to wreak total, complete havoc to this hostile regime in Iran.  And, by the way, they can do it in a control room right here, in an air- conditioned room in Tampa, or maybe Nevada, anywhere in the continental United States, and they can do so in a matter of minutes.  That's a fact.  The days of bribing our enemies and dictators and evildoers around the world, if you will, are over.  There will be no pallets of cash left on the tarmac for the mullahs in Iran.  Iran's dictatorship, they have a choice. They either comply.  They learn their lessons, or they will feel pain like never before. If you knock out those three refineries, their economy will totally and completely collapse.  And despite the whining and the complaining predictably among Democrats and the stupid commentators on TV and the media mob, top military experts agree that the president's strategy is effective.  In fact, General David Petraeus said that this strike against Soleimani was a bigger deal than killing bin Laden.  I put a lot of faith on what Petraeus has to say.  Let's take a look.",

And what I can't understand is why the liberals are celebrating Soleimani. And they can't accept that this president really has a solid strategy for Iran.  It's been clearly articulated, where, you know, we continue to apply maximum pressure so that they quit exporting terrorism throughout the region and the world, quite frankly, and they stop building nukes.  They can be a nuclear country like Japan with nuclear reactors, but not with nuclear weapons.  Quit this drive to hegemony in Southwest Asia, quite oppressing your people while we continue to defend our U.S. vital interests in the region, which is people, property and the free flow of oil through the shipping lanes.

OK.  It started off with a drone, started off with oil tankers.  Then it became rocketing our bases.  Then it became attacking our embassy. To say that we shouldn't disrupt that systematic escalation is absurd.  And I can't believe Democrats are actually making that argument.  You know, not too long ago, they were decrying Donald Trump for pulling out of Syria and living our Kurdish allies, which I agree with.  But at least I'm consistent.  They're not.  So, now, they don't want us protecting our own Americans in Iraq.  They're not principled.  They're not coming at this with principles backing them up.  They are coming at this politically-minded, to be against Donald Trump no matter what.

Yes, there he is.  Nike spokesperson, Hollywood darling Colin Kaepernick is defending the brutal mass-murdering Iranian regime, how a total ignorant, following the president's airstrike, taking out the guy that killed over 600 Americans Soleimani, sending out a pretty disturbing tweet, actually suggesting the attack was motivated by racism. Colin, here's a reality check.  Soleimani was a vicious war criminal.  Read your history.  He was the point man for the largest exporter of terrorism around the world.

Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up.  We have a lot to cover tonight, including an absolute beat-down of Hollywood by Ricky Gervais.  You just heard Tucker.  We'll play that tape.  We've got a lot more to get into. Oh, Colin Kaepernick back in the news, too.  We'll touch that. Plus, a lot of trouble tonight for Joe 30330. But, first, this is where we begin.  We're only 302 days away from the 2020 presidential election where you get the final say.  In less than a year, you will decide the future of this great country of ours. Now, we promise the best election coverage on television with the latest developments.  We'll have breaking reports on the radical socialist Democrats, their liberal insanity, the impact to the country and the world, and, of course, the complicit media mob.  In other words, the corrupt, lying, state-run DNC TV. And unlike the media mob, we will thoroughly vet on this program the 2020 Democrats.  Make no mistake: our great American way of life, our prosperity, our security, our liberties, our freedoms, our values, it is all at stake and in play in 302 days. And we'll also be launching, by the way, tomorrow morning on Hannity.com everything you need to know about voting -- all the deadlines in your state, your congressional races, early voting dates, absentee voting dates -- to be a more informed electorate.  It's now more clear than ever, Democrats care more about bashing this president than about literally anything else. For example, the strike that took out Iranians terrorist leader Soleimani, a huge success.  The world is safer.  One of the world's worst terrorists, most powerful terrorist is dead. The mob and the media, the Democratic Party, they just seem distraught.  In fact, today, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, announced a resolution trying to tell the commander-in-chief what he can do and cannot do in Iran. Pelosi, obviously, again, knows nothing about the U.S. Constitution, separations of powers.  Yes, he is the elected commander-in-chief, not her. And this totally unenforceable, non-binding resolution is nothing more than the latest political hit job to undermine the president and, frankly, make us less safe as a country.  It also gives the mullahs of Iran, oh, another talking point.  Oh, the Democrats, they even say. Now, we are getting lectures, get this, from the Benghazi Democrats, the bribe Iranian mullah appeasers, and the swamp -- how did that Biden/Obama $150 billion bribe work out for any of us?  The answer we now know -- it was a disaster. And now, the president is cleaning up their created mess.  Even Obama's DHS secretary believes President Trump utilized his full constitutional authority to take this action and, yes, we are better off. Take a look."

      "utterance": "If you believe everything that our government is saying about General Soleimani, he was a lawful military objective.  And the president under his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief had ample domestic legal authority to take him out without an additional congressional authorization."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "The hypocrisy, as usual, palpable.  And let's not forget, Secretary Johnson's former boss, President Obama, he himself launched 2,800 strikes in Iraq and Syria, guess what, Nancy?  No congressional approval. The speaker had no problem with any of that.  Now, when President Trump, he takes out the leading terrorist and American soldier killer outside of Baghdad, and she wants answers. All this is, are repulsive, continuous, never-ending double standards, more feign, selective moral outrage -- only this time, it impacts our safety and security at home, our fellow American citizens abroad, our interest abroad. So, let me educate Nancy Pelosi.  Let me educate all the other far left, rage-filled idiots in the media mob and elsewhere.  We have a new segment we're starting right now tonight called \"How to deal with the world's most evil terrorists for dummies\". First and foremost, you can't live in fear.  Second, you can't bribe your sworn enemies into liking you.  That is called appeasement.  Appeasement, when you try it, always results in further aggression.  What you're doing is you're literally teaching our enemies how to blackmail you. Iranian aggression must be checked or it will get worse.  And it has gotten worse and worse and worse.  They must know their hostile actions have consequences. And they don't get to shoot at our drones and take them out of the sky. They don't get to take oil tankers hostage in a very narrow Straits of Hormuz.  They don't get to disrupt the world's oil supply, the lifeblood of the world's economy by then hitting the Saudis so they can make more money. They don't get to kill our fellow Americans in Iraq.  They don't get to actively plot the murder of American State Department employees abroad. They don't get to orchestrate attacks on our embassy, our family, our U.S. family, our interests, American territory. They don't get to fund terrorism worldwide.  They can't fight their proxy wars all across the globe as they've been doing, and they can't try and take over the entire region and not expect some reprisals. The Iranians frankly fighting -- have been fighting against us and the civilized world since 1979.  That is a fact.  A hundred and fifty billion in cash and other currencies did nothing to change that. And tonight, the hostile regime in Iran is reeling.  Their top terrorist, Soleimani, will never see the light of day.  Good riddance.  Bye. His daughter proclaiming American soldiers will now be murdered all over world in retaliation.  Iran's government vowing to take revenge.  On state TV, one official offering an $80 million bounty for President Trump's head. Now, that would be called saber-rattling.  By the way, this for the Iranians is pretty much an average day.  They hate America.  They hate Israel.  They threatened to wipe Israel off the map and they want to take America too.  That's a daily filling (ph).  It's been that way since 1979. They are bad, evil actors in Iran.  They're evil, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are stupid.  They know that there's a new sheriff in town tonight.  They now know tonight, the days of $150 million dollars in bribes and cash and other currencies dropped on their tarmac are now over. And they better know that if any retribution does occur, it will result in serious and lethal consequences. I warned them that this would happen, oh, just a couple of months ago.  They will pay the deadliest of prices.  And without a doubt, they are now in a position of weakness, and we control the single, most powerful, advance, sophisticated military in the entire world with the greatest intelligence agencies. Remember, I kept saying the 99 percent.  We saw this in action.  President Trump has already identified at least 52 Iranian targets that the U.S. will take out if needed. And no, we can't and we won't be going with boots on the ground in Iran. That's not going to happen.  And, frankly, it's not necessary."

Now, we are not -- and let me be clear -- I do not support boots on the ground.  After Vietnam and Iraq and the swamp creatures, they send our brave men and women, our national treasure door-to-door, endless wars, and then they say \"never mind\" -- those days must forever be over.  I've been saying this for sometime. This is about what I've been calling the next generation of weaponry, offensive and defensive, much of which is already at our disposal.  In other words, that can and will be utilized to strike Iran's dictatorship where it will hurt them the most.  They've got three major oil refineries and we know where they are.  They have nuclear facilities, we know where they are. We know Iran's terrorists network.  Maybe even the mullahs themselves, maybe the mullahs, they're so brave.  Maybe President Rouhani, maybe he and the mullahs can hang out in one of those three major refineries, good luck if they do, because at this very moment, I can promise you, the United States military has the power to wreak total, complete havoc to this hostile regime in Iran. And, by the way, they can do it in a control room right here, in an air- conditioned room in Tampa, or maybe Nevada, anywhere in the continental United States, and they can do so in a matter of minutes.  That's a fact. The days of bribing our enemies and dictators and evildoers around the world, if you will, are over.  There will be no pallets of cash left on the tarmac for the mullahs in Iran.  Iran's dictatorship, they have a choice. They either comply.  They learn their lessons, or they will feel pain like never before. If you knock out those three refineries, their economy will totally and completely collapse.  And despite the whining and the complaining predictably among Democrats and the stupid commentators on TV and the media mob, top military experts agree that the president's strategy is effective. In fact, General David Petraeus said that this strike against Soleimani was a bigger deal than killing bin Laden.  I put a lot of faith on what Petraeus has to say.  Let's take a look."

I never thought giving $150 billion dollars in cash and other currency would ever buy any goodwill, sort of like the 9/11 Commission report.  They were at war with us.  We weren't war with them. The Iranians have really been at war and threatening America and threatening Israel and threatening the region now since 1979."

And what I can't understand is why the liberals are celebrating Soleimani. And they can't accept that this president really has a solid strategy for Iran.  It's been clearly articulated, where, you know, we continue to apply maximum pressure so that they quit exporting terrorism throughout the region and the world, quite frankly, and they stop building nukes.  They can be a nuclear country like Japan with nuclear reactors, but not with nuclear weapons. Quit this drive to hegemony in Southwest Asia, quite oppressing your people while we continue to defend our U.S. vital interests in the region, which is people, property and the free flow of oil through the shipping lanes.

What -- I think the answer on why the Democrats are the way they are, there is nothing Donald Trump can do that the left would give him credit for.  If he cured cancer, they'd impeach him for that.  So, we understand where they're coming from. Long term, how do you see the Iranians reacting to this, Congressman?"

OK.  It started off with a drone, started off with oil tankers.  Then it became rocketing our bases.  Then it became attacking our embassy. To say that we shouldn't disrupt that systematic escalation is absurd.  And I can't believe Democrats are actually making that argument. You know, not too long ago, they were decrying Donald Trump for pulling out of Syria and living our Kurdish allies, which I agree with.  But at least I'm consistent.  They're not.  So, now, they don't want us protecting our own Americans in Iraq. They're not principled.  They're not coming at this with principles backing them up.  They are coming at this politically-minded, to be against Donald Trump no matter what. So, Iranians will continue to escalate, I believe.  I think they're searching for those options right now, and we ought to be ready for them. Our defenses have to be up and we have to maintain a stiff backbone and be ready to respond when they attack."

Meanwhile, during the spring, summer and fall of this past year, the president was leveraging economic power, diplo -- he made diplomatic overtures, he was leveraging information power. And it was only when they crossed the red line, they killed an American citizen and wounded others, did the president react and rightfully so, stop an attack on our embassy.

To me, they are asking now the Senate to do the job they should have done. Now, at the end of the day, when you eliminate opinion witnesses, and hearsay witnesses, you only have one fact witness.  And that was Ambassador Sondland. What did the president want?  Nothing.  I want no quid pro quo. So, to me, it's a slam-dunk, and the idea also of an obstruction charge when there is a conflict between the executive and legislative branch and they seek remedy in the other branch of government known as the judiciary, and the Supreme Court is reviewing, that -- that's not reason for obstruction."

So, they produce a sub-par work product.  Nancy Pelosi gets challenged as to why it was rushed through, and she said, rushed through, we've been working on this for 2-1/2 years.

You saw Lloyd Doggett, one of my colleagues on the Democratic side, saying they may have additional articles of impeachment because while 2020 is a new year, it brought no new agenda for Democrats.  They see that the Trump economy is roaring, the American people are doing better.  And so, they're using additional impeachment tools to try to distract the American people. They need that distraction.  We don't, which is why I'm so glad, Sean, that you laid out a Trump doctrine in Iran that does not require some invasion, boots on the ground.  It means we go kill the terrorists and let's bring our troops home."

But inside the vehicle, an employee found a glass pipe with cocaine residue, along with the Delaware attorney general badge of Hunter Biden's deceased brother Beau.  The private eye says Beau Biden's ID and the name Joseph McGhee are proof Hunter Biden was committing identity theft.  The judge tossed out the claim. This is the same private eye who filed separate documents two weeks ago, claiming Hunter Biden laundered money, those were also denied. Biden who's being sued for child support has refused to turn over financial documents, including for his time on the board of Burisma.  We should note that Biden also was not charged for the cocaine pipe because there were no fingerprints on it -- Sean."

But it's really searing and shocking for the American people to have to listen to this.  And, look, they're voting with their feet, Sean.  I think we're watching Twitter and watching the clips and say, I might -- I might go back and watch the Golden Globes again.  But let's face it, these audiences are declining because they just don't agree with the values that are professed."

And we're also getting the first pictures taken inside Epstein's cell the morning he died.  They show piles of orange sheets and bed linens. Remember, the working theory is that Epstein hung himself by using bedsheets.  But in some autopsy pictures obtained by Fox News that we should warn are graphic, forensic pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden says the wounds on Epstein's neck do not match those that would come from a bedsheet noose."
