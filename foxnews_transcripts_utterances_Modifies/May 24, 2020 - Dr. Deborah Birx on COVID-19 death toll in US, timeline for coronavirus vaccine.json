We know being outside does help. We know sun does help in killing the virus, but that doesn't change the fact that people need to be responsible and maintain that distance. We know you're talking to the governor from Arkansas, he's made it clear that there are super-spreader events when people come together because of the nature of this virus and because of asymptomatic spread.

To make vaccines starting now as quickly as possible so when there is that efficacy and safety signal -- so we're not shortcutting the efficacy and safety testing, what we are shortcutting is the normal development time of manufacturing.

I want to put up two charts. This is the number of new COVID cases in Arkansas each day since March 1st and instead of a steady downward trend, folks looking at the graphic, you can see it's going up and down like the stock market, and you had your highest, that big spike on the right there, you had your highest single day of cases just this past Thursday.  And I want to show another chart which shows the number of cases since a week ago Friday from 181 cases last Sunday to 54 cases last Monday, and then as we say, up to 455 cases on Thursday.

It is important to note that there's two criteria for phase one. One is the 14-day decline in the number of cases. The other one is a decline in a positivity rate.  If you look at our positivity rates, 10 percent is the national standard you try to get to. We've expanded testing in Arkansas, but even with that, our positivity rate has been running lower than 5 percent of all of our tests. And so, you manage the risk by increasing the testing. You look at it as to whether the fact that we've lifted restrictions is one of the reasons for the increased number of cases and our answer is, we don't see a connection there. And we see it because we are testing more and we're following and tracing where those are coming from and they're not coming from the fact that we've lifted some of the restrictions.  For example, many of them come from the food supply industry, which is an essential service, nobody (ph) closes down anyway, and we can't. And so, you've got to manage the risk and we did, we believe comfortable in terms of meeting the criteria to go to phase one.",

So in January, February and March, when we didn't know that, we have visitors coming into our buildings, we had staff members in our buildings closely interacting with residents, as they need to, to take care of them, and we were unwittingly spreading the virus within the communities.  Once the academic community and doctors figured out that you could be asymptomatic and carry it, it was too late for a lot of people.

We understand that our mortality rates are less than those three countries and that's really due to the incredible work of our frontline hospital workers, but we understand that these number of infections has led to this level of mortality and our job now going forward is to do everything we can to prevent additional hospitalizations and additional mortality."

What do we know that has changed? We now have excellent scientific evidence of how far droplets go when we speak or just simply talking to one another and we know that it's important for people to socially interact, but we also know it's important that we have to have masks on if we are less than six feet and that we have to maintain that six feet distance. We know being outside does help. We know sun does help in killing the virus, but that doesn't change the fact that people need to be responsible and maintain that distance. We know you're talking to the governor from Arkansas, he's made it clear that there are super-spreader events when people come together because of the nature of this virus and because of asymptomatic spread. And people aren't intentionally spreading the virus. They don't know they're infected, but they come together and they're under that six feet and everybody who gets exposed to that person less than six feet has a chance of becoming infected."

We see what nursing homes are doing to try to make it safer for their residents. Let's even in public make sure that we're doing everything that we need to do to make it safe for others in public."

Like it is here in Washington, D.C., in Chicago and in L.A. And to really ensure that those with vulnerabilities are protected. So although it may be safe for some to go to churches and social distance, it may not be safe for those with pre-existing conditions, and that's why in phase one and phase two, we've asked for those individuals with vulnerabilities to really ensure that they are protected and sheltering in place while we open up America."

To make vaccines starting now as quickly as possible so when there is that efficacy and safety signal -- so we're not shortcutting the efficacy and safety testing, what we are shortcutting is the normal development time of manufacturing. And so really starting manufacturing what would be six months early, seven months early, that's how you could potentially shorten this by four to six or even eight months.

Governor, you met with President Trump at the White House this week and you said to him, in Arkansas, we're back to work. Now, I want to put up some examples of that. You never issued a stay-at- home order in your state, and now, you've officially reopened all your stores, restaurants, movie theaters and gyms, although at reduced capacity. Governor, what's your thinking about all that?"

That is just contrary to the American spirit. And we have to discipline ourselves. We have to manage the risk. I make the comparison with -- you know, you can be in an automobile and it's very risky, but you manage the risk by wearing a seat belt. At first, everyone resisted wearing a seat belt and said, well, that's a matter of freedom. Well, it is, but it's also a matter of safety. And so, we are managing the risk in Arkansas. We are expanding our economy. But right now, we have less than 100 -- we have less than 100 hospitalizations. Our death rate is low compared to the rest of the country. It doesn't diminish the seriousness in which we take it, but we have to manage the risk, grow our economy. We have to come back and not just in Arkansas, but nationally, because this virus is deadly, but it's going to be with us a while. We have to manage that risk."

I want to put up two charts. This is the number of new COVID cases in Arkansas each day since March 1st and instead of a steady downward trend, folks looking at the graphic, you can see it's going up and down like the stock market, and you had your highest, that big spike on the right there, you had your highest single day of cases just this past Thursday. And I want to show another chart which shows the number of cases since a week ago Friday from 181 cases last Sunday to 54 cases last Monday, and then as we say, up to 455 cases on Thursday. Which raises the question, do you really have the virus under control in Arkansas?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at those graphs that you see, it's really hard to see any period of time where you've got two spikes and one spike was about 30 days ago and then you had a decline in the cases, and that's when we reopen. It is important to note that there's two criteria for phase one. One is the 14-day decline in the number of cases. The other one is a decline in a positivity rate. If you look at our positivity rates, 10 percent is the national standard you try to get to. We've expanded testing in Arkansas, but even with that, our positivity rate has been running lower than 5 percent of all of our tests. And so, you manage the risk by increasing the testing. You look at it as to whether the fact that we've lifted restrictions is one of the reasons for the increased number of cases and our answer is, we don't see a connection there. And we see it because we are testing more and we're following and tracing where those are coming from and they're not coming from the fact that we've lifted some of the restrictions. For example, many of them come from the food supply industry, which is an essential service, nobody (ph) closes down anyway, and we can't. And so, you've got to manage the risk and we did, we believe comfortable in terms of meeting the criteria to go to phase one."

You said just yesterday at a press briefing that Arkansas is experiencing a second peak in new cases and you talked, for instance, about a swim party in north Arkansas where a bunch of kids were together and there was a spread of the virus. So, is there any thought about imposing new restrictions? Is it steady as she goes? I mean, how do you -- when you've got a new peak, do you respond to that in any way?"

      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",

It is a concern to us and part of it is transparency with the American public, with the Arkansas public and saying, we've got an increase in cases here. You know, what of the reasons for it? You know, what actions should we take in response to that? And to me, it's a matter of self-discipline and that's why I talked about the swim party and the fact that you can pass the virus at a swim party. I don't think we're going to say you can't invite anybody over to a pool in the backyard of your home. I think you have to exercise discipline and make sure you have the right constraints in place. And so, it's education. And you look at the reason for the spike and again, it's because we have greater testing. The fact that we're able to trace it, we want to build out infrastructure allows us -- we got to think about next fall. Where are we going to be? We're not going to be cloistered in our home. That's contrary to the American spirit. We've got to manage the risk next fall by the infrastructure that we're building now."

And so, our economy is stronger than and will rebound more quickly because it was not all shut down and people are going back to work.

Mr. Parkinson, a \"New York Times\" study found that one-third, more than a third, of all the deaths in this country from COVID-19 have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Obviously, the elderly are an especially vulnerable population. Incidentally, this wasn't just patients, this was also some of the workers at that nursing homes.

What we've learned from looking around the world is that any place where people live closely together, whether it's confidence or dormitories or cruise ships or nursing homes, they're particularly vulnerable. And it's because of one very unique feature to this virus, and that is that this virus, unlike any other that we fought before, a person can catch it, show no symptoms and yet still spread it. So in January, February and March, when we didn't know that, we have visitors coming into our buildings, we had staff members in our buildings closely interacting with residents, as they need to, to take care of them, and we were unwittingly spreading the virus within the communities. Once the academic community and doctors figured out that you could be asymptomatic and carry it, it was too late for a lot of people. And, unfortunately, even then we didn't have the test to figure out who had it. The good news that I can give this morning is that we're now in recovery, though, Chris.

And what that does is it creates the impression that even very good buildings are not good. It makes it hard for consumers to figure out what buildings are good and which aren't when everybody gets deficiencies. That same GAO report reported that 99 percent of those deficiencies were not severe. They did not affect patient safety. And many of them were just paperwork issues. The reality is that the coronavirus violates all of the normal concepts of infection control because normal infection control is symptom related. Now that we know that, we are adjusting our behavior, and that is why we're starting to see recovery and people actually getting better. Visitors are no longer allowed to come into building. Every interaction patients and staff now have masks on. Patients, residents are not eating together in the same room, they're eating privately in our own rooms so that now that we understand the very vicious nature of this virus, we're able to control it much better."

In hindsight, we now know that that was not the case. There was actually the capacity there. They didn't need to be discharged to nursing homes. In hindsight, it was an error. And to Governor Cuomo's credit, he has now reversed that policy. Fortunately, we were able to convince most of the other governors across the country to not institute that policy.

It was an error again based upon incomplete and inaccurate information. The country was too concerned with hospitals being overrun and there were consequences to that. One of the consequences is that nursing homes were left out. Our residents were not a high priority for testing. We weren't given the equipment that we needed. You know, there needs to be some accountability for all of these people that were making these fantastic estimates that the entire hospital system across the country was going to be overrun. It wasn't, and there are consequences. And, unfortunately, nursing home residents were one of the consequences."

And one of them is that people could be asymptomatic and -- and go into a hospital without any sign their ill and then still spread the virus to these very sick people. The result, as you've locked down, is we've seen these terrible scenes where, for their own good, residents are kept away from their families at some of them get very sick, some of them pass away and their families can't be with them when that happens. What are your thoughts about reopening nursing homes, letting families be with the residents, and under what structures, under what restriction so that the families can be together but you're not endangering the lives of - - of all the patients inside these facilities?"

And, you know, we've tried to offer FaceTime and all sorts of other alternatives, but there's just no alternative to being together. And then the tragic scenes of people dying without their loved ones, it's just -- it's -- it's horrible. The most important thing is that we need to keep Covid down in the communities that the nursing homes are in. If you're in a nursing home that's in a community that has very little Covid, there's not that huge risk of it getting into the buildings. If we spiked back up in Covid cases though, we're going to end up with more Covid in nursing homes. So issue one is, let's keep Covid down in the communities. Issue two is, let's get adequate testing so that we can get a test for every staff member, every resident. And then, ideally, if we could get on-site testing throughout the summer so that when people come and they get a test, we know that they're Covid-free, that would be the ideal. But we do recognize it's extremely important to get these folks back with their families."

But would you agree that the -- the Biden remark was pretty dumb? JONAH GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE DISPATCH\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. No, it was -- it's -- it was precisely the kind of thing that a lot of Democrats are worried about Biden doing again and again on the campaign trail. Regardless of the context of, you know, identity politics and blacks and the Democratic Party, just his sort of -- almost his insecurity to have to take everything to 11 and go just a bit further than the facts or -- or rationality sometimes allow makes a lot of people very -- very nervous about Biden.

But here's what I do believe. I believe that Joe Biden was incorrect in -- in saying the statement you ain't black. But I also believe that his apology was sufficient. Here we live in a -- in a country where thousands of people have died. And a disproportionate number of them are people of color, African-Americans, communities of color. And so I would rather spend more time talking about the -- the -- the disparities that we have seen that have been amplified during this pandemic then speaking about Joe Biden and his record of blackness. This is not just an issue of race, this is an issue of survival right now. And I hope that Joe Biden has learned his lesson, his advisors have also learned their lesson, that you just not -- you cannot be cavalier in talking about these issues. Stay -- stick to the facts.

Look, I think this whole episode, as Joe Biden often does, he just perfectly articulated the Trump campaign's central thesis for earning the black vote, which is Democrats have taken the vote for granted. Rather than going out and trying to earn the votes of black Americans, they've basically assumed it. And I think they would say that, conversely, the Trump campaign, once they get -- once the president was given the opportunity, he passed things like, you know, criminal justice reform, which is a long-standing priority of the black community, something that the Democrats have had an opportunity to do for a long time it haven't. You mentioned the -- the economic component. Again, I think what the Trump campaign would say is that those historically high employment numbers that we've had up until February, now compromised by Covid-19, are something he's uniquely able to do.

But this combative -- this -- this -- this posture that she has taken into the job I don't think is the right posture. I would hope that she could tone it down a little bit. And we all believe that as not just journalists but as individuals, we should be respected, regardless of where we -- where we sit. And I -- I just thought that that was inappropriate the way she went back, assuming that many of the people sitting in that room did not care about houses of worship. We want to all return back to normal, whatever that means anymore, but we want to do so in a safe way, in a way that don't harm ourselves and -- and those around us."

Not by the intel community entirely, but by Obama's chief of staff, by the former vice president, Joe Biden, by Susan Rice, by the Treasury secretary. I mean this is extraordinary."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

It -- it happens in the -- in the Trump White House. It happened, I think, 16,000 times the year before last. What's -- what's a crime is leaking it. But unmasking isn't. In addition to which, I have to say that if Kayleigh McEnany had told Sam Donaldson and me what questions we should ask, that would not have gone well, Jonah."

And I think that what she has done is she has -- you know, the sixth -- there's this cliche in Washington that President Trump wants Roy Cohn as DOJ, as the -- at the head -- as the attorney general. What Donald Trump wants in a press secretary is a Twitter troll who goes on attack, doesn't actually care about doing the job they have and instead wants to impress the -- really an audience of one, and make another part of official Washington another one of these essentially cable news and Twitter gladiatorial arenas. And it's -- it's a sign of the defining of deviancy down in our politics and it's only going to make things worse."

They work for the White House but they're paid by taxpayers. They are public officials. And Kayleigh McEnany isn't acting like she is working for the public. She acts like she is what she used to be, which is a spokesperson for the Trump campaign."

      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, Chris, I just disagree. I think Kayleigh's doing a nice job. And what's missing from this conversation that we've had this morning is the context by which she is making these statements. I think the -- any spokesperson in the Trump world, whether it's in the White House or the campaign, find themselves under constant attack by the press. The confrontation nature by which journals approach the questioning is not really to obtain much information so much as to try to back them into the corner. And I think Kayleigh said, I'm not going to play that game. And so, yes, it is completely different than what we've seen from years and years of briefings from press secretaries but I think it's reflective of the nature that we find ourselves in in."
