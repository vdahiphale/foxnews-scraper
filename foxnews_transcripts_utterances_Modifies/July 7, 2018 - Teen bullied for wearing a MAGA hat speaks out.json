Backfiring activism, that is the subject of tonight's \"Watters' Words.\" Hard core Democratic activists are threatening to overwhelm the rest of the party. They disrupt peaceful events, make threats and cause violence. This week we saw a teenager attacked for wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. That teen is going to join me later for an exclusive interview. On July 4th, in Lower Manhattan, Americans were sightseeing with their families, celebrating our Independence and preparing to watch the fireworks. Suddenly, a radical African immigrant activist began scaling the Statue of Liberty.  The woman, part of the Trump resistance movement refused to come down. Police and firemen were deployed. The entire Liberty Island filled with 4,000 tourists was evacuated. The statue was closed, 3,000 visitors were turned away on the monument's busiest day of the year because one selfish individual didn't agree with President Trump's immigration policy.  And after a four-hour standoff, she was arrested. Therese Okoumou, born in the Congo was slapped with a few misdemeanor charges. She's probably not even going to spend a day in jail. Now after causing the city tax dollars and man hours, diverting valuable police resources from fighting real crime and ruining thousands of Americans visit to the Statute of Liberty on July 4th. President Trump weighed in at a rally earlier in Montana.",

We all want families to stay together, so let's all work together to achieve that goal, while at the same time, protecting our border and protecting children from fake parent human smugglers. And radical Democratic activist tactics have turned regular Americans against their party and their cause. You'll remember Black Lives Matters protesters disrupted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade while parents were celebrating the holiday with their young kids. Occupy Wall Street protesters who wanted higher income for workers shut down traffic in Detroit so people couldn't commute to work on time and earn their income. Left wingers who were screaming about Trump's rhetoric on Muslims and immigrants cause mayhem during his Inauguration and fire bombed a limo owned by a Muslim immigrant. Idiots.

Come on, people, let's finish this.\" And not to be left out, Dan Rather wrote on this Fourth of July, \"I refuse to let Donald Trump have the flag of the United States as his own. I refuse to have the Pledge of Allegiance sullied by the jingoism and divisions of our present national leaders. I refuse to have the \"Star Spangled Banner\" used as a cudgel against principled speech. I refused to let the best of this nation be debased and weaponized against truth and justice. I refuse to bow to cynicism.\"   So why aren't liberals proud of America on the Fourth of July?

It was the first time anybody had made the argument that Obamacare was a tax rather than a fine, and as I recall, that was the logic that ended up being used by Chief Justice Roberts in determining that Obamacare was in fact legal under the Constitution. So, the original logic for that came from a Kavanaugh dissent in a case called Seven-Sky.",

I'm going to get one of those little kits, and in the middle of the debate, when she proclaims that she is of Indian heritage, because her mother said she has high cheekbones, that's her only evidence, that her mother said she had high cheekbones. We will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm. Even though it only weighs probably two ounces, and we will say, \"I will give you a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by Trump if you take the test and it shows you are an Indian.\"",

That teen is going to join me later for an exclusive interview. On July 4th, in Lower Manhattan, Americans were sightseeing with their families, celebrating our Independence and preparing to watch the fireworks. Suddenly, a radical African immigrant activist began scaling the Statue of Liberty. The woman, part of the Trump resistance movement refused to come down. Police and firemen were deployed. The entire Liberty Island filled with 4,000 tourists was evacuated. The statue was closed, 3,000 visitors were turned away on the monument's busiest day of the year because one selfish individual didn't agree with President Trump's immigration policy. And after a four-hour standoff, she was arrested. Therese Okoumou, born in the Congo was slapped with a few misdemeanor charges. She's probably not even going to spend a day in jail. Now after causing the city tax dollars and man hours, diverting valuable police resources from fighting real crime and ruining thousands of Americans visit to the Statute of Liberty on July 4th.

We all want families to stay together, so let's all work together to achieve that goal, while at the same time, protecting our border and protecting children from fake parent human smugglers. And radical Democratic activist tactics have turned regular Americans against their party and their cause. You'll remember Black Lives Matters protesters disrupted the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade while parents were celebrating the holiday with their young kids. Occupy Wall Street protesters who wanted higher income for workers shut down traffic in Detroit so people couldn't commute to work on time and earn their income.

We will rally each other and come back to the world once step at a time.\" Michael Moore said this. \"Happy resistance day. The revolt continues some 242 years later. Come on, people, let's finish this.\" And not to be left out, Dan Rather wrote on this Fourth of July, \"I refuse to let Donald Trump have the flag of the United States as his own. I refuse to have the Pledge of Allegiance sullied by the jingoism and divisions of our present national leaders. I refuse to have the \"Star Spangled Banner\" used as a cudgel against principled speech. I refused to let the best of this nation be debased and weaponized against truth and justice. I refuse to bow to cynicism.\" So why aren't liberals proud of America on the Fourth of July?

Those kinds of things. That's what conservatives tend to base their patriotism on, and not only ythat, Jesse, Democrats feel more patriotic when they are doing things like protesting. Actually, 51% of them, I believe said that they believe the patriotic thing to do was to break a law or to refuse to go to a war or to burn a flag.

A lot of people in the left and the media sided with Kim Jong-un against Donald Trump, and we saw Bill Maher the other day rooting for an economic recession.

And even Philippe didn't deny when I said that some Democrat patriotism is based on burning a flag or on protesting or refusing to go to war, and those kinds of things, so - or breaking a law, and so if that's the kind of thing they are basing it on, Jesse, it's a sad day in America."

He was one of the forces behind the selection of John Roberts, but there are two specific cases in which Brett Kavanaugh has I think done less that originalists would like. So, in one particular case, he denied jurisdiction on Obamacare because he said that Obamacare was actually a tax. It was the first time anybody had made the argument that Obamacare was a tax rather than a fine, and as I recall, that was the logic that ended up being used by Chief Justice Roberts in determining that Obamacare was in fact legal under the Constitution.

So, what we know about her is that is that she has written a lot in terms of academic writing, a lot of her academic writing has centered on originalism and textualism. She's a big supporter of the doctrines and philosophies of Justice Scalia. She's obviously personally very pro-life and so."

And now, we are hearing about Raymond Kethledge, now Raymond Kethledge, the third person, he was the runner up to Gorsuch and now he's making a late surge, too.

Kethledge's opinions are a lot more kind of punch you in the nose opinions. He has a strong record on the Second Amendment in particular. He also has a very strong record with regards to what we call Chevron Deference, which is the idea that when an administrative agency makes a judgment that that can still be - the Chevron Deference suggests it shouldn't be overruled by the Judiciary. He says the Judiciary is a separate branch and that the Judiciary should overrule - the Judiciary has to overrule, which I think is correct. I think Kethledge is a strong candidate."

I mean, Michael Horowitz in that IG report suggested that Peter Strzok was making decisions to privilege the timing of the Trump investigation above the Hillary investigation. In fact, one of the reasons they say that the Hillary investigation, the reopening of the Hillary e-mail investigation was delayed until late October is because Strzok wanted to place focus on the Trump investigation because he wanted to get it done before the actual election took place. Strzok is a political actor. There's no question about this, and even Horowitz essentially suggested as much in that much-maligned IG report.

They are going to cover Bernie? Hey, they are going to cover like sleepy Joe Biden? They are going to cover Pocahontas? Think of it. Think of it. She of the great tribal heritage. What tribe is it? Let me think about that one. In the meantime, she has based her life on being a minority. Pocahontas. They always want me to apologize for saying it. And I hereby, oh no, I want to apologize, I'll use tonight, Pocahontas, I apologize to you. I apologize. To you, I apologize. To the fake Pocahontas, I won't apologize. It's causing her problems, you know that name because now even the liberals are saying take a test. Take a test. You know, I tell you - I shouldn't tell you because I like not to give away secrets, but let's say I'm debating Pocahontas, right? I promise you I will do this. I will take you know, those little kits they sell on television for $2.00? I'm going to get one of those little kits, and in the middle of the debate, when she proclaims that she is of Indian heritage, because her mother said she has high cheekbones, that's her only evidence, that her mother said she had high cheekbones. We will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it, hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm. Even though it only weighs probably two ounces, and we will say, \"I will give you a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by Trump if you take the test and it shows you are an Indian.\""
