And as Nancy Pelosi gives in and accepts Mitch McConnell and the Senate's immigration deal after pressure from House Democrats. Which this bill we expect will make its way to the president's desk. And we also expect that because of all of this, this week, the border is destined to be a very hot topic again this evening.  But before we hear from the next round, let's dig into the ideas that were put forth last night which argued that United States taxpayers should be sending more money and more aid to bolster Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Got a lot of applause. Watch this.",

An in-depth look at the situation shows that economically, in terms of the way -- you know, the global markets look at countries, Honduras, and Guatemala, and El Salvador, are considered to be financially stable.  They enjoy, in fact, in many cases the same international credit as big countries like Brazil and Mexico. But they choose not to provide a social net for their poor. In fact, they have in their own legislatures voted down plans that would raise taxes among their own people in order to do so.   And it seems like they like this arrangement that pushes their poor to leave their countries and take these dangerous journeys coming up to America. Once they get here, they work and then they send a lot of money back to the country. Take a look at this Bloomberg chart that was published today. The pattern shows that these countries are getting 30 times more from America this way with this plan as they do in aid. And they don't have to provide any meaningful services then, for the poor people who leave their country and go elsewhere. We're going to debate this with Andy Puzder and Austan Goolsbee in just a moment. But first, we want to go back to Miami.

When I covered the 2015-2016 Democratic debates, Bernie Sanders socialist ideas we're sort of outliers, now, they're the norm. Take a look at some of these. Bill de Blasio, pushing a 70 percent tax rate for the rich. He and Elizabeth Warren raising their hands and saying they want to end all private health insurance in America affecting millions of people. And Jay Inslee vowing to end all fossil fuel production within a decade. On the border crisis, you saw Julian Castro there. He is all in unchanging a section of U.S. law to actually decriminalize illegal border-crossing. Now, the buzz I'm hearing privately from some Democrats here is that with really no major standout in the field so far, Castro really stood out a bit last night as he appeared to flummox Beto O'Rourke.  Remember him? He was somebody who the mainstream media had predicted would be a giant in this field, maybe the next Obama, not so much. Watch.",

Now, just a few months ago, top Democrats though were opposing the president's national emergency, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, both claiming it was a manufactured crisis. Interesting, Castro at one point recently called the border crisis B.S. He and many Democrats though, are now saying, it is a crisis as they tried to score political points on the president.

Should we try and help them solve those problems? Should we do what we can to try and lift those people as we do people across the world? Sure, we should. But the idea that our government's going to go down there and solve the problems in what they call the northern triangle is ridiculous.

It's just a month ago that the two of them last met, that was when the president was here to meet the new emperor, Naruhito. But President Trump raising some eyebrows before coming here to Japan when he suggested the defense agreement between the United States and Japan that goes back to the 1960s is so one-sided that if the United States were to get into a conflict, the only thing that Japan would do would be to watch the unfolding conflict on a Sony TV. Well that prompted Japanese officials to say look, while this whole thing is not exactly equal, that it is very balanced. Now the two of these leaders are friends now that they'll likely quickly get past those comments. It's been an awful a lot of time together they really do like each other as you see Abe greeting Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. They love to play golf together. They love to spend time together. So, a comment like that likely will probably be dealt with pretty quickly. The last time the leaders were together they were talking about trade and they likely will again today. President Trump making some news by saying that any trade deal between the United States and Japan to replace the current trade agreement will wait until after elections that are coming up next month in the upper house of Japan's government called the Diet where half of the members are up for reelection. Shinzo Abe trying to strengthen his hand there so that he can craft a deal with the United States and more power to craft the deal with the United States. President Trump is looking for something to level the playing field and reduce the tens of billions of dollars in trade deficit that the United States has with Japan every year. The president also raising some eyebrows when it comes to the Indian Prime Minister Modi who he will meet with a little bit later on today. The president saying that he is not happy that India has slapped very large tariffs on American goods. A lot of that was in response to the United States leveling tariffs on steel. The big meeting though, still tomorrow, that's when the president will meet with Xi Jinping of China. There were some reports out earlier in the day and the stock market was looking optimistically at this that the United States may agree to a precondition of easing restrictions on Huawei which is the Chinese telecom giant that the president slapped restrictions on recently as a precondition of that meeting. And also, that President Trump may forestall for six months the imposition of new tariffs on some $300 billion in Chinese goods.

So logistically, it seems like they're never going to be able to get this case resolved in time for these things to be printed for them to go out so it looks like the question doesn't make it. But this is what the president is saying today. A couple tweets tell us he's not done with this fight. Here's what he says. He says, \"Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed country, cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important census, in this case for 2020. I've asked the lawyers if they can delay the census, no matter how long, until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter. Can anyone really believe that as a great country, we are not able to ask the question whether or not someone is a citizen. Only in America.\" It's funny because there were a number of concurring decisions, dissenting decisions. Justice Alito wrote one that went both ways and he asked this question too. He said, you know, in our hyper-partisan environment right now, it's turned into a political question, people are calling this racist. But he said a lot of other countries ask this question. So, Justice Thomas also writing in part about this. He said it should not have gone beyond whether or not you can ask the question. He said, \"Our only role in this case is decide whether the secretary complied with the law and gave a reasoned explanation for his decision. The court correctly answers these questions in the affirmative. That ought to end our inquiry. The court, however, goes further. For the first time ever, the court invalidates an agency action solely because it questions the sincerity of the agency's otherwise adequate rationale.\" So, there are a group of these justices who felt like the question should survive all the scrutiny but the fight over it is not over. So, Martha, we'll see whether there is any way in which administration can delay this whole legal fight or at least the printing of the documents. Until that legal fight is settled and possibly get the question onto the census.",

What John Roberts was trying to do and I think you're right, but I would say it a different way, it's almost like he was trying to find any reason, give me any reason where I could side with the four liberals. For some reason he considered about 50 percent of the time he likes to saddle up next to them on these important decisions and I think it's a real -- it's a real example of judicial activism.

A weakening of the concept that you should only be here if you are here legally. Elizabeth Warren said on the debate stage the other night that she wanted to make legal the crossings at the border even when you're not allowed to be here. There's a weakening of what it means to be a citizen. If you allow people to get into the count who aren't here legally or who aren't citizens, that screws up the whole ability to properly apportion congressional seats.

They enjoy, in fact, in many cases the same international credit as big countries like Brazil and Mexico. But they choose not to provide a social net for their poor. In fact, they have in their own legislatures voted down plans that would raise taxes among their own people in order to do so. And it seems like they like this arrangement that pushes their poor to leave their countries and take these dangerous journeys coming up to America. Once they get here, they work and then they send a lot of money back to the country. Take a look at this Bloomberg chart that was published today. The pattern shows that these countries are getting 30 times more from America this way with this plan as they do in aid. And they don't have to provide any meaningful services then, for the poor people who leave their country and go elsewhere.

Now, just a few months ago, top Democrats though were opposing the president's national emergency, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, both claiming it was a manufactured crisis. Interesting, Castro at one point recently called the border crisis B.S. He and many Democrats though, are now saying, it is a crisis as they tried to score political points on the president.

After the financial crisis and the recession, the number of undocumented workers in the United States actually fell quite a lot. So, I think one reason that the tone has changed is the nature of the problem has changed quite significantly. And I think the second is you saw the Trump administration come in and take a series of actions that were viewed to be tough, harsh, whatever you want to call it. The zero- tolerance policy where they started separating kids from their parents."

I believe we will lose the election if we put up a nominee who runs on this. Because if you go to the American people, half of which have private insurance and a lot of them like it including our seniors, by the way, Martha. About half of our seniors have something called Medicare Advantage which they select. That's private insurance. How are we going to do as a party if we're running on taking away the Medicare plan that half of our seniors have chosen? This is one example. And I think everyone has been afraid to talk about this and we've kind of mindlessly been following Senator Sanders who's not even a Democrat by the way on this issue. I mean Senator Warren outsourced her whole health care platform to Senator Sanders. We've been mindlessly following him on this. And meanwhile, I'm like, someone's got to stand up and talk about this because I can assure you if we put a nominee up who runs on this, Donald Trump is going to talk about it.

And we should, ahead of that bilateral meeting get a light, what's called pool spray from them. So, we'll hear the two of them talk. It's just a month ago that the two of them last met, that was when the president was here to meet the new emperor, Naruhito. But President Trump raising some eyebrows before coming here to Japan when he suggested the defense agreement between the United States and Japan that goes back to the 1960s is so one-sided that if the United States were to get into a conflict, the only thing that Japan would do would be to watch the unfolding conflict on a Sony TV. Well that prompted Japanese officials to say look, while this whole thing is not exactly equal, that it is very balanced. Now the two of these leaders are friends now that they'll likely quickly get past those comments. It's been an awful a lot of time together they really do like each other as you see Abe greeting Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. They love to play golf together. They love to spend time together. So, a comment like that likely will probably be dealt with pretty quickly. The last time the leaders were together they were talking about trade and they likely will again today. President Trump making some news by saying that any trade deal between the United States and Japan to replace the current trade agreement will wait until after elections that are coming up next month in the upper house of Japan's government called the Diet where half of the members are up for reelection. Shinzo Abe trying to strengthen his hand there so that he can craft a deal with the United States and more power to craft the deal with the United States. President Trump is looking for something to level the playing field and reduce the tens of billions of dollars in trade deficit that the United States has with Japan every year. The president also raising some eyebrows when it comes to the Indian Prime Minister Modi who he will meet with a little bit later on today. The president saying that he is not happy that India has slapped very large tariffs on American goods. A lot of that was in response to the United States leveling tariffs on steel. The big meeting though, still tomorrow, that's when the president will meet with Xi Jinping of China. There were some reports out earlier in the day and the stock market was looking optimistically at this that the United States may agree to a precondition of easing restrictions on Huawei which is the Chinese telecom giant that the president slapped restrictions on recently as a precondition of that meeting. And also, that President Trump may forestall for six months the imposition of new tariffs on some $300 billion in Chinese goods. But in the 11 o'clock hour yesterday -- I'm getting my times mixed up yesterday in Japan time. Earlier this morning New York time, the chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow shot down those reports. Listen here."

      "utterance": "There are no preconditions. I don't know where that story came from or what they are talking about. We believe it's quite possible if the meeting goes well that the Chinese will come back to the negotiating table and we might be able to pick up where we left off in May where we completed roughly 90 percent of what could be a good agreement."

They will also be talking about technology, artificial intelligence, and the president will also be speaking about Iran. He'll talk with Vladimir Putin of Russia about that this afternoon, Japan time in a bilateral meeting. And French President Emmanuel Macron, even though he does not have a formal bilateral meeting with the president, told Reuters new news agency on his way here that he is going to urge the president during the summit to back off on some of the harsh sanctions against Iran in attempt to bring them to the table. We don't believe that the president will look too favorably upon that proposal because the president believes, Martha, the more you squeeze the leadership of Iran, the more likely you are to get them to the table.

Joining me now, Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown. Chief Brown, thank you so much for being with us tonight. You know, I guess the first question that you have a person of interest. You're looking for this mattress and box spring. Are you getting any closer to figuring out what happened here tonight, sir?"

We found out through a tip that this person of interest either gave away or sold a mattress and box spring last week. Now they didn't go to the same person. So that's our call today. That those people, those individuals that pick those up, if they would contact the Salt Lake City Police Department, we would love to get our hands on those so that we can process them for any additional evidence."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "A Supreme Court ruling today that could shape the future of American politics. The justices blocking for now a bid by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question on the 2020 census. Chief Justice John Roberts writing the decision for the majority, quote, \"We do not hold that the agency decision here was substantively invalid. But agencies must pursue their goals reasonably. Reasoned decision making under the law calls for an explanation of the agency's action. What was provided here was more of a distraction?\" Very interesting to read into the language in there. Chief legal correspondent and Fox News at Night anchor Shannon Bream is live in Miami covering the debates for us later tonight on her show but now with us on the Supreme Court. So, you know, first of all, what do you read into what Justice Roberts said there, Shannon? I'm curious."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, he did say that agencies can make decisions like this. The Commerce Department could add a question about citizenship probably to the census but he wasn't buying the explanation that Secretary Ross has given publicly about how the whole thing came about. He was basically saying this goes back to the lower court. So logistically, it seems like they're never going to be able to get this case resolved in time for these things to be printed for them to go out so it looks like the question doesn't make it. But this is what the president is saying today. A couple tweets tell us he's not done with this fight. Here's what he says. He says, \"Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed country, cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important census, in this case for 2020. I've asked the lawyers if they can delay the census, no matter how long, until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter. Can anyone really believe that as a great country, we are not able to ask the question whether or not someone is a citizen. Only in America.\" It's funny because there were a number of concurring decisions, dissenting decisions. Justice Alito wrote one that went both ways and he asked this question too. He said, you know, in our hyper-partisan environment right now, it's turned into a political question, people are calling this racist. But he said a lot of other countries ask this question. So, Justice Thomas also writing in part about this. He said it should not have gone beyond whether or not you can ask the question. He said, \"Our only role in this case is decide whether the secretary complied with the law and gave a reasoned explanation for his decision. The court correctly answers these questions in the affirmative. That ought to end our inquiry. The court, however, goes further. For the first time ever, the court invalidates an agency action solely because it questions the sincerity of the agency's otherwise adequate rationale.\" So, there are a group of these justices who felt like the question should survive all the scrutiny but the fight over it is not over. So, Martha, we'll see whether there is any way in which administration can delay this whole legal fight or at least the printing of the documents. Until that legal fight is settled and possibly get the question onto the census."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, obviously, you know, I thought in Justice Roberts' statement, it's almost as if he saying, you know, look, you need to give me a good reason for this agency changing of the question and it felt like the reason was kind of slapped on a political motivation. You know, that's my interpretation in a way of what he said."

    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "I think you're exactly right. Look, for most of our history we've had a question, like asking whether or not someone is a citizen, on the census. The Department of Commerce which has statutory authority over the census, Martha, needs no reason at all to justify putting a citizenship question on the senses. What John Roberts was trying to do and I think you're right, but I would say it a different way, it's almost like he was trying to find any reason, give me any reason where I could side with the four liberals. For some reason he considered about 50 percent of the time he likes to saddle up next to them on these important decisions and I think it's a real -- it's a real example of judicial activism. The court really has no role in this at all. And Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas said it very well when they said just that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Al right. So, you know, obviously, Democrats feel that this question will hurt their chances because there will be a lot of people who are new to the country or maybe they have relatives who are here illegally who just don't want to go near answering anything on the census and that in the law that it insist on the census, it says that every person should answer the census, not every citizen. And that's the language that they feel is more important. How do you answer that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, I like -- I agree that only people should answer the census. But as I said, for most of our history, there's been a question akin to this. And the secretary of commerce is totally in his right to add it. Martha, what's behind all this is this weakening of the concept of citizen. What does it mean? A weakening of the concept that you should only be here if you are here legally. Elizabeth Warren said on the debate stage the other night that she wanted to make legal the crossings at the border even when you're not allowed to be here. There's a weakening of what it means to be a citizen. If you allow people to get into the count who aren't here legally or who aren't citizens, that screws up the whole ability to properly apportion congressional seats. It screws up completely the whole idea of having an electoral college. Why is that surprising to us when the left and Democrats want to abolish the electoral college? They are doing everything they can to undermine these basic tenets of what having a successful and workable republic means."
