But there's no disagreement on our goal, our common goal of a security umbrella for all 29 of us. And I think the professional diplomats here are very good. And they do not bring up bilateral disputes or disagreements that they may have. We have good relationships with all of the other ambassadors, and we're able to talk through things. So, I feel very good about NATO staying very united and together. Unity is the most important thing that we have. And we do have it.",

Every NATO ally really in 2016 did not increase spending, but, as of today, every NATO ally is increasing their own defense spending. And, in 2018, when the numbers are finished, we will have the largest increase in defense spending by our NATO countries outside of the United States since the Cold War. So, I think that we are going in the right direction. Everyone is trying hard. There are differences.  I mean, look at Italy. They have had trouble forming a government. Germany took several months to form a government after elections. So, you have delays and then you don't get budgets. So I think we're going in the right direction. Do we have more to do? You bet. We do, because we want the 2 percent to represent not just a number out there, but the amount that we need to have a significant deterrence against a real enemy. And that is what -- it came up in the Wales summit. The number was 2 percent. Two percent is not too much to pay for the security and freedom of your people. And that's what NATO believes and that's what we're going to achieve. And we're going to do it in good order.",

And we want Germany to do more, but we respect that they're doing a lot in Afghanistan. They're one of the framework nations in Afghanistan. So we want them to meet the 2 percent, but there are other factors. All of these relationships are intertwined. So, yes, there is certainly some disagreement about the tariffs.  There's no question about that. But what I think is the purpose here is to try to get a more even trade relationship, and have a true alliance at NATO that does have some of our allies who haven't put up as much as they could, while they are giving in other areas to be helpful. So we have to balance all of this. We cannot step back on the 2 percent. That is what we need for the overall big picture security. But we know that many allies are also putting troops on the ground, advising in Afghanistan. And we're working with the Iraqis, as well, for advising them on how to get ISIS out of their country and stabilize their country. So we're doing many things in different areas, and we have to factor all of that in.",
