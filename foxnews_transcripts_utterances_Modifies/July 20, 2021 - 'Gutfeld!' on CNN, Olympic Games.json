The media lives in a bubble like the ones players blow while waiting on deck. For a brief moment that bubble popped Saturday night at a baseball game where the true reality of our crime epidemic hit home or rather home plate. They got a taste of how the rest of D.C. lives were policies the media supports have turned their neighborhoods into a John Wick movie. So will they learn any lessons from this? Will they reexamine their news coverage, especially regarding crime and how they drop that ball when it should have been a routine catch? Of course not.

Shocking as she's portrayed a school teacher many times, notably in student action volumes two four and 17 I never heard of her so I did my research which took between five and seven minutes. Sure enough, sure enough, she's got quite the output and a lot of inputs but the right overreact or is there more to this story than meets the thigh? A Turning Point spokesman told us, \"Turning Point USA did not block Miss Love from its student event. TPUSA did so in keeping with its standard operating procedures to not involve porn brands influencers or personalities that post and publish sexually explicit and pornographic content at student events. I have the same policy with a show dirty boy also said she bought her adult VIP ticket and that they didn't invite her, although she was the only one wearing a past that vibrated to in my mind this adult film star might have played it smarter given this was a teen event. I was at Turning Point yesterday cat you were there. You spoke on Saturday, I might here's the way I look at it.

For the press the game isn't just the past time, it's being seen in your awesome seats. Now obviously, CNN covered this shooting doing live shots outside the centerfield gate. Why is that important? Because it was refreshing to finally see CNN cover a crime story for once. If you watch their network, you were told crime was largely made up hysteria. Just an idea but nothing real like Antifa.

Or if Wolf Blitzer knocked off an armored car again. Until then they would only see it as something to be mocked. But now it's a story for the press. Because the press was already there at the game.

It is real and it is terrifying. But it's not a baseball game, so only Fox covers the crime that affects everyone. Michael Wolff is right. The media lives in a bubble like the ones players blow while waiting on deck. For a brief moment that bubble popped Saturday night at a baseball game where the true reality of our crime epidemic hit home or rather home plate. They got a taste of how the rest of D.C. lives were policies the media supports have turned their neighborhoods into a John Wick movie. So will they learn any lessons from this? Will they reexamine their news coverage, especially regarding crime and how they drop that ball when it should have been a routine catch? Of course not. They'll forget about it by tonight and say the game was postponed due to climate change."

Conservative Porn Star Brandi Love was turned away from Turning Points USA student action summit after was discovered she's a big time porn star. Shocking as she's portrayed a school teacher many times, notably in student action volumes two four and 17 I never heard of her so I did my research which took between five and seven minutes. Sure enough, sure enough, she's got quite the output and a lot of inputs but the right overreact or is there more to this story than meets the thigh? A Turning Point spokesman told us, \"Turning Point USA did not block Miss Love from its student event. TPUSA did so in keeping with its standard operating procedures to not involve porn brands influencers or personalities that post and publish sexually explicit and pornographic content at student events. I have the same policy with a show dirty boy also said she bought her adult VIP ticket and that they didn't invite her, although she was the only one wearing a past that vibrated to in my mind this adult film star might have played it smarter given this was a teen event. I was at Turning Point yesterday cat you were there. You spoke on Saturday, I might here's the way I look at it.

Meanwhile, Toyota has withdrawn its Olympic advertising campaign in Japan. The games are controversial in the host nation thanks to another COVID spike. And that's putting sponsorship deals in doubt until people are excited. Not because Japan passed an election integrity law, I don't know what that means. The games have faced so many problems.

Now, the sports and the pride are no longer the focus. We've got athletes complaining on the podium about their nation which alienates a lot of people. You don't see the same household triumph out of Olympic athletes in this day and age, because it's not what the games are known for. I mean, when you think back to icons, OK. I mean, obviously Bruce Jenner or Caitlyn Jenner comes to mind. But if you think of like Mary Lou Retton, if you think of guys like Carl Lewis, who had big Michael Johnson, iconic performances. We don't take that away from the Olympics now, we think about what we're mad at. And that's why I think Toyota was smart to pull out because no one's going to watch because here's the thing, obviously in Tokyo it's very unpopular because of the COVID. But then there's the reality that if you're watching at home, there's no fans, which is very jarring unless you're a Mets fan, that's really weird to look at.

A nursing home bought three of them but had to can the machine because it kept taking unplanned breaks, and a Scottish grocery chain and gave it the boot after it kept telling customers looking for various items to check the alcohol section. That's the same reason Kat got fired from Walmart. By the way, it's Scotland, of course, you go to the damn liquor section, it's Scotland. But just like Alexander Hamilton used to say, never send a boy to do a man's job or a woman because they belong in the kitchen. You didn't realize how sexist Thomas Jefferson was.
