But who's counting? What we do know right now is that really they're not in total agreement on all of this. Now, among some of the goodies packed into this for, $400 billion for child care and preschool, $150 billion for home care for the older population, $200 billion in a child tax, an earned income tax credit. Some of those could be phased out. The plan also includes about a half-trillion dollars for clean energy- related spending, $130 billion to help shore up the Affordable Care Act, $150 billion separately on housing, and then other investments that total close to $90 billion. Now, when it comes to paying for all of this, a 15 percent minimum tax on companies, about $350 billion coming from companies that move their jobs overseas, no details on how they will police that. Another $400 billion to help the IRS close the so-called tax gap and make sure those who are dodging taxes do not. Various other loopholes that could call for $250 billion worth of trying to close them. Now, we have been that way before. Is this the measure to finally get it done now? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And this is a divided world among moderates, who think that about $1.75 trillion is about right and progressives who say that's about half what they think would be remotely right. No indications as yet as to whether Bernie Sanders is going along with any of this. And all of this as the president's on his way to Rome with a message before he left, get this done. Will it get done? The latest right now from Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill -- Chad.",

So, for instance, I helped to craft a measure to invest in work force development. As you know, I have worked with Republicans over the years to put money into skills-based education and vocational education, which have been ignored for many, many years. And now this puts additional resources in there. And that helps to address a severe labor shortage which our employers have. Similarly, a lot of moms have dropped out of the work force because they can't get access to child care. And so this invests in helping to make sure that those moms, those working moms, can go back to work and their children are cared for, even as we are trying to get more goods and services produced, and we're trying to deal with a shortage of those too.",

Heating oil, natural gas, propane, electric are all going to be more expensive this winter.

Congresswoman AOC grilled CEOs about how involved they have been in lobbying efforts to try to stop the clean climate green energy reconciliation package that progressives have been working on, saying that she thinks that what gets lost in these conversations is that they have to live in the future and that, essentially, these oil companies are -- quote -- \"setting the world on fire.\" But they also did hear today from an ex-Keystone Pipeline worker that lost his job days after the president took office and made his first order of business to cancel the Keystone XL.

So Tim Cook was that, in reference to that a very strong performance in that quarter, it was despite larger, he says, than expected supply constraints, which we estimate to be around $6 billion, the supply constraints that were driven by industry-wide chip shortages and COVID- related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. Now, we also got some rare guidance here from Apple, something that they haven't been doing during the entire COVID era. And they're saying, Tim Cook is saying that the December quarter will be an all-time high. If we can bring up this quote for you: \"Best quarter ever,\" but -- here's the big but -- \"we expect supply constraints to be greater than the September quarter. And there are longer wait times for the iPhone 13 than we would like right now. And that's part of the supply constraints that we have been talking about.\" Now, when I asked him also about the outlook for the U.S. economy, I think this is very telling, and tell me what you think, Neil, but Tim Cook says that: \"I don't know right now is the real answer to that. I want to be optimistic, but it's a little unclear to me where it's going.\" So, if the world's biggest company, which you can argue probably has the most pricing control over its suppliers, makes its own chips, and, of course, is well-known for its innovative zero inventory supply chain, if they're being impacted, and it'll get worse in December, that means pretty much every company around the world is probably feeling the same pain right now.",

Now, among some of the goodies packed into this for, $400 billion for child care and preschool, $150 billion for home care for the older population, $200 billion in a child tax, an earned income tax credit. Some of those could be phased out. The plan also includes about a half-trillion dollars for clean energy- related spending, $130 billion to help shore up the Affordable Care Act, $150 billion separately on housing, and then other investments that total close to $90 billion. Now, when it comes to paying for all of this, a 15 percent minimum tax on companies, about $350 billion coming from companies that move their jobs overseas, no details on how they will police that. Another $400 billion to help the IRS close the so-called tax gap and make sure those who are dodging taxes do not.

But this additional bill, what we're calling the Build Back Better Act, has some key provisions that are going to help employers, employees and families. So, for instance, I helped to craft a measure to invest in work force development. As you know, I have worked with Republicans over the years to put money into skills-based education and vocational education, which have been ignored for many, many years. And now this puts additional resources in there. And that helps to address a severe labor shortage which our employers have. Similarly, a lot of moms have dropped out of the work force because they can't get access to child care. And so this invests in helping to make sure that those moms, those working moms, can go back to work and their children are cared for, even as we are trying to get more goods and services produced, and we're trying to deal with a shortage of those too."

And I plan to vote for it. And I think a lot of people are going to vote for it. I could use some Republicans -- we could use some Republicans supporting that as well.

Some in the Democrat Party say that you have to have both of those votes together, which means that the consensus for one is a prerequisite for the first vote. So, in my opinion, and, frankly, those shared by most people on both sides of the aisle, that's bringing those two back together. But the lack of confidence and transparency in this process should be concerning to every single American. An infrastructure package that spends less than 10 percent of the overall resources on roads and bridges over the next five years should be concerning. We're back to the days where you have to pass the legislation to know what's in it. That's bad news for every single American. And it feels like the great American shakedown, especially as we move into the larger, more problematic package."

A, it's half the price, but a lot more revenues than thought, raisers, than was the case, so it's very different than anything before. And we don't even know what this final package is. So where is he getting that information?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "T. SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Well, out of thin air, to be honest with you. There's no way in the world you can call this package paid for. Now only has he said it's paid for, but he also says it costs nothing. So costing nothing and being paid for means taking more money out of pockets of working Americans, on top of the already negative impact of inflation for many Americans well below $400,000. Their gas prices have gone from a $1.99 in December to $3.23 when I filled up in Charleston just this past Monday. So, on top of that, we're going to see a $1.75 trillion package that's paid for by higher taxes."

Amazon just out with numbers, and I got to tell you, unless I'm missing something, wildly missed on both the revenue and the earnings front. Furthermore, Amazon stock is dropping close to 5 percent right now on some very dismal fourth-quarter guidance and, in fact, telegraphing maybe a tough Christmas in terms of activity at the online retailer. Again, Amazon surprising analysts on the downside. This flies in the face of other earnings we have been getting that have largely been better than expected and further not warning or telegraphing problems. All the major market averages were up today ahead of this, including the Nasdaq, where Amazon resides. Nasdaq, in fact, finished at a record. Stay with us. You're watching \"Your World.\""

That is not the reason why Democrats in Congress dragged these oil CEOs and company presidents virtually to the Hill. They also didn't bring them here to talk about rising energy prices, which is something Americans are keeping their eye on. Heating oil, natural gas, propane, electric are all going to be more expensive this winter. But instead of addressing the cold winter ahead for many Americans and what Congress could do about it, Democrats instead turned their focus to global warming. Congresswoman AOC grilled CEOs about how involved they have been in lobbying efforts to try to stop the clean climate green energy reconciliation package that progressives have been working on, saying that she thinks that what gets lost in these conversations is that they have to live in the future and that, essentially, these oil companies are -- quote -- \"setting the world on fire.\" But they also did hear today from an ex-Keystone Pipeline worker that lost his job days after the president took office and made his first order of business to cancel the Keystone XL.

Now, there is something to what the White House is saying on this, that we came from an economy in park a year ago and all of a sudden any pickup in activity, the difference can be startling. And that did lead to an uptick in prices as well. But that is now exceeding the wage gains Americans are experiencing, because wages are indeed going up. But, unfortunately, they're being dwarfed by the cost of things that are going up a lot faster. To Gary Kaltbaum on this argument that inflation isn't that big of a deal.

And I can tell you, the more it persists, if this persists, consumer spending is going to come down because they're going to have less to buy. And we're going to get a lot -- we're already seeing a lot of shrinkflation. And I will be very upset if Yodels, instead of coming into a 10-pack, would be a nine-pack. So..."

And all of these companies that you mentioned, McDonald's and Chipotle and Kraft, they're actually liking what they're seeing, because they're so far easily passing along these increases because people, maybe with improved balance sheets and better financial picture, are paying it.

And, Neil, look, when you see things like gas prices up 110 percent from a year ago, we're talking about $100 billion out of consumers' pockets. That's just on filling up the gas tank. But you're also seeing it in copper and aluminum and coffee and cotton. And everything that moves, everything that goes into production of anything is going up, and it gets passed through. And if it gets into the system, you end up with hoarding. And if you end up with hoarding, you end up with a vicious cycle of shortages, which you are seeing right now. And that feeds on itself. And I don't know if we're there yet where automatically prices go up, where people and businesses worry, if I don't buy the heck out of something today, I'm going to pay higher tomorrow. If we get to that point, that's when you get into a spiraling effect. I don't think we're there. But if they think this is much ado about nothing and they do nothing about it or just think everything's just A-OK, oh, we will get there and it will not be fun."

And what the government of Mexico does is directly proportionate to what the U.S. asks Mexico to do and then the pressure that we put on them to help us out, if you will. As we saw in the last administration, Mexico is clearly capable of stepping up, enforcing their own immigration laws, and then helping create what we call then a regional safety. But without pressure, there's really not a reason for them to do that. So what we're seeing today, in my opinion, is just some semantics. They have a show of force, but they're clearly not trying to slow this down in any meaningful way."

When we have been serious about border security in my -- during my time in, Mexico was willing to step up and help us. But if we weren't willing to hold up our end, and we were just going to release people and not have any consequence, the question from my counterparts in Mexico was, why should we do all the work if you're not willing to do the endgame?

    },

We're spending millions and millions of tax dollars on the border right now. But instead of building a wall and a barrier and providing the technology to the agents that has already been paid for by the American taxpayers, we're paying contractors to sit there, stare at it and then excess it. We're not finishing those projects. Instead of paying for overtime and instead of paying for enforcement efforts, we're paying nongovernmental organizations to fly illegal aliens around the country after they have been processed and allowed in. We're also encouraging people to grab any kid they can, because they know that that's a free ticket into the U.S. under the current process, if you just answer a couple simple questions and get past the first step of the asylum claim.

Some do not really look at these grounds as any big deal. But when you go from something that started at 250 people, then 500 people, then 1,000, now 2,000, and 4,000, it begins to get attention. All right, some other things getting attention right now, earnings season. I told you about how Amazon disappointed a little while ago, especially telegraphing how things are going to go this holiday season. Two words, not well.

So Tim Cook was that, in reference to that a very strong performance in that quarter, it was despite larger, he says, than expected supply constraints, which we estimate to be around $6 billion, the supply constraints that were driven by industry-wide chip shortages and COVID- related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. Now, we also got some rare guidance here from Apple, something that they haven't been doing during the entire COVID era.

I want to be optimistic, but it's a little unclear to me where it's going.\" So, if the world's biggest company, which you can argue probably has the most pricing control over its suppliers, makes its own chips, and, of course, is well-known for its innovative zero inventory supply chain, if they're being impacted, and it'll get worse in December, that means pretty much every company around the world is probably feeling the same pain right now."

In the meantime, keeping you up to date on getting your kids vaccinated. No sooner, no sooner did we get word that an FDA panel says it's OK to go with Pfizer that we're already getting California going ahead with Pfizer and getting kids vaccinated. What about you? What about your kid? After this."

California is already setting up as we speak 4,000 sites to administer about 1.2 million COVID shots to kids after an FDA panel gave Pfizer the go-ahead for its treatment for kids as young, I think, 5 years old to 11 years old. Some thoughts now for Dr. Kevin Campbell, the K Roc Consulting president and CEO, cardiologist, a real smarty-pants. Always good to have you, Doctor."

The things to know about this is, there was more research done on this vaccine than a lot of the other vaccines we routinely administer to children over decades now. So I feel very good about the safety and efficacy of this vaccine."

      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "You know, I certainly understand that. Our children are precious and we want to make sure that we give them every advantage. What I would say is, talk to your health care provider. Talk to that pediatrician that you trust with your child. And get their advice. I say get the shot. I would certainly give it to my child, based on the preponderance of the evidence. It certainly saves lives. And its risk is minimal."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, a lot has been made, Doctor, of mandates. In New York, firefighters are complaining about a mandate they have to be vaccinated. As it turns out, about seven out of 10 of them are, but this is no loopholes for anyone. The others will have to go if they don't. What do you think of those types of policies?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "You know, I think mandates when they're used properly can be very helpful in motivating people to get vaccinated. However, we must remember, we're a free country, and we have the right to choose. So I certainly support choice. However, there has to be an alternative. De Blasio, in one week, has said, everybody has to be vaccinated in the police and fire department, and he has no option for maybe weekly or daily testing. I think we have to balance these mandates with protecting our right to choose."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, even at FOX, we have a policy, I'm sure you're familiar, where either show us your vaccination status or get regularly tested. But there doesn't seem to be much flexibility in some of these other positions. And I'm wondering if they're actually hurting more than helping. People see that and say, hell, no, I won't get vaccinated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "You know, I think it does create a lot of pushback. There may be people on the fence that sit there and say, I don't want my individual rights being tread on, so I'm not going to do it. Also, I think, from a patient and someone living in New York City standpoint, I think it's very difficult, because I think you're going to see shortages of police and firefighters and ambulances. So, ultimately, it's all of us who suffer at the hands of a mandate provided by the mayor."

So I'm told that immunocompromised individuals are the ones who make up half of these breakthrough cases. And yet I have heard from a lot of people who say, well, this is proof the vaccine is a joke, it's failing people. How do you answer that? Because I said, no, it isn't. I just gave you that data. But, no, people just will not hear it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPBELL",
      "utterance": "I think that's a fallacy. I think that that's absolutely not true. The reason that there's a predominance of elderly and immunocompromised folks that are getting breakthrough cases is because their immune system isn't as robust as younger, healthier folks. That is why. It has nothing to do with the vaccine not working. I think you have probably heard the buzz there may be a fourth COVID shot down the line for those that are immunocompromised."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, I know everyone is focused on the race in Virginia. And so you should be. It's tight as a tick. But this is a reading among independent voters in the Garden State, who overwhelmingly had been giving a double-digit lead to the incumbent governor, Phil Murphy. Now it's about dead even, with slightly more going to the Republican candidate. What to make of that in this bluest of blue states? Could it be a harbinger of things to come? To John Bussey, FOX News correspondent, but, more importantly, Wall Street Journal associate editor, and he knows his numbers, his politics, the whole shooting works. John. It would be a Herculean leap for a Republican to win in New Jersey. But it has been done, obviously, a number of times. In fact, Republicans who have made it to the governor's office have always been reelected in this last quarter-century, so not so Democrats."

    {
      "speaker": "BUSSEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, you just described neck and neck for independent voters. But it is the bluest of blue states. And Murphy is still leading by 11 points, which is a pretty healthy lead. It's come down a bit. It's tightened some in the last few months. There has been a few debates, other issues. I think that there's a kind of knock-on effect of Biden's approval ratings dropping after the Afghanistan withdrawal and after kind of -- during this logjam in Washington. But Murphy is still ahead. And I think that there's a really a big question about New Jersey. I think attention really is on Virginia, and for good reason, swing state, neck-and-neck race, lots of issues that voters are going to be thinking about in the next year as -- in the run-up to the midterms. This is really kind of a sort of a test for the Democrats and Republicans of issues that are going to resonate in the midterm elections in 2022."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's interesting. When you talk to both states' voters -- and you're right, I mean, that there's another poll about a week ago that showed a five- or six-point gap between Murphy and his Republican challenger, but you're quite right, all over the map, but nothing like the nearly 30-point lead that he had back in the summer. But the issue that keeps coming up that has changed is this -- the economy and inflation and taxes, particularly in New Jersey. And I'm just wondering, regardless of what happens Tuesday, if this spending package Democrats are working on now could help them or hurt them. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUSSEY",
      "utterance": "So, the possibility of additional spending cuts both ways, doesn't it? It would be a victory for Biden and if the Democrats who want to get this done before November 2, before these elections take place, to show that, yes, they really can make things happen in Washington. They view that as a potential boost in both the Virginia and the New Jersey races. On the other hand, we have had a fair amount of spending. Some of that spending has contributed to the disjuncture between demand and supply, which has led to inflation, lots of demand, logistically logjam supply. But a lot of that spending is going to be out over years. And you have a lot of people coming off extended unemployment benefits as well who are going to be bolstering the employment base. And that will bring down labor costs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. Like you say, it's too soon to tell. We will have to see what happens. All right, John Bussey, thank you very, very much. That will do it here. We will keep you updated on those."
