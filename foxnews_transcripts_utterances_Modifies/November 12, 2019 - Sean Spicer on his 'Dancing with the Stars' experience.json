      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's hard to think of an ideal more American than the freedom of speech. When people say our soldiers fight and die for our values, what they mean is our freedom to say what we think is true. That's our birthright. It's the most important thing we have -- that we have ever had. And so for generations, there was bipartisan consensus about this. In fact, liberals were among the most stalwart defenders of the First Amendment and good for them. But then the left took control of this country's institutions. Liberals became the establishment they had one opposed, and suddenly free speech seemed like a challenge to the highly profitable existing order, the one they were getting so rich from.  So our schools began to teach our children that freedom of speech is a threat. In fact, it's immoral. And over time the kids started to believe it. Why wouldn't they?  At this point, nearly 60 percent of young people believe we should change the First Amendment to ban speech they don't like. Now changing amendments is hard. Two thirds of Congress would have to approve a change like that.  But on campuses, many students aren't waiting for Congress to act. They've decided to impose censorship right now. Watch for example, kids at the purportedly impressive Northwestern University, try to ban Jeff Sessions from speaking out loud.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's Northwestern. It's funny, you know, if you're a middle aged parent and you're at dinner parties with other middle aged parents and they're talking about bragging really about what schools their kids go into, right, well, he got into -- you know, Cody got into Northwestern. It's really the Harvard of the Middle West.   And you think, yes, that's probably pretty impressive, right? No, that's actually what it looks like. It's not impressive at all. It's pathetic. Northwestern, by the way, is home to what they claim is that prestigious journalism school. And yet the student newspaper there apologized for daring to cover the Jeff Sessions event. The newspaper did, quote, \"Nothing is more important than ensuring that our fellow students feel safe.\" The editors later explained as if reporting was somehow a threat to student safety. Meanwhile, over at Harvard, the Student Government Association on campus which not incidentally is the single most overrated collection of people on Planet Earth, passed a statement condemning the student newspaper on campus because -- listen to this -- it had dared to ask the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency - I.C.E. to comment on a story.   They didn't endorse I.C.E. Someone just called up and said, hey, I.C.E., can we get a comment? Now, I.C.E. didn't respond and didn't provide a comment, but it didn't matter. More than 650 students at Harvard -- Harvard -- signed a petition condemning the paper for contacting I.C.E. The young Democrats at Harvard's campus issued a statement claiming the paper had -- and we're quoting now -- \"deliberately chosen to put our students in jeopardy.\" One campus activist group is now urging a boycott of the newspaper because calling I.C.E. was just that scary. It's pretty funny. On the other hand, it's really kind of ominous because our meritocracy is essentially fraudulent and our system is completely rigged for the benefit of a few. A lot of these shallow neurotic narcissists that we're making fun of tonight will in the end wind up running this country. Those people riving on the floor about how they're so threatened, yet, they're going to be in charge.  They shouldn't be. But because the system is rigged, they will be. They'll be making the decisions that affect your life and the lives of your children and grandchildren. And these are the people who literally couldn't care less about the First Amendment or any amendment, or in fact, any document that might limit their power in any way.   They consider themselves gods, and they'd like you to shut up and obey. And they'll use force if they have to. So what kind of place will America be when those people take over?  Jason Hill thought about this. He's a Professor at DePaul University. He is the author of the fantastic book, \"We Have Overcome,\" and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on.",

Now, the tower in question was supposed to be renovated 25 years ago, but they never did. They had other priorities. The measures haven't stopped wildfires by the way, which recently erupted again across the state from wine country north of San Francisco and up at Napa and Sonoma to Brentwood on the west side of LA.  Hundreds of thousands of people are forced to evacuate. California's fire response is so unreliable that many rich Californians -- and this is a metaphor for the whole state now -- hire private fire departments to protect their homes. But if you're not rich, it can get really ugly really fast, and two weeks ago it did. The Tick Fire north of Los Angeles burned more than 4,500 acres and forced the evacuation of about 40,000 people. Southern California Edison cut power to the area and that meant people who live there couldn't pump water to fight the flames. Amy and David Lamon lost their home to the fire. They say it could have been saved if they'd had electricity. The join us tonight from the wreckage of their home in Santa Clarita, California.

They were arrested for murdering police officers at the 1981 Brink's robbery. One is still in prison. Boudin is a public defender who has never prosecuted a case. Of course, he went to Yale Law School, needless to say, along with every other mediocre lunatic in the world, along with Cory Booker. And then he moved to Venezuela to serve in the Hugo Chavez administration. You honestly couldn't make this up. Joe Alioto Veronese ran for San Francisco DA. He should have gotten the job.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's hard to think of an ideal more American than the freedom of speech. When people say our soldiers fight and die for our values, what they mean is our freedom to say what we think is true. That's our birthright. It's the most important thing we have -- that we have ever had. And so for generations, there was bipartisan consensus about this. In fact, liberals were among the most stalwart defenders of the First Amendment and good for them. But then the left took control of this country's institutions. Liberals became the establishment they had one opposed, and suddenly free speech seemed like a challenge to the highly profitable existing order, the one they were getting so rich from. So our schools began to teach our children that freedom of speech is a threat. In fact, it's immoral. And over time the kids started to believe it. Why wouldn't they? At this point, nearly 60 percent of young people believe we should change the First Amendment to ban speech they don't like. Now changing amendments is hard. Two thirds of Congress would have to approve a change like that. But on campuses, many students aren't waiting for Congress to act. They've decided to impose censorship right now. Watch for example, kids at the purportedly impressive Northwestern University, try to ban Jeff Sessions from speaking out loud."

It's funny, you know, if you're a middle aged parent and you're at dinner parties with other middle aged parents and they're talking about bragging really about what schools their kids go into, right, well, he got into -- you know, Cody got into Northwestern. It's really the Harvard of the Middle West. And you think, yes, that's probably pretty impressive, right? No, that's actually what it looks like. It's not impressive at all. It's pathetic. Northwestern, by the way, is home to what they claim is that prestigious journalism school. And yet the student newspaper there apologized for daring to cover the Jeff Sessions event. The newspaper did, quote, \"Nothing is more important than ensuring that our fellow students feel safe.\" The editors later explained as if reporting was somehow a threat to student safety. Meanwhile, over at Harvard, the Student Government Association on campus which not incidentally is the single most overrated collection of people on Planet Earth, passed a statement condemning the student newspaper on campus because -- listen to this -- it had dared to ask the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency - I.C.E. to comment on a story. They didn't endorse I.C.E. Someone just called up and said, hey, I.C.E., can we get a comment? Now, I.C.E. didn't respond and didn't provide a comment, but it didn't matter. More than 650 students at Harvard -- Harvard -- signed a petition condemning the paper for contacting I.C.E. The young Democrats at Harvard's campus issued a statement claiming the paper had -- and we're quoting now -- \"deliberately chosen to put our students in jeopardy.\" One campus activist group is now urging a boycott of the newspaper because calling I.C.E. was just that scary. It's pretty funny. On the other hand, it's really kind of ominous because our meritocracy is essentially fraudulent and our system is completely rigged for the benefit of a few. A lot of these shallow neurotic narcissists that we're making fun of tonight will in the end wind up running this country. Those people riving on the floor about how they're so threatened, yet, they're going to be in charge. They shouldn't be. But because the system is rigged, they will be. They'll be making the decisions that affect your life and the lives of your children and grandchildren. And these are the people who literally couldn't care less about the First Amendment or any amendment, or in fact, any document that might limit their power in any way. They consider themselves gods, and they'd like you to shut up and obey. And they'll use force if they have to. So what kind of place will America be when those people take over? Jason Hill thought about this. He's a Professor at DePaul University. He is the author of the fantastic book, \"We Have Overcome,\" and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on."

And this deference, the cult -- this cult of deference to children because these are children who do not want to have the courage or the convictions.

Also the President backed to his former Press Secretary's run on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" that run has come to an end, and Sean Spicer joins us tonight.

      "utterance": "Millions of Californians have spent weeks living without electricity, the state's electrical utility companies have failed to maintain their infrastructure. That's an understatement. Now, they're having to shut down power to prevent wildfires. For example, last year, a 99-year-old electrical tower owned by the utility company, PG&E ignited a fire that killed 85 people. Now, the tower in question was supposed to be renovated 25 years ago, but they never did. They had other priorities. The measures haven't stopped wildfires by the way, which recently erupted again across the state from wine country north of San Francisco and up at Napa and Sonoma to Brentwood on the west side of LA. Hundreds of thousands of people are forced to evacuate. California's fire response is so unreliable that many rich Californians -- and this is a metaphor for the whole state now -- hire private fire departments to protect their homes. But if you're not rich, it can get really ugly really fast, and two weeks ago it did. The Tick Fire north of Los Angeles burned more than 4,500 acres and forced the evacuation of about 40,000 people. Southern California Edison cut power to the area and that meant people who live there couldn't pump water to fight the flames. Amy and David Lamon lost their home to the fire. They say it could have been saved if they'd had electricity. The join us tonight from the wreckage of their home in Santa Clarita, California. Amy and David, first of all, I'm so sorry about what happened to your home. I'm glad that you are alive. For our viewers at home who aren't familiar with what happened in the Tick Fire, I'm hoping that our camera can pull back a little bit and give some perspective of where you are.

We can't flush the toilet. We have two different meters, which means, two different power sources, one for the home and one for our well and water tank. So to be able to power both the home and the well and water tank is very difficult, and we didn't even know these power outages were going to be occurring until I found out about it early October. They had recently upgraded our systems. We have all new power lines from here to the main road, all the hardware on the telephone poles have been replaced, and half of the telephone poles have been replaced. So we assumed that great, okay, we're getting some attention here in these rural areas, we will have power. You know, like we always have. We didn't know the plan was for them to also turn off our power as well. Which, unfortunately that's what happened."

I mean most times I would think, you know, they try and keep the power on no matter what, and now they're shutting it off proactively, they say, you know, to keep us safe, and when the fire came through, we couldn't use our hose to fight the fire or even hose down our house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "D. LAMON",
      "utterance": "And my message would be people in emergency situations need as much help from as many people as possible and having a reliable power source is vital in emergency situations whether it's the situation like ours, where we could have put the fire out when it first got started. People with medical equipment and their homes, people that have to evacuate need light to evacuate them. I mean, there's so many variables and that's the reason why we're here tonight is to try to make a difference to help people in the future, to put an end to this because our understanding is the long term plan is at least five to six years that Edison plans on doing this, as well as other power companies in Southern California."

The city has elected a man named Chesa Boudin to be the prosecutor. Now, Boudin campaigned on halting prosecution. It's kind of weird for a prosecutor to run against his own job, but he said he will no longer enforce laws against public camping, in other words, living on the sidewalk, soliciting sex, public urination, blocking sidewalks, and other crimes against the public. It's hard to believe that San Francisco's leaders could make the city any worse. But this guy is certainly going to try. By the way if you're wondering where he comes from, we never blame people for their parents, but it's interesting that his parents were both members of the Weather Underground terror group, something he is proud of. They were arrested for murdering police officers at the 1981 Brink's robbery. One is still in prison. Boudin is a public defender who has never prosecuted a case. Of course, he went to Yale Law School, needless to say, along with every other mediocre lunatic in the world, along with Cory Booker. And then he moved to Venezuela to serve in the Hugo Chavez administration. You honestly couldn't make this up. Joe Alioto Veronese ran for San Francisco DA. He should have gotten the job. Instead, he is here with us tonight. Joe, thanks so much for coming on. So this guy is -- I mean, you know, it's like every possible stereotype confirmed but of all the gigs he could get, why prosecutor? Why wouldn't you put him in something harmless?"

That's how far the left in this city has gone. And it's a very dangerous thing because, as you know, it's very important to have that healthy dichotomy between the DA's office and the public defender's office. How do you go one day from saying this murder suspect or robbery suspect should be let out of jail and the very next day say in front of that same jury that he should be, you know, he shouldn't be going to jail. And that's just not going to happen. But here is really -- the people that are really going to be hurt here are the citizens of San Francisco, because now it's perfectly legal -- because he came out and said, you can't -- he will not prosecute certain crimes, including defecating in the street, right? He has a real problem distinguishing between crimes of poverty and crimes committed by people that are poor. There is a difference. Crimes committed by people that are poor should be prosecuted. Crimes of property in this city, you know, there's an understanding that there shouldn't be. But now, it's perfectly legal to defecate on the front steps of the Hall of Justice.

      "utterance": "Deval Patrick was the Governor of Massachusetts, didn't improve the state one bit. No one really liked him. So of course now we think about running for President. That news comes on the heels of Michael Bloomberg setting up his presidential run. Who else is going to run as a Democrat? Every day a new story. Trace Gallagher has been following this from day one and he joins us tonight. Hey, Trace."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Tucker, the odds of Hillary Clinton running for President appear to be improving and here is why. In the fall of 2018, Clinton said she had no idea if she would run, but in March of this year she flatly ruled it out saying she is not running. But today, she said running for President is absolutely not part of her plans at the moment. Then said this. Watch."

      "speaker": "HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDidATE",
      "utterance": "As I say, never, never, never say never. And I will certainly tell you I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "The pressure is mounting. Curious because back in March, Michael Bloomberg also vowed not to run for President and now he too says Trump needs to be held accountable. So today Bloomberg tweeted quote, \"Officially filed in Arkansas to be on the ballot for the Democratic primary. We must defeat Trump. He has failed us at every turn.\" And the former New York Mayor added this. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR",
      "utterance": "We had to register and Alabama and here because of the time frames, so it doesn't mean we're going to run, but we do have to make sure that we are on the ballot if we do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Meantime, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a friend and ally of a former President Obama is also considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. If you're keeping score, Patrick also said that he would not run. Finally, lawyers for Tulsi Gabbard who is already running for President are now calling on Hillary Clinton to retract her comments saying Gabbard is a favorite candidate of the Russians and that they are grooming her as a third party candidate. Gabbard has consistently denied any interest in a third party run -- Tucker."
    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Gabbard-Putin 2020. That's insane. Trace Gallagher, good to see you. So is Hillary Clinton next? And by the way, why wouldn't she jump in? Everyone else has. Richard Goodstein is a former adviser to both Clinton's and he joins us tonight. So you just heard Hillary say it. Many, many people are putting very, very intense pressure on Hillary Clinton to run for President basically, they're demanding she run. Are you one of the people demanding?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON",
      "utterance": "So I'm just surprised that Fox News hasn't come out with a poll shown her way ahead, because how delicious would that be for ratings for Fox News to have Hillary Clinton in the fray, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. This is -- this is something that we're not manufacturing."

      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "You're right. I agree."
    },

      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So I actually would be happy never to utter the phrase Hillary Clinton because I think she is singularly uninteresting and banal. I've always thought that, but she is touting herself, that suggests that the field she believes is inadequate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Yes. I actually don't think she is touting herself. I put this under the heading of not impossible. But I would say there's really no evidence other than not utterly ruling it out in this interview that she is going for it. I mean, she is not where Deval Patrick is and Michael Bloomberg, both of whom have a high regard for themselves and not without reason. I don't -- I don't think the Democrats are yearning for more private equity interests. So Deval Patrick, I don't think that's it. And the notion -- with all due respect to him, and again, I think, different with you in terms of the job he did -- the notion that somehow, you know, he is going to unite moderates and liberals and he is black. Well, I think Cory Booker would say that -- I've got that lane filled."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right, so if you want an obedient servant of private equity who is also African-American, you've already got Cory Booker is what you're saying. And you're absolutely right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "That's right. Both of them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "You know, who shamelessly do the bidding of the finance community. But that's what's so interesting is you hear Democrats say, you know, they look around like we need more billionaires in the race."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So then the other half of the party says we hate billionaires. This is a collision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think news organizations love stories that say people are worried rather than everything's actually okay, because the polls indicate that the Democratic voters are generally actually pretty pleased with the field. And we've got somebody at the top of the field who beats Trump by -- in Fox News on poll by 12 points."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Then why would -- hold on. I mean, maybe you're right. I mean, I don't know. But then why would Michael Bloomberg get in if everything is great?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Because he is the same age roughly as Joe Biden. He looks at him, frankly, unable consistently to make as much sense as he would like to make. And he says, oh, I can do better than that. My answer to that is Joe Biden talked like that decades ago. This is not a sign of age. This is just Joe Biden, who incidentally, pretty much every Democratic voter has voted for twice on the on the ticket with Barack Obama."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you're saying that -- I mean, Bloomberg is doing this because he's just -- he is Napoleon. He is a tiny little egomaniac."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "I'm saying he has always wanted to run for President. He thinks he could do a really good job. He's got the money to run an unconventional campaign, and he looks at Biden and he says, I could do better than that guy and we're desperate, desperate, desperate to defeat Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So we need more billionaires. More billionaires. Richard Goodstein, great to see you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Former Press Secretary Sean Spicer was on \"Dancing with the Stars\" this season. A lot of people complained about him being there, but he made it a long time -- eight weeks, I think. He received support from the President. Here's a look at him dancing last night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Sean Spicer joins us tonight. So you did what you needed to do. You went all in. You're a savage. I love that and you lasted about five times as long as anyone predicted that you would. What did you think of the experience?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Honestly, I had a blast. I really, really enjoyed this. It exceeded my expectations. I went into this thinking one, two weeks, maybe I'm not really good at this, but I'll have fun. I'll learn something. I made it to the quarterfinals of this show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's unbelievable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "And it's because -- well, I had a tremendous amount of support. I thank the President of the United States, Don, Jr., so many folks that came out. Jesse Watters and so many folks that are friends and supporters, and made this journey so much fun, but I loved being part of the show. It was a great experience, and I think I'm better for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So Tom Bergeron is one of the hosts, wrote this kind of I thought, just kind of contemptible complaint basically about you going on the show. You didn't take offense, you decided not to hold a grudge, you acted like it never happened. You were totally nice. You just kept going and remained positive. And I have to say I was very impressed by that. Was it hard to remain positive while people were sniping at you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, it's not the first time that somebody has kind of given me some negative compliments that have come out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Good point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "But I think -- but I think what I would rather do is show by -- lead by and show by example. And what I think I've demonstrated is that we can bring a diverse group of people together. I love supporting conservative principles and being a Republican, I'm proud about that. But I think that I want us, our side to be better than their side and come together and show people that we can fight it out on principles and policies, but be good people come together. And I thought that what this show does so well is bring these people together, support each other, root for each other, leave all of the rest of that stuff aside, and for two hours, once a week, everybody gets to be on everybody's team and cheer for each other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And you did that. I mean, you refused to live down to their expectations of you. You refused to embody their attacks on you. You were relentlessly cheerful to the last minute, no matter what they said or did. And I just thought, you know, that's an inspiration to people. What did Trump say when you talked to him last night?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, I called him. He has been super supportive of me since I left the White House and then particularly, the last nine weeks and I called him to just express to him my appreciation for his continued support. The votes are what kept me in this. My judges' scores and my dance moves were not exactly on the highest end of the score. So I wanted to let him know how much I appreciated everything that he and his family did and all of his supporters for keeping me in this for nine weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's actually on believable. I don't think anybody has ever marshaled the support of the President of the United States. So are you finally coming back to Washington? You've been living in a hotel in LA for months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, the nice thing is look, I think God always has a plan. Tomorrow is my 15th anniversary to my beautiful wife, Rebecca, who was my number one champion, so I get to be home for my anniversary. It just means now I've got to find a gift real quick."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Thank you. That's it for us and we will back tomorrow night. Impeachment hearings tomorrow. Everyone is going wall to wall. We probably won't. We'll bring you the highlights for sure. In any case, we will remain the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Always. Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity takes the reins.
