What Donald Trump wants to do is fulfill his campaign promises to the American people and defend American workers. And when we here about huge effects here, let's do some of the numbers here. I mean, first of all, the reason why the president is doing this because if he doesn't do this, we were will lose our aluminum steel, aluminum industry very quickly and our steel industry very quickly thereafter.   If you look at the aluminum industry, for example, we are down now to less than 10 percent to fulfilling our demand. With lost six smelters since 2013. We are down to five smelters, only two of them are fully operational. We are operating at a 43 percent capacity factor and only one of those smelters makes the high-purity aluminum we need for our defense --",

Commerce Secretary Ross estimates that if you take the imported steel that goes into an American built car, it will increase the price of that car $175.  An analyst at the Cato Institute tweeted this. So, a new $175 per vehicle tax times 17 million vehicles sold in the USA in 2017 equals almost $3 billion in new annual consumer taxes, just for steel and autos. Overall, if I may, sir, if you talk about not just cars but all the products that use imported steel or imported aluminum, we are talking about a tax on American consumers in the billions of dollars.",

And then Donald Trump went on to the Democratic opponent who didn't support his positions on trade and he beat them, too. What Donald Trump wants to do is fulfill his campaign promises to the American people and defend American workers. And when we here about huge effects here, let's do some of the numbers here. I mean, first of all, the reason why the president is doing this because if he doesn't do this, we were will lose our aluminum steel, aluminum industry very quickly and our steel industry very quickly thereafter. If you look at the aluminum industry, for example, we are down now to less than 10 percent to fulfilling our demand. With lost six smelters since 2013. We are down to five smelters, only two of them are fully operational. We are operating at a 43 percent capacity factor and only one of those smelters makes the high-purity aluminum we need for our defense --"

Commerce Secretary Ross estimates that if you take the imported steel that goes into an American built car, it will increase the price of that car $175. An analyst at the Cato Institute tweeted this. So, a new $175 per vehicle tax times 17 million vehicles sold in the USA in 2017 equals almost $3 billion in new annual consumer taxes, just for steel and autos. Overall, if I may, sir, if you talk about not just cars but all the products that use imported steel or imported aluminum, we are talking about a tax on American consumers in the billions of dollars."

      "speaker": "NAVARRO",
      "utterance": "I like Secretary Ross' map of a whole lot better. Let's do it for aluminum. If you look at a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, a six-pack of beer or Coke, that's a cent and a half. If you look at the other end of the spectrum, Boeing 777, it's one of the best airliners ever made, it's $330 million aircraft. We are talking but it increased and caused at the worst of $25,000. So, when you're talking about these massive costs or whatever is in fact, it's not. There are no downstream price effects on our industries that are significant. What we are doing here, and let's be very clear about the mission --"

I want to ask you about that. Here are the countries that we import steel from. Canada is number one with 16 percent of the market. South Korea is number three. Russia is number five. And China is way down at number 11 with only 2 percent of our national steel imports. Question, how can Canadian imports be a threat to our national security when, for the last quarter-century under law, Canadian imports are -- the Canadian industrial base is considered part of our defense, the American defense industrial base?"

We get every year a half a trillion dollar trade deficit that transfers our wealth to other countries and basically offshore our jobs and our factories.

What he needs to understand and what the overwhelming majority of the businesses in our organization are trying to say is, this will cause huge damage across broad sectors of the economy. You maybe will be able to give a little bit of help to the steel and aluminum industries.

      "speaker": "BOLTEN",

And that's the issue that ought to be addressed. Ironically, the announcement that President Trump made this past week hits steel imported from all kinds of countries, most of them are friends and allies, many of them are free trade agreement partners, and hits China only minimally. China accounts for only 2 percent of the U.S. steel imports at this point. So, the remedies that Peter Navarro is pushing the president to impose doesn't address the real problem, which is Chinese overcapacity. Now, how do you address that? It's really hard. You've got to get together with our friends and allies, who all face the same problem, put pressure on the Chinese jointly, because you can't do this individually, and force the Chinese to reform their practices. But it's not an easy task. It's not as easy as waving your hand and putting tariffs on a whole bunch of countries that are not the problem."

And we are talking all kinds of products when you get to cars, when you get to tractors, when you get to airplanes, the cost is really high, making our products uncompetitive against their foreign competitors. That's number one. Number two on the retaliation point. I mean, Peter Navarro seems to be very comfortable that we won't get retaliated against. I hope he's right. But the history is completely against him on that and the statements of some of our trading partners already is against that. Now, I don't know if Peter Navarro would be willing to bet his job that he is right that there won't be retaliation, but he ought to be willing to make that bet because he's putting the jobs of tens of thousands of Americans who depend on these export markets that there won't be retaliation."

It isn't. Nobody wins a trade war, especially in these globalized days of the United States when we are so dependent on goods coming in and going out for our competitiveness.

You are the deputy chief of staff, first, in the Bush White House and 2002, President Bush, Bush 43, imposed steel tariffs of 30 percent on foreign steel imports. Now, he did exempt some countries like Canada, which this president, according to Mr. Navarro, is not going to do. There was retaliation from European Union, and eventually, less than two years later, you rescinded. You lifted the tariffs. What lesson did you take from that experience into 2002 and `03?"

And steel wouldn't be in the problem it would be today if those metrics had been effective. There's a very important difference between what President Bush did and what President Trump is proposing to do and it's a little bit detailed but bear with me for a second because I think it is very important. President Bush and most trade remedy measures of this kind of been done under section 201, which is a legal procedure accepted in the World Trade Organization which requires going to an independent body, to make a showing of injury. If you succeed in making a showing of serious kind of injury, the products get pared back as they did for President Bush. And then internationally, that's generally accepted as a way to proceed. Now, the Europeans in that case took us to the WTO. When they won the case, President Bush immediately removed the tariffs and there was no retaliation in that case. This is completely different. President Trump is proposing to proceed under a statute called Section 232 --"

The problem here is the instincts that the president brought with him from the campaign and you have to respect that. I mean, you have to respect what the president is doing here. He's had really strong policies on taxes, on regulation, but the third stool of international trade on which he campaigned is weak.

You look at somebody like Senator Toomey and his criticism of Senator Toomey. I've disagreed with the senator on some things in the past. He's somebody who's approached this issue with nothing but the utmost integrity. What makes this issue so hard pressed as a country is it is one of the flash points in a cultural, civic breaking apart that really does risk tearing our country. You have one half of the country, probably less than half of the country, who literally doesn't understand why somebody would want to have a gun, doesn't understand why somebody would want to use a gun. Then you have another part of the country that looks at it and says, every opportunity that those cultural elites have, they come and they try to take away the rights of law-abiding citizens. I think until we can get to a point where different parts of the country want to talk to each other, want to understand each other and can start finding the types of policies that will actually make a difference, we're never going to be able to have a country where people want to live and talk with each other."

I would just say it's not a debate between guns and no guns, it's a debate about what level of protection can we give kids in school? How can we take guns away from mentally unstable people, especially assault weapons? And I was in Congress when it did work in 1994. Dianne Feinstein had a bill to ban assault weapons, which passed. Of course the Democrats then lost their majority. Tom Foley, who supported it and was speaker lost, so people were spooked. Ten years later it expired.

The fix NICS bill could pass if Democrats want it to pass, if Democrats want to make a small step forward. Senator Rubio gave a great speech this week on the floor of the Senate where he was talking about specific pieces of legislation that have bipartisan support that actually could have prevented this attack from getting something like retraining orders from guns, making it easier for school officials to take people who -- who are known problems and sending them to the cops. We need to get those things done. I think the question is going to be, does the Democrat Party want to work with Republicans to get things done or do they want the issue?

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "All right, Gerry, this has always been an unruly White House, but it really did seem to veer out of control this week. Let's put some of this up on the screen. There were a series of leaks that seemed designed to weaken Jared Kushner. The president called a decision by Attorney General Sessions disgraceful. Economic advisor Gary Cohn is said to be on the verge of resigning over the issue of tariffs. And the president, according to some reports, wants his national security advisor, General McMaster, out. What is going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GERALD F. SEIB, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Well, so other than that, it was a great week. So, look, I -- I think that -- that there is a reality about this White House, I've talked to some people who work in the White House about it, which is that you're not going to change the way President Trump operates. He -- this is the way he is. And so I think it's a mistake to try to have a staff structure that is designed to change him. I think what you have to do is have a staff structure that works around the way he operates. And it seemed to be in place for a while. But Rob Porter, who was the staff secretary, who helped control things a lot, is -- is gone. General Kelly, who had seemed to have instilled some order, has now found himself feuding with Jared Kushner. That has created its own set of chaos. And I think you also have the reality that some of the top issues that have been bubbling along have now come to the surface. Trade, for example, which you just had some very interesting conversations on, was always going to split the White House staff. I mean that was below the surface. Gary Cohn is here. Peter Navarro is there. There's no getting around that when you get to the point where you want to act. And that was -- actually the most amazing thing that happened this week was this decision by the president to announce on his own, on the fly, that he was going to impose tariffs on trade and aluminum imports because the staff at been telling people, you know, just an hour earlier, it's not going to happen. So, when you bring that sort of question to the surface, you're going to see the splits. So you can't keep them hidden any longer."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Josh, how much concern among top Republicans in this town, I'm mostly talking about in the building behind me, about staff disarray and policy disarray in the White House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOSH HOLMES, FOUNDER, CAVALRY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the second piece is -- is the most important to that because the -- the -- largely the palace intrigue is something the media has been obsessed with since day one in any administration. And this administration is no different. It seems to be more of a central thesis with this administration than previous administrations. But I think, in terms of Congress, the only time they care about this is when it affects the policy. And I think this week was the first week in many, many months going back to probably July of last year that it did. And we saw that with the rollout of this -- of these trade proposals. A lot of misunderstanding about what they actually were and a lack of consensus internally. That is a problem because Congress reacts only and exclusively to consistency from the administration. You've got to remember, there are 535 different opinions up there. At least 200 of them wake up every morning and look at the mirror and see the new president of the United States. They all have their own individual opinions. And so they need consistency from the administration to help guide their view."

But when we come back, we'll discuss Vladimir Putin's announcement, Russia has new, invincible missiles that can penetrate U.S. defenses.

      "utterance": "Russian President Vladimir Putin with an ominous warning after announcing a new generation of nuclear weapons. And we're back now with the panel. Congresswoman Harman, how important was Putin's announcement? Do we think he really has these weapons? And, if so, does -- how does it change our relations with Russia? Are we headed for a new Cold War?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, let's focus on the fact that there's an election in two weeks in Russia. Vladimir Putin's essentially unopposed, but it wouldn't hurt to put out a big campaign speech, which he did very effectively. On the weapons themselves, some of its new, some of it isn't new. The footage he used, or a lot of it, was from a 2007 Russian documentary which has been on YouTube since 2011. So that's clearly not new. And talking about his ability to be invincible, well, not so much, but -- but cruise missiles are much harder to defend against than missiles that have a -- a parabola that goes up and then comes down. That's what our defenses are geared for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But what -- but on the -- on the real issue, I mean this clearly -- I mean the animation actually showed the missile headed towards North America. I mean what does this say about U.S.-Russian relations?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it -- it says saber rattling. It say, my button is bigger than your button and all of that. We -- we've seen that movie recently. And we also should worry about Russia transferring technology to other countries. We've just learned that Russia has been laundering coal from North Korea to other places. So, not so good. But what I wanted to say was, there is a missile defense review underway. We should do more with our missile defenses. They're never going to be perfect. Russia could overwhelm us. But we could overwhelm them. And as to a new Cold War, I don't think so. I think the world is multi-pollard (ph). It's a very different world now. But what happened to the vision that Ronald Reagan had about a shining city on a hill. Not just being tough on defense, which we should be, but where's the vision for America and our role in the world? That we could do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "We asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Alex Atmore. Wouldn't imposing the sanctions that Congress approved of near unanimously be a good deterrent without further escalation? Josh, how do you answer Alex?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a great question. And, you know, the irony of this administration and how they've dealt with sanctions is actually only fueled the greater speculation about all of the election of 2016 and all of the investigation that have gone into it had they implemented the sanctions, I think, without any question, they would be in a much different situation with respect to the investigations. So, look, I -- what we're doing currently is clearly not working. You had DNI Director Coats out, you had CIA Director Pompeo out, all saying we're not doing enough to deter Russia, particularly with respect to our elections and the midterms coming up. And so I've talked to a number of members of Congress. They all think that we've spent far too much time talking about 2016 elections, not nearly enough talk about 2018 elections and it's time that we turn the page and address some of that."

Here he is."

    {
      "speaker": "NEEDHAM",
      "utterance": "He should be very clear about that. And we need to protect our critical infrastructure and he should never miss an opportunity to make it clear how much, and we're committed to that. Look, I think writ large American foreign policy towards Russia for a long time has been a little bit naive and I think that the Trump administration writ large has been bringing it together into a very coherent national security strategy that they put out there that needs to be more aggressive in looking at how we're dealing with the Russian threat, recognizing that Vladimir Putin is not backing down, he's doubling down and it's going to take a unified national response from our nuclear postural review, from our relationship with Ukraine, from our relationship with the sanctions that you brought up. I think the Trump administration has done a very good job of taking our foreign policy, unifying it around themes, backing up our allies, being more aggressive towards Russia. But, clearly, there's more that we need to do to make it clear that election meddling is not something that we're going to tolerate."

And targeted sanctions that hit individuals and prevent them from traveling and prevent them from using international banks would make a huge difference in Russia, and I think Trump missed an opportunity by just putting out there the Fortune 500 list and not doing anything. I think that was a strategic blunder."

I think that there is more bipartisan consensus that we need to come together on some of those issues that he needs to continue."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    {
      "speaker": "SEIB",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I -- I think there's a -- an unfortunate reality here, which is that the -- the debate about the 2016 election, which has consumed this conversation about Russia, is probably something, if you could do what you just suggested, put it in a box and get onto the broader realities here, that would be healthy. That's not happening. I think it's not happening in part because both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are obsessed with what happened in 2016. But the deeper reality here is that democracy is -- is under attack. And not just from Russia and not just in 2016. It happened in Europe in 2014, 2015, 2016. It happened here. It's apparently happening here now. Both the Russians, Vladimir Putin, and President Xi in China, would like to hold out other models besides democracy as the model that other countries in the world ought to follow. There's a really sustained attack on the -- basically the institutions in -- of democracy and its role as a model for the world. And that's the broader issue here. And it's now being basically lost as a question that ought to be discussed because of this obsession with 2016. And I don't know how you break out of that."

But of this continuing -- now we are a year and a third into this administration --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEIB",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's obvious that the -- the kind of broader issues we're talking about here don't get raised, don't get discussed. But at some point the Robert Mueller thing comes to an end. I don't know what the end point is, but at some point later this year, I assume, it will be reached and then we'll know the answer to some questions and maybe then we'll move on to the broader questions."

      "speaker": "HOLMES",
