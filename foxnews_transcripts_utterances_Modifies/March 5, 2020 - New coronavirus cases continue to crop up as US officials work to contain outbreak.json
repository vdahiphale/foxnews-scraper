And I closed them down very early, against the advice of almost everybody. And we have been given rave reviews. And that's why we have only right now 11 -- it's a lot of people, but it's still 11 people, versus tremendous numbers of thousands of people that have died all over the world. We have 11. We have 149 cases as of this moment. This morning, it was 129. And I just see you -- right now, it's about 149 cases. There are 100,000 cases all over the world. So we're really given tremendous marks for having made the decision.

And our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago. But you know very well David, because you're into the world of regulation -- I think it was maybe one of the biggest things we've done. I've cut regulations more than any president -- whether they're eight years, four years or one case quite a bit more than eight years. I cut more than any other president in the history of our country, and I did it in less than three years. So it's a great question. The EPA was -- this is why I was able to get the country going, because so many jobs were stopped, by not only EPA, so many other agencies where you'd have to go get 11 different permits for essentially the same thing. I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer trying to get permits -- they couldn't get permits. I got them built. A $10 billion plant in Louisiana. They Keystone XL pipeline, I gave it -- in my first week I got approval. The Dakota Access pipeline, I got the approval -- 48,000 jobs. And frankly, it's more environmentally -- you know, it's better than having the train going up and down tracks, and you don't know what happens with the train -- plenty of bad things happen with those trains. Here you're underground, environmentally better. So I think it's a great question. We're really -- one of the reasons the economy is so strong is because of what we did with regulations.

Today, we came close to another 1,000 point loss with all major averages and lower as markets remain incredibly volatile in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus. The Dow closing down over 900 points. The S&P down 105 with all sectors in the red. And the NASDAQ down 279 points, with many investors actually moving their money into safer bets like gold and government bonds. One sector getting hit hard is airlines. Today the International Airline Transportation Association predicts the impact of the coronavirus will cause a loss of $113 billion in revenue. This comes as airlines like United warm they will cut international flights by 20 percent and domestic flights by 10 percent by this April as they cope with weaker demand. And the cruise industry is also taking a beating. Bookings are down 40 percent with some crew socks tumbling 50 percent this year already. In fact, a new survey from Go Banking Rates shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans would turn down a completely free cruise if they were offered one because of the fears of the coronavirus. And companies across all sectors are coping with supply chain issues. Apple warned its retail employees they could face shortages of iPhones as well as replacement parts, as many are sourced in China. And Bret, I've been reporting actually from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange all week and traders have been telling me the swings might become the new norm, especially as the impact of the virus may take months to dissipate.",

Also says, Attorney General William Barr's decision to conduct a press conference and issue a letter immediately prior to releasing the redacted version causes the court concern. He's also saying that Barr's lack of candor calls his credibility into question. We'll follow this story. Overseas, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, says violence from the Taliban is not acceptable. Pompeo, telling workers at the State Department today, he expected renewed conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan following Saturday's peace agreement. The U.S. stage the drone strike against the terror group this week, following an uptick in Taliban attacks against Afghan forces. Pompeo, says the violence must be reduced immediately for the peace process to move forward. Turkey, says it will deploy Special Forces along its land border with Greece to prevent Greek authorities from pushing back people trying to cross into Europe. This comes after Turkey declared a previously guarded -- its previous and guarded gateways to Europe open. Thousands of refugees and other migrants have tried to cross into Greece from the Turkish land and sea border in the past week.

And one of the things I did is, I closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected, and really having a lot of troubles, I mean, countries and areas of countries that have had a lot of problem. And I closed them down very early, against the advice of almost everybody. And we have been given rave reviews. And that's why we have only right now 11 -- it's a lot of people, but it's still 11 people, versus tremendous numbers of thousands of people that have died all over the world. We have 11. We have 149 cases as of this moment. This morning, it was 129. And I just see you -- right now, it's about 149 cases. There are 100,000 cases all over the world. So we're really given tremendous marks for having made the decision. And that was a decision I made to close down the borders, so that people from China, where we take in thousands and thousands of people a day, they stopped coming in very early, weeks ahead of where they normally would have been stopped. Thank you."

But some of the Democrats have said, no matter what -- if we found a cure, and everybody's better tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, they would say, he's done a terrible job. It's just automatic. How is the president doing? Oh, terrible, terrible. They don't mean it. And we have done a great job. Again, we have gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of a thing. And it's -- and the other thing, I'm working with phenomenal people, with CDC and all of the people involved. Mike Pence is doing a fantastic job.

Even the James Bond movie, they're delaying because of coronavirus. I'm wondering what you think is the long-term -- over the course of the year, Wall Street says that they don't expect U.S. companies to have any growth in 2020, which is pretty surprising.

And even though it's down 10 or 11 percent, it's still the highest it's ever been by far. It certainly might have an impact. At the same time, I have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the U.S. And I like that. I have been after that for a long time. You know that. I have been saying, let's stay in the U.S., spend your money here. And they're doing that. They sort of enforced doing that. We met with the airline companies yesterday.

That's when we first started really to see some possible effects. But even despite that, the country, we are having the greatest year. We had -- last year was the greatest year we have ever had economically. And I think the way we unite is really through success. But when they hit us, we have to hit back. I feel that.

If I said, OK, let them just keep hitting at me, and I won't do it, they're not interviewing me right now. They're interviewing somebody else.

      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, we had a justice come out and criticize me badly. And I just responded to what she said. I had it twice. And when you look at -- I had a very harsh criticism, as you know, Justice Ginsburg, during the -- just before a debate during the election, as I was getting elected. She came out. She had to apologize. It was a terrible thing she said. She should have never been allowed to say it. But if they say something to me, I'm not allowed to say back? You had another justice say something that was somewhat derogatory. And all I did was respond. But I didn't respond like Schumer. Schumer, that was a physical thing, in my opinion. He tried to say, oh, well, that has to do with the election. That had nothing to do with the election, the way he said, we're going to hit back, like you have never seen before? That was a real intimidation. And the best you can say is, they're trying to intimidate, so that the judges vote -- so the justices vote their way. That's no good either. But that was a physical -- that was really -- if a Republican did what Schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, I'll tell you right now."

The last time he put out one of these rare statements, it was about you and the federal judge that you called an Obama judge. So, to Martha's question, is there something about apologies on both sides when dealing with justices or judges?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Because -- because, number one, Mitch McConnell did a great job, but the Republicans did a great job. But the bottom line is, President Obama gave me 142 openings when I first got there. Normally, you would have -- there's never been anything like that. Normally, you would have no opening. Now, you say he's a great president. The most important thing you have to do, I say, is the military, but a lot of people say is judges and justices of the Supreme Court. President Obama gave us 142. It's unheard of. If you have one, it's like you got lucky -- had (ph) 142. We're up to 220 federal judges and court of appeals judges, two Supreme Court justices. I mean, it's incredible. But we were going -- if you go to the Ninth Circuit, if you go certain places, it's almost impossible to win. So, I was surprised at Justice Roberts. And I have a lot of respect for him. I like him personally. I have a lot of respect. But I think that could have been left unsaid, because a lot of people, a lot of very top legal minds disagreed with him when he said it. Now I'm just talking about the facts. I'm talking about sort of the facts of life, that's the way it is."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "David, I love the question because our EPA is much different. We're very tough, but we get things done, and we're taking regulations off like nobody's ever seen. And I say very simply, I want to have the cleanest air on the planet. I want to have the most crystal clear beautiful water on the planet. And our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago. But you know very well David, because you're into the world of regulation -- I think it was maybe one of the biggest things we've done. I've cut regulations more than any president -- whether they're eight years, four years or one case quite a bit more than eight years. I cut more than any other president in the history of our country, and I did it in less than three years. So it's a great question. The EPA was -- this is why I was able to get the country going, because so many jobs were stopped, by not only EPA, so many other agencies where you'd have to go get 11 different permits for essentially the same thing. I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer trying to get permits -- they couldn't get permits. I got them built. A $10 billion plant in Louisiana. They Keystone XL pipeline, I gave it -- in my first week I got approval. The Dakota Access pipeline, I got the approval -- 48,000 jobs. And frankly, it's more environmentally -- you know, it's better than having the train going up and down tracks, and you don't know what happens with the train -- plenty of bad things happen with those trains. Here you're underground, environmentally better. So I think it's a great question. We're really -- one of the reasons the economy is so strong is because of what we did with regulations. If the other side -- we'll call it the other side, affectionately, got in they would have made regulations much, much tougher. Thank you."

Texas was close, she got votes -- she didn't do well, but she got a lot of votes -- far more than the difference. I think about Maine. Maine was almost a tie. They had to wait a day and a half before they could even call it, it was so close. She, I guess, came in third, and it was, you know, a very distant third. But she got a lot of votes. Maine would have gone to -- I think he would have gotten everything, right? Bernie Sanders would have won five, six, seven states -- would have won Minnesota, would have won at least another two or three states. So when you look at it, she did him no favors. That was not a good friendship. That was -- we started to see that during the debates, by the way, that one became unhinged."

If she weren't -- if she just dropped out of the race without an endorsement, he would have won a tremendous number of states that he lost. You know, he lost states by not very much.

We picked up three Democrat votes on top of that. And we had one Democrat - - was so angry by it that he left the party, became a Republican, which I think is a first time because he left a majority and went in to a minority. Van Drew. And it was a whole fake deal. And everybody knows that. I made a phone call, it was a perfect phone call, there was nothing wrong with it. And they said, let's impeach. Now the real back story is when the phony whistleblower - who's a total phony -- he heard the call supposedly, you know, through somebody -- through the informant. You notice the way everybody disappeared once -- thank goodness I had a transcriber -- we had more than one. Thank goodness we had that call transcribed, because the transcripts of the call reveal that it was a perfect call. By that time they were already talking about impeachment, and they were going by a phony whistleblower rendition of a call that didn't exist. Just like Adam Schiff, he goes before Congress and he starts talking about eight quid pro quos, and don't call me I'll call you. Well that's a mob expression. Don't call me, I'll -- and everybody's saying that's a terrible call. He made it up -- it was totally made up. And I said, oh good, we'll sue him, we'll take him down. And then I find out he's got immunity because he made it in Congress. It should almost be the opposite. You should almost have to be more honest if you're in Congress."

A lot of people -- I saw a couple of statements, very strong statements by very respected people in your world saying they aimed at Trump, but they took Biden down. And really that's what happened, when you think. Because you look at the son -- here's a guy, didn't have a job, was unfortunately, sadly -- the military was a very sad experience for him. He goes out, he gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt. Worse -- just as bad, China -- I just made a great China deal. China is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what I did to them with tariffs. Billions of dollars -- I mean, to a point where my farmers are in love with me because I took some of that money, gave it to them."

      "utterance": "Good evening, Bret. Much has changed in just two weeks when we hit market record highs. Today, we came close to another 1,000 point loss with all major averages and lower as markets remain incredibly volatile in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus. The Dow closing down over 900 points. The S&P down 105 with all sectors in the red. And the NASDAQ down 279 points, with many investors actually moving their money into safer bets like gold and government bonds. One sector getting hit hard is airlines. Today the International Airline Transportation Association predicts the impact of the coronavirus will cause a loss of $113 billion in revenue. This comes as airlines like United warm they will cut international flights by 20 percent and domestic flights by 10 percent by this April as they cope with weaker demand. And the cruise industry is also taking a beating. Bookings are down 40 percent with some crew socks tumbling 50 percent this year already. In fact, a new survey from Go Banking Rates shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans would turn down a completely free cruise if they were offered one because of the fears of the coronavirus. And companies across all sectors are coping with supply chain issues. Apple warned its retail employees they could face shortages of iPhones as well as replacement parts, as many are sourced in China. And Bret, I've been reporting actually from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange all week and traders have been telling me the swings might become the new norm, especially as the impact of the virus may take months to dissipate."

Jonathan, thank you. \"BREAKING TONIGHT\", a federal judge has denying a request by the Justice Department to dismiss a lawsuit seeking the public release of the full unredacted Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The action is being brought by the Electronic Privacy Center, Judge Reggie Walton, who was appointed by then-President George W. Bush, also a former FISA court judge. Also says, Attorney General William Barr's decision to conduct a press conference and issue a letter immediately prior to releasing the redacted version causes the court concern. He's also saying that Barr's lack of candor calls his credibility into question. We'll follow this story. Overseas, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, says violence from the Taliban is not acceptable. Pompeo, telling workers at the State Department today, he expected renewed conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan following Saturday's peace agreement. The U.S. stage the drone strike against the terror group this week, following an uptick in Taliban attacks against Afghan forces. Pompeo, says the violence must be reduced immediately for the peace process to move forward.

This comes after Turkey declared a previously guarded -- its previous and guarded gateways to Europe open. Thousands of refugees and other migrants have tried to cross into Greece from the Turkish land and sea border in the past week.

And that's shown in some of the polling where you see who their second choice might be. And I think you'll see that going forward who are all Warren's voters going to go for? And I think Sanders will definitely get some of them. But I think Biden will too. And so I don't see her voters as a definite vote for the liberal lane here as we're discussing it. But I think for Warren know, she had a lot of issues. It wasn't that she was a woman. I know a lot of people are, are saying that I think she had some issues with explaining how her various plans would work. I think she had a credibility issue, a likeability issue, and that's pretty much the reason why she didn't win."

We've seen from what happened with Joe Biden after he won South Carolina, how important momentum is and earned media. And boy this Bernie Sanders need earned media and momentum right now. And this could have in a moment to give him that. And the jolt in the arm that he needs heading into next week's primary. So, it hurts him substantially. And, you know, we've seen this incredible comeback from Joe Biden. I still think people haven't really dwelled on how profound a comeback. This was over two days after winning South Carolina from a guy who'd been completely written off to coming back. And the problem that Bernie Sanders has right now is the Super Tuesday results. Joe Biden wasn't even competing in those states. He had no ground operation. He spent no money. This was pure momentum and earned media and the light deciding voters, he crushed it with them. They all went to Biden. So, the momentum is everything right now and it's with Joe Biden. And boy did this Bernie Sanders need that Warren endorsement."
