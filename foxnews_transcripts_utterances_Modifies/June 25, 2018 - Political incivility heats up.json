You may have heard about it. It was a mean thing to do, but in a new era where mean girls rule, some mean girls think it's a plus. Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin wrote a piece on the lost art of shunning in which she feels for the restaurant owner. But, Jennifer, shunning is not a lost art, it was once used to ostracize people for religious reasons. It's extremism. But Jennifer hates Trump and everyone linked to him, so maybe extremism is warranted, right?  Meanwhile, Maxine Waters wants more than just shunning:",

Remember the last, you know, couple of years under the Obama administration, you had Antifa, you had racial riots, you had open borders, chaos. Even before you had occupy Wall Street. President Trump was elected to clean up that kind of mess. And the American people fundamentally are decent people. They want other people to be respected, and they're not going to tolerate kind rage-a-holics disrupting law-abiding Americans for having dinner. And I believe it starts with the left and the media's demonization of Republicans.  If you've spent a year and a half saying Donald Trump, and his cabinet, and the 60 million Americans who voted for him are Nazis, that is going to incite people to treat people like Nazis, and yell at them and harass them and put their lives in danger. And the Nazi comparison is lazy, historically inaccurate, and it means they've lost the argument. So, I believe this is happening because Trump is winning, not losing, and this is driving the left crazy. He's securing the borders and that is a threat to the left. They can't handle it. They're not acting like they're going to win in November. They're frantic and they're acting like they're desperate because this is all they have left. And if he succeeds and he is reelected, they have nothing. They have people like Peter Fonda, you have Maxine Waters, Kathy Griffin. They are literally melting down before our eyes. And there's no one in the Democratic Party that can control them. And it's just helping Donald Trump succeed. And his numbers are at record high right now.",

Yet, they fight for the cases for -- even like, say, gay rights to be able to have a wedding cake made or something of that nature. So, it's a real, you know, hypocrisy latent in there. But if they feel justified like with the Antifa and others, say we're fighting against evil, against something like the devil, then they say they're justified in doing it morally and ethically, so, therefore, anything goes. Like somebody like Maxine Waters calling for this or calling to put, you know, a child in a cage with pedophiles, making personal attacks against families, or increasing, sort of, the level of rhetoric and hate to say go after them personally. Can you imagine Sarah Sanders or her family going into a restaurant and you can tell somebody you can't eat there? I mean, this is so far -- like going back, you know, in time. This isn't moving forward in terms of civility of discourse, and disagreeing with somebody versus, you know, hating their guts and saying I could do anything to you, whether it's rhetoric or whether it's physical violence to justify my cause because of, you know, who you are and what you stand for.",

Remember the last, you know, couple of years under the Obama administration, you had Antifa, you had racial riots, you had open borders, chaos. Even before you had occupy Wall Street. President Trump was elected to clean up that kind of mess. And the American people fundamentally are decent people. They want other people to be respected, and they're not going to tolerate kind rage-a-holics disrupting law-abiding Americans for having dinner. And I believe it starts with the left and the media's demonization of Republicans. If you've spent a year and a half saying Donald Trump, and his cabinet, and the 60 million Americans who voted for him are Nazis, that is going to incite people to treat people like Nazis, and yell at them and harass them and put their lives in danger. And the Nazi comparison is lazy, historically inaccurate, and it means they've lost the argument. So, I believe this is happening because Trump is winning, not losing, and this is driving the left crazy. He's securing the borders and that is a threat to the left. They can't handle it. They're not acting like they're going to win in November. They're frantic and they're acting like they're desperate because this is all they have left. And if he succeeds and he is reelected, they have nothing. They have people like Peter Fonda, you have Maxine Waters, Kathy Griffin. They are literally melting down before our eyes. And there's no one in the Democratic Party that can control them. And it's just helping Donald Trump succeed. And his numbers are at record high right now."

It justifies the level of vitriol and, you know, the rhetoric that is just so, you know, repugnant to attack people or someone's family, to be able to say to someone you can't eat here at this restaurant. Yet, they fight for the cases for -- even like, say, gay rights to be able to have a wedding cake made or something of that nature. So, it's a real, you know, hypocrisy latent in there. But if they feel justified like with the Antifa and others, say we're fighting against evil, against something like the devil, then they say they're justified in doing it morally and ethically, so, therefore, anything goes. Like somebody like Maxine Waters calling for this or calling to put, you know, a child in a cage with pedophiles, making personal attacks against families, or increasing, sort of, the level of rhetoric and hate to say go after them personally. Can you imagine Sarah Sanders or her family going into a restaurant and you can tell somebody you can't eat there? I mean, this is so far -- like going back, you know, in time. This isn't moving forward in terms of civility of discourse, and disagreeing with somebody versus, you know, hating their guts and saying I could do anything to you, whether it's rhetoric or whether it's physical violence to justify my cause because of, you know, who you are and what you stand for."

Bush about not finding weapons of mass destruction and crude things about -- I don't remember this kind of acting out on either side.

I also think though that even though it is true that the previous administration had the separation policy as well, Jeh Johnson being very honest saying we can't have catch and release. That doesn't make sense. But I think that we have to explain that the White House should have explained all of this before. They didn't have a plan to do that.

Only 20 percent support the Democrats plan of catch and release. That's a CBS poll. And a majority of Americans, for the first time, believe that a wall should be built all along the southern border. So, the movement of the country is going in the president's direction because the country believes in the law, and the country believes in borders. We're a compassionate nation, but we're also fair.

So, we know that's not what it was about. It's not about illegal drugs, which comes from legal ports. I think this is an issue which fires up his base, in which he is deciding -- he said the Democrats like this issue. He said -- you know what? He likes this issue for the midterms. I would just point out to you, to me, the craziest thing that happened over the weekend was the president saying no more -- why do we need courts? Why do we need judges? Just throw them out.

At 41 percent, he's up about two percentage points from the average of his entire term. And Democrats generic ballot, well, their midterm edge has slit again.

In the beginning, it was chaotic with the tweets and a lot of the chaos in the personnel that the American people have now settled in and understand what this president is all about. There's going to be chaos. There's going to be ridiculous tweeting and commentary, but the economy is -- the engine of the economy is ripping right now. People see it in their paychecks. It's clear.

The job numbers are very supportive, more jobs available than there are people to fill them. And record low unemployment. I think you're going to see some fluctuation in the market. We've also seen tremendous, you know, highs. So in terms of just stabilizing it, I think over time, you know, you will see that. And what's interesting is just to see sort of some of the stability now coming in, in terms of the job approval ratings. And so as a president, he should feel happy that he's got these great numbers with the Trump -- more positive poll numbers, given the results. So, like, we talked about on the show and Greg said, they may not like sort of, like, the vessel, the delivery system, but he's offering a cure in terms of, you know, the economy and all the positive growth numbers that we've seen and what he's done with national security and ISIS and whatnot. So we'll have to see where it goes from here, but this is going into an important political time, which is the midterm elections. And that's why I think overall, when you're faced with these kind of good numbers and poll numbers, it's going to be very difficult for the Democrats, you know, to make a strong case for change coming into the midterm elections when things are most auspicious."
