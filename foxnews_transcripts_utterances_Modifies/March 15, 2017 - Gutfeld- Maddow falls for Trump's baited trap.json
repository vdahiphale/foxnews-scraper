Will you be revealing Steve Bannon's disturbing ankle tattoo? I hear it's a dolphin. So when America hears this news, what do you think they think? Outrage? Scandal? No, they think wow, Trump is rich, who knew? So how did Rachel fall for this? Trump set it up by fueling the intrigue. Remember when the Roadrunner would paint a tunnel entrance on a rock formation, so the Coyote would slam into it? Trump did that to Rachel. He baited the trap for months, pretending that somewhere lurked the Ark of the Covenant, and now MSNBC and Rachel off that stone wall. Trump wins again by the left simply losing their minds and their ethics and their dignity and their self-control. It was awesome.",
