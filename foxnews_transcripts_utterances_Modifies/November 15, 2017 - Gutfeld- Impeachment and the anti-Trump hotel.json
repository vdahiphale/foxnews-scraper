They need help. Here's a solution: A new anti-Trump hotel is opening in D.C. It's called Eaton Workshop. Sounds depressing, like a prison yoga class. The place is built around liberal activism and civic engagement. It's supposed to foster a culture of inclusion, of course without the right. How diverse. There will be fireside chats, lectures, organic mattresses and something called sound baths. I don't know, maybe a real bath might be better.   Look, I don't know if the world's first politically-motivated hotel is a good idea. I'd put bars on the windows on the higher floors, because I'd jump. Seriously, feeding more leftist identity politics to people already full of such division can't be good. Unless of course, you're not staying at that hotel but somewhere else, like here. Come on, even a lefty would take that over an organic mattress any day.",
