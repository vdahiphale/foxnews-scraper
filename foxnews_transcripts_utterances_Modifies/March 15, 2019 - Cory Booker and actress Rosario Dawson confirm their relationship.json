He went on to write that he always thought the stories of invasion were exaggerated but \"once I arrived in France, I found the stories not only to be true but profoundly understated.\" Then to avenge the attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims, the gunmen armed with two assault rifles and a shotgun drove to the Al-Nour mosque in Christchurch and livestreamed the 17 horrifying minutes of the attack beginning outside the mosque where he shot two men. When one of the men appeared to move, he shot him again. Then he moved into the prayer room where the worshippers were already cowering in separate corners and fired dozens of rounds into each group. One man appears to run at the gunman and his shot point-blank. The shooter then reloads several times then slowly methodically walks toward the wounded and repeatedly shoots them again.

He is an open borders kind of guy. He is ridiculous to have signed up to the green new deal so casually. But the real point is his character. When you look at the way he behaves, the way he campaigns, interviews, the way he just will say anything to please the person in front of him, that shows a fundamental weakness that I think is really dangerous when you're a president.

Yet, the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress, and the will of the American people.\" But, the new Attorney General William Barr, who was also at the signing ceremony in the Oval Office today defended the president's emergency declaration by saying this."

Today, the Washington Post reported on a new massive smuggling effort that's been speeding migrants to end across the southern border on buses. That's according to U.S. officials. And that's on top of the nearly 300 illegal immigrants arrested in a matter of hours after crossing the border in Texas earlier this week, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So, now the debate over this emergency declaration heads back to the house where they likely will not have enough votes to override the President's veto.

Great to see you, tonight. You and I, part of my town hall in Arizona seven months ago. I'm first going to ask you what it means for the morale.

But I'll continue to screaming it at the top of my lungs because the agents that I represent are asking for this. There's serious problems on our southern border. Our holding cells are at over capacity. It's a problem. These people are asking for asylum, they're being released within the United States. It's nonstop. The agents that we've hired is not enough because we've lost more than we -- within what we have hired. There's definitely a problem. These individuals that are voting against it, these individuals that are saying that there isn't a crisis, you know, I've issued it a long time ago. You have an open invitation, come down here. I'll show you myself, I'll give you a tour. I'll tell you how bad it is. Or put on that green uniform that our men and women are out here wearing every single day and they're being overrun.

A couple of weeks ago, there was agents from Tucson that were going down to El Paso, and we were going to in buses, loading up some of the individuals that have been turning themselves in El Paso, and we were driving him over to Tucson so we can process him here because they were at over capacity. And what that does, and this is what people need to understand. What that does is you're moving agents that are supposed to be protecting our borders having to do this transport so what's happening is it's weakening our southern borders. It is definitely an emergency. I don't understand how -- you know, we've been up here -- we're doing the job. We're out here and we've been trying to explain how difficult it is and what the problems are. And the president of the United States is listening.

He went on to write that he always thought the stories of invasion were exaggerated but \"once I arrived in France, I found the stories not only to be true but profoundly understated.\" Then to avenge the attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims, the gunmen armed with two assault rifles and a shotgun drove to the Al-Nour mosque in Christchurch and livestreamed the 17 horrifying minutes of the attack beginning outside the mosque where he shot two men. When one of the men appeared to move, he shot him again. Then he moved into the prayer room where the worshippers were already cowering in separate corners and fired dozens of rounds into each group. One man appears to run at the gunman and his shot point-blank. The shooter then reloads several times then slowly methodically walks toward the wounded and repeatedly shoots them again.

Then under the regulations, and these are regulations that have been in effect for 20 years and they go back to the Clinton years. Those regulations then call upon the attorney general to notify the Congress with an explanation of certain actions that he took.

I think it's much worse than that. I think he is actually one of the most dangerous candidates in the race. That's not because of his policy positions. Frankly, the position he just outlined on healthcare there is one that I agree with I think on other issues, for example, the border wall, his position is completely wrong. He is an open borders kind of guy. He is ridiculous to have signed up to the green new deal so casually. But the real point is his character. When you look at the way he behaves, the way he campaigns, interviews, the way he just will say anything to please the person in front of him, that shows a fundamental weakness that I think is really dangerous when you're a president. If you put him in the ring with Xi Jinping he will be knocked over. And I think that's why he is one of the more dangerous candidates in this race."

But importantly he is also running as civility, as discussion, as hearing people out and all of those things are popular with Democrats particularly with younger Democrats who are fed up with the way the dialogue goes. Now, whether or not he is adequately liberal to meet the demands of party activists I don't know."

You have a Biden and a Sanders who are literally between the two of them soaking up 51 percent or so of the vote. What happens to all those other candidates? Amy Klobuchar, for instance, senator from Minnesota was talking today about being tough. So, she is trying to define herself. Let's watch."

If, you know, they felt that something was unfair or they felt bad about something, but I still think that you have to demand good product when you are out there on the world stage and dealing with people like Vladimir Putin, yes, you want someone who is tough. You want someone that demands the answers and that's going to get things done. And that's what I've done my whole life."

But there it's something that Chris brought up I think is very interesting that both Amy Klobuchar has Joe Biden has and Beto has is they have this sort of reasonability sort of things to then I think really resonates with the American voter. So, if we look at the Fox News voter now since from the last election on the midterm elections we saw that single college educated white women voted two for one for their Democratic Party. In order for the Democratic party to win in 2020 they have to keep those same numbers and having somebody who is reasonable is going to work with those voters which I think all three of these candidates were talking about. Both Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Beto has. Which I think is sort of some good news for the Democratic base as we go into this prime hotly contested primary season."

I think that it sounds like sour grapes when you come back around and he says well, Trump ought to be primaried and I guess I would say to Jeb Bush well then either you do it or not. Larry Hogan is out there. Larry Hogan is testing the waters. And it might even there is an argument to be made, it might be even good for Trump to have a primary challenge to be in the news so that everybody is not talking about the Democrats the whole time. But whatever the case, Jeb Bush is at the very least an imperfect vessel for a message such as that."

And now police are taking a hard look at whether we might be looking at an internal war for control of the Gambino crime family. Remember John Gotti, the Teflon don was once the Gambino family boss. But in 1992 his right-hand man Sammy the Bull Gravano testified against Gotti and sent him to prison for life. John Gotti died of cancer in prison in 2002. But his 72-year-old brother Gene Gotti just got out of prison in September. Gene's top associate John Carneglia got out of prison in August and that's important because Carneglia was reputedly the one who fatally shot then Gambino boss Paul Castellano outside of Spark's steak house in Manhattan back in 1985. And investigators say there are real similarities between the killing this week of Frank Cali in front of his home on Staten Island and the killing 34 years ago of Castellano outside of Sparks restaurant. Some believe this is good old fashioned American versus civilian power struggle that could lead to all-out war. And experts say crime families are not reemerging because they never went away. Watch."
