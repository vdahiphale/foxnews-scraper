Now, tonight on this program, we will offer up solutions and we will explain why this is needed now more than ever. And more importantly, we will continue to hold Washington accountable. And that is tonight's important \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, President Trump is pushing for sweeping tax cuts and major tax reform. Why? To unleash the American economy and provide relief to the American people. Why? Because millions of Americans desperately need the health and the growth of the economy.  Now, the president sat down with a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House earlier today, and here's what he said.",

Now, the president also wrote on Twitter earlier today, \"The approval process for the biggest tax cut and tax reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast, Congress.\" And he added, \"With Irma and Harvey devastation, tax cuts and tax reform is needed more than ever before. Go, Congress, go.\"   Now, President Trump is right. The time for tax reform is right now. We did not do this since 1986! And tonight, the president dined with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Here's what's happening. Look, the president is reaching across the aisle to try and get things done because, let's face it, Republican leadership in Congress -- they have failed miserably and at every turn. Now, Republican failure -- they've broken promises. They have now left the president with no other option if he's going to keep his promises to the American people. They have proven themselves to be incompetent, ineffective. And the president -- frankly, I don't blame him -- he's done waiting and he's forging ahead with or without Mitch McConnell. We'll have more on him in just a second.  But first, let's look at some of these statistics on how massive and how burdensome this tax system in this country has now become. Now, according to Republican members on the House Ways and Means Committee, the current federal tax code -- look at this, over 70,000 pages! Who could ever comprehend that?   Now, put that in perspective for you -- back in 1913, when the income tax was introduced, it was only 400 pages long. Now, the Tax Foundation also has an estimate that Americans spent 8.9 billion hours in tax preparation last year! And that translates to over $400 billion in lost productivity. Now, the president understands this all has to change, because unlike the vast majority of politicians in the swamp and the sewer and the so-called policy wonks in D.C., well, the president -- he's actually run a business. And here's what the president has been calling for. Pay close attention.  He wants bold tax cuts and tax reforms. He wants an emphasis on benefiting the middle class, including middle class tax cuts. He wants seven brackets to go to three brackets to make it easy and simple. He wants that 15 percent corporate tax rate. Why? Because that makes American businesses more competitive on the global stage. And of course, he's been talking about allowing multi-national corporations -- what? To repatriate trillions of dollars that they have sitting overseas at a low rate. And that way, they can invest in American workers and build factories and manufacturing centers right here in Michigan, in Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania.  And of course, he's also pushing energy independence. Why? Because there are literally millions of high-paying career jobs available. And the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin -- he's saying the administration wants to make these tax cuts retroactive. Wow! People start spending money.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz -- who will join us in just a minute -- he's also offering up his own tax reform plan. Now, here's the senator explaining today what you, the American people, need and why you need tax reform. Take a look.",

Government doubled the revenues that they had in eight years, 20 million new jobs were created.  And by the way, Here are the highlights of what Senator Cruz is proposing. This makes perfect sense, and it's simple and it's easy and it's basic and it's fundamental. A low flat tax rate, tax returns that can be filed on a postcard, immediate expensing for businesses, a low corporate tax rate, repatriation, ending the death tax, getting rid of the alternative minimum tax. Now, President Trump and Senator Cruz's philosophy on tax reform is simple. They want to get the government off your back and let you keep more of your hard-earned money in your wallet, spend it the way you want.   And as we've been seeing, President Trump is working nonstop. He wants to get his major agenda items passed with members of Congress, meeting with them day and night and by taking his message on the road and speaking directly to the American people. Now it's time for Congress. I cannot believe they have no urgency. Get your job done! And I'm specifically talking about, you, Senator Mitch McConnell and the never-Trumpers out there like, let's see, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake -- oh, Ben Sasse. We'll add him to the list.  You know what? It's now or never. And by the way, no more excuses as to why you can't keep your promises. Oh, it's so hard! Well, for seven-and- a-half years, you promised to repeal, replace ObamaCare, and you couldn't get it done.

This is pathetic! It's inexcusable! It's unacceptable! Why did we elect you? Now, it's time for an ultimatum. Senator McConnell, other Republicans, if you don't get the urgency to work for the American people, if you don't pass tax reform by the end of this year, you need to resign, go home, play golf, and get out of the way and let's get people in those positions that can serve the American people.  I'm tired of the complacency and business as usual. You know what? It's not been working. Congress is now failing the American people -- 50 million Americans in poverty, 50 million on food stamps, 90-plus million out of the labor force, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. Really?  This is why, Congress, you have an approval rating that hovers around 15 wonderful percent. It's why Mitch McConnell has a dismal 18 percent approval rating in his own home state of Kentucky! Now, instead of whining and complaining and pointing fingers about why you can't pass legislation, you people in Washington and Congress, time to roll up your sleeves, get in a room -- I'll send you pizza and beer -- and turn off the air conditioner, like our framers and founders, and get to work and don't leave the room until you build consensus to help people.  You know what? It's not like these issues or ideas are new. Just like with ObamaCare. What have you been doing? You've been promising and promising and running and elect us and elect us. The American people -- you've been doing this for years! And you know what? You said you're going to do this. You said you'll cut taxes. You said you'll pass reform. You said you'll repeal and replace. Where is your sense of urgency? Every American I know has a sense of urgency on their job. Where's your accountability?

      "sentences": "Well, and let me emphasize a couple of points from the tax speech I gave today. Number one, the president said today he wants a big, big tax cut. There's some Republicans in Congress that are talking about making tax reform revenue-neutral. Revenue-neutral means they're not cutting taxes. They're just moving money around from one bucket to another. We don't need revenue-neutral. We need a big tax cut on you, on families who are struggling, on small businesses. We need a Reaganesque tax cut that unleashes incredible growth. And I laid out today how we do it. We do that under the budget rules by having a 30-year budget window, which means we can have a big tax cut that isn't revenue-neutral that lasts for 30 years and unleashes booming growth.  Let me make a second point, which is something I called for today, which is total expensing, immediate expensing of capital expenditures. What that does, if you're a farmer, it lets you buy a new tractor. If you're a steel worker, it lets the company invest in a new steel factory. If you're a truck driver, it lets you buy a new truck. We care about jobs here in America, Main Street jobs, manufacturing jobs, union jobs, blue-collar jobs. Immediate expensing unleashes incredible growth. I think that's a very important part of tax cuts and tax reforms that we're pushing forward.",

      "utterance": "Now, notice, but for DACA, the president was echoing everything he promised you in the campaign. Now, the president also wrote on Twitter earlier today, \"The approval process for the biggest tax cut and tax reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast, Congress.\" And he added, \"With Irma and Harvey devastation, tax cuts and tax reform is needed more than ever before. Go, Congress, go.\" Now, President Trump is right. The time for tax reform is right now. We did not do this since 1986! And tonight, the president dined with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Here's what's happening. Look, the president is reaching across the aisle to try and get things done because, let's face it, Republican leadership in Congress -- they have failed miserably and at every turn. Now, Republican failure -- they've broken promises. They have now left the president with no other option if he's going to keep his promises to the American people. They have proven themselves to be incompetent, ineffective. And the president -- frankly, I don't blame him -- he's done waiting and he's forging ahead with or without Mitch McConnell. We'll have more on him in just a second. But first, let's look at some of these statistics on how massive and how burdensome this tax system in this country has now become. Now, according to Republican members on the House Ways and Means Committee, the current federal tax code -- look at this, over 70,000 pages! Who could ever comprehend that? Now, put that in perspective for you -- back in 1913, when the income tax was introduced, it was only 400 pages long. Now, the Tax Foundation also has an estimate that Americans spent 8.9 billion hours in tax preparation last year! And that translates to over $400 billion in lost productivity. Now, the president understands this all has to change, because unlike the vast majority of politicians in the swamp and the sewer and the so-called policy wonks in D.C., well, the president -- he's actually run a business. And here's what the president has been calling for. Pay close attention. He wants bold tax cuts and tax reforms. He wants an emphasis on benefiting the middle class, including middle class tax cuts. He wants seven brackets to go to three brackets to make it easy and simple. He wants that 15 percent corporate tax rate. Why? Because that makes American businesses more competitive on the global stage. And of course, he's been talking about allowing multi-national corporations -- what? To repatriate trillions of dollars that they have sitting overseas at a low rate. And that way, they can invest in American workers and build factories and manufacturing centers right here in Michigan, in Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania. And of course, he's also pushing energy independence. Why? Because there are literally millions of high-paying career jobs available. And the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin -- he's saying the administration wants to make these tax cuts retroactive. Wow! People start spending money. Texas Senator Ted Cruz -- who will join us in just a minute -- he's also offering up his own tax reform plan. Now, here's the senator explaining today what you, the American people, need and why you need tax reform. Take a look."
    },

      "speaker": "SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TEXAS",

      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Ronald Reagan was elected on a promise of tax cuts, of tax reforms. We saw historic tax reform in '81 and '86. And by the fourth year of Reagan's presidency, 1984, we went from stagnant economic growth, less than one percent a year, to 7.2 percent a year -- massive, booming growth lifting millions out of poverty, increasing significantly median incomes!"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Senator Cruz is right. In the Reagan years, Reagan went from 70 to 28 percent top marginal tax rates in this country. OK, how did it result? Government doubled the revenues that they had in eight years, 20 million new jobs were created. And by the way, Here are the highlights of what Senator Cruz is proposing. This makes perfect sense, and it's simple and it's easy and it's basic and it's fundamental. A low flat tax rate, tax returns that can be filed on a postcard, immediate expensing for businesses, a low corporate tax rate, repatriation, ending the death tax, getting rid of the alternative minimum tax. Now, President Trump and Senator Cruz's philosophy on tax reform is simple. They want to get the government off your back and let you keep more of your hard-earned money in your wallet, spend it the way you want. And as we've been seeing, President Trump is working nonstop. He wants to get his major agenda items passed with members of Congress, meeting with them day and night and by taking his message on the road and speaking directly to the American people. Now it's time for Congress. I cannot believe they have no urgency. Get your job done! And I'm specifically talking about, you, Senator Mitch McConnell and the never-Trumpers out there like, let's see, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake -- oh, Ben Sasse. We'll add him to the list. You know what? It's now or never. And by the way, no more excuses as to why you can't keep your promises. Oh, it's so hard! Well, for seven-and- a-half years, you promised to repeal, replace ObamaCare, and you couldn't get it done. No more blaming the president like Mitch McConnell did last month, and he said the president had excessive expectations, and well, he doesn't understand the parliamentary procedures and the difficulties of legislation because he's never done this before. Take a look."

This is pathetic! It's inexcusable! It's unacceptable! Why did we elect you? Now, it's time for an ultimatum. Senator McConnell, other Republicans, if you don't get the urgency to work for the American people, if you don't pass tax reform by the end of this year, you need to resign, go home, play golf, and get out of the way and let's get people in those positions that can serve the American people. I'm tired of the complacency and business as usual. You know what? It's not been working. Congress is now failing the American people -- 50 million Americans in poverty, 50 million on food stamps, 90-plus million out of the labor force, lowest home ownership rate in 51 years. Really? This is why, Congress, you have an approval rating that hovers around 15 wonderful percent. It's why Mitch McConnell has a dismal 18 percent approval rating in his own home state of Kentucky! Now, instead of whining and complaining and pointing fingers about why you can't pass legislation, you people in Washington and Congress, time to roll up your sleeves, get in a room -- I'll send you pizza and beer -- and turn off the air conditioner, like our framers and founders, and get to work and don't leave the room until you build consensus to help people. You know what? It's not like these issues or ideas are new. Just like with ObamaCare. What have you been doing? You've been promising and promising and running and elect us and elect us. The American people -- you've been doing this for years! And you know what? You said you're going to do this. You said you'll cut taxes. You said you'll pass reform. You said you'll repeal and replace. Where is your sense of urgency? Every American I know has a sense of urgency on their job. Where's your accountability? Now, the president can't do everything on his own. You need to hold up your end of the bargain. You need to accomplish something for once! Here with reaction, Texas senator Ted Cruz. Senator, are my expectations out of whack?"

They've given us a Republican president, Republican heads of every agency and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. We don't have any more excuses. We need to get the job done. And the big four that we promised the American people is repeal the train wreck that is \"Obama care.\" We've got to get that done. Major tax cuts, major tax reform -- we got to get that done. Regulatory reform, getting Washington off the backs of small businesses and job creators. And confirming constitutionalists to the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal courts.

I've told Mitch McConnell, I've told other senators we need to keep at it until we honor that promise, and critically, we lower premiums and give people more choices, more options, put you in charge of your health care. On tax reform, we've got to do it. And what the president just said that you aired earlier on the show, simple and fair. Put it on a postcard.

And you got money flowing in to Washington. You guys will have more money than you ever dreamed of. And Newt Gingrich told me he thinks it's about a 50 percent shot we get that done.

    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Well, and let me emphasize a couple of points from the tax speech I gave today. Number one, the president said today he wants a big, big tax cut. There's some Republicans in Congress that are talking about making tax reform revenue-neutral. Revenue-neutral means they're not cutting taxes. They're just moving money around from one bucket to another. We don't need revenue-neutral. We need a big tax cut on you, on families who are struggling, on small businesses. We need a Reaganesque tax cut that unleashes incredible growth. And I laid out today how we do it. We do that under the budget rules by having a 30-year budget window, which means we can have a big tax cut that isn't revenue-neutral that lasts for 30 years and unleashes booming growth. Let me make a second point, which is something I called for today, which is total expensing, immediate expensing of capital expenditures. What that does, if you're a farmer, it lets you buy a new tractor. If you're a steel worker, it lets the company invest in a new steel factory. If you're a truck driver, it lets you buy a new truck. We care about jobs here in America, Main Street jobs, manufacturing jobs, union jobs, blue-collar jobs. Immediate expensing unleashes incredible growth. I think that's a very important part of tax cuts and tax reforms that we're pushing forward."

You watch this decay of the leftist media over the last eight to 10 years as they continue to spout their bigotry and to be so intolerant. And it's left a really good place for conservative media, and conservative media is continuing to fill those voids. I like to say that every time the left spouts their mantra, another conservative gets their wings. And I really believe this is no exception to that."

And the left isn't really tolerant. I've seen horrible things about you and Dr. Loudon, myself on social media and by these groups that are funded seemingly from Soros type of people."

So I'm not somebody that calls for boycott or calls for firings either, and I would never do that. I have been very vocal about that. But I will say this, kind of what Dr. Gina was talking about there, the Trump voter is a sports watcher and we're folks that enjoy watching ESPN, love watching the commentary. And I wouldn't call for a boycott, I wouldn't call for a firing, but I would just say to ESPN, your numbers are not going to lie, because we're going to start turning off the TV. And that's how we're going to voice our opinion, that's how we're going to use our freedom of expression, our freedom of speech. So watch you. You might be losing a big chunk of your audience, and we're not going to feel bad for you when you do."

And I don't like it when it comes from the left or the right. On Colin Kaepernick, he has the free-speech right to protest, to take a knee, which I personally think is a very reverential thing to do obviously when you listen to the National Anthem. People have the right to like it, to not like it. His employers, a private entity, have the right to hire him or not. And maybe this is the free market talking, but I will defend his right to take that knee until my last breath."

When we come back, Daily Caller has a huge, explosive report about Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Shultz's former I.T. aide. They are reporting he tried to hide a secret server. This gets bigger every day. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett, they're next."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity.\" Luke Rosiak is an investigative reporter with The Daily Caller. There's an explosive report out today about Debbie Wasserman Shultz and her former I.T. staffer. Rosiak reports that, quote, \"Exclusive DWS I.T. guy was banned from House after trying to hide the secret server.\" Luke goes onto explain in the article, quote, \"Now indicted former Congressional I.T. aide Imran Awan alleged routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server.\" Fox News has not been able to independently verify this, but if that is true, that is beyond damning. Here with reaction, Fox News anchor, attorney, Gregg Jarrett, Circa News, Sara Carter. Gregg, if that's true, to me that means one thing, that there's a chance other countries could have been fed this information, that the security concerns we had may be real."

      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. He was downloading huge quantities of sensitive documents to a secret server. And that puts a lie to what Democrats including Debbie Wasserman Shultz have been claiming all along that there were no security breaches. Clearly there were. It also suggests to me that this is a guy who probably is planning to flip, to implicate Democrats who were either wittingly or unwittingly complicit in his criminal activities. Why do I think that? Because his wife who is safely ensconced in Pakistan has now reportedly decided to turn herself in to American authorities. She wouldn't do that unless an immunity deal was in the works to implicate people like Debbie Wasserman Shultz. Now, did Russians actually hack our system? A senior investigative official said, does it mean that this guy sold the information to the Russians? I don't know. So, Sean, they're clearly looking at whether a Democratic insider is the one who gave the information to the Russians, not hacking at all."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to believe something is coming because not only did Imran leave her laptop sitting there in that small room at the Rayburn office building, but he left a letter for the U.S. attorney. He left copies of his identification sitting all around. Luke was very detailed in this story on how this happened. And just like Gregg said, Sean, these are huge national security implications. Imran Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, they moved data apparently, if this story is true, from protected servers of members of the House Intelligence Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, to an offsite server that was connected to the House Democratic Caucus. And that could have been established right there. They could have put it within the server that's connected to the House Democratic Caucus, created a backdoor where they could infiltrate that system wherever they wanted. And not only that, he created a Dropbox account where he put everything into this Dropbox account where he could access it after February 2nd when he was removed. And all of his trips to Pakistan for months at a time and having armored escort in Pakistan has to raise the suspicion that possibly Imran and his wife Hina Alvi are connected to Pakistani intelligence."
