This will give them the ability to shoot down helicopters and small aircraft. But moving forward, the things they will need most has to do with airpower. They want to control the air above them.

The other thing to focus is the capital of Kyiv and this convoy that according to satellite images is nearly 40 miles long, artillery units, tanks, Russian soldiers. And it has been stalled for the past 48 hours. And officials believe that has to do with logistics. So, this will be really the focus in the coming days, whether or not these troops continue their advance toward the Ukrainian capital. And if they do, their real understanding here is they will try to encircle the city. So, I think that's going to be the thing that people focus on in the coming days. Is this convoy moving? And if they are not moving, why is that? And it could be for two major reasons. They are regrouping and preparing to launch that assault on the city, or they could be having logistics problems in the forms of food, fuel, and supplies.",

But the president needs to explain what he means when he says the Russians will make gains on the battlefield. You know what that really means? It means cluster bombs are going off in a hotel. That's what that means. And he has to spell it out for the American people. You're going to get to a point in a week or three weeks where they are going to have the capital surrounded, and they are going to starve people out. It is going to be a humanitarian catastrophe. And because everybody has an iPhone, we're all going to be able to see it. We're going to be able to see war crimes, atrocities fed out on television and on our phones on real time. There is going to be a ton of pressure on the president and this administration, and on the Europeans to do more than they're doing. I understand you don't want to put troops on the ground, but are we going to sit back and watch as people's limbs are getting blown off, as they circle the city and shell it?

We should definitely should send more weapons. The second part is you got to hope that there is intent and unprecedented pressure in Russia to upend Putin. It appears that some of the oligarchs and others are asking and encourage -- and urging this. So, you think about the frame, you've nailed it.

Are they squeezing the country in a way that some in Ukraine may think could cause Putin to back off or at some point for the Russian people and maybe replace him?",

Their families told they died doing their international duty. They would not tell them how their sons were killed. And I think a very similar thing could be happening today. You heard those casualty figures I just gave out. About 500 Russian soldiers have been killed and it has even been a week since the invasion and this war started. So -- and U.S. intelligence thinks that number is four times higher. So, when these bodies go back to Moscow, even if the government is not saying how they died, people will know and people will take to the streets, and there could be a lot more pressure on Vladimir Putin.",

The other thing to focus is the capital of Kyiv and this convoy that according to satellite images is nearly 40 miles long, artillery units, tanks, Russian soldiers. And it has been stalled for the past 48 hours. And officials believe that has to do with logistics. So, this will be really the focus in the coming days, whether or not these troops continue their advance toward the Ukrainian capital. And if they do, their real understanding here is they will try to encircle the city. So, I think that's going to be the thing that people focus on in the coming days. Is this convoy moving? And if they are not moving, why is that? And it could be for two major reasons. They are regrouping and preparing to launch that assault on the city, or they could be having logistics problems in the forms of food, fuel, and supplies."

But the president needs to explain what he means when he says the Russians will make gains on the battlefield. You know what that really means? It means cluster bombs are going off in a hotel. That's what that means. And he has to spell it out for the American people. You're going to get to a point in a week or three weeks where they are going to have the capital surrounded, and they are going to starve people out. It is going to be a humanitarian catastrophe. And because everybody has an iPhone, we're all going to be able to see it. We're going to be able to see war crimes, atrocities fed out on television and on our phones on real time. There is going to be a ton of pressure on the president and this administration, and on the Europeans to do more than they're doing. I understand you don't want to put troops on the ground, but are we going to sit back and watch as people's limbs are getting blown off, as they circle the city and shell it?

I mean, the president said no-fly zone as well. And if the Ukrainians want us to enforce a no-fly zone, which General Keane and others believe would engage us there in a way we don't want to be engages. Two, do you send them more weapons. We should definitely should send more weapons. The second part is you got to hope that there is intent and unprecedented pressure in Russia to upend Putin.

What do we do over the next several days if they continue to pound these cities, continue to kill civilians? And when we see the pictures of women and moms, young moms and their young kids being killed, how will that make us feel? And I think we don't know yet."

And already today, we heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken announce these new sanctions targeting the Russian defense economy sector, 22 entities. And I think you will see more of that.

We hear there is intense pressure growing pressure within Russia on Putin. The oligarchs we see stories oligarch after oligarch we've read that the owner of the Chelsea soccer team has sold and might even be donating some of that to Ukraine. What is your sense of how the internal pressure on Putin, or the stories, the reporting correct in that regard that he's under more and more pressure?"

And in the coming days, you will see more pressure on the regime in Moscow. But you have to remember at this point, it's not just the SWIFT banking system or the economic sanctions against the inter-circle around Putin. It's things like the World Cup, it's things like Apple Pay, it's thing like the ability to engage with the international community. It is currently affecting the Russian population across the board. And so, as that happens, President Putin will continue to receive more internal pressure. And whether or not that changes his behavior is still up in the air.

Thing that you can see with your own eyes.

There's a -- there is a part of you that has to ask, well, is there a way for Putin to save face if he overestimated what he could do and he underestimated Ukraine, and he underestimated the world reaction. How do you allow a status seeking culture? Russia is a status seeking culture. They are very -- it's all about their place in the world. And the world of persuasion -- mockery is great. But mocking them, calling them war criminal, all these things, I don't think that's going to persuade anybody. However, finding a way as the off-ramp, the ability, the potential to save face, is one way to avoid further bloodshed. And that is something that we should be interested in more than anything.

But that's not what's going to solve this. The fundamental question is what's being debated here at the table and pounded at the table. I'd listened to Tony Blinken today who make clear, to your point, this is Putin's war, not the Russians. We don't have a gripe with the Russian people. We have a gripe with Putin. And that internal pressure that Trey touched on and we've all touched on, it seems to be building in Russia. Let's hope it gives him, you know, he sees that he's going to make his -- make life so miserable for his own people. Two, you're right. The off-ramp, I think is something that question -- the answer the question about the war criminal question -- I think that may have something to do with how they are thinking about not giving him an off-ramp, but figuring out how we get out of this.

And then in order to save the capital, you bring him down, you sit him down and you say we'll do a cease-fire. Something. Something. But you have to ratchet up sanctions before that.

The one thing I wish they had done more was to rush weapons, advance more weapons into Ukraine sooner. But their reasons for that is -- if they did that, they thought that Putin might use that as a way to say the West using it to Russians at the -- we're battling the West, and we have to fight the West. We need to not move so fast off of fossil fuels here in this country. I'm a believer. I don't know how many more times I can say it. Restart the Keystone Pipeline.

This jackass didn't do a thing when cops were being killed, when businesses were being burned. He hid in his basement. And only when it became politically expedient, when he was worried about losing an election -- and now when an election is coming up, all of a sudden he's backing the blue. Because he felt it was better at the time, right, to embrace the woke orthodoxy that put BLM above law enforcement. That's what he did. So, I'm sorry. When I see, you know, CNN recently purchased conservatives, you know, those principle few supporting -- oh, isn't this great? Look at him, such a good thing. You're an idiot, because this guy was nowhere to be found. Lastly, the thing that gets me bad -- that gets me crazy -- because I know a lot of people are pissed off about these two Republicans that heckled, that's nothing compared to this cause play that you see, the stand-up and applause, the sit-down. No matter how stupid Biden said something, people have to applaud. This is Kabuki applause line theater, right? And we are expected as idiot Americans to go, oh, wow everything coming out of his mouth is somehow majestic and moral and meaningful. Of course, not. And by the way, both sides do this, right?

And, you know, the intellectual part of me says, you have to applaud that because we have to recognize, at least when he says that -- he doesn't -- he doesn't mean that, he doesn't believe it. He's a Trojan horse. We've got to recognize that this is who we are as Americans. We're a law and order society. Every -- everything that came out of his mouth I thought last night -- and we -- there were some polls that showed that even the independents were skeptical, not just the Republicans, but the independents were skeptical. And, you know, when he talks about, you know, funding the police, and all of a sudden he's on the side of truth and justice, I mean, it's nonsense. Everybody knows it's nonsense. He came to New York, and oh he's going to stop the flow of guns. How are you going to stop the flow of guns if criminals keep getting out and getting guns? It's not about anything new.

I think the bigger thing to look at is actually the pressure internally. Recalled back in Afghanistan, 15,000 Russian troops are killed. And when those bodies came back, they were unmarked coffins. Their families told they died doing their international duty. They would not tell them how their sons were killed. And I think a very similar thing could be happening today. You heard those casualty figures I just gave out. About 500 Russian soldiers have been killed and it has even been a week since the invasion and this war started. So -- and U.S. intelligence thinks that number is four times higher. So, when these bodies go back to Moscow, even if the government is not saying how they died, people will know and people will take to the streets, and there could be a lot more pressure on Vladimir Putin."
