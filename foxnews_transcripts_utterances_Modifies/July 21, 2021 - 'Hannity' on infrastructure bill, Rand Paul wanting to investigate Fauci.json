      "sentences": "All right, Tucker, and thank you. And welcome to HANNITY. Tonight, we have a lot on deck. The Biden administration, they're trying to sneak and not millions and billions, but trillions of dollars in Green New Deal socialism spending under the guise, they are calling it human infrastructure. Not bridges, roads, tunnels, human infrastructure. Plus, another damning development from zero experience Hunter and the Biden family syndicate as the walls are now closing in on the family. And the Texas Democrats, you know, the ones that left their state of Texas to block a vote, while ironically protesting the filibuster -- and they're filibustering, going to Washington, urging Democrats to filibuster. Well, they're also now spreading COVID-19 all over Washington, D.C., after their maskless flight on a private jet to our nation's capital. We'll break down the multiple layers of hypocrisy. That's coming up. But first tonight, he is the left-wing New Green Deal socialist, most cherished public figure, longtime government doctor who is often wrong, but never in doubt. Anthony flip-flop Fauci is once again back in the news after Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also a medical doctor, confronted Fauci about his deceptive testimony surrounding what we've discussed a lot. It's called gain of function research and Wuhan Institute of Virology. In other words, the origins of COVID-19. As a reminder, the definition of gain of function, that research often involves manipulating viruses to make them more dangerous, more infectious. Now, Fauci's NIH defines itself. This is their definition: research projects that can be reasonably anticipated to enhance transmissibility via the respiratory route in mammals. The practice is so risky that it was temporarily by the U.S. government from 2014 to `17. However, this kind of highly dangerous research apparently continued at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This as Fauci's NIH sent millions of your U.S. taxpayer dollars to this Wuhan lab, funneled to a nonprofit that's called Eco-Health Alliance. Now, put simply, Fauci's NIH may have played a role in developing the deadly COVID-19 virus. That would be something we need to get to the bottom of. Because now, according to multiple outlets, including \"The Wall Street Journal,\" a Wuhan lab leak is the most likely cause of the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. But today, when asked about this very real possibility, Dr. Anthony Fauci became more indignant, more defensive than ever. Even called senator and Dr. Rand Paul, said he doesn't know what he's talking about. But I think it was him that didn't know what he was talking about. You decide.",

And why is Fauci still serving in the White House? Forget about the gain of function research claims for a moment. Dr. Fauci's sloppy guidance during the pandemic has been all over the map. He has flipped. He has flopped. He has failed the entire time. March 8, 2020, he is trashing China's draconian lockdown. But on March 13th, he promoted a 14-day national lockdown in the U.S. to slow the spread, which turned into several months to slow the spread. Then on January 28th, 2020, Fauci downplayed the asymptomatic spread of the virus. But in August of the same year, he blamed asymptomatic cases for community outbreaks. Last year, he referred to Trump rallies as troublesome, super-spreader events. He had not a word to say about last summer's protests and riots. Nothing. On masks, well, first, Fauci laughed at the idea on \"60 Minutes\", told us not to wear any masks. They don't work. And then he demanded we all wear one mask indoors and also a mask outdoors, and two masks. Then, no mask outdoors. And now we may be wearing masks in perpetuity. We can go on, and on, and on, and on.

Here with more, Kentucky senator and also a medical doctor, Rand Paul. Senator, thanks for being with us. Appreciate it. I want to go to the heart of this. You read gain of function, what the NIH definition is. And you know, you take an animal virus. You increase transmissibility to humans. And that's gain of function. He denied that's gain of function.

The NIH funded the lab. But once the public figures out that they were doing very, very dangerous research there, gain of function research, taking dangerous animal viruses and making them more transmissible to humans, once everybody puts this together, he realizes where the blame is going to attach. He has at least tangential responsibility. If this came from the lab that he was funding, my goodness, can you imagine the moral culpability that the man has? But you also have to place this in context. Since 2012, he has said repeatedly that yes, an accident can happen but the research is worth it, even if an accident were to cause a worldwide pandemic, the research is worth it. That judgment call is something that most Americans or people who have family members, the 4 million people who died would say, you know what? Maybe that research isn't worth it if this contagion actually came out of a lab where they are doing this research. They also do this research in the United States. They do it in Galveston and in North Carolina. So this is a big debate, not just over blame, but over whether or not this could happen again in the United States.",

But in that email, he was told it looked like a specific genome had been manipulated in a lab. What are the emails tell you? Then there was the back and forth. They seemed very nervous to me.

His assistant responds, oh my goodness, this is gain of function research. It's like, oh, no, they've discovered that this is going on. We might have funded the origin of this virus. So, immediately they're circling the wagon. They're having urgent meetings. Meet with me immediately, he says to his assistant. Read this paper, which is a gain of function paper. He was alarmed. But then to his boss, he's putting on a different front and he's saying, everything's okay, it looks like there's no chance it came from the lab. Meanwhile, a virologist is sending him an email saying, four of us agree this looks like a virus that was manipulated in a lab. So, yes, from the very beginning, I think he was covering up because he realized that there would be a great deal of culpability, of blame attached to him if a lab that he was funding through the NIH turned out to be the source of a pandemic that caused 4 million people to die.

And many, not all, but many Democrats are perfectly happy having a voting month. Now, I don't care what your opinion is about the results of the last election. No fair-minded person can deny that it was anything other than a goat rodeo. I mean, we had ballots flying around like confetti. They sent out, various states sent out 44 million ballots unsolicited. We had the poll watchers being interfered with. We had ballot harvesting out the wazoo. We had state executive branch officials unilaterally changing the voting laws without conferring with the legislature and their state, which the Constitutions says has the final say. Some of this, I understand, might have been necessary. We had to make some changes to accommodate the coronavirus and people's public safety. But I'm going to say it again. No fair-minded person can point to the -- process-wise, to the last election and say it was a model of efficiency. So, that's what most of these bills are doing.

But what does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi do? She rewards him by placing this 30-something no-name California congressman on the House Intel Committee, which only has access to, you know, the country's most sensitive, classified info, excuse me. So, now, he's used thousands of dollars of campaign funds on limos and booze deliveries and high-end restaurants, which I last checked had nothing to do with actual campaigning. So, you think, OK, that will get him removed from House Intel. But, of course, that's not going to happen because the media isn't covering the story. They are providing cover. You look at the home page, Sean, of \"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS. They haven't touched the story. It's \"Silence of the Lambs.\" because why would you want to insult one of your most active anonymous and dubious sources? I'll leave you with this stat. In Donald Trump's first year in office, Eric Swalwell went on national television 282 times in one year.

The Biden administration, they're trying to sneak and not millions and billions, but trillions of dollars in Green New Deal socialism spending under the guise, they are calling it human infrastructure. Not bridges, roads, tunnels, human infrastructure. Plus, another damning development from zero experience Hunter and the Biden family syndicate as the walls are now closing in on the family. And the Texas Democrats, you know, the ones that left their state of Texas to block a vote, while ironically protesting the filibuster -- and they're filibustering, going to Washington, urging Democrats to filibuster. Well, they're also now spreading COVID-19 all over Washington, D.C., after their maskless flight on a private jet to our nation's capital. We'll break down the multiple layers of hypocrisy. That's coming up. But first tonight, he is the left-wing New Green Deal socialist, most cherished public figure, longtime government doctor who is often wrong, but never in doubt. Anthony flip-flop Fauci is once again back in the news after Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is also a medical doctor, confronted Fauci about his deceptive testimony surrounding what we've discussed a lot. It's called gain of function research and Wuhan Institute of Virology. In other words, the origins of COVID-19. As a reminder, the definition of gain of function, that research often involves manipulating viruses to make them more dangerous, more infectious."

This as Fauci's NIH sent millions of your U.S. taxpayer dollars to this Wuhan lab, funneled to a nonprofit that's called Eco-Health Alliance. Now, put simply, Fauci's NIH may have played a role in developing the deadly COVID-19 virus. That would be something we need to get to the bottom of. Because now, according to multiple outlets, including \"The Wall Street Journal,\" a Wuhan lab leak is the most likely cause of the pandemic that has killed millions worldwide. But today, when asked about this very real possibility, Dr. Anthony Fauci became more indignant, more defensive than ever.

Why on Earth was Anthony Fauci's NIH sending any money whatsoever to any virology lab in China? Who in their right mind would ever think that's a good idea? And why is Fauci still serving in the White House? Forget about the gain of function research claims for a moment. Dr. Fauci's sloppy guidance during the pandemic has been all over the map. He has flipped. He has flopped. He has failed the entire time. March 8, 2020, he is trashing China's draconian lockdown. But on March 13th, he promoted a 14-day national lockdown in the U.S. to slow the spread, which turned into several months to slow the spread. Then on January 28th, 2020, Fauci downplayed the asymptomatic spread of the virus. But in August of the same year, he blamed asymptomatic cases for community outbreaks. Last year, he referred to Trump rallies as troublesome, super-spreader events. He had not a word to say about last summer's protests and riots. Nothing. On masks, well, first, Fauci laughed at the idea on \"60 Minutes\", told us not to wear any masks. They don't work. And then he demanded we all wear one mask indoors and also a mask outdoors, and two masks. Then, no mask outdoors. And now we may be wearing masks in perpetuity. We can go on, and on, and on, and on. Now here are a few more examples. Take a look."

In the United States, people should not be walking around with masks. Well, if one mask is good, and makes common sense that maybe two masks are better. If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, it's very, very strongly leaning towards this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated."

His models, his projections were a disaster and his NIH was spending millions of dollars to Wuhan Institute of Virology before the pandemic. So why on earth is Dr. Fauci even still employed? And where are the investigations into his potential malfeasance? And what about those emails that now tell us a lot more about what he knew as early as January 31st of 2020? He was told that it looked like a specific genome might have been manipulated in an email. And then the frantic emails that went back and forth about, do you think there is any chance we funded this? Here with more, Kentucky senator and also a medical doctor, Rand Paul. Senator, thanks for being with us. Appreciate it. I want to go to the heart of this. You read gain of function, what the NIH definition is. And you know, you take an animal virus. You increase transmissibility to humans. And that's gain of function. He denied that's gain of function. But that's what his own NIH defines as gain of function. Help me out with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "I think the reasoning behind him being so resistant, so livid, and so full of ad hominem is he realizes that once the public realizes that the NIH under his leadership funded the Wuhan lab, that is beyond question they did. The NIH funded the lab. But once the public figures out that they were doing very, very dangerous research there, gain of function research, taking dangerous animal viruses and making them more transmissible to humans, once everybody puts this together, he realizes where the blame is going to attach. He has at least tangential responsibility. If this came from the lab that he was funding, my goodness, can you imagine the moral culpability that the man has? But you also have to place this in context. Since 2012, he has said repeatedly that yes, an accident can happen but the research is worth it, even if an accident were to cause a worldwide pandemic, the research is worth it. That judgment call is something that most Americans or people who have family members, the 4 million people who died would say, you know what? Maybe that research isn't worth it if this contagion actually came out of a lab where they are doing this research. They also do this research in the United States. They do it in Galveston and in North Carolina. So this is a big debate, not just over blame, but over whether or not this could happen again in the United States."

      "utterance": "You have had a chance as I have to read the emails that were released from Dr. Fauci. He was told as early as January 31st, the day that President Trump put in his hysterical xenophobic and racist travel ban that was brilliant 10 days after the first identified case here. But in that email, he was told it looked like a specific genome had been manipulated in a lab. What are the emails tell you? Then there was the back and forth. They seemed very nervous to me. Read like a very nervous Dr. Fauci worried about possible monies from the NIH funding this. He actually talked -- discussing this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Realized that these emails are frantic, going back and forth. At 2:00 in the morning, he is still sending emails out. The first email he sends to his assistant is one of these research papers with Dr. Shi from the Wuhan Institute that is gain of function. His assistant responds, oh my goodness, this is gain of function research. It's like, oh, no, they've discovered that this is going on. We might have funded the origin of this virus. So, immediately they're circling the wagon. They're having urgent meetings. Meet with me immediately, he says to his assistant. Read this paper, which is a gain of function paper. He was alarmed. But then to his boss, he's putting on a different front and he's saying, everything's okay, it looks like there's no chance it came from the lab. Meanwhile, a virologist is sending him an email saying, four of us agree this looks like a virus that was manipulated in a lab. So, yes, from the very beginning, I think he was covering up because he realized that there would be a great deal of culpability, of blame attached to him if a lab that he was funding through the NIH turned out to be the source of a pandemic that caused 4 million people to die. That could be the worst governmental decision in history of the world."

He's doing this because he has a self interest to cover his tracks and to cover his connection to Wuhan lab. Now does he deserve all the blame? No, there's still some conjecture as to whether or not it came from the lab. But he's lying about whether or not he funded gain of function research, and yes, he should be punished."

You have what's called T cell antibodies that would recognize if you were once again in the future exposed to coronavirus, even one of the variants. My question to you is, if we're following the science, it looks like you were right, because I think you'd agree with me, the Cleveland Clinic is a pretty well-respected medical institution. The Cleveland Clinic did their own study and they decided and they came to the conclusion that if you have natural antibodies like you do, that you wouldn't need any vaccine. I didn't hear anybody saying, wow, Dr. Paul was right."

So yes, the vaccine works. But so does a natural infection. And here's the thing about the crazy left-wing trying to deny natural immunity. Vaccines are based on natural immunity. We learned how to do vaccines once we learned that the body actually had an immune response that prevented infection in the future. And yes, we have memory cells, both T and B cells. They have looked in bone marrow. It's long lasting. For some diseases like the Spanish flu from 1918, there were people that were alive until recently that they still measured immune responses in their blood 90 years later."

Isn't that very different than what the American people were told, that if you get the vaccine, you will be safe, you don't have to worry? You know, if there's any vaccine hesitancy, didn't it really come from Joe Biden, fully vaccinated, socially distant, outside walking with a mask on, going into Jimmy Carter's house, an older person, taking off the masks, and taking pictures up close and personal. Didn't -- you know, what message does this all sending here?"

If you're under 25, the risk of COVID is about one in a million, less than the risk of being struck by lightning.

I agree with Senator Paul that yes, it shouldn't be so black and white. They have to start acknowledging natural immunity. They should also start considering single dose vaccines in younger healthier people. But at the end of the day, this should be a discussion between the patient and the doctor. That should have nothing to do with the government and mainstream media."

For me, it was a very calculated decision that I thought was right for me, smart for me. But if somebody decides not to take the vaccine, they are no threat to me because I've had the vaccine. So my point is, I encourage people to take it if it's something that you feel like would help you and protect you. For heaven's sakes, do it. But it doesn't make me less a conservative. Nor does it make me more compassionate. Nor does it make me smarter, just because I've made a medical decision. Some people get a root canal. Other people just pull their tooth.

Yes, you may still have some breakthrough cases with some mild symptoms. But hey, it didn't bother anybody with the flu shot. These are still so much better than the flu shot.

Watch the back seat. See that. Okay. That's a 15-year-old who has been arrested after 18 was shot dead while sitting in the back of a car. Look at this video posted on the Internet. Shot in cold blood. It is believed to be an active gang violence. That's not all. Over the weekend, a man who has twice been arrested for attacking New York police officers smashed a bottle over a cop's head in an unprovoked assault. These are the deadly predictable consequences of defund, dismantle the police agenda, no bail laws and the consequences of not enforcing law and order, and the consequences of demonizing the police. Here with reaction and an update is the host of \"Unfiltered\", Saturdays, right here on the FOX News Channel. Along with his new special, \"Canceled in the USA\" on FoxNation.com, Dan Bongino. All right, I don't know if there is much left to say, but this is -- this is predictable. Sad.

The people who did this to you knew this was going to happen. Sean, here's just like -- a couple of headlines from \"The Washington Post\". There's a whole story right here. D.C. council passes budget slashing $15 million for police. Here's another headline now, from now. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser directs Metro PD to use any overtime necessary in response to recent gun violence. Do you think these people are stupid? They did this to you. When are you going to wake up? They did this to you. Your neighborhoods are turning into hell holes because they did it. And do you know why? You know what really ticks me off? Because these people are weak. And you know what discussed me? Weakness. I hate weak people. I can't stand weakness. These politicians were weak because they didn't have the cojones to stand up to these radical leftist lunatics like the AOC members and the squad and say, you know what? I'm not going to cut funding for my police because people are going to die. They didn't have the guts because they are weak. They are pathetic losers and that's why people are dead, because of them.

The dumbest idea in all of Washington would be to grant amnesty in an infrastructure bill without first securing the border. You would have an invasion beyond what you have today. If we legalized 100,000 people or a million people in the infrastructure bill, there would be a run on our borders because everybody would get the message that they're legalizing people in America. Let's go and let's go now. You have to secure the border before you grant one person legal status. If you don't, you will lose control of America, of our sovereignty."

But if they put amnesty in that bill, I would try to deny them a quorum to pass that bill. It's a 50/50 Senate. And the vice president doesn't count toward a quorum. So, a lot of people have pushed back to me. To my Republican colleagues, what are we going to do if they load off the $3.5 trillion, really $5 trillion infrastructure bill with mail-in voting and with amnesty? What is our response? If you don't like my idea, come up with one of your own. If we don't fight back as hard as we can, they're destroying the Senate as I speak. They're going to lead to an illegal immigrant invasion like we've never seen in the history of the country. So, my idea is do anything and everything possible to stop this before it happens. Let the Democrats know that if you pass -- if you put legalizing illegal immigrants in the reconciliation bill, then we as Republicans will use everything available to us, including denying you a quorum."

And get this - - we are also learning tonight, more individuals who interacted with Texas Democrats who tested positive for COVID have now themselves tested positive, including a staffer for Speaker Pelosi. That might explain the Sunday preplanned health exam of Kamala Harris. She's scheduled it on a Sunday. Everyone goes to Walter Reed on Sunday to get a regular routine exam. Anyway, despite these developments, circle back Jen Psaki still won't call it a super-spreader event. Now, I wonder if she would have a different view if this was Texas Republicans. Oh, by the way they are now saying they're not going to tell anybody if anybody else tests positive. Here with reaction, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.

They fit in just fine here in Washington, D.C., because in Washington, D.C., if it weren't for double standards, there wouldn't be any standards at all. This place, as you know, is a lot like high school, except no one ever graduates. In terms of what they're complaining about, the Texas voting rights bill, I've read the bill. I've read the statute. I've read the proposed bill. I've read the underlying statutes. It doesn't suppress anybody's vote. It allows for a very generous early voting, very generous absentee voting. Yes, it does require voter ID. It does require the people of Texas to prove they are who they say they are when they go to vote. The American people support that. The American people want that. And I say gently to my Democratic friends from Texas, if you don't, if you don't see the need for that, then there are one or two close circumstances here. Either you're so dumb, you lose your place during sex, or you want to cheat. And those are your two choices."

      "speaker": "KENNEDY",
      "utterance": "Here's what I think a lot of this is about, because I've read all of these proposals. One of the reasons that the last presidential election was so controversial is because we had a voting month instead of what we are used to, a voting day. And if you peel off the layers here, you'll see that most, not all, but most Republicans want to go back to having a voting day. And many, not all, but many Democrats are perfectly happy having a voting month. Now, I don't care what your opinion is about the results of the last election. No fair-minded person can deny that it was anything other than a goat rodeo. I mean, we had ballots flying around like confetti. They sent out, various states sent out 44 million ballots unsolicited. We had the poll watchers being interfered with. We had ballot harvesting out the wazoo. We had state executive branch officials unilaterally changing the voting laws without conferring with the legislature and their state, which the Constitutions says has the final say. Some of this, I understand, might have been necessary. We had to make some changes to accommodate the coronavirus and people's public safety. But I'm going to say it again. No fair-minded person can point to the -- process-wise, to the last election and say it was a model of efficiency. So, that's what most of these bills are doing. They're trying to move us back to an election day, not an election month. And they do have voter ID. But they also have generous early voting, and generous absentee balloting. And I just don't get their complaints."

Again, Joe repeatedly said he has never talked about his son's foreign business dealings. Joe, do you stand by that? Because if you do, you are standing by what we now know is a huge provable lie. But of course, Hunter isn't the only Democrat with questionable dealings. As far as left-wing radicalist Eric Swalwell apparently spent tens of thousands of campaign dollars on booze, limo services as well as a 20 grand bill at the Ritz-Carlton where his wife works, according to FEC records reviewed by FOX News.

And during pillow talk, if the person next to you says, hey, by the way, please, call me Fang Fang, it's time to go back to Tinder and find another girlfriend, because that's probably a situation you don't want to be in. But what does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi do? She rewards him by placing this 30-something no-name California congressman on the House Intel Committee, which only has access to, you know, the country's most sensitive, classified info, excuse me. So, now, he's used thousands of dollars of campaign funds on limos and booze deliveries and high-end restaurants, which I last checked had nothing to do with actual campaigning. So, you think, OK, that will get him removed from House Intel. But, of course, that's not going to happen because the media isn't covering the story. They are providing cover. You look at the home page, Sean, of \"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS. They haven't touched the story. It's \"Silence of the Lambs.\" because why would you want to insult one of your most active anonymous and dubious sources? I'll leave you with this stat. In Donald Trump's first year in office, Eric Swalwell went on national television 282 times in one year.
