The president is in excellent health with the liberal mainstream media is not, absolutely melting down about the president's great medical test results. It's unconscionable. Wait until you see this video tonight.  Plus, everything we have been reporting on here that the media has been ignoring, it is now unfolding. The phony Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda dossier, that is being exposed. There is an indictment -- did anyone else report this? -- in the Uranium One scandal.  And brand-new tonight, a key witness in the exoneration before investigation of corrupt Hillary Clinton and the email server scandal will be grilled by congressional lawmakers. It's all coming to pass, as I have told you, and a bombshell report from Sara Carter about Fusion GPS continuing to investigate to this day President Trump.  It is it is all in tonight opening news breaking monologue.",

The corrupt, Trump-hating news media, they are dusting off the tinfoil hats, fueling up their black helicopters and are running absolutely wild with baseless conspiracy theories about President Trump and his great health report. We're going to cover the out-of-control media and the bias. We do it regularly on the program, but this is now insane. This is a new level.  So, Dr. Ronny Jackson, he briefed the media on the results of the president's extensive medical exams. What did he find? A president in excellent health.   Dr. Jackson is also saying of the president, that he did so well on a cognitive test, and he has normal, perfect, neurological functions. No early onset Alzheimer's or dementia. Now, of course, this does not fit the media and their preconceived fake news narrative that President Trump is crazy, suffering from dementia, early onset, and is mentally unfit to serve, which means in their twisted minds, he needs to be thrown out of office. For 49 long minutes, the media breathlessly, hysterically asking the president's doctor about his mental fitness. They couldn't believe the answers they were getting. He asked for the cognitive test. It's one of the best tests out there and he passed it perfectly, 30 out of 30. This is something they have been obsessing over. You're going to enjoy this. Watch.",

We actually went back and checked to see if the media ever ask anything close to those questions about Barack Obama's health or any other president for that matter and the answer, of course, they did not. Now, after that frenzied display, members of the media should have their owned heads examined. I said this before. Hating Trump is their heroin. It's their drug. And they are completely hooked on their drugs. They're like addicts. The only thing that gives them a fix is attacking the president minute-by-minute. And the media is so completely utterly unhinged and deranged, and today's press conference is just their latest episode. Ever since President Trump announced his candidacy, the blind sheep in the liberal media, who live in their own bubble, and bounce their own recycled talking points and their own little echo chamber, they have been rushing to create a new crisis after a new crisis after a new crisis, and their recent hyperventilation has reached extreme levels. Even for their pathetically low standards, by the way.   It's one crisis, one panic, one total meltdown after another where they repeat the exact same words, meaning, NBC, ABC, CBS, \"New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" they use the same commentary until something better can be blown out of proportion comes along.  And for the last couple of weeks, the media's schizophrenia has been on full display. It's gone from a year of saying President Trump colluded with Russians, there is no evidence. President Trump is going to start a nuclear war. They are not mad that it was in fact Bill Clinton that gave North Korea billions and promised, it's going to be a good deal for the American people. The media being BFFs with Steve Bannon, you know, they were friends for at least three days because he made comments that they like for once, in the giddiness over Bannon's comments of Michael Wolff's phony book. Now, this is the narrative that now, it's Trump's crazy. We should invoke the 25th Amendment, we will use that to throw him out of office. Russia didn't work.  Take a look at this insane coverage that you are getting, and I tell you, media is dead. I told you in 2007. I was more right than I ever dreamed. Take a look.  JOY-ANN REID, MSNBC, SEPT. 3. 2007: We start with this week in Russia gate.  NICOLE WALLACE, \"TODAY\"/NBC, JULY 6, 2017: This cloud about collusion with Russia will hang over him no matter where he stands.  DAN RATHER, MSNBC, AUG. 30, 2017: Donald Trump is afraid a political hurricane is out there at sea for him. We will call it hurricane Vladimir, if you will, the whole Russian thing. JAKE TAPPER, CNN, JULY 11, 2017: This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE, MSNBC, JULY 11, 2017: There is outright treason. I mean, there is no question that what he is doing is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. DANA BASH, CNN, JAN. 3: If the idea of a nuclear showdown with North Korea keeps you up at night, I would recommend deleting your Twitter app. JOHN AVLON, CNN, JAN. 3: This is language that would have been rejected from the script of \"Dr. Strangelove\". We can't begin to normalize this. This is dangerous, this is childish, this is unpresidential. It's not befitting the leader of the free world. ANAND GIRIDHARADAS, MSNBC, JAN. 2: Perhaps never have we seen a man whose profound sexual and masculine insecurities are literally threatening to annihilate the planet.",

TAPPER, JAN. 2: None of this normal, none of this acceptable, none of this frankly stable behavior. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"NEWS HOUR\"/PBS, JAN. 3: We turn out of the public riff that broke out today between President Trump and his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.

No, he's really, really demented, and in the next liberal says no, really, really, really demented. And they are talking to themselves. You get how they needed their own examination? There is a reason the American people don't watch a lot of these fake news networks. Now, after moving on from his manufactured crisis, one after another, the media's new drug of choice is the alleged comments that President Trump made in a heated oval office debate about immigration. Fake news CNN loses it. They need some help. They need some psychiatric help. And according to the Media Research Center, the network literally said on air blank ssh-hole, I'm not allowed to see it.

      "sentences": "What sshole fake news network. Now, I wonder if the CEO, soon-to-be scandal plagued Jeff Zucker, and the stenographer Humpty Dumpty are really proud of that coverage. It's pretty pathetic. Maybe I need to do a public service, may be a need to send CNN over a case of Xanax, if I can get it legally. Since the media, led by the highly esteemed doctors Joe Scarborough and his soon-to-be bride, Dr. Mika Brzezinski, since they love to diagnose the president even though they have zero medical qualifications, all right, let me play the same game. I'll step into their echo chamber for a minute and I'll play their game.  Here's Dr. Hannity's prescription tonight. All of you on the fake news network, you desperately, trust me, need psychiatric help. You are all out of touch with reality and suffering from delusional groupthink about the president. And if, for some reason, you overpaid lazy so-called journalists can't pay for it, I'll help you because I'm probably paid more and I will offer assistance. And also tonight, everything that we have been telling you, let's get serious for a minute, is now starting to play out. This is the serious side. They don't talk about forgotten men and women. By the way, this isn't about me being right or the show being right, even though we are clearly the team that we have assembled here, the only ones in the media talking about it, it's about what's right for the country. It's about our Constitution. This is what is serious about it. What's right for the rule of law, equal justice under the law. We have been uncovering, and peeling the layers of that onion. The Clinton bought and paid for fake news Russian propaganda dossier, it's now being exposed and there are so much more to come. We are learning the dossier was used by the Obama administration to literally spy and get that FISA warrant on members of the Trump campaign and a present-elect. This is serious. They have weaponized America's most powerful tools of intelligence to go after an opposition party in an election year and then, of course, a president-elect. We have a massive development tonight in the Clinton email server scandal. \"Washington Examiner\" reporting that the chief of staff and senior counsel to the FBI director, Christopher Wray, is in fact will be grilled by House lawmakers about the corrupt Clinton email investigation. Oh, I thought that was dead. And that's huge because Rybicki the one that will be grilled was one of three people that James Comey sent his original statement that exonerated Clinton, oh, before they investigated, and 17 other witnesses and Hillary Clinton had not been interviewed for. How do you write an exoneration before investigating? Yes, this is serious. The same statement where Comey and his minions changed the word twice from the legal standard gross negligence, which would mean Hillary Clinton broke the law, and actually put in there that foreign entities got a hold of this, and then they changed it to extreme carelessness and they used as a justification, all of this to let Clinton walk free. We know she committed felonies. That is serious if we have equal justice under the law.  And then a Comey his little minions also alter the original conclusion. It was reasonably likely that Clinton's server stored in the bathroom of a mom-and-pop shop closet was hacked by hostile actors, top secret classified special access program information, all hacked. Yet, the fixes and before they investigated now we are learning more and more about how top officials at the FBI covered up evidence that Hillary Clinton committed crimes and put our national security, your national security at risk? And just like with everything else, we have been telling you that the media ignores, it is only the start of much bigger things that will be coming. I promise you. This will rival the worst scandal by far in American history. It's that severe. And there is other breaking news tonight. Sara Carter reporting that Fusion GPS, you know, the firm that Clinton bought and paid for, the fake news Russian dossier that was used to get the FISA warrant to dig up dirt on President Trump, candidate Trump, well, what is unclear is who was paying for it. We know Hillary Clinton, the DNC, she controlled, shelled out $12 million to fund Fusion GPS to pay for those Russian lies. They wanted to influence the election. After all, they store stole the primary from poor Bernie and his supporters. And sources are telling me tonight that if the information is about the dossier, if it's related to the public, here's what I was told -- it will shock the conscience of law-abiding Americans in the entire country. That is how serious it is, as the media makes fools of themselves every night. We are hoping that you, the American people, that you will get to see everything because I am told when you do, it will blow you away. The real Russian scandal will finally be exposed. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett. Sara, let's start with you and your new report tonight. This thing is still going on?",

Secretary Kiersten Nielsen as you mentioned held firm and saying last Thursday she did not hear the President utter that expletive. Winning Democrats Cory Booker charge her silence and Amnesia made her and his words complicit in the president's comments. Now Nielsen clearly try to pivot and change the narrative and send a signal to the President's base that he is all about not words, but action, he is saying he is taking actions to crackdown on illegal immigration. The secretary announcing the administration is talking to federal prosecutors about launching criminal charges against local officials in sanctuary cities that refuse to follow through on federal orders to deport criminals. Also new today, the Department of Justice revealed is going to try to go directly to the Supreme Court to fast-track its appeal of a federal Judge's ruling that new DACA applications can start up. Republican Lindsey Graham meanwhile charged all that as a dramatic turn from one week ago today, when the President gathered both parties in the cabinet room and wanted a deal to take care of the DACA kids with love and while also tightening border security. Graham charged last Thursday morning around 10:00 a.m. He and Democrats Senator Dick Durbin called over the president to read him out on a bipartisan deal they are putting together, but by the time they made it to the oval office around noon, someone on the White House staff, senior adviser Steven Miller and someone else, had convinced the President to turn against the deal.

For example check out this graph, it shows the negative coverage of President Trump and his administration and what he received on the network in a newscast throughout the year. It consistently hovers around 90 percent negative versus 10 percent positive. Neutral coverage was excluded, and that surprisingly those saying network TV news cast dedicated in the same amount of coverage to the fake news Trump-Russia collusion, In fact according to the MRC, they spent over 1200 minutes talking about it. Far exceeding the coverage that they gave to any the story which of course were also anti-Trump. The media research center also gave us an exclusive sneak peek of part two of the report where they analyze six Trump accomplishments to the network newscasts had virtually ignored. The president's actions on deregulating expediting pipe line projects and promoting religious freedom and confirmation of conservative judges.

Wait until you see this video tonight. Plus, everything we have been reporting on here that the media has been ignoring, it is now unfolding. The phony Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda dossier, that is being exposed. There is an indictment -- did anyone else report this? -- in the Uranium One scandal. And brand-new tonight, a key witness in the exoneration before investigation of corrupt Hillary Clinton and the email server scandal will be grilled by congressional lawmakers. It's all coming to pass, as I have told you, and a bombshell report from Sara Carter about Fusion GPS continuing to investigate to this day President Trump.

The corrupt, Trump-hating news media, they are dusting off the tinfoil hats, fueling up their black helicopters and are running absolutely wild with baseless conspiracy theories about President Trump and his great health report. We're going to cover the out-of-control media and the bias. We do it regularly on the program, but this is now insane. This is a new level. So, Dr. Ronny Jackson, he briefed the media on the results of the president's extensive medical exams. What did he find? A president in excellent health. Dr. Jackson is also saying of the president, that he did so well on a cognitive test, and he has normal, perfect, neurological functions. No early onset Alzheimer's or dementia. Now, of course, this does not fit the media and their preconceived fake news narrative that President Trump is crazy, suffering from dementia, early onset, and is mentally unfit to serve, which means in their twisted minds, he needs to be thrown out of office. For 49 long minutes, the media breathlessly, hysterically asking the president's doctor about his mental fitness. They couldn't believe the answers they were getting. He asked for the cognitive test. It's one of the best tests out there and he passed it perfectly, 30 out of 30. This is something they have been obsessing over. You're going to enjoy this. Watch."

We actually went back and checked to see if the media ever ask anything close to those questions about Barack Obama's health or any other president for that matter and the answer, of course, they did not. Now, after that frenzied display, members of the media should have their owned heads examined. I said this before. Hating Trump is their heroin. It's their drug. And they are completely hooked on their drugs. They're like addicts. The only thing that gives them a fix is attacking the president minute-by-minute. And the media is so completely utterly unhinged and deranged, and today's press conference is just their latest episode. Ever since President Trump announced his candidacy, the blind sheep in the liberal media, who live in their own bubble, and bounce their own recycled talking points and their own little echo chamber, they have been rushing to create a new crisis after a new crisis after a new crisis, and their recent hyperventilation has reached extreme levels. Even for their pathetically low standards, by the way. It's one crisis, one panic, one total meltdown after another where they repeat the exact same words, meaning, NBC, ABC, CBS, \"New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" they use the same commentary until something better can be blown out of proportion comes along. And for the last couple of weeks, the media's schizophrenia has been on full display. It's gone from a year of saying President Trump colluded with Russians, there is no evidence. President Trump is going to start a nuclear war. They are not mad that it was in fact Bill Clinton that gave North Korea billions and promised, it's going to be a good deal for the American people. The media being BFFs with Steve Bannon, you know, they were friends for at least three days because he made comments that they like for once, in the giddiness over Bannon's comments of Michael Wolff's phony book. Now, this is the narrative that now, it's Trump's crazy. We should invoke the 25th Amendment, we will use that to throw him out of office. Russia didn't work. Take a look at this insane coverage that you are getting, and I tell you, media is dead. I told you in 2007. I was more right than I ever dreamed. Take a look. JOY-ANN REID, MSNBC, SEPT. 3. 2007: We start with this week in Russia gate. NICOLE WALLACE, \"TODAY\"/NBC, JULY 6, 2017: This cloud about collusion with Russia will hang over him no matter where he stands. DAN RATHER, MSNBC, AUG. 30, 2017: Donald Trump is afraid a political hurricane is out there at sea for him. We will call it hurricane Vladimir, if you will, the whole Russian thing. JAKE TAPPER, CNN, JULY 11, 2017: This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, MSNBC, JULY 11, 2017: There is outright treason. I mean, there is no question that what he is doing is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. DANA BASH, CNN, JAN. 3: If the idea of a nuclear showdown with North Korea keeps you up at night, I would recommend deleting your Twitter app. JOHN AVLON, CNN, JAN. 3: This is language that would have been rejected from the script of \"Dr. Strangelove\". We can't begin to normalize this. This is dangerous, this is childish, this is unpresidential. It's not befitting the leader of the free world. ANAND GIRIDHARADAS, MSNBC, JAN. 2: Perhaps never have we seen a man whose profound sexual and masculine insecurities are literally threatening to annihilate the planet."

TAPPER, JAN. 2: None of this normal, none of this acceptable, none of this frankly stable behavior. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"NEWS HOUR\"/PBS, JAN. 3: We turn out of the public riff that broke out today between President Trump and his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon.

No, he's really, really demented, and in the next liberal says no, really, really, really demented. And they are talking to themselves. You get how they needed their own examination? There is a reason the American people don't watch a lot of these fake news networks. Now, after moving on from his manufactured crisis, one after another, the media's new drug of choice is the alleged comments that President Trump made in a heated oval office debate about immigration. Fake news CNN loses it. They need some help. They need some psychiatric help. And according to the Media Research Center, the network literally said on air blank ssh-hole, I'm not allowed to see it.

It's pretty pathetic. Maybe I need to do a public service, may be a need to send CNN over a case of Xanax, if I can get it legally. Since the media, led by the highly esteemed doctors Joe Scarborough and his soon-to-be bride, Dr. Mika Brzezinski, since they love to diagnose the president even though they have zero medical qualifications, all right, let me play the same game. I'll step into their echo chamber for a minute and I'll play their game. Here's Dr. Hannity's prescription tonight. All of you on the fake news network, you desperately, trust me, need psychiatric help. You are all out of touch with reality and suffering from delusional groupthink about the president. And if, for some reason, you overpaid lazy so-called journalists can't pay for it, I'll help you because I'm probably paid more and I will offer assistance. And also tonight, everything that we have been telling you, let's get serious for a minute, is now starting to play out. This is the serious side. They don't talk about forgotten men and women. By the way, this isn't about me being right or the show being right, even though we are clearly the team that we have assembled here, the only ones in the media talking about it, it's about what's right for the country. It's about our Constitution. This is what is serious about it. What's right for the rule of law, equal justice under the law. We have been uncovering, and peeling the layers of that onion. The Clinton bought and paid for fake news Russian propaganda dossier, it's now being exposed and there are so much more to come. We are learning the dossier was used by the Obama administration to literally spy and get that FISA warrant on members of the Trump campaign and a present-elect. This is serious. They have weaponized America's most powerful tools of intelligence to go after an opposition party in an election year and then, of course, a president-elect. We have a massive development tonight in the Clinton email server scandal. \"Washington Examiner\" reporting that the chief of staff and senior counsel to the FBI director, Christopher Wray, is in fact will be grilled by House lawmakers about the corrupt Clinton email investigation. Oh, I thought that was dead. And that's huge because Rybicki the one that will be grilled was one of three people that James Comey sent his original statement that exonerated Clinton, oh, before they investigated, and 17 other witnesses and Hillary Clinton had not been interviewed for. How do you write an exoneration before investigating? Yes, this is serious. The same statement where Comey and his minions changed the word twice from the legal standard gross negligence, which would mean Hillary Clinton broke the law, and actually put in there that foreign entities got a hold of this, and then they changed it to extreme carelessness and they used as a justification, all of this to let Clinton walk free. We know she committed felonies. That is serious if we have equal justice under the law. And then a Comey his little minions also alter the original conclusion. It was reasonably likely that Clinton's server stored in the bathroom of a mom-and-pop shop closet was hacked by hostile actors, top secret classified special access program information, all hacked. Yet, the fixes and before they investigated now we are learning more and more about how top officials at the FBI covered up evidence that Hillary Clinton committed crimes and put our national security, your national security at risk? And just like with everything else, we have been telling you that the media ignores, it is only the start of much bigger things that will be coming. I promise you. This will rival the worst scandal by far in American history. It's that severe. And there is other breaking news tonight. Sara Carter reporting that Fusion GPS, you know, the firm that Clinton bought and paid for, the fake news Russian dossier that was used to get the FISA warrant to dig up dirt on President Trump, candidate Trump, well, what is unclear is who was paying for it. We know Hillary Clinton, the DNC, she controlled, shelled out $12 million to fund Fusion GPS to pay for those Russian lies. They wanted to influence the election. After all, they store stole the primary from poor Bernie and his supporters. And sources are telling me tonight that if the information is about the dossier, if it's related to the public, here's what I was told -- it will shock the conscience of law-abiding Americans in the entire country. That is how serious it is, as the media makes fools of themselves every night. We are hoping that you, the American people, that you will get to see everything because I am told when you do, it will blow you away. The real Russian scandal will finally be exposed. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett. Sara, let's start with you and your new report tonight. This thing is still going on?"

Next in line as James Rybicki, we learned that today. He will be questioned. After that, Lisa Page, inevitably, Peter Strzok.

Which is unsubstantiated, which is salacious, the majority of which is unverified, did they know? And if they didn't know, shouldn't they have known? And what parts of those dossier were used to get that warrant? These are huge questions, Sean, because all of that led to spying on Trump and his campaign and those are real stories with real connections that the media should be investigating and I think that's what is so disappointing."

And then we find out the phony Russian paid for dossier that they wanted to use to manipulate the American people before an election to steal the general, they stole the primary, if that was used to get a warrant on Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton's team, and opposition candidate, and then a president-elect Hillary -- thank god we don't have to say that.

You had a better candidate who was far more competent and worked much harder despite having one-seventh the amount of money who blew the other party out of the water. They need an excuse.

Look, there's a battle that is brewing about this, but the hearing you mentioned, it was supposed to be contentious, because it was going to be all about President Trump's plan for a wall on the southern border, but instead it blew up over what the President said or didn't say last Thursday at the contentious meeting here at the White House over immigration. Secretary Kiersten Nielsen as you mentioned held firm and saying last Thursday she did not hear the President utter that expletive. Winning Democrats Cory Booker charge her silence and Amnesia made her and his words complicit in the president's comments. Now Nielsen clearly try to pivot and change the narrative and send a signal to the President's base that he is all about not words, but action, he is saying he is taking actions to crackdown on illegal immigration. The secretary announcing the administration is talking to federal prosecutors about launching criminal charges against local officials in sanctuary cities that refuse to follow through on federal orders to deport criminals. Also new today, the Department of Justice revealed is going to try to go directly to the Supreme Court to fast-track its appeal of a federal Judge's ruling that new DACA applications can start up. Republican Lindsey Graham meanwhile charged all that as a dramatic turn from one week ago today, when the President gathered both parties in the cabinet room and wanted a deal to take care of the DACA kids with love and while also tightening border security. Graham charged last Thursday morning around 10:00 a.m. He and Democrats Senator Dick Durbin called over the president to read him out on a bipartisan deal they are putting together, but by the time they made it to the oval office around noon, someone on the White House staff, senior adviser Steven Miller and someone else, had convinced the President to turn against the deal. Graham today lashed about that."

They declared Graham, quote, tried to sabotage the framework. Nobody knew what was in the damn plan the person said. The President was frustrated and hit Graham with questions and Lindsey had no answers. The president shut him down. So the bottom line is it got contentious on immigration and will it lead to a shutdown that is unlikely to happen. A top official here in the White House tonight told me they're willing to call the Democrat's bluff. The Democrats are willing to shut down the government over a clean bill on DACA, this White House is prepared to let Democrats do that, Sean."

They don't want to secure the border. They don't want to reform immigration, they want to maintain the Russian roulette of the diversity lottery. They want to maintain chain migration, remember the New York attacker on the bicycle path, a terrorist was able to claim migration to sponsor 23 people to come in to this country. And tax reform. How many Democrats voted for tax reform, Sean? None. It comes down to this. We have one Party, the DNC that wants Americans to suffer.

Now in this study, they detail just how ridiculously partisan the media coverage was of President Trump's first year in office. For example check out this graph, it shows the negative coverage of President Trump and his administration and what he received on the network in a newscast throughout the year. It consistently hovers around 90 percent negative versus 10 percent positive. Neutral coverage was excluded, and that surprisingly those saying network TV news cast dedicated in the same amount of coverage to the fake news Trump-Russia collusion, In fact according to the MRC, they spent over 1200 minutes talking about it. Far exceeding the coverage that they gave to any the story which of course were also anti-Trump. The media research center also gave us an exclusive sneak peek of part two of the report where they analyze six Trump accomplishments to the network newscasts had virtually ignored. The president's actions on deregulating expediting pipe line projects and promoting religious freedom and confirmation of conservative judges. Drilling in parts of the arctic and elsewhere and moving us to energy independence. Do you think the news media is not biased and didn't have an anti-Trump agenda, what more proof do you need?

Now, numbers don't mean much unless you contrast it with something, so let's look at what the previous President got in his first year, 20 percent negative coverage. President Trump 5 percent positive. President Obama 20 percent negative. As you said, President Trump had plenty of accomplishment, it was bumpy sometimes obviously with health care but how did you get the 5 percent, I have no idea, so what it tells you it's not just bias in the media, Sean, but that of the blatant variety."
