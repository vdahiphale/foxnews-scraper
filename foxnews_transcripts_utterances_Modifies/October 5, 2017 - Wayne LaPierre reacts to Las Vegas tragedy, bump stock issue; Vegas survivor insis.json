      "sentences": "And this is a Fox News alert. And we are again reporting live tonight from Las Vegas. We are learning new information about mass murderer, Stephen Paddock. His motive tonight remains a mystery. But according to our reports, the gunman researched and scouted for possible attacks in Chicago and Boston and he did in fact -- he rented a room in Vegas overlooking a separate music festival just a week before carrying out his horrific rampage. The Associated Press is also reporting that investigators, they are trying to determine whether he was planning a car bombing. Tonight, there are major questions that we need answers to. Also, Democrats, celebrities, members in the mainstream media, they continue to politicize this tragedy and push for gun control and more. Some are now even saying it's time to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether.  NRA executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre will react tonight. Also Newt Gingrich, he will weigh in on the impulse of the left to politicize this event before we have any facts or any information. Plus, in the aftermath of this tragedy, a heartwarming moment between President Trump and a shooting victim that is now going viral. We visited earlier today, Thomas Gunderson in the hospital.  He is the one that stood up to greet the President even after of course being shot in the leg. After meeting the President, he wrote on Facebook. 'I will never lie down when the president of this great country comes to shake my hand. There may be plenty of issues in this country but I will always respect my country. My president. My flag. Shot in the leg or not, I will stand to show my president the respect he deserves.'  We will have that interview for you a little bit later on the program. By the way, if you are associated with the NFL, I hope you are watching. Plus, I also spoke with the hero doctorates that saved hundreds of lives after this Vegas shooting.  Tonight's very important news breaking opening Vegas monologue. As authorities continue to search for a motive in the Vegas massacre, we are learning chilling new details about this investigation.  According to reports, Stephen Paddock may have been scouting out other potential mass shooting targets. In August he reportedly booked hotel room in Chicago. That overlooked the Lollapalooza Music Festival but never set foot in the city. Chicago police are telling Fox News that they believe that Stephen Paddock did in fact booked the room.   Also reports tonight that Paddock researched hotel rooms in Boston near Fenway Park where the Red Sox play. The Las Vegas Review-Journal, they are reporting that Paddock shot at jet fuel tanks nearby McCarran International Airport during this massacre. Two of the bullets hit one of the tanks and one bullet actually penetrated the tank. Thankfully, that did not cause an explosion. And according to ABC News, Paddock was seen with a woman who is not his girlfriend in the days before the shooting. NBC News reporting the girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has now told investigators that Paddock would lie in bed moaning and screaming and according to Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, the weekend before this mass shooting, Paddock rented and checked into a Las Vegas high-rise condo that overlooked yet another separate music festival. Sheriff Lombardo also revealed last night that he thinks Paddock had to have received help and planned to survive this attack. The sheriff added that 50 pounds of an explosive that's called Tannerite was found in the suspect's car. Along with 1,600 rounds. The AP is also reporting that in addition to other possible planned attacks, Paddock may have also plotted a car bombing.   That information is beyond troubling. And tonight we have questions that need to be answered. Who if anybody helped Paddock carry out this operation? What was Paddock planning to do with a car full of explosives that could be used to make bombs? How did Paddock plan to escape this shooting and why did Paddock rent rooms in Chicago and Vegas during other concerts? Was he planning to do this multiple times and then trying to escape? And the most important question today, of course it remains unanswered. Why? What would motivate this individual to commit such evil, atrocities against innocent men, women, and children? We need answers to all these questions. Tonight, the left liberal celebrities in the media, they continue to play politics, they're trying to use this tragedy to use in advance their gun control agenda. Tonight, some are even calling for the shredding of the Constitution and the eradicating or our Second Amendment and our right to keep and to bear arms. Now, take a look at this headline from the so-called conservative New York Times writer Bret Stephens who is also a contributor over at that conspiracy so-called news network, MSNBC. Quote, 'Repeal the Second Amendment.'  Then Stevens goes on to write, quote, 'Repealing the amendment may seem like political mission impossible today but in the era of same-sex marriage, it's worth recalling that most great causes began as improbable ones. Gun ownership should never be outlawed. Just as it isn't outlawed in Britain and Australia but it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection either.'   Yes. Good luck in those countries getting a gun. And as we have showed you in great detail last night, banning guns does not prevent crime. Just the opposite. More guns prevent crime. More guns save lives and by the way, it appears these people on the left don't care about the Constitution. All banning guns will do is prevent good people from having the ability to protect themselves and their families from those that do us harm. Unlike a lot of these celebrities and politicians, they don't have armed guards and they don't have big houses with expensive security systems and people out there protecting them and bodyguards everywhere they go. So, if people like Michael Moore, Bret Stephens, you really believe in repealing the Second Amendment, here's a simple question I need you to answer.  God forbid for anybody, someone breaks into your home. Well, you have your family, your wife, your children. Would you want a gun? Would you want to have been trained in the use of a firearm and its safety to protect your wife and family? What Brett Stevens is doing is shameful. He's using this massacre here in Vegas to push a liberal agenda. One that is not constitutional. And it's pretty obvious at this point that he's only pretending to be a conservative. By the way, that's a New York Times conservative. He isn't. Hollywood liberal Michael Moore, he wants to repeal what he now calls the ancient and outdated Second Amendment and put in place European-style restrictions that essentially ban you, the American people, from buying arms to protect yourself and your families. These Hollywood liberals like Moore such huge hypocrites when it comes to the issue.  How many live in those gated communities? How many can afford private security? How may buy the best and most expensive security systems but yet they would disarm law-abiding citizens who can only rely on themselves to protect their families? You want an example, take a look at this video security from the Emmys last year. You the American taxpayer, you put at least some of the bill to keep these prima donna celebrities safe at their self-congratulatory red carpet award shows one after another.  Security was extra tight last year because of terror threats. Take a look at some of these headlines. 'No expenses spared to keep the celebrities safe and happy.' Variety: 'Oscars, LAPD, plans for multiple scenarios with three peers of security.' Deadline: 'Hollywood, Golden Globes, ramped up security.' Leading to longer waits for the celebrities. Here's another headline from Hollywood. Emmys security will be severely in hand after London subway attack. As you can see, it is beyond the height of hypocrisy. Here's another thing that these people on the left and members of this biased, abusive press in this country will never tell you. The left doesn't believe in the Second Amendment. You heard Michael Moore say it. He thinks part of the Constitution is outdated. It is why every time tragedy strikes, the left races and rushes to judgment. Pushing an agenda. Do you have a right to protect yourself, your family, your wives, your children? These new examples from the liberal mainstream media, take a look at this.",

Let's come up with common sense solutions but don't take away the rights of law abiding citizens. And what the left should not be doing is using a tragedy while people are still in the hospital and parents, I was there today. They are waiting and hoping and praying that their children will recover from the injuries.  The left has their rigid radical anti-gun agenda. And they are wanting to disarm millions of law-abiding American citizens and that would prevent them from being able to protect themselves, their children, their wives, their families.

That being said, I mean --  The other side has been so outright trying to politicize this tragedy that we did feel the need to speak out today on this whole bump stock issue. You know, I for years have tried to correct the media on semi-automatics. When they said they were fully automatic firearms, when Dianne Feinstein, and Schumer and all the rest of them said they were machine guns -- for years I set the record straight. And then the Obama administration a couple years ago approves this device called a bump stock. If you take a look at it, I mean, any look at it, it takes a semiautomatic firearm and it makes it perform like a fully automatic firearm. It makes it function like one. And what the NRA has said is we ought to take a look at that and see if it is in compliance with federal law and it's worthy of additional regulation.

I am a little surprised. We haven't heard more from his Facebook, from his tweets, from his emails. I mean, it strikes me that there's a lot of stuff that's not coming out. And I'd be very curious to learn what is the police learning that we are not learning? So, one, I just don't get what actually happened in terms of the killer and what drove him and why it happened. He was clearly premeditated and thought through and then deliberately done. Second, I think that the reaction from the left is pathetically normal. They know they have a chant. They go back to their chant. Nothing they've chant about what would have changed what happened in Las Vegas. And third as you just pointed out, you know, the Second Amendment is there for a very powerful reason. And in my course defending America, I have an entire section of course on the Second Amendment. Why the founding fathers put it in. Why they thought it was the heart of our freedom. And why they would not give it up. And I think nobody on the left gets that anymore. They live in a lala land where they trust government and where all the bureaucrats are good guys and so forth.   But I think also as Wayne LaPierre was pointing out, the fact is, we live in a dangerous country. And I was intrigued with your numbers. But have never quite heard before. If you look at the disaster of the Obama administration in terms of public safety, particularly in Chicago, it is staggering that we've never had a national debate about the failure of the system in Chicago to protect innocent people. By the way, virtually all of them are African-American. And you would have thought of Black Lives Matter cared about black lives. One of the places they would have really targeted would have been Southside, Chicago.

      "utterance": "And this is a Fox News alert. And we are again reporting live tonight from Las Vegas. We are learning new information about mass murderer, Stephen Paddock. His motive tonight remains a mystery. But according to our reports, the gunman researched and scouted for possible attacks in Chicago and Boston and he did in fact -- he rented a room in Vegas overlooking a separate music festival just a week before carrying out his horrific rampage. The Associated Press is also reporting that investigators, they are trying to determine whether he was planning a car bombing. Tonight, there are major questions that we need answers to. Also, Democrats, celebrities, members in the mainstream media, they continue to politicize this tragedy and push for gun control and more. Some are now even saying it's time to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether. NRA executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre will react tonight. Also Newt Gingrich, he will weigh in on the impulse of the left to politicize this event before we have any facts or any information. Plus, in the aftermath of this tragedy, a heartwarming moment between President Trump and a shooting victim that is now going viral. We visited earlier today, Thomas Gunderson in the hospital. He is the one that stood up to greet the President even after of course being shot in the leg. After meeting the President, he wrote on Facebook. 'I will never lie down when the president of this great country comes to shake my hand. There may be plenty of issues in this country but I will always respect my country. My president. My flag. Shot in the leg or not, I will stand to show my president the respect he deserves.' We will have that interview for you a little bit later on the program. By the way, if you are associated with the NFL, I hope you are watching. Plus, I also spoke with the hero doctorates that saved hundreds of lives after this Vegas shooting. Tonight's very important news breaking opening Vegas monologue. As authorities continue to search for a motive in the Vegas massacre, we are learning chilling new details about this investigation. According to reports, Stephen Paddock may have been scouting out other potential mass shooting targets. In August he reportedly booked hotel room in Chicago. That overlooked the Lollapalooza Music Festival but never set foot in the city. Chicago police are telling Fox News that they believe that Stephen Paddock did in fact booked the room. Also reports tonight that Paddock researched hotel rooms in Boston near Fenway Park where the Red Sox play. The Las Vegas Review-Journal, they are reporting that Paddock shot at jet fuel tanks nearby McCarran International Airport during this massacre. Two of the bullets hit one of the tanks and one bullet actually penetrated the tank. Thankfully, that did not cause an explosion. And according to ABC News, Paddock was seen with a woman who is not his girlfriend in the days before the shooting. NBC News reporting the girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has now told investigators that Paddock would lie in bed moaning and screaming and according to Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, the weekend before this mass shooting, Paddock rented and checked into a Las Vegas high-rise condo that overlooked yet another separate music festival. Sheriff Lombardo also revealed last night that he thinks Paddock had to have received help and planned to survive this attack. The sheriff added that 50 pounds of an explosive that's called Tannerite was found in the suspect's car. Along with 1,600 rounds. The AP is also reporting that in addition to other possible planned attacks, Paddock may have also plotted a car bombing. That information is beyond troubling. And tonight we have questions that need to be answered. Who if anybody helped Paddock carry out this operation? What was Paddock planning to do with a car full of explosives that could be used to make bombs? How did Paddock plan to escape this shooting and why did Paddock rent rooms in Chicago and Vegas during other concerts? Was he planning to do this multiple times and then trying to escape? And the most important question today, of course it remains unanswered. Why? What would motivate this individual to commit such evil, atrocities against innocent men, women, and children? We need answers to all these questions. Tonight, the left liberal celebrities in the media, they continue to play politics, they're trying to use this tragedy to use in advance their gun control agenda. Tonight, some are even calling for the shredding of the Constitution and the eradicating or our Second Amendment and our right to keep and to bear arms. Now, take a look at this headline from the so-called conservative New York Times writer Bret Stephens who is also a contributor over at that conspiracy so-called news network, MSNBC. Quote, 'Repeal the Second Amendment.' Then Stevens goes on to write, quote, 'Repealing the amendment may seem like political mission impossible today but in the era of same-sex marriage, it's worth recalling that most great causes began as improbable ones. Gun ownership should never be outlawed. Just as it isn't outlawed in Britain and Australia but it doesn't need a blanket constitutional protection either.' Yes. Good luck in those countries getting a gun. And as we have showed you in great detail last night, banning guns does not prevent crime. Just the opposite. More guns prevent crime. More guns save lives and by the way, it appears these people on the left don't care about the Constitution. All banning guns will do is prevent good people from having the ability to protect themselves and their families from those that do us harm. Unlike a lot of these celebrities and politicians, they don't have armed guards and they don't have big houses with expensive security systems and people out there protecting them and bodyguards everywhere they go. So, if people like Michael Moore, Bret Stephens, you really believe in repealing the Second Amendment, here's a simple question I need you to answer. God forbid for anybody, someone breaks into your home. Well, you have your family, your wife, your children. Would you want a gun? Would you want to have been trained in the use of a firearm and its safety to protect your wife and family? What Brett Stevens is doing is shameful. He's using this massacre here in Vegas to push a liberal agenda. One that is not constitutional. And it's pretty obvious at this point that he's only pretending to be a conservative. By the way, that's a New York Times conservative. He isn't. Hollywood liberal Michael Moore, he wants to repeal what he now calls the ancient and outdated Second Amendment and put in place European-style restrictions that essentially ban you, the American people, from buying arms to protect yourself and your families. These Hollywood liberals like Moore such huge hypocrites when it comes to the issue. How many live in those gated communities? How many can afford private security? How may buy the best and most expensive security systems but yet they would disarm law-abiding citizens who can only rely on themselves to protect their families? You want an example, take a look at this video security from the Emmys last year. You the American taxpayer, you put at least some of the bill to keep these prima donna celebrities safe at their self-congratulatory red carpet award shows one after another."

Here's another headline from Hollywood. Emmys security will be severely in hand after London subway attack. As you can see, it is beyond the height of hypocrisy. Here's another thing that these people on the left and members of this biased, abusive press in this country will never tell you. The left doesn't believe in the Second Amendment. You heard Michael Moore say it. He thinks part of the Constitution is outdated. It is why every time tragedy strikes, the left races and rushes to judgment. Pushing an agenda. Do you have a right to protect yourself, your family, your wives, your children? These new examples from the liberal mainstream media, take a look at this."

Let's come up with common sense solutions but don't take away the rights of law abiding citizens. And what the left should not be doing is using a tragedy while people are still in the hospital and parents, I was there today.

When they said they were fully automatic firearms, when Dianne Feinstein, and Schumer and all the rest of them said they were machine guns -- for years I set the record straight. And then the Obama administration a couple years ago approves this device called a bump stock. If you take a look at it, I mean, any look at it, it takes a semiautomatic firearm and it makes it perform like a fully automatic firearm. It makes it function like one. And what the NRA has said is we ought to take a look at that and see if it is in compliance with federal law and it's worthy of additional regulation. That being said, we didn't say ban, we didn't say confiscate."

And that is they really don't want the average citizen -- they don't believe in the constitution. They don't believe in the right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. And I just pointed out the great hypocrisy -- most of these people, they have security guards. They have their fortresses at their house. They have people at the self- congratulatory event like Oscars and Emmys. The average Americans has one -- usually they have themselves to rely on. Great hypocrisy or no?"

One thing the American public always knows is that the elites always protect themselves and they always protect themselves with guns and then they lectured the American public how you shouldn't do that. But in the heart of the American public all over this country, they see these monsters and they don't want to be alone out there. They want to be able to detect themselves. One of the things that happened in Las Vegas when they said shelter in place, the first thing that came up when they were sheltered, they said to somebody have a gun. We saw it with the hurricanes this past week in Texas and Florida, in places like that. Louisiana. When the water is rising, when it goes dark, the American public values its freedom to protect themselves and now you have Dianne Feinstein and Schumer in the media to get this horrible tragedy and they want to piggybacked their whole agenda to ban guns, restrict law-abiding people for the last 20 years. This circus on the back of this tragedy in then active. And what the NRA is fighting for is reciprocity, enforced existing federal gun laws, protect the American's rights to protect themselves."

Thirty nine hundred people killed in Chicago while Obama's president, 18,000 shootings in just the last six years of his presidency. Where were these liberal voices then?

San Bernardino where California has every gun law you can imagine on the books. That wouldn't have happened. In Paris where they have complete gun bans, that wouldn't have happened. Brussels, all over the world where the people are disarmed. These monsters. These bad guys go about their business. They could care less what laws are on the books. And the good people want to protect themselves. They want to defend themselves. That's why we are fighting for reciprocity.

They criticize me for saying, people ought to be able to protect themselves from murderers, rapists, and robbers. And then they make billions to pick thing every night those same situations.

He also has a new class teaching online and a former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. It's on my website Hannity.com. I know that's not the usual introduction, Mr. Speaker. But I could not exist. As you've been watching this, I want to get your take on everything. Your take on the politicizing of it. Your take on those that literally have no respect for our constitution nor any understanding for what real Americans live under. The threat that they have.

      "utterance": "Well, let me divide it into three different things. First, I frankly still and I said this to you on your radio show, I still have not fully got my head around what happened. I am a little surprised. We haven't heard more from his Facebook, from his tweets, from his emails. I mean, it strikes me that there's a lot of stuff that's not coming out. And I'd be very curious to learn what is the police learning that we are not learning? So, one, I just don't get what actually happened in terms of the killer and what drove him and why it happened. He was clearly premeditated and thought through and then deliberately done. Second, I think that the reaction from the left is pathetically normal. They know they have a chant. They go back to their chant. Nothing they've chant about what would have changed what happened in Las Vegas. And third as you just pointed out, you know, the Second Amendment is there for a very powerful reason. And in my course defending America, I have an entire section of course on the Second Amendment. Why the founding fathers put it in. Why they thought it was the heart of our freedom. And why they would not give it up. And I think nobody on the left gets that anymore. They live in a lala land where they trust government and where all the bureaucrats are good guys and so forth. But I think also as Wayne LaPierre was pointing out, the fact is, we live in a dangerous country. And I was intrigued with your numbers. But have never quite heard before. If you look at the disaster of the Obama administration in terms of public safety, particularly in Chicago, it is staggering that we've never had a national debate about the failure of the system in Chicago to protect innocent people. By the way, virtually all of them are African-American. And you would have thought of Black Lives Matter cared about black lives. One of the places they would have really targeted would have been Southside, Chicago. And the terrible death rate that occurs there and yet we cannot have an honest, open conversation about these kind of practical problems."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm actually trying to work on how to put this together into an understandable package. You ought to look at the number of children for example in Baltimore who failed their eighth grade Math and Science test. About 13 percent past, 87 percent failed. If you were to add up the eight years of failure under Obama, with no effort to save the lives of these young people. If you are to look at what you just pointed out at Southside Chicago. But by the way, there is a small part of St. Louis that is more violent than any other area in the United States. In fact, it's about as violent as the most dangerous cities in Honduras, which are routinely ranked as the most dangerous in the world. For some reason, none of this penetrates the elite news media. It does not fit their particular narrative."

And they saved hundreds of lives on this night. And it was all hands on deck. And let them explain it for them. There is this young man. Thomas Gunderson is his name. And I met him and I met his parents and he is the young man that stood for the President even though he had been shot and the like. And I was thinking about comments that you would made about the NFL and taking in me. And the people that fought, bled, and died fighting under our flag. And I was thinking, you know, this young man could really teach a lot of people a lesson here. And you've got to wonder if maybe now we will remember what police do for us. We remember it on 9/11, and these policemen been going to this 32nd floor and facing an automatic weapon. And this young man will stand for his president, for his country and his flag.

And I thought wow, what a distinction between a guy who had risked his life for America, wearing a uniform with the American flag, who was still proud to be an American. And these guys are making millions of dollars a year who don't mind disrespecting the National Anthem and the American flag.

I don't have any sense of who he emailed with or what websites he went to. I don't understand the total absence of understanding what motivated him, what created this moment.
