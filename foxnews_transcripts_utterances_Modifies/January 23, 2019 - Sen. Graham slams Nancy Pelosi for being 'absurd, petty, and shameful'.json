      "sentences": "There's always something. Welcome to “Hannity.”  This is a huge news night. For the first time in history, a sitting U.S. president has been disinvited from delivering the State of the Union Address from the House chambers.  In a letter, Speaker Pelosi wrote that she would not authorize the president's speech in the House until the government reopened. This is unprecedented political ploy, obvious for what it is. And it comes just days after speaker Pelosi falsely claimed that the shutdown related to security concerns that that would delay the joint address. That was a lie. And Pelosi's newest letter makes zero reference to security, only a demand to reopen the government, only on her terms. So, that just proves it's a cheap political ploy.  Now, unfortunately, for Speaker Pelosi, we do have something called the Constitution. And there is Article II, Section 3, U.S. Constitution, it requires the president to deliver the State of the Union, as you can see up there from time to time. In coming days, the president will make this constitutionally important speech whether or not Nancy Pelosi decides to attend or whether or not she grants access to the House chamber. And, of course, Nancy Pelosi doesn't really care when or if the government reopened. A matter of fact, she could care less about the furloughed government workers not getting paid. She sure as hell doesn't care about the epidemic of crime, violence, drugs pouring across what is our unsecured southern border, human trafficking, gang-related crimes. Ninety percent of America's heroin supply comes across that border. Nancy apparently doesn't care. She won't even talk to the president.  We have 300 dead Americans every week because of heroin. There's an opioid crisis that we can fix in large part by getting rid of the heroin. Nancy doesn't seem to care. Now, this deadly poison fentanyl also pouring across in record amounts on our southern border. Nancy apparently doesn't care. That's why Nancy Pelosi calls this real life, every day death and destruction a, quote, manufactured crisis. That's why she took a nice long luxury vacation to Hawaii during Christmas. The president, he remained in the White House, urging Democrats to come on over and negotiate. That's why Pelosi and Schumer rejected a meeting with the vice president over the weekend and instead they sent low level aides to the shutdown negotiations. That's why dozens of Pelosi's colleagues hopped on a private jet, tons of carbon emissions, for an all-expense paid tropical vacation to Puerto Rico, complements, of course, of K Street lobbyists.  Well, the president he remained in Washington the entire time, only leaving briefly to visit our troops in Iraq and monitor the crisis at our southern border. And that's why Pelosi tried to take another week-long, government paid, taxpayer paid international trip at the height of the shutdown, which would have guaranteed furloughed employees don't get a penny while Trump urged her to stay home and come to the negotiating table.   That's why Pelosi rejected the president's good faith compromise. He provided what the Democrats for years have said they wanted, a solution for DACA recipients, so-called Dreamers. She rejected it before he even read the offer. And tomorrow, Senate Republicans -- they will hold a vote on that compromise while Senate Democrats are pushing a bill that offers nothing. And earlier, President Trump offered this insight. Radical, extreme left wing lawmakers are now pulling the strings in what is the new radical leftist Democratic socialist party. Take a look.",

And she's afraid of the truth. And the super left Democrats, the radical Democrats, what's going on in that party is shocking. It's too bad with Nancy Pelosi what she's done. It's radical. Democrats - - they've become a radicalized party -- they really have. They've become a radicalized party.  I actually think they've become a very dangerous party for this country. If you listen to what they're saying, what they're doing, I think they've become a very dangerous -- a very, very dangerous party for this country.   We are not going to allow the radical left to control our borders. Because if they do, you will see crime, you will see drugs, you will see human trafficking like you've never seen ever in the history of our country. You will never see anything like what you would see. So, we will never let the radical left control our borders.",

Can you really say to Angel moms and dads that lost their kids to illegal immigrants in this country that this is a manufactured crisis? Can you look into the eyes of parents that lost their kids from heroin overdoses and say this is a manufactured crisis? Now, they refuse to come to the table. The president can and likely will declare a national emergency and fund the border wall without their consent.  Now, for the president, this is obviously about life and death, fulfilling his constitutional pledge which is to protect and defend the country as commander in chief. Just a few short years ago, remember Democrats, oh, under Obama, they sounded like Trump about the border. They say they care about DACA, Dreamers, furloughed employees.  Their actions show that is absolutely false and not true. For them, this isn't about anything but power. Not principle. Also, how refreshing. Think for a moment that we actually elected a president that is willing to fight hard to protect the country to keep it safe, to keep a promise. Don't we always say we want politicians to keep their words, stand on principle, keep promises, fight for the things that they believe in?  We're now witnessing all of that unfold every day. That is good and that is something we haven't seen in a lot of politicians. Now, this is not going to be easy. We're now witnessing what is an implosion of the Democratic Party. Pelosi, Schumer, other long-time Democrats have completely lost control and now that party has been taken over by extreme, radical Democratic socialists.   A group of people that really wake up in the morning and they just hate President Trump. That's what's important. Not DACA, not Dreamers, not furloughed employees. They hate Trump. And they want to dramatically reshape what is a free market economy which is the envy of the world. They want to cater to the most extreme elements of their own base. This comes as we witness horrific effects of socialism in real time. And the South American country of Venezuela, their economy, socialist, well, it's totally collapsed. The country is descending into chaos. And today, protests throughout the streets of Caracas, and an opposition leader has now declared himself the interim president. The socialist dictator is refusing to give up any power even after his socialist policies caused his country to really become, well, a living hell hole.  Three million Venezuelans have now fled their home country because of poverty and hunger. Look at this -- hyper inflation has reached 80,000 percent. The entire country once ran out of toilet paper. Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves, one of -- one time, the wealthiest in Latin America. It is now the perfect poster child for socialism.  But that's stopping Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from pushing these same policies right here at home, by the way, after predicting that the world is going to end in 12 years if we didn't let the government force green energy down our throats. You think I'm kidding? No, I didn't make this up. Take a look.",

No investigation, no interviews, and try to plug the facts in later to fit your already conceived narrative, destroying innocent lives in the process. This is sick.

So if I'm a Democrat, these people are defining my party in a way that gives it a very limited future in America in my view. So the President to me obviously and I agree with him, views this as life and death, safety and security of the American people, stopping the heroin - 90 percent of the heroin coming into this country from coming across the border, fentanyl, he's about life and that seems like a principled strong position. Also part of his, when he pledges to faithfully serve and protect the constitution, that means it's people, he's the Commander-in-Chief as per the constitution. What is the democratic position?

That used to be the standard that a lot of media places embrace but that's all changed now, Sean because of social media which is a unfiltered medium with no editor, no checks and balances. Then you'll say, well, who gets their news from social media? You know that two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, that's according to PEW and what you have is news organizations reacting to what's trending and what's going viral and when there's a negative connotation towards an administration or an ideology, forget about it.

No, he's not a Vietnam veteran and when you watch the video in full instead of the heavily edited version, you see the completely different version of what was first reported which was like The New York Times, \"Boys in Make America Great Again hats mob native elder at march.\" So all that said, when it's all said and done, there needs to be accountability.

      "utterance": "There's always something. Welcome to “Hannity.” This is a huge news night. For the first time in history, a sitting U.S. president has been disinvited from delivering the State of the Union Address from the House chambers. In a letter, Speaker Pelosi wrote that she would not authorize the president's speech in the House until the government reopened. This is unprecedented political ploy, obvious for what it is. And it comes just days after speaker Pelosi falsely claimed that the shutdown related to security concerns that that would delay the joint address. That was a lie. And Pelosi's newest letter makes zero reference to security, only a demand to reopen the government, only on her terms. So, that just proves it's a cheap political ploy. Now, unfortunately, for Speaker Pelosi, we do have something called the Constitution. And there is Article II, Section 3, U.S. Constitution, it requires the president to deliver the State of the Union, as you can see up there from time to time. In coming days, the president will make this constitutionally important speech whether or not Nancy Pelosi decides to attend or whether or not she grants access to the House chamber. And, of course, Nancy Pelosi doesn't really care when or if the government reopened. A matter of fact, she could care less about the furloughed government workers not getting paid. She sure as hell doesn't care about the epidemic of crime, violence, drugs pouring across what is our unsecured southern border, human trafficking, gang-related crimes. Ninety percent of America's heroin supply comes across that border. Nancy apparently doesn't care. She won't even talk to the president. We have 300 dead Americans every week because of heroin. There's an opioid crisis that we can fix in large part by getting rid of the heroin. Nancy doesn't seem to care. Now, this deadly poison fentanyl also pouring across in record amounts on our southern border. Nancy apparently doesn't care. That's why Nancy Pelosi calls this real life, every day death and destruction a, quote, manufactured crisis. That's why she took a nice long luxury vacation to Hawaii during Christmas. The president, he remained in the White House, urging Democrats to come on over and negotiate. That's why Pelosi and Schumer rejected a meeting with the vice president over the weekend and instead they sent low level aides to the shutdown negotiations. That's why dozens of Pelosi's colleagues hopped on a private jet, tons of carbon emissions, for an all-expense paid tropical vacation to Puerto Rico, complements, of course, of K Street lobbyists. Well, the president he remained in Washington the entire time, only leaving briefly to visit our troops in Iraq and monitor the crisis at our southern border. And that's why Pelosi tried to take another week-long, government paid, taxpayer paid international trip at the height of the shutdown, which would have guaranteed furloughed employees don't get a penny while Trump urged her to stay home and come to the negotiating table. That's why Pelosi rejected the president's good faith compromise. He provided what the Democrats for years have said they wanted, a solution for DACA recipients, so-called Dreamers. She rejected it before he even read the offer. And tomorrow, Senate Republicans -- they will hold a vote on that compromise while Senate Democrats are pushing a bill that offers nothing. And earlier, President Trump offered this insight. Radical, extreme left wing lawmakers are now pulling the strings in what is the new radical leftist Democratic socialist party. Take a look."

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "The State of the Union speech has been canceled by Nancy Pelosi because she doesn't want to hear the truth. She doesn't want the American public to hear what's going on. And she's afraid of the truth. And the super left Democrats, the radical Democrats, what's going on in that party is shocking. It's too bad with Nancy Pelosi what she's done. It's radical. Democrats - - they've become a radicalized party -- they really have. They've become a radicalized party. I actually think they've become a very dangerous party for this country. If you listen to what they're saying, what they're doing, I think they've become a very dangerous -- a very, very dangerous party for this country. We are not going to allow the radical left to control our borders. Because if they do, you will see crime, you will see drugs, you will see human trafficking like you've never seen ever in the history of our country. You will never see anything like what you would see. So, we will never let the radical left control our borders."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "The president's correct. And still as we speak, the Democrats have an opportunity to secure the border, provide a solution for DACA, Dreamers. Now, think about this for a second. Can you really say to Angel moms and dads that lost their kids to illegal immigrants in this country that this is a manufactured crisis? Can you look into the eyes of parents that lost their kids from heroin overdoses and say this is a manufactured crisis? Now, they refuse to come to the table. The president can and likely will declare a national emergency and fund the border wall without their consent. Now, for the president, this is obviously about life and death, fulfilling his constitutional pledge which is to protect and defend the country as commander in chief. Just a few short years ago, remember Democrats, oh, under Obama, they sounded like Trump about the border. They say they care about DACA, Dreamers, furloughed employees. Their actions show that is absolutely false and not true. For them, this isn't about anything but power. Not principle. Also, how refreshing. Think for a moment that we actually elected a president that is willing to fight hard to protect the country to keep it safe, to keep a promise. Don't we always say we want politicians to keep their words, stand on principle, keep promises, fight for the things that they believe in? We're now witnessing all of that unfold every day. That is good and that is something we haven't seen in a lot of politicians. Now, this is not going to be easy. We're now witnessing what is an implosion of the Democratic Party. Pelosi, Schumer, other long-time Democrats have completely lost control and now that party has been taken over by extreme, radical Democratic socialists. A group of people that really wake up in the morning and they just hate President Trump. That's what's important. Not DACA, not Dreamers, not furloughed employees. They hate Trump. And they want to dramatically reshape what is a free market economy which is the envy of the world. They want to cater to the most extreme elements of their own base. This comes as we witness horrific effects of socialism in real time. And the South American country of Venezuela, their economy, socialist, well, it's totally collapsed. The country is descending into chaos. And today, protests throughout the streets of Caracas, and an opposition leader has now declared himself the interim president. The socialist dictator is refusing to give up any power even after his socialist policies caused his country to really become, well, a living hell hole. Three million Venezuelans have now fled their home country because of poverty and hunger. Look at this -- hyper inflation has reached 80,000 percent. The entire country once ran out of toilet paper. Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves, one of -- one time, the wealthiest in Latin America. It is now the perfect poster child for socialism. But that's stopping Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from pushing these same policies right here at home, by the way, after predicting that the world is going to end in 12 years if we didn't let the government force green energy down our throats. You think I'm kidding? No, I didn't make this up. Take a look."

In the twisted world, what is now the radical socialist Democratic Party, apparently making money and being successful is evil. Venezuela is a heaven on earth opportunity for us.

To many in the media, they seem all too comfortable, this rush to judgment over and over and over again. And remember, first the media reported the students surrounded Phillips. That never happened. Videotape shows that in fact there was an indigenous peoples rally as well. He approached them. Phillips accused the students of initiating taunts against the Black Hebrew Israelites we have on tape saying all those things. And we now know that's not true. Despite this story being exposed, that's not stopping Mr. Phillips. Just hours after his now infamous encounter with the Covington students, he let a group of protesters to the steps of a Washington, D.C., cathedral. And according to multiple reports, a new video out tonight, Phillips attempted to disrupt mass before being halted by security. That sound like someone who wants to unify, bridge differences? That's what he claimed. Now, remember, fake news has real consequences. Richard Jewell, Duke Lacrosse, UVA, Ferguson, Missouri, Justice Kavanaugh, Cambridge police. You know what, rushing to judgment, dangerous. It ruins people's lives. Covington was forced to close its doors amid a wave of death threats. That was earlier today, and a bomb threat today.

Well, to the media, he became an instant villain. And we all know why. But here's a message to the left and their partners in the fake news media. The face of bullying, hate, smear, slander, no, it's not wearing a red hat that says let's make this wonderful country of ours great again. You know, when are you all going to take a look in the mirror, take ownership of the lies, the division, the rush to judgment and chaos that you so willingly seem to sow? Your hatred for this president, we saw it with the \"BuzzFeed\" article. If it's true, then spend hours and hours and hours speculating about something you have not vetted. It goes so deep you're literally willing to write the story first.

Since 1913, Woodrow Wilson, there's been 83 presidents, 83 times that they -- not presidents, a number of times they came there to present to Congress. The speaker of the House invited President Trump on January 3rd when we were sworn in. She also said that should be a town hall, a place where we can have debates and others. I truly believe history will mark this as a low point for the speaker of the house, for that office, to disinvite this president.

The Arms Services chair says, walls work. Even the number two Steny Hoyer believes in having a barrier or a wall. So, what Speaker Pelosi is doing is almost acting like a dictator. By bringing a privilege resolution allows a vote on the floor to disapprove of this action, because I believe that no other time in America it is more important now to have the president, the senators, the House members, Republican and Democrats alike, all in one place talking about where America's at today and where we can go in the future. This is bigger than just our country. The world watches the State of the Union. And you know what's most concerning to me? Since 1934, there has not been a State of the Union past February 2nd.

He may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper and he shall receive ambassadors and senators. Sounds like the president can go to the Senate.

We'll have Schumer's proposal that I'll vote against, then the hard work starts. We had a meeting today with about eight Democrats and about eight Republicans and you know, Nancy Pelosi's become a nightmare for the Democratic Party. She seems unreasonable, she seems to have a dislike for the President that is hurting the country and this idea of not letting the President speak is really over playing your hand. So I want to let your listers know that there's a reaction to this far left rhetoric in the Senate by more mainstream Democrats that I think will eventually allow us to get the wall funded and do some things for the DACA recipients and TPS recipients. There's a deal in the making and the more extreme Nancy Pelosi gets, the more likely we'll have a deal."

      "utterance": "Well, I think the President has a lot of power. I mean she can disinvite him to the House but come to the Senate, Mr. President. There's plenty of places the President can choose to deliver the State of the Union but here's the question for America, what kind of Union do you want? Do you want a country that looks more like Venezuela and less like America? If you do for all these hard left people, they're going to take you to the land where the government taxes everything in its power, they control every decision in life and you'll see Venezuela come here. This is what this whole election is going to be about in 2020. Do we go further left and become a like Venezuela? Or do we want to come to America that all of us want us to be? So if I'm a Democrat, these people are defining my party in a way that gives it a very limited future in America in my view. So the President to me obviously and I agree with him, views this as life and death, safety and security of the American people, stopping the heroin - 90 percent of the heroin coming into this country from coming across the border, fentanyl, he's about life and that seems like a principled strong position. Also part of his, when he pledges to faithfully serve and protect the constitution, that means it's people, he's the Commander-in-Chief as per the constitution. What is the democratic position? They don't want DACA, they don't seem to care about furloughed employees, they don't seem to care about dreamers."

A broken border is more dangerous to the country than a partial government shutdown. In their world there is no ICE, you get a dollar for the wall and the border patrol agents are gassing children, not defending the country from an onslaught. So my view is that Democrats in the Senate are going to become more reasonable as these people define extreme positions. The President made a very smart move by putting on the table relief for DACA recipients, TPS recipients which the Democrats have been for, for decades. Now let's see what kind of Democratic Party we've got. Do we have a Democratic Party that hates Trump so much they will say no to 1.1 million people having a better life or will we have some Democratic senators and some Democratic House members joined with the President and me to solve this problem? Time will tell."

If I were the President, I would ask Nancy Pelosi if the Bill passes the Senate that has Wall funding, protection for DACA and TPS, would you take it up in the House? If she says yes, I would open the government for 3 weeks, let the Senate see if we can reach a deal and if we can't, I would use the emergency powers as the Commander-in-Chief to bring this debacle to an end."

This is all collateral damage for them. They continue to go with a completely false and disproven narrative. In fact to this very day in some media outlets cases, on that story simply because they've got a double down not just against this President who they've got to - they're committed to destroy but also everybody and everything that supports him and or his agenda."

So the question is where does the media - how do they come down here in the end because the American people seem to like the President that's fighting hard to keep promises and being principled."

The sizzle instead of the steak and I think when President Trump leaves the stage, it's going to be like the 2008 financial crisis where it's going to go right off the cliff and you're going to see a lot more layoffs than like the 15 percent of employee layoffs that we saw today at BuzzFeed for instance. So a lot of places are going to struggle without the central character in their casting but look, UPI used to have saying as, it used to be get it first but first, get it right. That used to be the standard that a lot of media places embrace but that's all changed now, Sean because of social media which is a unfiltered medium with no editor, no checks and balances. Then you'll say, well, who gets their news from social media? You know that two-thirds of Americans get their news from social media, that's according to PEW and what you have is news organizations reacting to what's trending and what's going viral and when there's a negative connotation towards an administration or an ideology, forget about it. Then it goes off the ledge because in this case, think of the trifecta that news organizations embraced here, Covington kids, all right, Catholic white privilege wearing Trump MAGA hats, taunting an elder native American except they weren't taunting and he approached them, except that they said he was a Vietnam veteran. No, he's not a Vietnam veteran and when you watch the video in full instead of the heavily edited version, you see the completely different version of what was first reported which was like The New York Times, \"Boys in Make America Great Again hats mob native elder at march.\" So all that said, when it's all said and done, there needs to be accountability. We see it once in a while with people that are expendable but until people start getting fired, suspended or reprimanded, you are not going to see any changes because it's like speeding. A cop pulls you over and says, hey, I'll give you a warning. You're going to keep doing it so until there are actual consequences for people that make mistakes and that includes on Twitter, you're going to see this over and over and over again."
