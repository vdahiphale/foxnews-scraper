And now, 2020 Democrats are putting out their own spin. What a shock. Fox is on - I'm so excited about this. Maria Bartiromo sets the record straight in a dynamite segment ahead.  Plus, former Whitewater Counsel, Ken Starr is here exclusively. He's going to share behind the scenes, real story about what happened during that Jeffrey Epstein plea deal. He was there. And what happens with his testimony being moved for Bob Mueller.  Also, Raymond Arroyo will address the strange coverage of a young Stranger Things Star and its latest, well, the fashion trend. Will anyone buy mercies. I'm going to do an informal poll on the set tonight.  And tonight's “Angle” is going to explain why I'm calling Democrats. Well, the bitter bunch. We'll show you throughout the hour how they now find misery in America's happiness. But first, another day, another pathetic Democrat clown show on Capitol Hill. Now, remember, the party of abortion on demand and now infanticide cares more about the children than you heartless soulless Republicans.",

His family, including two young daughters are separated from him forever. Not for just a few weeks or a few months. So, as AOC or any well-known elected Democrat shed one tear for these types of tragedies, ever? Not that I've seen.

At the same time, Trump's casual trashing of past trade agreements has badly damaged American credibility and weakened the international rule of law. Maria you know this better than almost anyone. What did China's repeated cheating in trade and market manipulation. What did that to do to people's belief in the free market trading system. BARTIROMO: One example Laura, I had Steve Ballmer on, the former CEO of Microsoft. He said In China, 90 percent of the companies use the Microsoft operating system. One percent of them pay for it. Ballmer told me that cost Microsoft $10 billion in profits a year. The Chinese have been stealing from the West, stealing from America, intellectual property for decades. Everybody knows that very few people have even thought to push back on China. This President is the first President to actually push back on China and keep his boot on the neck of President Xi Jinping. And that is why you're seeing this fight over tariffs.

Currently we're looking at winds maybe getting up to 70 miles an hour, which would make it a very strong tropical storm. At 74 miles an hour it becomes a hurricane. But that's not going to matter. The story of this is really going to be the rain that it brings, all of the moisture. We have got hurricane watches and warnings that a lot of this is going to be due to some of the flooding that we're going to see all associated with this system. Early bands of rain have already begun to batter the coast of Louisiana, stretching all the way over to portions of the Florida Panhandle. The heaviest rain really highlighting in a spot along the Louisiana coast, and then up into Mississippi as this entire system makes landfall and then runs farther north. This is going to be a widespread flooding event. And it's not just the rainfall that's going to case the problems. We also have an issue with possible storm surge, especially in low lying areas, anywhere from three to six feet of flooding right along the coast as this runs up on the coast. This is going to be a mess. And Laura, it's not just today. I'm afraid this is going to linger into Sunday and even Monday as the system tracks to the north.",

Plus, former Whitewater Counsel, Ken Starr is here exclusively. He's going to share behind the scenes, real story about what happened during that Jeffrey Epstein plea deal. He was there. And what happens with his testimony being moved for Bob Mueller. Also, Raymond Arroyo will address the strange coverage of a young Stranger Things Star and its latest, well, the fashion trend. Will anyone buy mercies. I'm going to do an informal poll on the set tonight. And tonight's “Angle” is going to explain why I'm calling Democrats. Well, the bitter bunch. We'll show you throughout the hour how they now find misery in America's happiness. But first, another day, another pathetic Democrat clown show on Capitol Hill.

That they operate concentration camps That they abuse women and children. ICE agents and Border Patrol Agents are moms and dads too. They have children.

His family, including two young daughters are separated from him forever. Not for just a few weeks or a few months. So, as AOC or any well-known elected Democrat shed one tear for these types of tragedies, ever? Not that I've seen.

We're always going to rescue them. That's what we do. That's who we are. We don't purposely let people drown. Other countries might do that. We don't do that. But today and listening to some of these Democrats, no, we don't pick them up and in fact we want them to suffer. That's not what I saw down there.

The men and women of the Border Control and ICE go out there every day and put their lives on the line to protect this country. The people coming into the country illegally, they are violating federal law. If you don't want those kids separated from their families, if you don't want those kids taken away, then don't come into the country illegally. And if it's all about asylum.

Some are in trucks and buses. So, the idea that they come to the United States and it's all terrible, it's ridiculous and it's overcrowded. But come on, the asylum reform has to happen, because a lot of them do cross, Congressman Duffy and when they cross, they are technically following the law. Are they not?

They came across the desert with Mexican drug cartels. I would love to have Gunther and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shed a tear for the angel moms who will never hug their loved ones any longer. Or the little girls or women who are raped on the way across the Mexican desert by drug cartels, or officers saying, who lost his life on Christmas Day. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant or Gonzalez (ph) who had his throat slit in the Mexican desert by the drug cartel and his 10-year-old son fake dead and was phone hugging his dad in the desert. When you shed tears for those people and say, let's fix the problem. Close the loopholes and if you're not going to close the loopholes Democrats, at least vote to spend the $4.6 billion to the Border Patrol so they can take care of the people, they're in the detention centers but when Cortez doesn't vote for the money and then cries about it, give me a break.

Now the results since then haven't just provided a contrast to those headlines. They have blown them out of the water. In a word, they have shamed or should have shamed these so-called experts. Joining me now is the always fabulous, Maria Bartiromo, Host of the fantastic show Mornings with Maria. Of course, on Fox Business and Sunday Morning Futures right here on Fox.

I don't know what it would take to for them to admit that they were wrong. But when you look at these metrics Laura, it is really hard to ignore. Unemployment at a 51-year low. Wages up better than 3 percent. First time, we're seeing wages go up in more than a decade. I mean get your head around that for a second. The first time American workers have actually had a raise, a real raise in more than 10 years. And the real important and gem of all of this is actually that it's the low income and minorities that are benefiting from these policies coming out of the Trump administration than so many others. We're seeing people who have never had a job actually working. They are participating in an economy that is growing better than 3 percent. You ask anybody on either side of the aisle, and you have to admit, things are going well. There's euphoria in the air."

They go on to note that these are the people who haven't benefited from the American economy since the pre-recession days and then they had a graph which was stunning. The people without a high school diploma, it's the hardest to get jobs if you're without a high school diploma. They have seen an increase in their employment at a greater rate than any other group that's measured in the same way. I thought that was great news, because I'm always worried about those people who didn't have a chance to finish the schooling that a lot of us did get a chance to finish."

This goes directly back to what the President did a year and a half ago with tax cuts and the rollback in regulations. Under the Obama administration, there was so many rules and regulations Laura that companies are sitting on cash. Not only were they handcuffed with all of the regulations and the red tape that they had to go through to actually move forward, they were wondering what's around the corner, what other regulation is going to hit me. So, as a result, they were uncertain. They sat on cash. As soon as the President came in, lower taxes, rolled back regulations opened up the spigots in terms of the energy markets.

One percent of them pay for it. Ballmer told me that cost Microsoft $10 billion in profits a year. The Chinese have been stealing from the West, stealing from America, intellectual property for decades. Everybody knows that very few people have even thought to push back on China. This President is the first President to actually push back on China and keep his boot on the neck of President Xi Jinping. And that is why you're seeing this fight over tariffs. Yes, there is a debate about tariffs in terms of other countries, in terms of what we're doing and how he's generating the growth. Even though, we are seeing the tariffs, but at the end of the day, he's taking in billions of dollars in tariff revenue."

As a result of that the Chinese actually believed probably watching CNN, the Chinese actually believed well I might be done with this guy in two years. So, they're trying to now over the last couple of months, they're realizing we'll wait, maybe not. I might have to deal with him for another six years. It could be that they'll wait it out. We'll see that. That economy is getting hit and it's getting hit hard. Auto sales down in the double-digits. You're really seeing an impact to the economy. And if the President goes one step further and actually does the tariffs on the remaining $350 billion of products coming in from China that's going to hurt bad.

      "utterance": "You look at the Democrats today, they never look like they're in a good mood. They're always complaining about something and never want to work with President Trump on any issue. But Trump, he is going to spend the next year plus, he's going to go town to town speaking about the American renewal that his policies have helped spark. Now, sure he's going to hit the Democratic field really hard too. But I think this campaign is mostly going between two competing visions of America, one fairly dark, and one, let's keep the good times going. So do you really trust Biden or Warren or Harris to spend your money and set your family's priorities? When Americans are at each other's throats, Democrats are happiest because that is when Americans, they hope, will want government to step in and decide everything for us, protect us from each other. Radical thinking Saul Alinsky understood this. His tenth rule in the \"Rules for Radicals,\" \"The major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.\" Today's Antifa thugs who maraud the streets looking for people to smash over the head are angry Alinskyites, hoping to provoke violent conflict and even a civil war. Revolutionaries in their minds, these mass morons think that stoking violent street conflict will result in a more just society. But of course, it would result in less freedom, more poverty, with maybe a small coterie of rich people running the whole show. Read your history, kids. That's always the way it works out. And smile every now and then. And that's “The Angle.” And next up Alex Acosta caves to the liberal mob, and Mueller's date in front of Congress is now postponed. But why? Ken Starr is here on both."

      "utterance": "I have seen coverage of this case that is over 12 years old that has input and vetting at multiple levels of the Department of Justice. And as I look forward, I do not think it is right and fair for this administration's Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Labor Secretary Alex Acosta bowed to the liberal mob today. He'll be stepping from his post next week. Democrats blasted him over a secret plea deal that he cut with alleged child molester Jeff Epstein's legal team. And that was done while he was serving as U.S. attorney in Miami during the Bush administration of course over a decade ago. Acosta said it was the best deal he could strike given the circumstances, the evidence, and the state prosecuting attorney's desire to let this ride. So should he have resigned at all? Why did he resign? Joining us now is someone who represented Epstein years ago, former Whitewater independent counsel and Fox News contributor Ken Starr. Ken, was a plea deal really Acosta's best play in this circumstance? He said that Barry Krischer, the state prosecuting attorney, was not inclined to pursue the case against Epstein because, for a variety of reasons, some of which we just aren't privy too. What are your thoughts tonight?"

      "speaker": "KEN STARR, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, there is a real irony here. And by the way, Alex Acosta I believe is a person of complete integrity. He's an honorable guy. He took one for the team obviously today. But yes, I was involved in those negotiations. And it was Alex Acosta and the U.S. Attorney's Office who were playing tough. They were insisting on some conditions with respect to the plea agreement with Jeffery Epstein. And we were arguing, and I personally argued before U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta and then higher-ups in the Justice Department that what was alleged in Palm Beach County and what was under investigation by the county, were quintessentially state offenses, not federal offenses. So Laura, you understand this. I was making a federalism argument. Don't federally criminalize this area of the law that really does belong to the states. It's a quintessential state offense with respect to sexual wrongdoing. But Alex ended up disagreeing with that. And so here is the irony. He was pushing for a harder kind of disposition, a tougher disposition, and we ultimately came to an agreement that everyone was satisfied with, but obviously what has since happened has happened."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ken, but now we learn of course that there's allegations of trafficking people across state front. That would indicate at this point with, apparently what the allegations are, that this is now of course a federally triggered case because of the crossing state lines, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "That would be correct, Laura. But there were no allegations of crossing state lines in the Florida situation. So you're right. These are accusations. These are serious accusations, obviously. Every human being is entitled to basic human dignity, and so we will see what happens. But you're absolutely right, Laura. There was no suggestion of human trafficking, nonconsensual use of drugs and the like in the Florida case, or the state's attorney in Palm Beach County would have taken a very different look at the entire situation."

      "utterance": "How much push back pressure was brought to bear on that U.S. attorney's office from people connected to Epstein and his attorney, very were high-powered, high-priced attorneys, when this case was before that U.S. attorney, Alex Acosta? JULIE BROWN, \"MIAMI HERALD\" REPORTER: I think that they were pretty bowled over, quite frankly, by these big attorneys, Kenneth Starr, Alan Dershowitz, Jay Lefkowitz. These were big name attorneys."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I happen to know all three of you. I have known Jay Lefkowitz for 25 years. I've know you for about the same length of time, Ken. So that is just about the most high-powered team I can think of. So how did you get involved in the case initially?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Well, our firm was retained by Jeffery Epstein as part of the defense team. And I was brought in specifically to argue these constitution federalism points. But the idea that anybody was bowled over is absolute nonsense. No one was bowled over. I was in these meetings. They listened respectfully. But the pushback came from the United States Attorney's Office. And then at main justice when the matter was reviewed at our request, I heard things such as you're making compelling arguments, but we're going to defer to the position of the U.S. attorney which is there is a federal interest here. So I just respectfully but firmly disagree with these kinds of accusations."

That is what is going on, and that's what happens in Washington. Ken, really quickly, Mueller is testifying now, but they're moving it back to I guess the 26th or so, 24th?"

      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Well, of course we don't know. But my speculation, Laura, is that there were a lot of House Democrats in particular who said hey, me too, so to speak, I want to be able to question Robert Mueller. And so I think that's the dynamic, the internal dynamic."

Ken, we're out of time, but thank you so much for joining us tonight. We really appreciate your perspective in getting what was all happening. We have a Fox News alert. Tropical storm Barry is bearing down on Louisiana tonight. Fox meteorologist Adam Klotz is standing by with a new forecast and track, next."

That storm could very well reach hurricane stage before making landfall tomorrow morning on the state's Gulf coast. Fox meteorologist Adam Klotz is in the Weather Center with a look at what to expect from Barry tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAM KLOTZ, METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Hey there, Laura. Yes, you're right, this could be a hurricane by the time this makes landfall tomorrow morning. It's going to be very close. We have been back and forth on this. Currently we're looking at winds maybe getting up to 70 miles an hour, which would make it a very strong tropical storm. At 74 miles an hour it becomes a hurricane. But that's not going to matter. The story of this is really going to be the rain that it brings, all of the moisture. We have got hurricane watches and warnings that a lot of this is going to be due to some of the flooding that we're going to see all associated with this system. Early bands of rain have already begun to batter the coast of Louisiana, stretching all the way over to portions of the Florida Panhandle. The heaviest rain really highlighting in a spot along the Louisiana coast, and then up into Mississippi as this entire system makes landfall and then runs farther north. This is going to be a widespread flooding event. And it's not just the rainfall that's going to case the problems. We also have an issue with possible storm surge, especially in low lying areas, anywhere from three to six feet of flooding right along the coast as this runs up on the coast. This is going to be a mess. And Laura, it's not just today. I'm afraid this is going to linger into Sunday and even Monday as the system tracks to the north."

Our prayers with all of the people of the Gulf Coast affected by the storm overnight and throughout the weekend. Stay with Fox throughout the evening for continuous live updates as we track Barry.
