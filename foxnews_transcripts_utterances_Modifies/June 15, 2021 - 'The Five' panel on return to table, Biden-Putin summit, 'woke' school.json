And now you get to sit next to your best friend to the cafeteria, it's a brand-new day. But it's weird to see all of us in person again and up so close, it's like a class and advanced dermatology. Jesse's hair is as big and as shiny as ever. It's more than a hair. It's a safety device. It's not as thick as it was 15 months ago. Why do you -- it's fact. Jesse is getting old, he's losing it.",

I have no idea what he said, Richard, and that did not strike me as someone that's in command of the issues. They were asking what the goals are going into this meeting, he said he's not going to negotiate in front of the press but he did that yesterday. Putin floated the idea of the cyber- criminal swap and he said oh, yes, I'm open to it. And then the White House had to walk it bac. So, he seems confused to me. I don't think he's going to do well one on one with Vladimir Putin, he is going to probably do a lot of listening and he's probably going to be reading off a lot of script and then they are going to release a readout that says we challenged him here, they disagreed here, and the media is going to make him out to be Rambo. But that's not really the point. The point is you have to do something to Vladimir Putin to kind of snap him to attention and right now he hasn't done anything, he's let the pipeline go, he's trying to get back into the Iran nuke deal and he hasn't really -- he's basically surrendered on the cyber war.

I mean, I don't like -- I think that we just have to presume. Of course, we know where it's coming from. We know that he doesn't tell the truth. We know what he does to journalists in his own country. And he's down on this propaganda tour all around basically saying I am bigger and better than Biden. And I do seriously wonder why the White House called this a summit because a summit indicates that it's grand and it's big, where I said I think that they should've said, we are going to get coffee with Putin when we're over there in Brussels, that will be -- or in Geneva, we're going to stop by and have a couple -- cups of espresso and that's it.

The last thing I would say is, I think if you're going to have a summit, you have to have a press conference. If you are the leader of the free world then you have to have the other leader even if he is reluctant to stand next to you or maybe if you are concerned how you will look standing next to him, I still think that you have to do it in order to show that the media matters."

And he laughed like Kamala Harris and then he started to answer and then he paused for 10 seconds and then he restarted his answer was something completely unintelligible. I have no idea what he said, Richard, and that did not strike me as someone that's in command of the issues. They were asking what the goals are going into this meeting, he said he's not going to negotiate in front of the press but he did that yesterday. Putin floated the idea of the cyber- criminal swap and he said oh, yes, I'm open to it. And then the White House had to walk it bac. So, he seems confused to me. I don't think he's going to do well one on one with Vladimir Putin, he is going to probably do a lot of listening and he's probably going to be reading off a lot of script and then they are going to release a readout that says we challenged him here, they disagreed here, and the media is going to make him out to be Rambo. But that's not really the point. The point is you have to do something to Vladimir Putin to kind of snap him to attention and right now he hasn't done anything, he's let the pipeline go, he's trying to get back into the Iran nuke deal and he hasn't really -- he's basically surrendered on the cyber war. So, to Dana's point, almost every major summit you have with a Russian leader, you hold a joint news conference right afterwards. By holding a solo news conference that doesn't signal strength to me."

But I think what's on the table for the Biden White House is the fact that Putin is sort of in a quagmire in Syria, right? He sort of, broke Syria and now he has to pay for it and guess what, he doesn't have any money, right? So, the United States is walking in with look, you want us to help you in Syria? We want all of these things in return. And you want to be this great leader that says you can prop up countries and you can't, and we're the only person that can help you here."

So, we're handing power and riches to Putin. And secondly, I understand why you don't get on that stage and do a joint press conference because Biden is the classic weakling. You talk tough away from the great goon, but then you don't have the gumption to stand on the stage and say, hey, this guy is a killer. He's a malign actor. He's evil, and he uses KGB tactics and methods to destroy his enemies. He's an enemy of us. Biden would never do that. So, he looks like less of a coward not having to stand on the stage with Putin."

I mean, the guy had to pull over and deal with mobsters, so I think he understands that mindset. And right now Joe seems shakier than at IKEA, you know, box-spring on a honeymoon. I think that what's missing in this whole thing is the America First-like card. And I think that's what Putin -- like, these people, that's all they understand because their country comes first. And so, I think when Trump is missing, and you have Biden there, it's more like what happened to the America first. And I think Putin use a very valid little strategy with the boy who cried wolf response when they were talking about what are you responsible? Of course, they're responsible for the -- for these hacks. But he's saying, look, you know, you guys are constantly accusing us of stuff, right? So, the Democrats and the media open that whole, you know, accusing the Russians of years and years of -- years of infiltrating our election system, which as you know is impossible. Our election system is unhackable and impervious. So, like, you know -- he's like, why do you go so -- you blame me for everything. Do you expect me to take this seriously? So, that was kind of the -- he was the boy who cried wolf on us, which was good. I'm rooting for Joe though as you know because I want him to do well. But I do think that Dana is correct.

But Wednesday is mercury and Mercury is the god of finance, so that's evil. So, we got to change all those names. This hyper -- kind of hypersensitivity is being marshaled to tear down this country. And I know that sounds farfetched, but if you get really deep into it, it's about recreating America as oppressor versus oppressed, and it's -- and like, every revolution that is successful, it's being -- it's being controlled and created by a very tiny minority.

I think that people like the parents that we just saw are part of a new grassroots movement that is like the Tea Party. They just don't quite know it yet. And the reason why, as you think about ObamaCare, you might not have been able to say to like a person walking down the street, what is it -- what is it about ObamaCare and all the complexities that make you upset about? They just knew that it just didn't feel right. And that is what you're starting to see with critical race theory and other types of things like this with the school boards. People can't -- they can't exactly tell you exactly what's going on but they know that it's not the direction that they want to go. So, I do think you'll see a lot more parents at the school board meetings are possibly even running for office because the Democrats are now even being warned by their strategists.

No. New Jersey parents don't get offended. They offend other people. This is -- we're talking about New Jersey here, right?
