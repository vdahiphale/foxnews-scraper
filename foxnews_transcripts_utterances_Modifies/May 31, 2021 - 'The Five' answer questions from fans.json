We are not allowed to have a cookout until the Fourth of July when we get the green light or red light from the president of United States. So I even think this is bad even to discuss hypothetically. Let's say this is next year and President Biden gave us permission. I would just like a turkey burger. But I would like it to a point where it's unfrozen. That means I have to buy it this year, when I take up the previous year it is so -- it's like a piece of ice from glacier covering a woolly mammoth. And I just can't separate the two.

It's Memorial Day, the unofficial kickoff to summer and after making it more -- through more than a year of COVID restrictions, it's also a holiday where crowds are back in full force. Americans hitting the road, soaking up the sun and getting together for barbecue once again. Today, it would not be complete without honoring and remembering the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for our country and freedom. We salute all of our military heroes. And we have a fun filled show in store for you. We're answering your fun meal questions for the entire hour. And we got some good ones. So let's get going. OK, Facebook question from Hailey L. What's your favorite summer barbecue food? I have to start with Jesse Watters who is the host of Jesse's feeding frenzy, to find out."

You have either that or a brilliant metabolism which will be the whole -- another hour special for Geraldo and Fox Nation. Number two, what do you think in Jesse? That's bad for the environment having meat, you know that. And I will add this. Dagen, I think you agree with me. We are not allowed to have a cookout until the Fourth of July when we get the green light or red light from the president of United States. So I even think this is bad even to discuss hypothetically. Let's say this is next year and President Biden gave us permission. I would just like a turkey burger. But I would like it to a point where it's unfrozen. That means I have to buy it this year, when I take up the previous year it is so -- it's like a piece of ice from glacier covering a woolly mammoth. And I just can't separate the two. So, I'd like turkey burger, it's frozen, but this year. That's what I like to grow."

On the top bank with strangers, not a great combination. I would add this. I did go to soccer camp. So, it was like you play soccer for 16 hours a day in 110 temperature and you would get water once a day, which didn't make any sense. I thought they were building character, instead ourselves were being starved mitochondria is never the same after a summer camp of just soccer. But I would actually add, too, when it comes to the camp, I just don't think it's a good thing. I mean, what does it say about your family? You go to school all day. You have extracurricular activities. They find --"

So, and the guide that was in charge of my summer wreck was Mr. Baldwin, the father of Alec Baldwin, Billy Baldwin, Stephen Baldwin, and Daniel Baldwin, and he was a big guy, offensive lineman type guy. We've competed in softball against other schools. Great personality. Wonderful leader. Tough guy and a historian. So that was my experience with the Baldwin's first, second, third, and fourth grade.

Actually, Jesse, you, too, from Long Island. There was a beach pass you could take your bike. And that was in high school. You go down with everything you need your essentials to spend the whole day there. Until my bike got stolen at the end of the day and that kind of tore it for me.

The president said democracy is in peril in the U.S. and around the world. He said the soul of America is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts and our better angels. Democrats and the Texas legislature have walked out of the House chamber to try to block a controversial election reform bill. But the Republican governor said he will call a special session to try to pass the legislation. An increasing number of American citizens have been apprehended as they have tried to smuggle illegal drugs into the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Tonight at 6 Eastern, we will have exclusive evidence showing the magnitude of the growing criminal element along the out-of-control southern border. I'm Mike Emanuel in Washington.

And now, I realized that is probably a very boring thing to do. The most -- the dream I remember most recently was I dream that -- I won't say who it was but someone pretty senior in the federal government, but at the most senior, resigned. I had this dream. And then the next day, I was going on my business and in my head, I actually thought this person had resigned and I had to fact check it."

And that is the Beach Boys who are timeless. And of course, they're still playing a little bit louder than I thought I would be. I feel like I have to speak over them, which I find a little disconcerting. But I will say this. It takes some time to think about people that have served before the many wars, most of which are World War One Geraldo has covered up close and personal, and I'm not even sure about that one."

My parents, my mother -- my mother, in particular, like, when she was diagnosed with cancer, and you know, she passed away about a year and a half ago, like everything was out there. Wow. And it was always like that, for the most part. But literally, we -- every -- I held nothing back. There are a couple of things I told her. She was like, maybe you could have kept that one to yourself. Maybe I didn't need to hear that one. But -- and my dad too. Like we -- there -- we share everything.

But I've got -- also, we don't live close together, so it's like, you know, chit-chat on the phone. I don't tell them anything. Anyway, this feels like therapy to me. Also, I think that by being on THE FIVE for the last nearly 10 years, everyone, including my parents, was everything about me. And there's like, there's nothing left to find out."

And I can't say on the show A couple of the things that have happened, but they are so embarrassing. The next time you see him, you have to have him tell the story.

I also listen to Howard Stern unless he's complaining about masks and other people not wearing masks. He's taking the pandemic terribly. I find it wearing but he's always endlessly entertaining. I also listen to all sports radio and a lot of podcasts now. Now that I could fully understand how to connect my iPhone to my -- to my radio, I've never had so much control in my life.

It was just (INAUDIBLE) and you just stood up, strap yourself in, and they would swing you around and go up and down and about. But I have to say, something has happened as I got older, I as I understand it. Your inner ear balance changes and so you feel like all woozy when you get off a ride. So, I gave it up after I went on this crazy ride at a like a funfair in California in like, 1999. I felt like my brain was rattled all over my head. So, I gave it up but I did love it.
