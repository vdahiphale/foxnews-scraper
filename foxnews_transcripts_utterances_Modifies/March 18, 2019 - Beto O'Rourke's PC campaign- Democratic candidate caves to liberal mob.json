You want pathetic? Here's pathetic. He felt he had to apologize over a sick joke he made about his wife. Now before we play this joke, you might want to scoot the kids out of the room.",

They're eye blinking controls the robots taking your orders. So, if people who are paralyzed have a desire to work, that's what makes me wonder about how can people not work.

I came across this crazy experiment in Japan. So I'm for these experiments. I think we should try stuff out. There's a restaurant in Japan where the waiters are all robots because that's where it's gonna go, but they're controlled by paralyzed humans at a distant facility. They're eye blinking controls the robots taking your orders. So, if people who are paralyzed have a desire to work, that's what makes me wonder about how can people not work. If you can find jobs for paralyzed humans, universal basic income should be tied to some kind of work at home.  I think it would be better for both of them, for both the community and the workers, so they have something to contribute. If paralyzed people can get jobs, anybody can get jobs."

Everybody is fleeing and yet that state decided to raise taxes individually at the state level and for businesses. So sure, this idea too, on top of that, give free and come to people makes a lot of sense. That state is ridiculous. And I think it would behoove it instead to conduct an audit to shave spending, to then save and be able to meet their fiduciary obligations and incentivize businesses to grow in that state so they wouldn't have to shell out free money that doesn't work anyway. And my last point is that we have twice as many millionaires in this country as Finland even has residents. So for people to make the comparisons of like, oh, that experiment, you know, whatever.
