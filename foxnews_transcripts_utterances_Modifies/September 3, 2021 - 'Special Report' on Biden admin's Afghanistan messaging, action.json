But we, too, because there's no question, notwithstanding all the sweet talk from some of the Taliban leaders, that's not who they are. They are a radical Islamist terrorist group, and they're going to welcome other radical Islamist terrorist groups to Afghanistan who will aim to strike us from there as Al-Qaeda did on 9/11.

Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Bill McGurn, columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal.\"  Bill, let me start with you. Your thought? \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a really scathing editorial today about this situation, but a lot of lawmakers up on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle have been very critical of this administration messaging and action. BILL MCGURN, COLUMNIST, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Yes, I think it's not just the messaging. It's the reality. We've just surrendered 9/11 forever to the Islamic jihadists. It is now a double victory celebration for them.  First, the original Al-Qaeda strike on America, and second the Taliban victory that we see right now in Kabul. It just seems to me we are back to that pre-9/11 thinking. Remember when people used to say Al-Qaeda was at war with us long before we were at war with Al-Qaeda. And I think Joe Biden's spin that somehow the world watches the spectacle of us leaving fellow Americans behind enemy lines and concludes that America has greater resolve and greater capabilities going forward is just farcical.",

      "sentences": "Well, if we just look at what is happening with the Taliban, Bret, I think I mentioned on your podcast, the problem here is not only are they an uneducated group of men that run the Taliban, but the Taliban is used to running a terrorist organization, and running a country is very different. They could be without food in a couple of weeks. They don't have air traffic control. They have people landing right now as we speak from Qatar to try and handle that so that they can open commercial airways in two days, and hopefully more people, including those Afghans that assisted us here in the United States and abroad, can get out.  Look, left and right, I have said it before, we should have started this earlier. We should not leave until everyone that we can help is out, is out. But we also do have to look at other realities. The State Department since April gave numerous warnings, over a dozen warnings to Americans to get out.   In addition to that, everyone knew the Taliban was going to be in power, quite frankly. And I think it's the United States and all of our allies, especially the United States knew. The former administration, former Secretary of State Pompeo sat down with the Taliban, not with the president of Afghanistan. They knew who was going to be the new sheriff in town, sadly. So, it's messy right now. I certainly hope and pray that won't be the case going forward. And one last thing. Even though we can't trust them, Bret, no question, they need money from us and from others. And if we say we want a and then you get b, they might be apt to do it.",

What about the who knew what when, and this leaked Reuters report, the transcript from this call between President Biden and the Afghan president Ghani? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  Yes, we impeached a president for a phone call, and now we have this leak of phone call that President Biden had where he asked someone to lie in exchange for military support. It sounds like something that last year would have caused major problems for the previous president.  I think we cannot lose sight of how we can never fight a war like this ever again. There was a Pew poll last week that showed that Americans are broadly supportive of the departure from Afghanistan. That's the Trump policy that Biden supported. They have even more agreement that the manner in which we fought this war was a failure. You don't see people talking about World War II the way we talk about this war. This war has been prosecuted poorly, according to the American people, for decades.  And then there is even more agreement that the manner in which Biden departed was a complete debacle. That's not really up for debate. It was a debacle. It was a national humiliation and a disgrace. And the proper response to that is to clean out our military like we did after Bay of Pigs and make sure that people are replaced with people who know how to do their jobs. Unfortunately, the current president who was involved in this phone call is incompetent and unable to replace the military leadership who failed. And so it remains to the American people in their elections to replace him and the woke generals who cannot do basic jobs like winning wars or exiting a country.",

Speaking of rape, a rapist could actually sue their victim and get $10,000 if they feel that individual is trying to abort that child outside the six- week limit.   And to Bill's point, you know, the American people are not looking for a six-week limit on abortion. When you look at the majority of polls out there, the majority of people in the United States support Roe v Wade, and even if they call themselves pro-life, support a woman's right to choose.

And so it is incumbent upon the court to correct mistakes like that, like they did after the Dred Scott decision or Korematsu or Roe v. Wade. And they have an excellent opportunity with this case that has risen to the Supreme Court level this year with Dobbs to correct some of these problems. We have a radical abortion regime.
