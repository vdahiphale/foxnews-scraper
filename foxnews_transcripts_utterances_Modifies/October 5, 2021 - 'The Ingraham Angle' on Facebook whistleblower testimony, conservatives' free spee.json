      "sentences": "They love saying the children. Well, let's begin with one basic fact. The Left doesn't care if the culture or big business spreads content that's not appropriate for children, they never have. They literally do not care. In fact, for decades, liberals have defended even celebrated cultural and political forces that harm children. Porn, drugs, gambling, gender bending, school shutdowns, mask mandates, and of course, their holy grail of abortion. Democrats support all of it. Now some on the Left would prefer if we didn't even have children. A New York Magazine columnist named Emily Holloman (ph), recently called the decision to have children an essentially selfish one done for fulfillment or self-betterment or boredom or peer pressure. We should pray for her because she knows not what she says. But the point is, after all they've done to damage our children and steal their innocence. We're supposed to trust them on the Facebook and Instagram issue. Color me (ph) skeptical. We've known for many years that parents should keep their kids off smartphones for as long as possible. We need to put our own phones down, myself included and do the hard job of parenting in this very messed up world. Conservative parents have led the charge on these issues for as long as I can remember. But now suddenly, people like Far Left Senator Ed Markey agrees with staunch Republican Marsha Blackburn. And we're supposed to think that he's trustworthy. Not so fast. The fact is Republicans may be walking straight into a trap. The Left's real beef with Facebook has nothing to do with the children. The kids are on TikTok, aren't they? The Left doesn't like Facebook, because Facebook has refused to suppress all conservative speech. That's it. The Left has decided to drive conservatives off of the Internet, and they're afraid Facebook won't be sufficiently loyal to their plans. They actually got away with banning the former president of the United States. And that's not enough power for the Democrats. They're that afraid of voters and free speech. Think about that for a minute. Now this is why globalist don't mind China being in-charge frankly, because if they could, some of these really hardlined Democrats would ban all dissenting opinions on social media. And just like China, they probably call it something like a threat to the social order or a threat to security or threat to overall community or harmony. Now this all makes sense if your goal is to maintain power by any means necessary, and let's face it, that's all they care about. Facebook could promote live sex acts and how to hunt a Christian instructionals. And the Left would take their side, but because there's still some conservatives on Facebook, some conservatives, the Left wants to shut it down. Democrats have seized upon the current Facebook scandal as an opportunity to silence conservatives for good.",

It would be directed broadly across all media and online platforms, but cloaked in terms again, of protecting national security, or their new favorite preventing domestic terrorism. They would pack the courts to approve that legislation and your freedom of speech or freedom that generations of Americans have fought to preserve would be gone. That's the real goal. A land where we're silenced, and theirs are the only voices heard. But they're willing to get their - they'd take a little bit of time to get there. So, they'll use the bipartisan dust kicked up by one whistleblower as another nudge toward government control of political speech. Although they dispute the whistleblower's claims, Facebook responded by inviting government regulation, saying we need to create standard rules for the Internet, it's time for Congress to act. Kind of makes perfect sense. Remember, Zuckerberg himself was heavily and personally coordinating with liberal activists and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into local election offices in places like Pennsylvania. And after Zuckerberg was mercilessly scorned by the Left for not silencing Trump in 2016, he kind of tried to make it up to his political comrades by keeping Trump's reach limited. Prediction, this is not going to end well for conservatives who want to challenge the Left. Now how do I know this? Look who's licking their chops at the prospect of Facebook regulation.",

The only ones guilty of intimidation here are sitting behind the big desks at the DOJ. Just thank God that Mitch McConnell and thank God for him that Merrick Garland isn't sitting on the Supreme Court today. And by the way, we just learned tonight that the Defense Department is about to turn the screws on its own ranks, subjecting them to continuous vetting, supposedly to stop extremists within the military and other insider threats. And this will include surveillance of social media postings for starters. We warned you last year that the Left has changed since the days of Clinton and Obama as the pain of their policy sinks in. They've just given up altogether trying to win rhetorically, the voters over, they're not going to do that kind of do that anymore. It's impossible. So, in their desperation, they now believe forced compliance is the only way to go. And the silencing of conservatives is the only way forward. God help any Republican who would assist them.

If anything, we ought to be investigating Zuckerberg for the $350 million that he invested into so-called nonprofit groups that got involved in our election.

Mark Zuckerberg as Devin Nunes was talking about, the financing of elections. He pretty well took over the election system in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and had a great deal of influence in four or five other Democrat counties. So, he obviously is not to try and support free speech. I do agree that he's primarily about making money. And he's craven in terms of how he's willing to do it. But that starts with problem control. And quite honestly, the best pushback is going to be the free market solutions, the competitors to Facebook, but I've never felt there's really a legislative solution because the Democrats like the status quo.

      "utterance": "They love saying the children. Well, let's begin with one basic fact. The Left doesn't care if the culture or big business spreads content that's not appropriate for children, they never have. They literally do not care. In fact, for decades, liberals have defended even celebrated cultural and political forces that harm children. Porn, drugs, gambling, gender bending, school shutdowns, mask mandates, and of course, their holy grail of abortion. Democrats support all of it. Now some on the Left would prefer if we didn't even have children. A New York Magazine columnist named Emily Holloman (ph), recently called the decision to have children an essentially selfish one done for fulfillment or self-betterment or boredom or peer pressure. We should pray for her because she knows not what she says. But the point is, after all they've done to damage our children and steal their innocence. We're supposed to trust them on the Facebook and Instagram issue. Color me (ph) skeptical. We've known for many years that parents should keep their kids off smartphones for as long as possible. We need to put our own phones down, myself included and do the hard job of parenting in this very messed up world. Conservative parents have led the charge on these issues for as long as I can remember. But now suddenly, people like Far Left Senator Ed Markey agrees with staunch Republican Marsha Blackburn. And we're supposed to think that he's trustworthy. Not so fast. The fact is Republicans may be walking straight into a trap. The Left's real beef with Facebook has nothing to do with the children. The kids are on TikTok, aren't they? The Left doesn't like Facebook, because Facebook has refused to suppress all conservative speech. That's it. The Left has decided to drive conservatives off of the Internet, and they're afraid Facebook won't be sufficiently loyal to their plans. They actually got away with banning the former president of the United States. And that's not enough power for the Democrats. They're that afraid of voters and free speech. Think about that for a minute. Now this is why globalist don't mind China being in-charge frankly, because if they could, some of these really hardlined Democrats would ban all dissenting opinions on social media. And just like China, they probably call it something like a threat to the social order or a threat to security or threat to overall community or harmony. Now this all makes sense if your goal is to maintain power by any means necessary, and let's face it, that's all they care about. Facebook could promote live sex acts and how to hunt a Christian instructionals. And the Left would take their side, but because there's still some conservatives on Facebook, some conservatives, the Left wants to shut it down. Democrats have seized upon the current Facebook scandal as an opportunity to silence conservatives for good."

It would be directed broadly across all media and online platforms, but cloaked in terms again, of protecting national security, or their new favorite preventing domestic terrorism. They would pack the courts to approve that legislation and your freedom of speech or freedom that generations of Americans have fought to preserve would be gone. That's the real goal. A land where we're silenced, and theirs are the only voices heard. But they're willing to get their - they'd take a little bit of time to get there. So, they'll use the bipartisan dust kicked up by one whistleblower as another nudge toward government control of political speech. Although they dispute the whistleblower's claims, Facebook responded by inviting government regulation, saying we need to create standard rules for the Internet, it's time for Congress to act. Kind of makes perfect sense. Remember, Zuckerberg himself was heavily and personally coordinating with liberal activists and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into local election offices in places like Pennsylvania. And after Zuckerberg was mercilessly scorned by the Left for not silencing Trump in 2016, he kind of tried to make it up to his political comrades by keeping Trump's reach limited. Prediction, this is not going to end well for conservatives who want to challenge the Left. Now how do I know this? Look who's licking their chops at the prospect of Facebook regulation."

Just look what the Biden's Justice Department is already doing to intimidate parents. We talked about this last night from attending school board meetings and expressing their outrage at the propaganda being taught in public schools. Remember, when Biden told us that the Justice Department would be independent, what a joke that is. These days the DOJ is just another branch of the DNC. Because the liberal weaklings at the National School Board Association don't want to face criticism for their horrible policies. They're calling on the DOJ to criminalize their political opposition.

The FBI exists to investigate whether parents getting mad at a school board meeting rises to the level of intimidation or harassment. That's now a federal matter. Think about all the threats facing America from transnational criminal syndicates, CCP cybercrimes, and open borders and the FBI has time to zero in on what like a 45 year old mom complaining about her son's sophomore English reading list. The only ones guilty of intimidation here are sitting behind the big desks at the DOJ. Just thank God that Mitch McConnell and thank God for him that Merrick Garland isn't sitting on the Supreme Court today. And by the way, we just learned tonight that the Defense Department is about to turn the screws on its own ranks, subjecting them to continuous vetting, supposedly to stop extremists within the military and other insider threats. And this will include surveillance of social media postings for starters. We warned you last year that the Left has changed since the days of Clinton and Obama as the pain of their policy sinks in. They've just given up altogether trying to win rhetorically, the voters over, they're not going to do that kind of do that anymore. It's impossible. So, in their desperation, they now believe forced compliance is the only way to go. And the silencing of conservatives is the only way forward. God help any Republican who would assist them. And that's the angle. Joining me now Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson and California Congressman Devin Nunes. Congressman Nunes, let's start with you, what we're seeing right now, do you see a possible bait and switch being pulled on the Republicans here?"

But the big Boogeyman here that nobody's talking about is TikTok, TikTok is where all the kids are, all the little kids and there's no regulation there. So, I think Republicans should be very careful here. If anything, we ought to be investigating Zuckerberg for the $350 million that he invested into so-called nonprofit groups that got involved in our election. And I think that's where the focus should be. That's what every single member of Congress should be asking on an everyday basis, not fall into some trap of figuring out some scam where we're going to have a bureaucracy of people that are going to just do good things, which is i.e., means going to censor conservatives."

The Left by and large likes media and social media as they are, what they're trying to do is stomp out the last little tidbit of conservative thought that says sneaking through Facebook, and so, we shouldn't fall for it. Mark Zuckerberg as Devin Nunes was talking about, the financing of elections. He pretty well took over the election system in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and had a great deal of influence in four or five other Democrat counties. So, he obviously is not to try and support free speech. I do agree that he's primarily about making money. And he's craven in terms of how he's willing to do it. But that starts with problem control. And quite honestly, the best pushback is going to be the free market solutions, the competitors to Facebook, but I've never felt there's really a legislative solution because the Democrats like the status quo. They're not going to cooperate with Republicans to really rein in the social media companies because I've never - what liberal misinformation has ever been labeled misinformation by Facebook."

That's why we've advocated for updated Internet regs, for several years now. I've written op eds outlining the areas of regulation, we think are most important, related to elections, harmful content, privacy and competition. Congressman Nunes, does he actually think there's going to be a law written about what you can post regarding an election. Is that what he's getting at."

Number two, of course, Biden in his regime would love to write the rules. And of course, Zuckerberg would welcome it, because if you have the Attorney General Merrick Garland, drafting the rules, it's got to be perfect for Zuckerberg and Twitter and Google and all of them.

      "utterance": "Well, that was Joe Biden desperately pitching this multi-trillion dollar boondoggle to unions in Michigan today. But of course, the truth is, few have done more to facilitate America's decline than Joe Biden himself. Remember, he voted to normalize trade relations with China and he supported its entry into the WTO. That costs us millions of jobs. For some Republicans, a lot of them supported it too. But now Joe wants to cause more misery for all working Americans by taxing and spending our economy into oblivion. What's even more worrisome is that Manchin seems to be cracking. We've predicted this. I knew it would happen. Today, he opened the door to $2.2 trillion in spending. What happened at 1.5? Joining me now, Newt Gingrich, Fox News Contributor, former Speaker of the House, also the author of the upcoming book, Beyond Biden, Rebuilding the America We Love. Newt, I always knew Manchin was going to be a soft touch here. I mean, they showed up on those kayaks around his yacht, and he just completely melted. Is there any room for - is there any room for hope here that this will blow up?"

Depending on how they design the bill, can they really get what the Left wants at 2.2 billion or whatever it is? I recently wrote a newsletter and said, there are no moderates here. There's a choice between the timid big government socialists and the bold big government socialists, and then Manchin turns right around and proves what I was saying. There's no reason for him to be for $2.2 trillion. I think. I saw a number this morning, that Joe Biden is at 18 percent approval in West Virginia. That means that the people that Manchin represents have like a five to one opposition."

We're now in a period where every time you turn around, businesses will tell they can't find workers. We have a huge logjam of shipments coming into the U.S. because they aren't enough truck drivers. So in the middle of this labor shortage, what Joe Biden wants to do is go out and another 1.6 million, assuming that is the right number, whatever his staff told him, another 1.6 million and put them on a government payroll doing something when they are not in the private sector doing jobs that already exist. This is just one more example of the kind of madness that we are dealing with in an administration that can't control inflation, can't control inflation, can't produce energy. You watch, they're going to have a massive Christmas when all these toys and all that these people want are still stuck on ships sitting off the coast of California because they can't unload them.

He was tossed into the brig for demanding accountability from our failing military leaders. Tonight, we are happy to report he has been released after this show's focus and others on this story. Scheller is no longer in solitary confinement. Joining me now exclusively is Tony Buzbee, attorney for Colonel Scheller. Tony, where does the case stand right now?"

      "speaker": "TONY BUZBEE, ATTORNEY FOR LT. COL. STUART SCHELLER",
      "utterance": "Right now he's, of course, as you've said, been released. He is with his family. He faces a court-martial, and that might happen as early as next Friday. We're not sure. And we will have to have a hearing, and hopefully it will be a public hearing because I think it should be public. And he still remains subject to this gag order, which I would submit is illegal, and that's what put him in the brig in the first place. So I think it's important to remember why he went to the brig in the first place. He spoke out, as we saw, and he said that many service members, both former like myself and current service members believe, which was the withdrawal from Afghanistan was completely botched, and no one took accountability. You have the general staff, the high brass, basically trying to pass the buck. And so he spoke out. He offered to resign, as you know. They refused to let him resign honorably, even though he spent 17 years of his life in the marine corps as a marine corps infantry officer. Here's a guy now that has lost his command, his job, his health care, and his pension. We are talking about more than $2.5 million dollars of retirement that he is essentially going to have to walk away from him."

One thing when I spoke to him this afternoon he noted was that he was in the brig, of course, in a safe place, of course not with his family, but he is reminded that there are many military families who have it a lot worse than him, including the 13 families who suffered on that fateful day there in Afghanistan. So that's the reason he spoke out. His message still rings true, and he has done what a real marine does. And he hopes that somebody, somewhere within the military constabulary will take accountability. So far, he's the one who's been held accountable, and it's just not right."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    {
      "speaker": "BUZBEE",
      "utterance": "It's really funny when they talk about the uniform code of military justice. It's not very uniform. There's not a lot of justice involved. He was alone of course. I will say this -- a lot of the brig staff treated him very well, the other marines who were supposedly guarding him. He was considered to be a, quote, flight risk, which is ridiculous on its face."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUZBEE",
      "utterance": "Yes, and so this is the state of affairs as they are now. Once you hurt the general's feelings, of course, they are punitive, and that's where it is. Hopefully we can get this all behind us next Friday if there is a hearing next Friday. And I would also say this. He has been released awaiting this court-martial. The secretary of the Navy right now could release him from the Marine Corps without going through a court-martial and let him be honorably discharged and go about his business. He still loses his command. He still loses his job. He still loses his retirement. But at least he is returned to his family and goes about his business. And that's what should happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But Tony, do you believe they want to make an example out of him, given all the suppression of speech? And the military is different, you are subjected to different types of restrictions of what you can say, and even the parents acknowledged that last week with me. So he is under other restrictions. However, you get the sense that they are using him to tell the other troops don't even think about saying anything like this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUZBEE",
      "utterance": "That's certainly what it seems like, make an example. You speak, this is what happens to you. And look, this man is an honorable marine. He took responsibility for what he said. He offered to resign. But they wouldn't allow him to do that, and that's where we are now."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tony, I hope you will come back next week. Please give our best regards to Lieutenant Colonel Scheller. We wish him the very best and we hope that he comes back, he will come on the show as well. But Tony, thank you.

In order to stay enrolled, he says that UCLA forced him to sign kind of an Orwellian confession stating \"I certify that I have been informed of the risks of COVID-19 infection including long-term disability and death both for myself and others who I may expose the disease.\" I think it's \"whom\" I may expose to the disease, but it's just UCLA. I guess grammar, you can't say that anymore. Joining me now, Christian Walker, UCLA student, son of football legend Herschel Walker. Christian, good to see you tonight. First of all, you crack me up. Your video cracked me up. I just laughed out loud because it was just so dramatic. I loved it. They made you sign this confessional statement, it's kind of a waiver of liability. But what's going on out there?"

All of my classes are online, I don't step foot onto the campus, and they told me all of my already paid for classes would be dropped if I didn't disclose my vaccination status. I do all of my classes from my living room. I then received a message from the health center telling me that I would be subject to financial and other consequences if I didn't tell them, such is being reported to the student conduct office for disciplinary action. This makes no sense, and it's none of the university's business what my health decisions are since I'm not even going onto the campus."

They love the mandates, and even though most of them are vaccinated, they are also forced and encouraging everyone to wear a mask in class and while walking outside to different classes. It's complete derangement."

      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "I believe the rule is that you have to tell them your status, and if you have the vaccine you have to wear a mask. If you don't have it, you have to wear a mask and you also have to get COVID tested once per week. So I'm just praying I don't have to go deal with the on-campus drama since most of the students have very ill feelings towards me because I'm a conservative."
