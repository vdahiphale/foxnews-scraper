At the NATO summit, we've got a guy, Trump, revealing a hard truth. With the hearing, we got an FBI lovebird shielded by his white knight Democrats. So after all the mainstream media freak outs, maybe they should stop screaming and listen to the grown-up who might be onto something. I mean, I never knew about that pipeline and now I do. Again, Trump has dragged something out of Europe's backroom and put it on stage and he didn't give [bleep] that he might have violated some decorum. That's his job. He's our jerk.  The fact that he pissed off so many people should endear him to us. He's not interested in being TIME's man of the year, just the leader of Americans, so he left his summit with pockets full, about $40 billion. If it had been Hillary, all she would leave with is the silverware. True. Meanwhile - and while Obama may have been a lullaby, Trump is a wake-up call, a Sex Pistol in the land of Abba. It's true. It's true what the punk movement did to music in the 70s, Trump is now doing to politics. And if you missed that now, it's like you're still listening to Emerson, Lake and Palmer, which I do.  Let's welcome tonight's guests, shall we? He's so sharp he can't hold a balloon, \"Washington Times\" opinion editor wearing Sears sucker, Fox News contributor Charlie Hurt.

So, go to ggutfeld.com for the latest tour information. All right, still to come, is he unqualified or evil? Or both? Our potential next Supreme Court Justice. They are working up a sweat to find dirt on Brett. This week, President Trump nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh, that's his real name, to be the next Supreme Court Justice. He seems to be a decent guy. He coaches youth basketball. He feeds the homeless with actual food. Not like my uncle Steve. Anyway, but that doesn't fit the left's narrative. See, he must be a threat to earth's survival. So the media is out to find the skeletons and here's what they found. In his high school yearbook, he called himself the treasurer of the Keg City Club, 100 kegs or bust. He drinks beer, that's horrifying. That's not all. Your kids may need to leave the room for this one. According to \"The Washington Post,\" Kavanaugh got into serious debt on tickets to baseball games - Washington Nationals baseball games. This man is a monster.

But critics call the phrase sexist and racist. One professor says the word \"cowboy\" makes you picture a straight white male. I'd add a hot one, too. Anyway, the professor says really, for the past 20 years it's not been acceptable to use the generic male to pretend that includes females. Shut up. The school's spokesperson responded it's not gender specific. A cowboy is not what you are, but who you are. Anyway, here is video proof the world needs more cowboys. Rest in peace.

Straight white guys weren't jumping in for that.

He will demand cash to your face. Germany's tab isn't paid on NATO, which was designed of course to curb Soviet expansion, yet the country is making massive oil deals with the Russians. Sorry, I think Trump has a right to call Germany out for skipping out to do lines with Putin. Lifelines. Now, Trump wants everyone to up their defense spending. Why would he do that?

At the NATO summit, we've got a guy, Trump, revealing a hard truth. With the hearing, we got an FBI lovebird shielded by his white knight Democrats. So after all the mainstream media freak outs, maybe they should stop screaming and listen to the grown-up who might be onto something. I mean, I never knew about that pipeline and now I do. Again, Trump has dragged something out of Europe's backroom and put it on stage and he didn't give [bleep] that he might have violated some decorum. That's his job. He's our jerk. The fact that he pissed off so many people should endear him to us. He's not interested in being TIME's man of the year, just the leader of Americans, so he left his summit with pockets full, about $40 billion. If it had been Hillary, all she would leave with is the silverware. True. Meanwhile - and while Obama may have been a lullaby, Trump is a wake-up call, a Sex Pistol in the land of Abba. It's true. It's true what the punk movement did to music in the 70s, Trump is now doing to politics. And if you missed that now, it's like you're still listening to Emerson, Lake and Palmer, which I do.

So the media is out to find the skeletons and here's what they found. In his high school yearbook, he called himself the treasurer of the Keg City Club, 100 kegs or bust. He drinks beer, that's horrifying. That's not all. Your kids may need to leave the room for this one.

The Secretary of Homeland Security says Russia is not targeting the midterm elections on the same scale as the 2016 presidential election. But Kirstjen Nielsen noted that the Russians are using social media to divide Americans. Nielsen says the DHS is helping state and local governments prepare for cyber attacks from Russia or elsewhere. The Secretary spoke today at the Convention of State Secretaries of State in Philadelphia. Overseas, Haiti's Prime Minister resigned today after a plan to hike fuel prices sparked deadly riots. Jack Guy Lafontant suspended the fuel price increases, but that failed to stop the protests. As the violence intensified, he faced growing calls to step down. Lafotant said the increases in gasoline, diesel and kerosene were needed to balance the nation's budget. Now, back to Greg Gutfeld."

It's not quite as catchy, but I will work on it. I understand why she wants to run again though, because she's been in politics forever.

But here's the thing that to me is so terrifying about this is you look at what the deep state did, you look at what all of these people did, too, and I do believe they did things to rig the election or try to rig the election, when they thought Donald Trump had no chance of winning.

Some professors and students are outraged over a University of Wyoming marketing campaign bearing the slogan, \"The world needs more cowboys.\" Now, for those of you not from Wyoming, it's a state, but also the school's mascot is a cowboy. But critics call the phrase sexist and racist. One professor says the word \"cowboy\" makes you picture a straight white male. I'd add a hot one, too. Anyway, the professor says really, for the past 20 years it's not been acceptable to use the generic male to pretend that includes females. Shut up. The school's spokesperson responded it's not gender specific. A cowboy is not what you are, but who you are. Anyway, here is video proof the world needs more cowboys. Rest in peace.

Unless you're a wolf, a cowboy or a tourist stuck trying to get out of Wyoming, there's not much else to do but to herd cattle, drink beer and avoid wolves. I mean, this is what's wrong with America and this is exactly why Democrats can never win an election. This type of, all this energy and all of this negativity on a name or nickname. History lesson from Tyrus, the first cowboys were black, punk. They were black. It was the worst job you can get in the West to herd a rich white man's cows. Load them up. Straight white guys weren't jumping in for that. It wasn't a big thing like, \"Hey, I got to Texas and I'm going to go stand in the sun for 14 hours a day and smell and push cows for a guy with money.\" The white guys were smart. They didn't do that. It wasn't until you saw the movies that all of a sudden, white guys - and they got breaks and trailers, but the real cowboy were brothers running from the south.
