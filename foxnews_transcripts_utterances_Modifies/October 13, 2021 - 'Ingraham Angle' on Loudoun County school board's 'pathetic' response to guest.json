Gas is now up 42 percent, steak 22 percent, egg prices rose nearly 13 percent. Don't you wish you kept that old clunker. By the way, used car prices jumped 24 percent.

Biden's problem is his ideas will only make life harder for the average American. It's a substantive problem. Biden is trying to use the coming Christmas shortage as justification for passing an infrastructure bill. But the truth is exactly the opposite. Because the inflation situation is so severe, we cannot afford to be dumping trillions of dollars in new federal spending into an overstimulated market. Where the worker is going to come from, where the supply is going to come from? If you start pumping more money into this economy right now, all you're going to create is a demand spike that will cause prices to spiral and shortages will ultimately get worse. By this team of nincompoops have it exactly wrong. First, you have to get inflation under control. Then and only then could you maybe start thinking about increased spending. For now, inflation, not infrastructure has to be the priority, or we're going to go right off the cliff. Republicans who voted for it, you got to turn around now, all 19 of you. Now, we saw the same dynamic at play for Biden with the Afghanistan withdrawal. Now, the basic goal getting out of Afghanistan did make sense. But they approached it, of course, in the most idiotic manner. And here, it may make sense to build more infrastructure later on, but trying to spend enormous amounts of new federal money at a time of soaring inflation will be a catastrophe for us.

No word yet from Commonwealth attorney Buta Biberaj. But the school board's response was truly despicable. First, they lied about it. \"Members were not aware of the specific details of this incident until it was reported in media outlets earlier this week.\" Then came the excuses. \"LCPS is prohibited from disciplining any student without following the Title IX grievance policies, which include investigating complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault.\" They concluded by saying, Scott Smith deserved to be arrested for trying to speak about his daughter. \"We were unable to locate any records that indicate that Scott Smith had registered in advance to speak at the June 22 board meeting.\" So he didn't register. That's the reason. Joining me now are two Loudoun County parents, who know the Smiths. Patti Menders and Erin Dunbar. Ladies, thank you for - both of you for coming on tonight.

Because the inflation situation is so severe, we cannot afford to be dumping trillions of dollars in new federal spending into an overstimulated market. Where the worker is going to come from, where the supply is going to come from? If you start pumping more money into this economy right now, all you're going to create is a demand spike that will cause prices to spiral and shortages will ultimately get worse. By this team of nincompoops have it exactly wrong. First, you have to get inflation under control. Then and only then could you maybe start thinking about increased spending. For now, inflation, not infrastructure has to be the priority, or we're going to go right off the cliff. Republicans who voted for it, you got to turn around now, all 19 of you. Now, we saw the same dynamic at play for Biden with the Afghanistan withdrawal. Now, the basic goal getting out of Afghanistan did make sense. But they approached it, of course, in the most idiotic manner. And here, it may make sense to build more infrastructure later on, but trying to spend enormous amounts of new federal money at a time of soaring inflation will be a catastrophe for us.

LARRY KUDLOW, HOST OF THE \"KUDLOW\": Yes. I think those companies probably do. I'm sure that FedEx and you [ph] guessed who--"

      "utterance": "I mean, I - that's the business they're in, overnight delivery. So, I don't know, the retailers may or may not, I'm not sure. But here's the thing. The government can't get anything right. The problem was the Port of Los Angeles was not open. So you could put all the people you want in there, but you couldn't open the boxes of the containers and try to put them in trucks to drive away in all those deserted roads that the President talked about. You couldn't do that until they stay open. So that's a government thing. And I guess they're going to change that. Good for them. I just want to say one other thing here. These private companies, they're great companies, ok, FedEx, and UPS, and Walmart, and Target, and so forth. They are lending their hand, they're trying to help out, they'll do 24/7. They are actually sending their own planes with their own pilots. They're sending their own trucks with their own drivers. And Biden is such a snark. In that press conference you showed, he just starts going on if the private sector doesn't do what we want them to do, then they will see what we are going to do to them."

      "utterance": "We need the rest of the private sector chain to step up as well. If federal support is needed, I will direct all appropriate actions. And if the private sector doesn't step up, we're going to call them out and ask them to act."

And it really is tragic that he does not understand how good American businesses are, and can be. And I don't know if they're going to solve this problem. You don't have enough longshoremen, you don't have enough truck drivers. I'm trying to be optimistic about it. You could open up the container cartons and get it out there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We don't have employees, Larry. Larry, Larry, Larry, they have a shortage of pilots, of health care workers, in some cases, teachers, nurses, and now for a lot of reasons, including sometimes their vaccine issues as well. They're not getting the workers there. OK. So that's just a fact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know whether UPS, or FedEx has enough workers. I don't know that. They will surely pay high wages to get workers in the period ahead if they haven't already. I'm just saying, Joe Biden has such dislike for American free enterprise and these private companies. Remember this, you know this. Donald Trump worked with the private drug companies to develop a vaccine that literally saved America in six months. That was a public-private partnership. He didn't rank them out. He didn't snark them out when he invited them over to the White House, the way Biden does, and he didn't walk - talk behind their back. And they deliver, and they - Biden, he wants to tax these companies to death. He wants to regulate these companies to death. And by the way, he wants $5 trillion in spending, which, - you know, I think you're right, Laura. You're coming along on your economic analysis."

      "utterance": "Yes. I mean - I think summers was right. He was ahead of the curve. I don't know how Janet Yellen with a straight face, who believes that climate change is an existential threat, and who wants to have a $3 trillion tax hike, which will damage, destroy our economy and the Europeans, if they go along with it. But here's the other piece, the Federal Reserve, Yellen used to run the central bank, they are pumping money in as though we were still in an emergency."

But if the fed keeps pouring money in, that is going to cause a major inflation, while the tax hikes throw the economy into recession. Those are the risks here."

We know how to grow the economy and grow wages, keep China back on its heels and shut the border. We know how to do it. He doesn't want to do it. And as a result, he don't want to do it."

      "utterance": "Yes, Larry. The beast always needs to be fed, though. You got to keep pumping money into the beast. To the money they are always hungry. Larry, great to see you tonight as always. And with the $3.5 billion behemoth spending bill Larry just talked about, Democrats are trying to increase the cost of everything. And ultimately, it will bankrupt the next generation, steal the next generation. The following priorities in this legislation include $8 billion bucks for a civilian climate corps. It's going to act basically as a taxpayer funded leftist police force. $4 billion for equity, love that word, in electric vehicle charging and tree planting. What? $643 million will go toward procuring culturally appropriate foods, I kid you not, for school lunches, forget chicken tenders and Friday pizza, I guess. Free community college for illegals, of course. They'll be eligible for child tax credits as well. My personal favorite, though, and this is a drop in the bucket for the federal government. $15 million for National Resource Centers focused on providing services for older individuals who are underserved due to their sexual orientation, or gender identity. Hmm. Every so often, we're going to show you how the left hopes to waste your tax dollars and that's it. Last night, I spoke exclusively to a Loudoun County father, who says his daughter was sexually assaulted in a school bathroom by a boy who was wearing a skirt. What followed was his arrest. He was arrested at a school board meeting and a potential cover up by local officials. In moments, we're going to speak to two parents who know the Smith family well, what they've been through and have some very unique insight about what's happening. Stay there."

My wife and I had to spend the entire summer rebuilding our daughter. Unfortunately, there was a couple rough nights. It was, it was, it was hell."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That was last night during an INGRAHAM ANGLE exclusive. Loudoun County parent Scott Smith recounted his family's pain and suffering after his daughter, he says, was sexually assaulted in a girl's bathroom by a boy who entered wearing a skirt. More shocking, Smith says the school board and the county's Soros funded prosecutor tried to cover it all up. Of course, after hearing such disturbing allegations, we reached out to both offices. No word yet from Commonwealth attorney Buta Biberaj. But the school board's response was truly despicable. First, they lied about it. \"Members were not aware of the specific details of this incident until it was reported in media outlets earlier this week.\" Then came the excuses. \"LCPS is prohibited from disciplining any student without following the Title IX grievance policies, which include investigating complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault.\" They concluded by saying, Scott Smith deserved to be arrested for trying to speak about his daughter. \"We were unable to locate any records that indicate that Scott Smith had registered in advance to speak at the June 22 board meeting.\" So he didn't register. That's the reason. Joining me now are two Loudoun County parents, who know the Smiths. Patti Menders and Erin Dunbar. Ladies, thank you for - both of you for coming on tonight. Patti, now you say the school board's claim that it didn't know about sexual assault allegations until this week is bogus. How do you know that? Why do you know that?"

    {
      "speaker": "PATTI MENDERS, LOUDOUN COUNTY MOTHER",
      "utterance": "So I've lived in Loudoun County for 23 years, and I asked a former school board member. She said to us that the school board is very aware of any disciplinary actions, especially violent and sexual in nature. So the fact that the incident happened at the high school, the principal was obviously alerted, then they went to law enforcement. It is automatically sent to the superintendent and the school board. So the fact that they said that they did not know at the June 22 meeting is wrong."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Erin, when I first heard that last night, it took my breath away. I think if you don't know that a girl says, she was raped. We're not going to recount how it happened and what the actual descriptive content of that assault was. It was idiocy, made me want to cry. If they didn't know about it, they all should tender the resignations, frankly. They should all go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERIN DUNBAR, LOUDOUN COUNTY MOTHER",
      "utterance": "I agree. I agree. I mean, honestly, the superintendent is kind of the last line of defense for our kids as far as the school disciplinary process. And the fact that he's just falling on the excuse that, we didn't know until you all found out is just ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MENDERS",
      "utterance": "That's correct. House Bill 257 was created by a Democrat. It was passed, and the governor, Northam, who was also a Democrat, he signed off on it. So I blame the Democrats for posing this bill that prevents the superintendent and the principal from telling law enforcement. So look what happened to the poor Smith family."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tell us about that, Patti. What - Mr. Smith came on last night. He's obviously still, you don't blame him, incredibly emotional about this. And it's unimaginable. What are they going through?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MENDERS",
      "utterance": "So, imagine your daughter being raped and sodomized in a school. You put your children on that bus and you hope and pray that they are safe. They're supposed to be safe in a school environment. And this boy says that he's bisexual and wears a skirt enters the girl's bathroom and does this to their daughter. Can you imagine the rage that any parent would have? And the school did not greet him very well. And he was not allowed in. Then he attended the school board meeting, and you can see how he was treated. It is a disgrace that this poor man and this family was treated like this. They went silent this summer, and then they found out about this same predator went after and did the same exact acts to another girl at another high school. And they said enough being silent. And I actually had lunch with them on Monday. We set up a GoFundMe account for them, and the community is supporting this family because we blame the superintendent, the school board, and Democrats in Richmond for allowing this bill to give all of this hush-hush cover-up."

So I have two different daughters in the public school system, and the fact that this school board would sit there and ban parents from coming to the school board meetings because they don't wear a mask, but they're going to allow a child that was accused of assaulting and raping another children to go back into school system and be there with other children and have access to them, it's a travesty. I can't believe this is what we're dealing with. And they're accusing us of being the threat when really, to me, it's the Loudoun County school board that is the threat to us and to our children."

With the economy faltering, with people struggling and separated, it speaks, I think, to the desperation and anxiety people are feeling. It's also a dystopian allegory for the moment when we are all running for our lives and trying to stay in the game. That said, it's really gross, really bloody.

Joining me now, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Dan, what is happening here? Are they caught between a rock and a hard place, or was there a way for them to listen to Abbott and not to Biden here?"

      "utterance": "I think they should listen to their employees. It's not about politics, quite frankly. It's about liberty. We are the most business friendly state in the country for the 10 years. Businesses flock to Texas for many reasons. We believe in businesses having the authority over their employees to run their businesses how they wish. But we are also a liberty loving state for the individual, Laura. And I have been vaccinated. I believe in vaccinations. Over 70 percent of people over the age of 50 in Texas have been vaccinated. But in the population between 16 and 49, 56 percent of those people have been fully vaccinated. That means almost half. And that's your big segment of your working population, 16 to 49. And if people don't want a vaccine, that's their right. I own a business. I would never tell my employees they have to get a vaccination. And the idea that the president of the United States mandated this, putting these bigger companies in this position, was wrong. He said before he got elected he wouldn't do it. It's none of his damn business, quite frankly, how a person takes care of their health."

      "utterance": "Their attacks today on some of the other cable networks was basically that Abbott is trying to dictate what businesses do, which is -- the argument doesn't work because, of course, Biden is trying to dictate what businesses do as well. So your point is let freedom ring here? There's no reason to step in here at all."

    {
      "speaker": "PATRICK",
      "utterance": "Yes, stand with the individual, Laura. I have been consistent on this from day one. People have a right to make their own decisions. And the idea that you would take away someone's job, their career, their livelihood to put food on the table for their family because they believe -- and for whatever belief that is. That's up to them. They don't need to explain what their belief is. I don't want to take the show. Again, I encourage it, but if they don't want to take the shot, I am standing with them. Abbott is standing with them. And Texas legislators, I believe, will stand with the people of Texas. Biden needs to butt out of our business. What he needs to do is focus on securing the border and these 50,000 patients who say they've declared war on us, and they don't care about our National Guard. Biden needs to pay attention to that. They're the risk, they're the danger to America, not that 30 percent or 40 percent of Americans who don't want to take the vaccination, many of which, Laura, have already had COVID, so they don't need the vaccination."

Since last August 6th, 31,977 were released via what's called parole. It gives them temporary legal status, makes them eligible for work permits. Dan, it's like 10 times that many. Real quick."

      "utterance": "We've had more people cross the border illegally than we have unemployment. So in other words, for all these job openings we have that people aren't taking, Biden plans to fill them with illegals from Haiti and elsewhere. He needs to stand on the border. He needs to secure us. Let me tell you what's going to happen, Laura. There's going to be massive violence at some point in the future if Biden continue to let this happen - -"
