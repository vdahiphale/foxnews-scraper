Welcome, everybody.  \"Your World\" gets going right now with news of 128,000 new jobs added last month. Now, I know what you're thinking. That doesn't sound like a lot. But when you consider we were in the middle of that GM strike, and you had nearly 50,000 people walking a picket line, and that a lot more jobs were then created in August than September than first thought -- try 95,000 more -- well, that's the kind of thing -- things that get Wall Street's attention. The S&P 500, the NASDAQ both closing at records today. Take a look at the Dow today, within a stone's throw of a record itself. Amazing.  This as the president heads off to Tupelo, Mississippi, moments from now, big rally planned. He makes any remarks, you know the drill, we will take you to them.

So how do they get to that number? You were alluding to this at the top. So you got the base, 128,000 jobs created last month, and then there was 95,000 in the upward revisions for the prior two months. They added that in. Then the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council estimate that there's a 60,000-person adjustment for the GM strike, and then they threw in $20,000 for census -- 20,000 jobs, rather, for census workers. So that's how they get to that total of 303,000.  The president chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, saying this morning that the real winners here are the middle class. Listen here.",

What she wants to do is spend an additional $20.5 trillion new spending Medicare-, health care-related, on top of the 30-plus-trillion we're roughly spending right now.  Now, to pay for that over 10 years, she's boosting taxes, in other words, $35 trillion more in tax revenues, a good chunk of which will come, nearly $9 trillion, in new taxes on financial firms and corporations, $6 trillion bucks on very wealthy individuals and some firms that she says are trying to dodge taxes. About $2.66 trillion she hopes to realize from tighter tax enforcement, $2 trillion taxing capital gains at the regular income rate for the very well- to-do, and $800 billion, again, over 10 years, in something called a financial transaction tax on every Wall Street trade, whether you're buying stocks, bonds, you name it.  Will that not only pay for this? Again, the numbers might be a little off.

And a lot of people are crediting the tax cut that he and Republicans imposed for this great economy and sustained economic growth. So here she is. She's going -- obviously, when she was attacked by Joe Biden on this about a credibility -- her credibility on this issue, she said, well, we can go big in this country. And so she feels like -- it seems like she does feel like that this is something that the economy can sustain.  But we're seeing this -- the recession fears overturned with this jobs report because of the tax cuts. And I think she has a credibility problem on this issue, and you saw back in the Democratic debates in Detroit that she was rubbing her hands together, saying sort of like -- salivating over the chance to get her hands on more tax dollars.

She did raise clearly -- and I went through this line by line -- she did raise the possibility -- not the possibly, the plan here, that if you junk all private health insurance plans, Americans just leave those, the money that they might have been paying toward premiums on those plans, some of whom are in tax-advantaged accounts, you lose that, so your taxable income goes up, and that's why your taxes go up.

But when you consider we were in the middle of that GM strike, and you had nearly 50,000 people walking a picket line, and that a lot more jobs were then created in August than September than first thought -- try 95,000 more -- well, that's the kind of thing -- things that get Wall Street's attention. The S&P 500, the NASDAQ both closing at records today. Take a look at the Dow today, within a stone's throw of a record itself. Amazing. This as the president heads off to Tupelo, Mississippi, moments from now, big rally planned. He makes any remarks, you know the drill, we will take you to them.

Adjusted for revisions and the General Motors strike, 303,000. This is far greater than expectations. USA rocks.\" So, the president there said that the 128,000 number is actually 303,000. So how do they get to that number? You were alluding to this at the top. So you got the base, 128,000 jobs created last month, and then there was 95,000 in the upward revisions for the prior two months. They added that in. Then the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council estimate that there's a 60,000-person adjustment for the GM strike, and then they threw in $20,000 for census -- 20,000 jobs, rather, for census workers. So that's how they get to that total of 303,000. The president chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, saying this morning that the real winners here are the middle class. Listen here."

And I think everything's going to come down on November 3, is, how do people feel about their wallets, their situation, the jobs? And I have to throw one more thing into this, Neil.

The employment situation look -- just continues to look really, really good. You cannot fight a number. I believe we finished at 3.6 percent right now. And people having a job and contributing to the government, instead of the other way around, there is nothing better than that.

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, it might be debatable whether it's all paid for. What she wants to do is spend an additional $20.5 trillion new spending Medicare-, health care-related, on top of the 30-plus-trillion we're roughly spending right now. Now, to pay for that over 10 years, she's boosting taxes, in other words, $35 trillion more in tax revenues, a good chunk of which will come, nearly $9 trillion, in new taxes on financial firms and corporations, $6 trillion bucks on very wealthy individuals and some firms that she says are trying to dodge taxes. About $2.66 trillion she hopes to realize from tighter tax enforcement, $2 trillion taxing capital gains at the regular income rate for the very well- to-do, and $800 billion, again, over 10 years, in something called a financial transaction tax on every Wall Street trade, whether you're buying stocks, bonds, you name it. Will that not only pay for this? Again, the numbers might be a little off. And if she were to succeed and become president and get Congress to go along -- a big leap on all fronts -- what happens to the economy? To RealClearPolitics' Susan Crabtree. Susan, we already know that a lot of our opponents say the numbers don't add up. Joe Biden didn't waste a nanosecond to rip it. What's the reaction on the stump?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think you have a headline saying, even from The New Yorker, saying, well, she doesn't really have a plan for this. This is not a realistic plan. It's sort of a fairy tale that you have -- it came on the same day -- we sort of see this Friday news dump -- on the same day we had a great jobs report that the president is celebrating. And a lot of people are crediting the tax cut that he and Republicans imposed for this great economy and sustained economic growth. So here she is. She's going -- obviously, when she was attacked by Joe Biden on this about a credibility -- her credibility on this issue, she said, well, we can go big in this country. And so she feels like -- it seems like she does feel like that this is something that the economy can sustain. But we're seeing this -- the recession fears overturned with this jobs report because of the tax cuts. And I think she has a credibility problem on this issue, and you saw back in the Democratic debates in Detroit that she was rubbing her hands together, saying sort of like -- salivating over the chance to get her hands on more tax dollars. And so I think this could be a huge liability for her, make Joe Biden more of a centrist candidate and make his campaign a little bit more attractive, when he's been faltering and she's been rising."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

They will get a lot more back and the benefits and other things because of it, but that's neither here nor there. She didn't do that. She did raise clearly -- and I went through this line by line -- she did raise the possibility -- not the possibly, the plan here, that if you junk all private health insurance plans, Americans just leave those, the money that they might have been paying toward premiums on those plans, some of whom are in tax-advantaged accounts, you lose that, so your taxable income goes up, and that's why your taxes go up. That was kind of pooh-poohed minimized, but that means the middle class, others would pay more, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRABTREE",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the situation. I think that you can debate whether the premium -- the better premiums that Americans would pay would offset the tax cuts that they may incur. She's saying the middle class is not going to get tax cuts. But if they don't have a job, that's sort of a moot factor, right? This is the economy and whether you're better off four years than you are now, better off than you were four years ago is the real test of any president. And, right now, we're seeing the economy continue sustained growth there. And we have Elizabeth Warren coming up with this plan that could indeed hurt the economy by imposing greater taxes, $52 trillion it's going to take over the next decade to pay for this plan."

And they made progress in a variety of areas, as they are in the process of resolving outstanding issues. Now, the Chinese read on the call similar, but adding that they reached consensus on principles. Now, that last part is exactly what President Donald Trump said back on October 11. The bottom line is that progress was made today. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow says the two sides are almost finished on the agriculture section.

We're probably launching human intelligence operatives throughout the region, trying to track down his trail, as well as others. So I suspect this is not something that's surprising. We have done it many times before. That's how we came across al-Baghdadi and how we came across Usama bin Laden. It wasn't by chance. It was by just sheer analysis and hard work."

The question is whether or not they're going to establish liaison and I suppose partnership with other jihadi groups, as they have in the past. Now, they have tried to maintain some sort of purity from Al Qaeda and some of these other groups. But I suspect that they will reach out. They will try to reconstitute. They have had plans. But with our departure, with the Russians and Turks along the northeast corner, and with some dissidents in Lebanon and Iraq and Baghdad, and, of course, with the Iranians threatening Israel, we have a region that is very volatile. And that helps our kind of. And it helps ISIS in this case. So, unless we keep our eye on the target here, this new leader, we may have him slip away and some ability to reconstitute some of his warriors, which would be bad news for the entire region."

We suffered tremendously under the Obama years in terms of just spare parts and ability to train ourselves for contingencies. The world's changed. The world today that we face is one in which China is an incredibly strong and rising adversary, not just in the Pacific, but across the world. And we look at that daily. The Russians are not something to dismiss either. It's not just in Syria, but -- or Ukraine. They have just expanded their air defense systems into their exclave in the Baltics.

I -- first off, I'm -- thank goodness for Cuomo. I used to send him notes as people moved to Florida. Thank you. Keep raising taxes. It's great for Florida. Keep raising that regulation. The same thing. What are these states thinking? If you keep raising taxes, what's going to happen to their citizens? They're moving. They can't pay those taxes. And it's impossible to do business up there. So they're going to just keep moving and moving and moving to Florida. So I don't -- it's a death spiral for the -- by the way, Neil, think about it. Their most productive citizens that pay the highest taxes are the ones that keep moving. And so what happens to their tax structure? They have to keep raising taxes on everybody else. Who's it hurt? The poorest. The poorest. There's less money for roads, for schools, for all the things that the poor need to get ahead."

This wouldn't be an issue for the president, and given his wealth, that he would really care that there's a limit on how much taxes you can write off in a state to $10,000. But for people far less wealthy who are facing this conundrum, that's a big reason to leave these high-tax states. Do you think that Republicans, Democrats ought to work together to address that, that limitation that was really -- they came up with that to make the numbers match -- I know what the drill was and all -- and to get this all done, but that that boomeranged. And while the goal was to send a message to high-tax states that maybe you have got to watch your spending, not one of them has, and yet those hurt in this process are those who are trying to stay."

We have about three million more people than New York, and their budget is almost double ours. Why would Floridians have to pay for that? Why would Texans have to pay for that? The states that focus on keeping their governments small, they're -- what's happening is, people are moving to those states. And the two beneficiaries are Texas and Florida. And it's because we don't have an income tax. We have lower overall taxes. We have less regulation. And we're nice places to live. And -- but New York, I mean, there -- and, by the way, we have pension plans that are better funded. We have better roads than they have. We have better schools. We're the -- Florida is number one in higher education in the entire country right now, second lowest tuition. There's something going on here that New York is not doing."

I'm just wondering how this is sorted out. This is the same day we have learned, Senator, as you know, that your colleague Elizabeth Warren has come up with a plan, Medicare for all, that calls for a lot more taxes, about $35 trillion over the next 10 years. And, as you know, as a former businessman, that that is not a static number. The wealthy and corporations, they can find ways to avoid that or get out of Dodge to not have to deal with that.

There's going to have to be a process eventually like what's happening with Puerto Rico right now. Number two, think about Elizabeth Warren's plan. Whether it's $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $52 trillion, whoever -- whatever the number is, it's basically a double. So whatever you're paying in taxes now, because it's going to be a double. The federal government only collects $3 trillion a year now. And so, if it's $30 trillion, that's a double. That's -- that's $3 trillion a year. That's a double in your taxes.

      "speaker": "MCGHEE",
      "utterance": "I think that it's going to be hard for Trump to step away from the partisan back and forth, because he does seem pretty obsessed with the impeachment saga right now. But if he was smart, he would take a page out of former President Bill Clinton's book and focus less on the impeachment drama, and more on the other things that his administration is accomplishing, because the last thing that we need right now is what happened with Mick Mulvaney a couple of weeks ago during that press conference, when there was essentially an inadvertent implication, when he admitted that there was a kind of quid pro quo, and then he walked it back. So we don't need that right now. Trump needs to focus not on impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, Kaylee, when -- you're well wired into these folks. When the vote came down, as it did, on this process, and it was only Democrats voting for it, and only Republicans voting against it, and two Democrats in vulnerable districts voting against it, that's as partisan as you can get. So were Democrats surprised, the leadership surprised that, wow, this does look like a cabal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGHEE",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's interesting. It'll be interesting to see moving forward what the rest of the Democratic Party does, especially in the Senate, and as well as some Republicans that have voiced concerns about the impeachment saga as well. We have heard from Mitt Romney and a few other moderates that they could perhaps join the Democrats on the impeachment side. So focusing on that during tonight's rally for Trump would probably energize his base quite a bit. But it's important to keep in mind that his base is not representative of the general electorate. And if you look at recent polls, it does show that support for impeachment is gradually increasing."

And ever since that one experience, every time I need to go to the restroom, like, in bed, it's just -- I'm just taking off. It's just like that one thing. And it's just -- at this age, it's just embarrassing. I would like to get rid of that memory."

      "speaker": "FINK",

      "speaker": "BAIA",

By the way, he will be going to this big rally in Mississippi. And you can bet, you can bet he is going to talk a lot about economic numbers out today and a big old tax hike he says Elizabeth Warren is planning for you tomorrow, or something like that."

And, today, she explained what would happen to people who work for private insurance companies."
