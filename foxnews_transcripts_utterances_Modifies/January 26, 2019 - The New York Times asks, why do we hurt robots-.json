I speak of the Covington story in which we realize once again that the media will use anything they can to destroy you, and left unchecked, they won't stop. If it wasn't for other honest eyewitnesses, the press wouldn't have rested until the teens were frog-marched into the La Brea tar pits. They embrace the video from a sketchy source and pushed it out like cheap meth. Instantly, the teens became this week's media approved evil.  And when the media was caught pushing a lie, they blamed everyone, but themselves. But thanks to NBC Savannah Guthrie, we can see media bias in all its glory by comparing her questions of the Covington team to the ones she asked Native American Nathan Phillips.",

Did anyone say \"Build the wall?\" You have certainly been through a lot in these last few days. What some people see is a young kid with a smirk on his face.

All right, take these two - Alyssa Milano and Kathy Griffin - two peas in a putrid pod, camouflaging their drooling hate with fake compassion. These two led the charge in trashing the teens. Milano branded them racists, Griffin wanted them doxed.  So again, why do we let fame excuse people for being [bleep]. I mean the plague is famous and we don't admire that, yet these jerks count on their status to excuse their own jerkiness. But take away their celebrity and they're just your crazy neighbor in a soiled housecoat muttering and sniffing their own fingers.  The third culprit, Twitter, it's a decency subtraction machine, replacing actual face-to-face contact with bored malice. It's a platform where antagonism is its own reward. And let's not forget, all of this [bleep] was brought to you by identity politics which dictates the heroes and the villains always. It's a power struggle between oppressor and oppressed and those roles are dictated by the media, academia and entertainment complex. White kids in red hats - oppressor; low Native American - oppressed; and those crackpot cultists who initially accosted the teens, they're just delightfully eccentric. With identity politics, the mob always rules as it stalks a new victim every week. The final culprit your own eyes. You can't trust them anymore. Viral videos are designed to trick them. They're called viral for a reason. They're highly contagious, and they'll make you puke.   I initially fell for the wrong version of events simply by trusting my own beautiful blue eyes. I was fooled, and I am never fooled. I ignored my own advice, though, which is never rush to judge. True, I was - I was at brunch at the time, which is code for I was super drunk. But no excuses. Bottle of Rose. That's sad. But if I can fall for this crap, then we can all fall for this crap.  The best bet when something like this shows up on social media, run like hell to the safest space you can find. If only there was one place we could run to and hide until this all blows over.",

If it wasn't for other honest eyewitnesses, the press wouldn't have rested until the teens were frog-marched into the La Brea tar pits. They embrace the video from a sketchy source and pushed it out like cheap meth. Instantly, the teens became this week's media approved evil. And when the media was caught pushing a lie, they blamed everyone, but themselves. But thanks to NBC Savannah Guthrie, we can see media bias in all its glory by comparing her questions of the Covington team to the ones she asked Native American Nathan Phillips."

All right, take these two - Alyssa Milano and Kathy Griffin - two peas in a putrid pod, camouflaging their drooling hate with fake compassion. These two led the charge in trashing the teens. Milano branded them racists, Griffin wanted them doxed. So again, why do we let fame excuse people for being [bleep]. I mean the plague is famous and we don't admire that, yet these jerks count on their status to excuse their own jerkiness. But take away their celebrity and they're just your crazy neighbor in a soiled housecoat muttering and sniffing their own fingers. The third culprit, Twitter, it's a decency subtraction machine, replacing actual face-to-face contact with bored malice. It's a platform where antagonism is its own reward. And let's not forget, all of this [bleep] was brought to you by identity politics which dictates the heroes and the villains always. It's a power struggle between oppressor and oppressed and those roles are dictated by the media, academia and entertainment complex. White kids in red hats - oppressor; low Native American - oppressed; and those crackpot cultists who initially accosted the teens, they're just delightfully eccentric. With identity politics, the mob always rules as it stalks a new victim every week. The final culprit your own eyes. You can't trust them anymore. Viral videos are designed to trick them. They're called viral for a reason. They're highly contagious, and they'll make you puke. I initially fell for the wrong version of events simply by trusting my own beautiful blue eyes. I was fooled, and I am never fooled. I ignored my own advice, though, which is never rush to judge. True, I was - I was at brunch at the time, which is code for I was super drunk. But no excuses. Bottle of Rose. That's sad. But if I can fall for this crap, then we can all fall for this crap. The best bet when something like this shows up on social media, run like hell to the safest space you can find. If only there was one place we could run to and hide until this all blows over."

You've got your films that deal with race, you've got your films with LGBT heroes, you've got class consciousness, of course you've got your Cheney bashing.
