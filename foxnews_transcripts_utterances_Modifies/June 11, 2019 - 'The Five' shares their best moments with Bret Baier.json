And this is “The Five.” All eyes are on Iowa as President Trump and Biden face-off in the Hawkeye state. You're looking live where Trump and Biden are currently speaking. The fireworks though started earlier today with both men taking jabs at each other. The former Vice President is also set to speak tonight where he is apparently going to label the President as a quote, existential threat to America. The flailing Democratic frontrunner gave us a little preview of what is to come earlier today.",

I think he is genuinely a threat to our core values. And he is threat to our standing in the world. This is a guy who does everything to separate and frighten people. It's about fear and loathing.

You know, according to Biden -- what bugs me about his speech, other than he did the fine -- fine folks hopes again. He told the people there that you cannot discredit the news, which is B.S. Of course, you can. And he believes that calling somebody an existential threat is not as bad as saying fake news. But if you call somebody an existential threat, you are putting him among Hitler, ISIS, and climate change. So what are you applying when you call somebody existential, you can't vote out something existential, you can't vote out imperialist Japan, or Hitler, or climate change.

So you know, you've just got to watch your words, Joe. But he did flip-flop again on China.   And I find it very interesting that Joe Biden has tied himself so close to President Obama on the economy specifically, especially when you've seen such a change in the atmosphere with businesses, manufacturing. He also tried to make the point today that manufacturing is somehow not good under President Trump, when he's brought back half a million manufacturing jobs back to the country.

So people who worked around the World Trade Center, people who went to school there who are now filing a claim with this fund and wanting competition, because they were near the site of 9/11. Now if you're not a first responder, it's a first responder compensation fund. Therefore it's running out of money. And so there are legitimate, logical reasons why the funding isn't there. Maybe they underestimated the number of claims that were going to be made as a result of the cancer that takes years and years to develop. But there are legitimate questions about that.

The students pleaded guilty to attempted theft, admitting they weren't profiled at all. Here's a photo of the family who owns the bakery. You can see the racial hate in their eyes. So, once again, what the media first promoted turned out false and we should be glad that again the demand for racist stories exceeds the supply. America is better than the media thinks, which is why to most people media means nothing. But I doubt such hoaxes will stop until the media and academia admit their roles, which won't be soon. Oberlin blasted the verdict. But other schools must be quaking as Oberlin learns a hard truth. Don't believe in the vigilante media without evidence just because the accusation thinks your ideology. That education cost them millions, unlike their overpriced diplomas, it's worth every penny. So, Katie, I guess, there going to be - it could be - 11 million is the minimum. I guess, there is going to be more punitive damages. It could go up three times that of something?",

So when grievance culture is rewarded, then false victimhood becomes an excuse for bad behavior and accountability. And when the media blasted out like it's true without asking questions, interviewing the bakery, telling both sides of the story, they amplified the grievance culture, that's being used as an excuse for bad behavior. And then they get rid of it when it's no longer convenient or turns out not to fit their narrative, right, and so it continues. That's why we repeatedly see these screw ups by the media and repeatedly see this kind of behavior on college campuses or in general everyday life. And so until that stops, until you can't use grievance culture as an excuse for that kind of behavior, then it's going to continue.",

And this is “The Five.” All eyes are on Iowa as President Trump and Biden face-off in the Hawkeye state. You're looking live where Trump and Biden are currently speaking. The fireworks though started earlier today with both men taking jabs at each other. The former Vice President is also set to speak tonight where he is apparently going to label the President as a quote, existential threat to America. The flailing Democratic frontrunner gave us a little preview of what is to come earlier today."

He thinks that being tough is great. But what's really -- to be tough when someone else absorbs the pain. Donald Trump is only exacerbating the threat and the danger. I think he is genuinely a threat to our core values. And he is threat to our standing in the world. This is a guy who does everything to separate and frighten people. It's about fear and loathing. It's always been about the abuse of power."

It looks like his friends from the left are going to overtake him pretty soon. But I heard, you know, his whole campaign is to hit Trump. When he mentions my name that many times, I guess I should be complemented. No, I would rather run against I think Biden than anybody. I think he is weakest mentally. And I like running against people that are weak mentally. I think Joe is the weakest up here. The other ones have much more energy. I don't agree with their policies, but I think Joe is a man -- I called him One-Percent Joe. Because until Obama came along, he didn't do very well. Look, look, I don't bring him up. Joe Biden is a dummy."

And he is trying to be energetic. And that's the power of a nickname because it's forcing them to act energetic, which in itself is exhausting. I want to focus on what the -- what the media said this morning when they kept talking about Biden is set to eviscerate Trump. That was everywhere. It was almost as though the verb was fed to them."

It just shows you how in tandem the media and the Democrats are, that would -- they act together. You know, according to Biden -- what bugs me about his speech, other than he did the fine -- fine folks hopes again. He told the people there that you cannot discredit the news, which is B.S. Of course, you can. And he believes that calling somebody an existential threat is not as bad as saying fake news. But if you call somebody an existential threat, you are putting him among Hitler, ISIS, and climate change. So what are you applying when you call somebody existential, you can't vote out something existential, you can't vote out imperialist Japan, or Hitler, or climate change. So this rhetoric is way worse than anything about fake news. You're basically implying something very sinister that needs to be taken care of."

No, actually, they are just stealing all of our technology and calling in an investment. But he also had another issue today with plagiarism. Remember when Michael Avenatti was thinking about running in Iowa for the presidency, and he had an actual campaign ad. Well, he said Make America America again. Joe Biden said that today. So you know, you've just got to watch your words, Joe. But he did flip-flop again on China. And I find it very interesting that Joe Biden has tied himself so close to President Obama on the economy specifically, especially when you've seen such a change in the atmosphere with businesses, manufacturing. He also tried to make the point today that manufacturing is somehow not good under President Trump, when he's brought back half a million manufacturing jobs back to the country. So, I'm not sure that people are willing to go back to the Obama economy. I find it interesting that he's running on that."

But remember, his opposition right now is not Donald Trump. But he's talking about Trump. Trump is talking about Biden. The other candidates on the Democratic side have started taking swipes at Joe Biden. I think part of the China peace and the flip-flop on that was pressure from the left, including Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren in Iowa, in particular, just 1 point behind Bernie Sanders. And her favorables are much higher than Bernie Sanders."

And the media is saying can you give us more chicken? We don't watch Dean. It's great to watch. And the truth is the momentum for impeachment has slowed. The only people really calling for it are the House chairs, the resistance, and the press. And if you look at it, it's kind of like a stock that is tanking. You get a few rallies like when Mueller comes out or there's a contempt vote. But generally, it's going down the toilet. And the President right now, I think in the real clear politics has about a 44 percent average, which is nowhere near impeachment territory, no matter how many push polls the media can put out on impeachment. The thing is there was no collusion. So there's not going to be any real impeachment. Right now, this inside baseball with Doug McGahn is going nowhere because it's too inside baseball.

First of all, if you know Jon Stewart is coming to the hearing, show up, right, because he's going to get attention. And rightly so, he's been very consistent on this and a champion for these guys. I understand some members of Congress would say we are triple booked. We've got votes and we have all these things and coming in and out of the hearing. And yet, if you know this is going to happen, this doesn't make it look good when you're also out there trying to spin the members of Congress deserve a pay rise. And while this is an expensive endeavor, it's not that expensive. You can argue the tax cut. But from a messaging standpoint, what Jon Stewart said about corporate America getting tax breaks. And we can't even take care of these guys. Remember, it was never forget? We should just go ahead and figure out a way to do it. America basically has given up on fiscal responsibility. Like where are the conservatives out there talking about fiscal responsibility? Where is anybody talking about it? Nobody is. I would talk about entitlement reform. I'm all for that. But when it comes to these guys, they deserve our support. They've earned it. And they're really going through a lot right now. It's hard to watch some of them. But we should be made to watch it."

Your point, they just want a pay raise. And they are obsessed with fake problems, like the Russian hoax, when you have this sitting in your lap. You have the new NAFTA sitting in your lap, a border crisis sitting in your lap, healthcare, no one wants to do anything about it. And this is why everybody hates you.

      "utterance": "No, I don't - nobody is holding the bill up, because they don't want to fund a compensation fund for 9/11 first responders. That's not the issue. The issue is that there are our questions about what the qualifications are. It's hard to tell who qualifies in terms of the timing, and also there's been an increase in claims from people who weren't first responders. So people who worked around the World Trade Center, people who went to school there who are now filing a claim with this fund and wanting competition, because they were near the site of 9/11. Now if you're not a first responder, it's a first responder compensation fund. Therefore it's running out of money. And so there are legitimate, logical reasons why the funding isn't there. Maybe they underestimated the number of claims that were going to be made as a result of the cancer that takes years and years to develop. But there are legitimate questions about that. But I'm with Dana. I mean, out of all the things that you can find money for that Congress spends on, they should be it. But there are legitimate questions about who qualifies, who's getting the money. And as usual with a government program, the people who are the actual victims of something are now being victimized again, because of fraud in the program and people who don't qualify taking the resource away from the people who actually deserve it."

Then when the story falls apart, the media slinks away without addressing their own role in magnifying the lies. But, finally, the public is catching on. With Smollett, Covington, Kavanaugh. Now add the Oberlin case to this education and fakery. A jury nailed Oberlin College and the Dean named Meredith Raimondo with $11 million penalty for siding with three black students who claimed they were racially profiled at a bakery in 2016. The case got a lot of press. There were massive protests that targeted the bakery. But not just by students either. The dean actually distributed a flyer claiming that bakery had a history of racism and encouraged the boycott. The bakery went through hell for obvious reasons. But finally truth went out. The students pleaded guilty to attempted theft, admitting they weren't profiled at all. Here's a photo of the family who owns the bakery. You can see the racial hate in their eyes. So, once again, what the media first promoted turned out false and we should be glad that again the demand for racist stories exceeds the supply. America is better than the media thinks, which is why to most people media means nothing. But I doubt such hoaxes will stop until the media and academia admit their roles, which won't be soon. Oberlin blasted the verdict. But other schools must be quaking as Oberlin learns a hard truth. Don't believe in the vigilante media without evidence just because the accusation thinks your ideology. That education cost them millions, unlike their overpriced diplomas, it's worth every penny. So, Katie, I guess, there going to be - it could be - 11 million is the minimum. I guess, there is going to be more punitive damages. It could go up three times that of something?"

So when grievance culture is rewarded, then false victimhood becomes an excuse for bad behavior and accountability. And when the media blasted out like it's true without asking questions, interviewing the bakery, telling both sides of the story, they amplified the grievance culture, that's being used as an excuse for bad behavior. And then they get rid of it when it's no longer convenient or turns out not to fit their narrative, right, and so it continues. That's why we repeatedly see these screw ups by the media and repeatedly see this kind of behavior on college campuses or in general everyday life. And so until that stops, until you can't use grievance culture as an excuse for that kind of behavior, then it's going to continue."
