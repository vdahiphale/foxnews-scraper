Why didn't you take responsibility that you were the one that thought this should be in the hands of the media, rather than giving this in this backhanded way? I thought it was probably the most embarrassing moment for the director today on what was not a terrible day for him, and probably not a terrible day for the president, but I thought a pretty good day for the Senate Intelligence Committee to step up and say, this is a group of individuals that intend to get to the bottom of this and have the capacity as the part of Congress that can most likely do that.",

That is his view of honest, whatever he said he would be. That's probably-- honest loyalty I think was the term he used. That didn't sound either of those to me.  But my real question, this is a guy who has every reason, with a great career in public service, to be a stand-up guy. Why would you go through a back channel, rather than just take responsibility?

He said that: \"Comey's testimony just gave us the clearest and most damning evidence yet that President Trump lied to the American people and is likely under investigation for obstruction of justice, a serious and disturbing charge.\" I took the leap to say that would be an impeachable offense.

And, of course, if you're the president and you know that the FBI has been investigating this since 2015, and you have been told three times in 90 days that you're not part of the investigation, you would have to logically wonder why that piece of information couldn't come out.",

He then says the same thing again and goes a little further in 2016. That was supposedly obstruction of justice. The president-elect right before that January 6 meeting had said he didn't think that Secretary Clinton should be investigated any further. Was that obstruction of justice?
