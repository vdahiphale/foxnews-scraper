Confusing statements, weird bizarre gaffes, long meandering rants about -- let's see -- the ladies sections in department stores. And today, he touted a conspiracy theory about the coronavirus vaccine. We're going to show you the very worst moments coming up, typical though. Also, we'll get reaction tonight from Jared Kushner, the architect Karl Rove. Senator Lindsey Graham will break news with us tonight. And also tonight, you will meet to high school student -- one is the son of a police officer, the other, the son of a firefighter, both proud of their parents. They were both suspended from school, and school athletics. When you find out why, the only thing I say is it will make your blood boil. But, first, we begin tonight. Prepare to crawl out of your skin because yesterday, Joe Biden was trying so hard to pander for Hispanic-Americans to vote for him in Florida and he actually started a speech by playing, the -- well, the -- it's a song called \"Despacito\" which is on his cell phone. That's a well-known song. They had some great singers there. There's little interesting story behind it. Watch this.",

Now, Joe stays far away from other people. You usually find him hiding, cowering in his basement bunker like a reckless, maybe start calling him Howard Hughes Joe. And, of course, when does he -- when he finally does make a rare trip out of the house and the basement bunker, he hides behind his trusty teleprompter at these carefully scripted events.

And -- but then he turned around and said, you know what, rather than staying in the middle of the Democratic Party or maybe even moving to the center of American politics, I'm going to go left. He files the Unity Commissions with Bernie Sanders, eight members of panels on a whole range of issues, five of them selected by Biden, three of them selected by Bernie, co-chairman from each. If you want to read a scary document, read the 130 pages of the Unity Commission and see all the nutty, left-wing nostrums that are printed page after page after page. So if I were AOC sitting there saying, he didn't need to give up the platform to us and then we rolled him and his people time and time again in that process, she was one of the co-chairs of the Climate Committee. And you look at the lunatics that Bernie Sanders put on there and then see what shows up in that document and it's clear that the Biden people on those committees were told don't irritate your Sanders compatriots and give as much as you can. And what has happened since then, he has come out in favor -- you know, he was against Medicare-for-All. Now, he's for mostly all of Medicare-for-All. He was in -- he was the architect and the author of a bankruptcy protection bill when he was in the Senate. His principal critic is Elizabeth Warren and he now says she was right and I was wrong to have passed that bill. We know what he did in 1994 in the crime bill. He now says that's a big mistake and I'll go just the opposite. So, yeah, they've got him -- they got him on the run. And so, she's sitting there saying, he gets in. We're going to be able to pressure that guy. He's weak, his judgment is bad, he's feckless and we can take advantage of him all day long. That's not exactly what the American people want.

Of course, this will be your own personal decision as to whether or not you and your loved ones want to get the vaccine. Now, I do not support mandatory vaccinations, I don't. If doctors and scientists say it's safe, well, my personal inclination will be to take it after I read the studies, consult with my own personal doctors, make my own informed decision. I choose to get the flu shot every year. Some of my friends think I'm nuts. I believe in freedom. I believe in personal choice.

January 31st, 10 days later, Donald Trump puts the travel ban in effect. Then a quarantine, the first in over 50 years and then subsequent travel bans. February 1st, after the president announced his life-saving travel ban to and from China 11 days after the first case identified in the U.S., Biden tweeted that the travel ban was hysterical xenophobia and fear-mongering. And Joe continued calling the band hysterical xenophobia and fear-mongering as late as March the 18th. Wow. All the while, Biden was still holding indoor rallies through March. He wasn't talking about social distancing. He wasn't wearing his beloved mask. He wasn't coordinating an aggressive use of the Defense Production Act or sourcing PPE. He was totally missing an action, caring only that the Chinese not be mad at us for putting a travel ban in effect. His fellow Democrats also missing in action on any response to COVID-19. Late February, Nancy telling people to go to San Francisco's Chinatown. March 2nd, comrade De Blasio -- get out on the town, here are my recommendations for the next week. In March, Cuomo -- he said the virus wouldn't be as bad in New York because, quote, excuse all new arrogance as New Yorkers and I speak for the mayor also that we think we have the best health care system in the planet right here in New York. OK, wasn't until April 3rd that Biden via a campaign surrogate actually reversed course and then supported Donald Trump's travel ban two months and three days too late, Joe. Trump had already handled it all for you. And it wasn't until June 26 that Biden first supported the, quote, national mask mandate, late again, Joe.

And not the far left riots that have been wreaking havoc on we the American people, not in the violence in America's major cities run by liberal Democrats. And 50 years in the swamp, what do you have to show for your efforts, Joe? Tell us your great accomplishments. You had eight years as vice president, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. What'd you do to stop violence in Obama's hometown of Chicago, when you were the vice president? And 4,000 homicides happen in your period under your watch, 20,000 people in Chicago alone shot. And for eight years, both you and Barack barely mentioned it. Why didn't you pass criminal justice reform, or to stop your so-called, your word, predators? Why didn't you do police reform after Ferguson, Baltimore, Cambridge? Why didn't you set record low unemployment for every demographic group in the country, you name it, they have it? Why didn't you broker a peace deal in the Middle East, Joe? Why did you give $150 billion to mullahs in Iran that got nothing in return? $150 billion, you got nothing, Joe. The answer all these questions is simple. Biden's not just incompetent because he's a career politician, the ultimate swamp creature, who says and talks and talks and talks and does nothing. The same guy that praised the former Klansman that filibustered the Civil Rights Act, that was against the Voting Rights Act. He partnered in the late s with that same former Klansman to stop the integration of public schools because he didn't want his own kids going to public schools that he called racial jungles. He said those words. Now, so even though Biden's record's terrible, the swamp, they've only rewarded him, his bank account, Hunter's bank account, his brother's bank account get bigger and bigger. Forty-eight days, you get to decide. We'll get the government we deserve. Here now, someone who helped broker that historic Middle East peace accord, White House senior advisor, Jared Kushner.

Donald Trump's had to rebuild a lot of the alliances that were shattered by the previous administration. All the countries in the Middle East felt abandoned by America. There was instability. Remember, in 2017, ISIS was running rampant and Iran was very emboldened and on a glide path to a nuclear weapon. Donald Trump came in and he saw things for what they were. He went, he spoke with everyone. He listened. He brought everyone together on his first foreign trip. He said, if we're going to solve the Middle East, America can't do it for you. We have to all come together -- and his leadership and strategy over the last three years is what resulted in yesterday's signing of two peace deals in the Middle East. The last piece deal was 26 years ago, and just this past month, Donald Trump was nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, thanks to his leadership. So, you have two decades of failed Middle East policy in Washington, which means more wars, more troops, more threats of terror, and Donald Trump's come in. He's done a very rational, non-Washington approach. We've been criticized for it the last three and a half years, but obviously, it's yielding results. And that's really what this race will come down to. You have somebody who's been in Washington for 47 years, who's good at very complaining and criticizing and talking about the problems, but you have someone in Donald Trump who's come in, he's taken unorthodox approach, he's brought in a lot of unconventional people. But he continues to take problems on, head on. He solves them.

And every single challenge that seemed impossible at the time that everyone thought there would be no way to accomplish, whether it was getting enough ventilators for people, getting them produced, getting them distributed correctly, getting PPE to the front line workers, we took all those challenges on and we were able to meet them, and make sure that people's worst fears didn't come to pass. And, obviously, you see now our economy is rebounding very, very well, better than the G7 countries because of President Trump's leadership. We have the right economic interventions. That's made a big difference. And even with the vaccine, today, I saw them asking President Trump -- well, you said a couple months ago is going to take 13 months to get a vaccine, but now, it's only five months later, and you're in phase three trials for three different vaccines. You know, were you wrong? And he says, look, we've been -- we launched Operation Warp Speed. This is all new stuff, but we're moving as quickly as we can to make sure we can save lives and save the American economy. And I do believe this -- you know, what I'm seeing coming out of this -- coming out of this pandemic is that we have found out a lot about what our country is capable of.

Now, Joe stays far away from other people. You usually find him hiding, cowering in his basement bunker like a reckless, maybe start calling him Howard Hughes Joe. And, of course, when does he -- when he finally does make a rare trip out of the house and the basement bunker, he hides behind his trusty teleprompter at these carefully scripted events.

Look, he won the nomination by being a traditional Democrat, by basically saying, I'm not with those guys over there and he won the nomination could propelled by a lot of support in South Carolina from African-American voters who, you know, are typically more moderate in nature than the average Democrat, particularly if you're a southern Democrat, a black Democrat. And -- but then he turned around and said, you know what, rather than staying in the middle of the Democratic Party or maybe even moving to the center of American politics, I'm going to go left. He files the Unity Commissions with Bernie Sanders, eight members of panels on a whole range of issues, five of them selected by Biden, three of them selected by Bernie, co-chairman from each. If you want to read a scary document, read the 130 pages of the Unity Commission and see all the nutty, left-wing nostrums that are printed page after page after page. So if I were AOC sitting there saying, he didn't need to give up the platform to us and then we rolled him and his people time and time again in that process, she was one of the co-chairs of the Climate Committee. And you look at the lunatics that Bernie Sanders put on there and then see what shows up in that document and it's clear that the Biden people on those committees were told don't irritate your Sanders compatriots and give as much as you can. And what has happened since then, he has come out in favor -- you know, he was against Medicare-for-All. Now, he's for mostly all of Medicare-for-All. He was in -- he was the architect and the author of a bankruptcy protection bill when he was in the Senate. His principal critic is Elizabeth Warren and he now says she was right and I was wrong to have passed that bill. We know what he did in 1994 in the crime bill. He now says that's a big mistake and I'll go just the opposite. So, yeah, they've got him -- they got him on the run. And so, she's sitting there saying, he gets in. We're going to be able to pressure that guy. He's weak, his judgment is bad, he's feckless and we can take advantage of him all day long. That's not exactly what the American people want. They want somebody who regardless of where you are believes in what you believe and are willing to stay stand and fight for it.

When it comes to COVID-19, well, Joe Biden was behind the curve every single step on the way. Now, remember, first case identified in the United States, January 21st this year. January 31st, 10 days later, Donald Trump puts the travel ban in effect. Then a quarantine, the first in over 50 years and then subsequent travel bans. February 1st, after the president announced his life-saving travel ban to and from China 11 days after the first case identified in the U.S., Biden tweeted that the travel ban was hysterical xenophobia and fear-mongering. And Joe continued calling the band hysterical xenophobia and fear-mongering as late as March the 18th. Wow. All the while, Biden was still holding indoor rallies through March. He wasn't talking about social distancing. He wasn't wearing his beloved mask. He wasn't coordinating an aggressive use of the Defense Production Act or sourcing PPE. He was totally missing an action, caring only that the Chinese not be mad at us for putting a travel ban in effect. His fellow Democrats also missing in action on any response to COVID-19. Late February, Nancy telling people to go to San Francisco's Chinatown. March 2nd, comrade De Blasio -- get out on the town, here are my recommendations for the next week. In March, Cuomo -- he said the virus wouldn't be as bad in New York because, quote, excuse all new arrogance as New Yorkers and I speak for the mayor also that we think we have the best health care system in the planet right here in New York. OK, wasn't until April 3rd that Biden via a campaign surrogate actually reversed course and then supported Donald Trump's travel ban two months and three days too late, Joe. Trump had already handled it all for you. And it wasn't until June 26 that Biden first supported the, quote, national mask mandate, late again, Joe. And then in September, yeah, the polls aren't good on this, and he said he didn't support the federally mandated mask wearing, but now today once again, he flips flop and flails again. Take a look."

No matter how much he lies to your face, Biden hasn't let on a thing. His entire 50 years as a swamp creature, certainly not coronavirus. And not the far left riots that have been wreaking havoc on we the American people, not in the violence in America's major cities run by liberal Democrats. And 50 years in the swamp, what do you have to show for your efforts, Joe? Tell us your great accomplishments. You had eight years as vice president, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. What'd you do to stop violence in Obama's hometown of Chicago, when you were the vice president? And 4,000 homicides happen in your period under your watch, 20,000 people in Chicago alone shot. And for eight years, both you and Barack barely mentioned it. Why didn't you pass criminal justice reform, or to stop your so-called, your word, predators? Why didn't you do police reform after Ferguson, Baltimore, Cambridge? Why didn't you set record low unemployment for every demographic group in the country, you name it, they have it? Why didn't you broker a peace deal in the Middle East, Joe? Why did you give $150 billion to mullahs in Iran that got nothing in return? $150 billion, you got nothing, Joe. The answer all these questions is simple. Biden's not just incompetent because he's a career politician, the ultimate swamp creature, who says and talks and talks and talks and does nothing. The same guy that praised the former Klansman that filibustered the Civil Rights Act, that was against the Voting Rights Act. He partnered in the late s with that same former Klansman to stop the integration of public schools because he didn't want his own kids going to public schools that he called racial jungles. He said those words. Now, so even though Biden's record's terrible, the swamp, they've only rewarded him, his bank account, Hunter's bank account, his brother's bank account get bigger and bigger. Forty-eight days, you get to decide. We'll get the government we deserve. Here now, someone who helped broker that historic Middle East peace accord, White House senior advisor, Jared Kushner. I would argue that Biden and Obama and the $150 billion and nothing in return paved the way for a lot of these peace deals. Why? Because all of these countries are now aligned against Iranian hegemony. Am I wrong?"

Donald Trump's had to rebuild a lot of the alliances that were shattered by the previous administration. All the countries in the Middle East felt abandoned by America. There was instability. Remember, in 2017, ISIS was running rampant and Iran was very emboldened and on a glide path to a nuclear weapon. Donald Trump came in and he saw things for what they were. He went, he spoke with everyone. He listened. He brought everyone together on his first foreign trip. He said, if we're going to solve the Middle East, America can't do it for you. We have to all come together -- and his leadership and strategy over the last three years is what resulted in yesterday's signing of two peace deals in the Middle East. The last piece deal was 26 years ago, and just this past month, Donald Trump was nominated twice for the Nobel Peace Prize, thanks to his leadership. So, you have two decades of failed Middle East policy in Washington, which means more wars, more troops, more threats of terror, and Donald Trump's come in. He's done a very rational, non-Washington approach. We've been criticized for it the last three and a half years, but obviously, it's yielding results. And that's really what this race will come down to. You have somebody who's been in Washington for 47 years, who's good at very complaining and criticizing and talking about the problems, but you have someone in Donald Trump who's come in, he's taken unorthodox approach, he's brought in a lot of unconventional people. But he continues to take problems on, head on. He solves them. And I tell him all the time that if you weren't making so much change, if you weren't so effective, if you weren't getting so much done, they wouldn't be attacking you as hard as they are."

And every single challenge that seemed impossible at the time that everyone thought there would be no way to accomplish, whether it was getting enough ventilators for people, getting them produced, getting them distributed correctly, getting PPE to the front line workers, we took all those challenges on and we were able to meet them, and make sure that people's worst fears didn't come to pass. And, obviously, you see now our economy is rebounding very, very well, better than the G7 countries because of President Trump's leadership. We have the right economic interventions. That's made a big difference. And even with the vaccine, today, I saw them asking President Trump -- well, you said a couple months ago is going to take 13 months to get a vaccine, but now, it's only five months later, and you're in phase three trials for three different vaccines. You know, were you wrong? And he says, look, we've been -- we launched Operation Warp Speed. This is all new stuff, but we're moving as quickly as we can to make sure we can save lives and save the American economy. And I do believe this -- you know, what I'm seeing coming out of this -- coming out of this pandemic is that we have found out a lot about what our country is capable of. We'll have a much stronger medical system because of it and I think we're going to merge with a stronger economy than we've ever had before."

For example, \"Axios\" reporting that the $1 billion in riot damage that might go as high as $2 billion is the most expensive in insurance history. These are real human lives, real businesses, real harm done, real suffering for our fellow Americans. And the worst part, the new, radical, extreme socialist left is doing everything they can do to show even more hatred, more division, more violence, just days before the election. Here's the Attorney General Bill Barr laying it all out earlier this week. Listen closely."

      "utterance": "There undoubtedly are many people in the government who surreptitiously work to thwart the administration, and the turnout of the mob violence and countenancing with mob violence is another very disconcerting development because I think that increasingly, the message of the Democrats appear to see -- appears to be, Biden or no peace. That is ruled by the mob. You know, liberals project, you know, the president is going to stay in office and seize power and all that. I've never heard of that crap, right? I mean, I'm the attorney general, I would think I would hear of that. I never heard about it, OK? They're projecting. They're creating an incendiary situation where there's going to be loss of confidence in the vote. It'll be a close vote. People will say, you know, someone -- you know, the president won Nevada. Oh, wait a minute, we just discovered a hundred thousand ballots. Every vote must be counted. Yeah, but we don't know where these freaking votes came from."

Shocker, as if that wasn't predictable. Here with reaction of all this, FOX News contributor, former Republican congressman, he's now reformed. He's actually filled on on the show. I don't watch the show when I'm away, otherwise I'm not off. Trey Gowdy is with us. Sir, good to see you. When you look at the rhetoric of Joe, police become the enemy and we're going to redirect funds and Kamala's saying -- oh, applauding $150 million cut in the LAPD, and now, they're assassinating -- attempting to assassinate police officers, thousands injured, 45 cops dead this year on the job, do you believe that rhetoric has an impact?"

I mean, you know, the media wants us to believe that only Republican rhetoric, that that's the only thing that can incite violence, shown we've had ten thousand arrests this year connected with the rioters, $2 billion in property damage. We've got mobs chanting \"we hope you die\" to two police officers who were almost executed in the line of work, while you got other folks blocking access to emergency medical care for those deputies. And yet \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" and those on the left want us to believe that these protests are mostly peaceful. If $2 billion and ten thousand arrests and chanting we hope you die is mostly peaceful, I hope it doesn't ever get violent."

How do they do not somehow bifurcate their twisted socialist brains into denying what we see before our eyes happening and reject the help that the president is begging them to take? He begged again last night on that idiotic interview with Georgy."

They don't want to alienate the people that are setting things on fire and looting innocent property and store owners. So that that's the conundrum they have. Do we speak out against this and alienate our base, what -- the only reason Joe said anything is because the polls are tightening and they're losing on the issue of public safety. They thought they could run the pandemic all the way through the election and now, the country's on fire and you got cops almost being assassinated, and you got mobs chanting \"we hope you die\", even Joe can't ignore that."

What's up with Joe? I don't know, I hire a lot of people. If you want to work in this industry, you better have some urgency to work on my radio or TV show. You know why, this is a hard job and you got to be on your game. I don't -- I don't think I'd hire Joe Biden to work on this show because I don't think he has the energy to keep up. I don't think he has the energy to work in a busy restaurant. Are you getting the same questions I'm getting?"

Because I think that there is a very real likelihood she will have a disproportionate role in the administration if he wins. We've seen Pelosi put, you know, coronavirus relief on hold. People are familiar with Chuck Schumer. I mean, even if Joe Biden were to win, he will not be running government. You can watch an interview and it's painful to watch. He will not be running the country even if he prevails in November."

Thank you, Congressman, host -- I don't know what the hell they'll call you at this point. Anyway, when we come back, Lindsey Graham breaking news and our quest for equal justice. This is important. And later, you meet two high school football players. One is the son of a cop, one's a son of a fireman. They've been suspended from their team.

That would include Brennan, Clapper, Strzok, Page and the self-proclaimed super patriot, Mr. Higher Honor, lower in reality himself, James Comey, and others in the deep state cabal. Now, this is very welcome news. And remember, just last week, we learned members of Mueller's team, they all accidentally, OK, wipe their phones clean, including Andrew Weissmann, with two phones -- that's Robert Mueller's pit bull -- before handing those phones over to the inspector general. Yeah, I'd like to see an investigation. And speaker in name only, Nancy Pelosi, continues to play political games with coronavirus relief. But whatever moderate Democrats might be left, they're afraid how that might impact the election. Here now with more, Senator Lindsey Graham, about to break some news about who you have invited to your committee."

James Comey has agreed to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September the 30th, without a subpoena. I appreciate Mr. Comey coming before the committee. He will be respectfully treated but ask hard questions. We're negotiating with McCabe, Mr. McCabe. We're hoping to get him without a subpoena. Time will tell. Mueller has declined the invitation of the committee to appear to explain his report after the Horowitz report. He says he doesn't have enough time. But September the 30th, we'll have Mr. Comey before the committee and I look forward to it."

      "utterance": "Yeah, it sounds fishy as hell. We're going to ask the people who did the erasing, but I'm going to ask the Department of Justice and the inspector general to look at this. But I've been telling your viewers for a long time that we would try to have an accounting for what happened with Crossfire Hurricane. How did it get so off the rails, how was the FISA court misled multiple times? Well, that day is coming. I'm proud of our committee. We will also interview the people who interviewed the sub-source and we're getting to the bottom of what happened, and we'll have a hearing on September 30th with Mr. Comey, and hopefully, Mr. McCabe will come in. He's out all over the place. We've invited Strzok to come. He's selling a book. We'll see if Mr. Strzok will come without a subpoena. But I look forward to this hearing. I think it will be important to the American people."

Now, he was warned that the dossier was dirty before he signed the first warrant, that Hillary paid for it, didn't put that in the account. It does say verified. We now know it's unverifiable. He signed three of them. After he signed that it was verified in October, he told Donald Trump in December, the president-elect, that it's salacious and unverified. So he lied either in October or he lied in December, and we also know for sure, don't we, that the sub-source of Steele said, no, none of this is true, in January of 2017. And Comey went on to sign two more warrants. Is that a fact, Senator?"

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

Horowitz is doing a review of Crossfire Hurricane and this could be obstruction of justice. If you're -- know that your phone is going to be looked at for investigative purposes, you erase it, then you got a problem. We'll see what happens there too. But stay tuned, September 30th."

Their crime -- their terrible deed, carrying flags honoring our brave first responders onto the field prior to the game on the 19th anniversary of September the 11th. Brady Williams is with us. He is the son of a police officer. He carried a thin blue line flag. Jarad Bentley, the son of a firefighter, carried a thin red line flag, both players were suspended from athletics as the school denied them permission to carry the flags honoring those heroes who lost their lives on 9/11. A little Miami school board finally overturned the suspension yesterday. We reached out to the school for comment on their stupidity but they didn't hear anything back. Here now, players at the center of the story, Brady Williams, he's in gray, and Jarad Bentley is in green. I think if I can see properly I'm blind and deaf as I get older. First of all, first, thank your fathers for what they do. Nineteen years ago, when all common sense said to go down and get out, those guys went up. They knew they're going to lose -- a lot of them knew chances were high they lose their lives. Brady, let's start with you. Talk about what why would they -- what's the reasoning behind this."

But I brought everybody together, I stood up, I told them what I wanted to do, why I did it, what happened and all that and everybody decided everyone was 100 percent behind me, they were all backing me up and that's really what led my decision to what I did."
