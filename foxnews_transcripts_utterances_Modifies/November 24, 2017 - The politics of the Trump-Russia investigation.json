He actually brought up something new, which was the prospect of the Manafort campaign manager reaching out to the Russians, not being reached out to, reaching out himself. That's potentially new. He doesn't have to reveal anything that he knows in those questions. And the questions are broad enough that they open up new ones depending on the answer. He is not saying that there was collusion, he's not saying there's obstruction. He needs to know the mindset to determine whether or not there was corrupt intent, and that has a lot to do with obstruction. But there is nothing in there that reveals that collusion has been ruled out at all.
