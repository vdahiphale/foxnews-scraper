In fact, the article contends the FBI was open about the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation because they assumed she would win the White House and didn't want to appear to be withholding information. And yet, the FBI was very private about any Trump-Russia connections for fear that underdog Donald Trump would claim the FBI was trying to sway the election.

I have a different theory. Next week, or the week after the I.G. report is going to come out and it's going to excoriate the FBI's handling of both the Hillary Clinton case and the Donald Trump initial Russia case. And I think there's a lot of effort here for the FBI career people to get some of their narrative out in between all of the politics. But here are the key things that are in that story today: one is, in the 27th paragraph, if you'll read The New York Times wrote -- what it wrote in October all over again. There's still no evidence today like there was in October of 2016, still no evidence of collusion after all this time. That's an important acknowledgment in the story.   And then, I think the timeline is very important and it's written in a way -- it's hard to put the times in linear fashion. But let's take what happened. Ambassador hears conversation, doesn't report it to the FBI about Trump collusion. Christopher Steele approaches the FBI. Special team goes and meets the ambassador who then tells him about it. And then, John Brennan sends an electronic communication, kind of prodding the communication, get going, boys, I think there's some collusion here too, some interference in the election. That is the origin of this case. And I think when people look back, the question will be: was that evidence solid, was there enough reason to open a counterintelligence investigation against a sitting candidate for president based on what we now know about the quality of that evidence?

And we know that Glenn Simpson suggested that there was somebody who was embedded in the Trump campaign as part of the investigation. And they try to sort of explain that here. It says, at least one government informant met several times with Mr. Paige and Mr. Papadopoulos, current and former officials said. That has become politically contentious with Mr. Trump's allies questioning whether the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign or trying to entrap campaign officials. So, it questions whether or not there was someone who was connected to the FBI into the investigation who was trying to sort of bait Papadopoulos and Page into actions related to all of this.",

It is not uncommon in the counterintelligence investigation to use humans, to send a human to go try to pump someone for information to get an assessment of whether their allegation is true. You know, a lot of people forget -- counterintelligence investigations aren't criminal investigation. They're not trying to bring prosecution. They're trying to stop harm to the United States. It doesn't surprise me. I don't think it will turn out to be nefarious, but I do think it is a common tactic in CIA investigations to get someone close to the target and find out if their suspicions are correct.",

And President Trump invited us to talk about it, and I'm so grateful for that because, you know, we are front liners, we are fighting against this bad law, but President Trump is helping and he listens to everybody who were there, and he commented -- and, actually, we had Jeff Sessions was there.

We signed a peace treaty with North Korea and South Korea, China and United States. We recognize North Korea as a sovereign country. We have no desire to invade North Korea. We're not trying to unify South Korea and North Korea. We just want North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons program which has threatened us and the world. For that, they'll get a guarantee of security and hopefully a better economy because the sanctions will be relieved. Here's the other choice, keep threatening America, keep building nuclear weapons and ICBMs, get in a war with Donald Trump and lose it. Those are your two choices."

And you know, we may be seeing him having some second thoughts here on that front. Also, what about the people of North Korea who've lived on the dark continent for all these decades, and what's to stop them once they have no nukes and they have, you know, a lot of light shed into their country from rebelling against this regime that has put hundreds of thousands of people in labor camps?"

Here's what's crazy, is they keep building ICBMs that can deliver a nuclear weapon to America and believe that Donald Trump won't do anything about it. That probably work with Obama but I'm here to tell North Korea, that our president has drawn a red line. If you keep threatening the American homeland with a nuclear weapon, we're going to destroy your regime, it's that simple. So, if you want to survive, Kim Jong Un, you need to sit down with the president and do a deal -- giving up your nukes. In return, we'll guarantee your security and end the Korean War. If you keep doing what you're doing, you are miscalculating Donald Trump. He's not Obama. You do this at your own peril.

We know that no collusion by the Trump campaign and the mayor has now said, if Bob Mueller wants to talk to the president you do it through a series of questions in a very limited fashion.

And what we don't want to see is the politicization of this any further, because we the Mueller team to finish their interviews, to writer that report to Congress so that the American people can see, very clearly, that the Trump campaign, of which I was a part of for a long period of time, never coordinated with any Russians, there weren't any Russians there, there was no collusion, and that's what the American people deserve to see.

The team that worked on this had just finished the Hillary Clinton investigation and the story says that Strzok and Page, you remember them, among others and this small team wanted to tread carefully. Is that exactly what happened and is this the process of what turned out to be the \"insurance policy\" that we heard so much about, that you later famously discussed that? So, is the story an effort to rewrite at Times' piece back from October of 2016 that claimed there was no collusion to be found? It comes also at an opportune time for John Brennan whose own narrative appears to be unraveling more and more every day. The Hill's opinion contributor John Solomon is here on that.

It was the name used by only a few FBI agents who in the summer of 2016 were sent to interview the Australian ambassador to the United Kingdom who claimed he had evidence of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. It was former Trump Campaign Aide George Papadopoulos who the ambassador reportedly got his information from. But the Times says the investigation was largely secret. In fact, the article contends the FBI was open about the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation because they assumed she would win the White House and didn't want to appear to be withholding information. And yet, the FBI was very private about any Trump-Russia connections for fear that underdog Donald Trump would claim the FBI was trying to sway the election. It was also in the summer of 2016 that then-CIA director John Brennan started briefing members of congress and FBI director James Comey on intelligence showing that Russia was behind an attack on the election and here's what John Brennan said today on MSNBC.

But now, former NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper are contradicting John Brennan, saying the dossier was, in fact, used as part of that assessment and then finally we should note after a closed-door hearing with John Brennan today the Senate Intel Committee says the Russian government did interfere to help Donald Trump win the election. The House Intel Committee, you might remember, had already concluded that Russia did interfere, but not in an effort to help Donald Trump. Martha."

John, good to have you with us tonight. So, I'm curious what you think. It was interesting timing how this piece dropped and sort of shed light on all of these things. What do you make of this story and what it aims to accomplish?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN SOLOMON, OPINION CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's a lot of speculation that maybe this is an effort by Brennan to burnish his image or correct his story or the New York Times to get right with its earlier reporting. I have a different theory. Next week, or the week after the I.G. report is going to come out and it's going to excoriate the FBI's handling of both the Hillary Clinton case and the Donald Trump initial Russia case. And I think there's a lot of effort here for the FBI career people to get some of their narrative out in between all of the politics. But here are the key things that are in that story today: one is, in the 27th paragraph, if you'll read The New York Times wrote -- what it wrote in October all over again. There's still no evidence today like there was in October of 2016, still no evidence of collusion after all this time. That's an important acknowledgment in the story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And then, I think the timeline is very important and it's written in a way -- it's hard to put the times in linear fashion. But let's take what happened. Ambassador hears conversation, doesn't report it to the FBI about Trump collusion. Christopher Steele approaches the FBI. Special team goes and meets the ambassador who then tells him about it. And then, John Brennan sends an electronic communication, kind of prodding the communication, get going, boys, I think there's some collusion here too, some interference in the election. That is the origin of this case. And I think when people look back, the question will be",
      "utterance": "was that evidence solid, was there enough reason to open a counterintelligence investigation against a sitting candidate for president based on what we now know about the quality of that evidence? And I think today, there was an effort to just lay that timeline out so people can make a better decision."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That's very interesting and we are expecting that I.G. report shortly. And if it is as you say, it'll be very interesting. Another point that caught me here was the question of the FBI having their own independent mole or a, you know, spy who was sort of at the center of all of this. And we know that Glenn Simpson suggested that there was somebody who was embedded in the Trump campaign as part of the investigation. And they try to sort of explain that here. It says, at least one government informant met several times with Mr. Paige and Mr. Papadopoulos, current and former officials said. That has become politically contentious with Mr. Trump's allies questioning whether the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign or trying to entrap campaign officials. So, it questions whether or not there was someone who was connected to the FBI into the investigation who was trying to sort of bait Papadopoulos and Page into actions related to all of this."

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, and to be honest with you, I've covered a lot of counterintelligence investigations over 30 years. That is not an uncommon tactic. It's a lot different. I think the early stories were suggesting there was a mole and headquarters. I don't think it's quite that. They had their suspicions about Page, that's why they want for the FISA warrant. It is not uncommon in the counterintelligence investigation to use humans, to send a human to go try to pump someone for information to get an assessment of whether their allegation is true. You know, a lot of people forget -- counterintelligence investigations aren't criminal investigation. They're not trying to bring prosecution. They're trying to stop harm to the United States. It doesn't surprise me. I don't think it will turn out to be nefarious, but I do think it is a common tactic in CIA investigations to get someone close to the target and find out if their suspicions are correct."

We wanted to come up with something that exemplify what our tagline meant, which was fearless conservative, as well as addresses an issue that is pivotal to my campaign, as well as important to all Georgians -- that's illegal immigration. So, we came up with the Michael Williams Deportation Bus Tour, and we actually started it today and we went to two sanctuary cities to bring attention to the effects of illegal immigration here in our state and our country. And we feel very, very confident about our position in this race. We have had tons of people reach out to us over the past several weeks saying they've already voted for us.

The purpose of the bus is to bring attention to my 287G deportation program, which would allow sheriff's deputies to have many of their deputies act as ICE agents, so that we can have 159 counties with acting ICE agents in it, so once they've identified some in our country illegally, they can begin the deportation process immediately, and not have to wait for federal agents."

No, I agree with Charlie that this is definitely a wave, what's going on here with this Trumpian way that a lot of people are obviously taking signals from what has worked for the president and bringing that to their localities here. What's interesting to me that Michael Williams said there, you know, I'm a fearless conservative, and that's what this is. And that used to mean being for the free market and small government, right? And balancing the budget and cutting some entitlements. And it has totally transformed into being someone who opens an ad with your shotgun and rides around saying, I'm going to round up all the illegals, and I'm going to escort them to the border and kicked them over, right? This isn't even just, like, I'm going to make sure they go into court, and then we'll see what happens to them. It has gotten so much more aggressive in the age of Trump, and people are liking it. They're not liking it enough, I think, to elect this fellow, though, I don't know what is going to happen here. But it is so much more hyper charged than it used to be, because these are competitive primaries, but, I think, also, just because of the tone and rhetoric of this president."

But, the other thing is that -- you know, these guys -- and Jessica is right, you know, this is not necessarily conservative, it's more populist than anything else. And -- but I don't think the founders, for example, would be terribly upset by all of this. They never intended to have a professional political class. They didn't want to professional political class. They wanted people who had other jobs and owned chainsaws, and shotguns, and trucks, and did other things. And came to Washington, brought their common sense to Washington, fix things, ran the government, and then went home. This whole idea where we have a, literally, a swamp along the Potomac River where people never leave, and now we have air conditioning. You know, if we didn't have air conditioning they would have to leave in a summer because it's so miserable here. But now, they're here all the time and they're spending all of our money."

We are talking about criminal illegals that they are, walking on the street. In Orange County itself, we had about 338 criminals who were released on the streets. We're supposed to hand them to ICE, but we couldn't do it because of the California law. This is unsafe. Our job, and government's job, is to protect its own citizens, and it's not done in California, so we really have to fight for it. And President Trump invited us to talk about it, and I'm so grateful for that because, you know, we are front liners, we are fighting against this bad law, but President Trump is helping and he listens to everybody who were there, and he commented -- and, actually, we had Jeff Sessions was there. We had cabinet secretary from homeland security, Secretary Nielsen was there. ICE director, Mr. Homan was there. So, he was pointing at those people at what we can do, work with these people."
