But I think, you know, many people are asking, why was there the need for that air lift to begin with, and that just seems to be evading the White House's grasp here. They keep kind of going back to the reasons for getting out of Afghanistan, which people had largely agreed with. They keep going back to the need to end the war. But everybody agrees that this was done poorly. I think that their attempt to focus on the air lift is a way of distracting people away from what was a situation that was unfolding before our very eyes that was clearly going very poorly.",

Now, you can say, you know, there is a divide between left and right, Howie, but I think you watch any channel in America, no matter their orientation, and there's much coverage, almost saturation coverage of the foreign policy implications, the potential for future terrorist attacks as a result of the withdrawal, discussion about the sacrifices that were made by the military over a 20-year forever period. So, all of that is going on. And then, of course, the 13 Americans who sacrificed their lives in the course of the withdrawal grew tremendous attention on left and right. So, in my opinion, we have had an ongoing discussion here about the consequences of all of the president's actions.",

But a very interesting one, I think one that was newsworthy and people were interested in hearing about his perspective on this, when he was giving his side of the story in terms of what he would have done and what the implications were. So I thought that round of media interviews was really interesting.

The disaster of a chaotic withdrawal that led to the horrible suicide bombing, among other problems, and the decision to withdraw, which you're right, new \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll says 77 percent of Americans agree with Biden's decision to get out of the 20-year war and which Donald Trump agreed with as well.

And of course, we couldn't have anticipated what happened with the Afghan government. And, again, to my mind, the United States, you know, it did not go well. But we put so much money into the afghan government, into training the Afghan military police, to literally arming them. So, yes, you're right, you can say it is two separate items, withdrawing from the war and how it was done. But in my mind, you can't guarantee anything in a military operation. And I would be critical I especially have great heart for those who lost their lives, our service people who put themselves on the line first. But I got to say that it is a difficult task. I don't think you could have said it could be done easily or with some precision that would have prevented any problems.

By the way, 60 percent in that same \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll disapproved of Biden's handling of Afghanistan as opposed to the more than three quarters who liked the decision. Alex, there is one thing that's unspinnable, really just unspinnable at the media, and that is the Biden administration did leave, despite its promises, at least couple of hundred Americans behind and tens of thousands of Afghan allies who risked their lives to help us during the war.",

Clearly, as you were saying earlier, this has been going on for some time, the idea that, you know, former President Trump said get out in May. President Biden delayed it until August. Why people decided that they could wait until the last moment or whatever? I think at some point, despite U.S. reaching out, telegrams, e-mails, telephone, people who were delaying, and I think they got caught.

Yes, Biden inherited a war we are already losing. Yes, the Pentagon did good work in evacuating 122,000 Americans and Afghan allies. But we haven't heard the president, defense secretary, secretary of state acknowledged a single thing wrong, and that has fueled the negative press. There is an emerging media debate about whether the U.S. should be propping up weak regimes and civil wars. Remember, it was Donald Trump who signed the withdrawal agreement, but also an attempt by pro-Biden pundits to conflate the decision to leave Afghanistan with the awful execution that the whole world has witnessed. And this broader debate is so important that it's our job to lift it above petty partisanship. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ. Ahead, my interview with Larry Elder, the California radio host who has got a shot at becoming governor in next week's recall election. As media hawks and hardliners say it would have been better to leave some military contingent in Afghanistan indefinitely, President Biden used his televised speech to reject those views."

But more liberal pundits are saying he's right, it was an incredible mass evacuation, but that's hardly the whole story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALEXANDRA WILKES, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, I think that the president's speech was an attempt to put a bow on what's really an indefensible situation. But that's exactly what the White House is guiding reporters and guiding, you know, liberal columnist, allies towards the success of the air lift. But I think, you know, many people are asking, why was there the need for that air lift to begin with, and that just seems to be evading the White House's grasp here. They keep kind of going back to the reasons for getting out of Afghanistan, which people had largely agreed with. They keep going back to the need to end the war. But everybody agrees that this was done poorly. I think that their attempt to focus on the air lift is a way of distracting people away from what was a situation that was unfolding before our very eyes that was clearly going very poorly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. We all have seen the images. Juan, what bothered many media people on the right, as I said at the top, was the fact that the president and his top national security officials didn't admit that anything had gone wrong, everything went as well as it possibly could, nobody could have predicted the Afghan collapse and all that. Why can't commentators on your side admit that much of this was horribly handled?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the key point is that they got out of the war and obviously most Americans agree with that, liberal and conservative. So we're talking then about the withdrawal. I think that there has been lots of dissent there. Now, you can say, you know, there is a divide between left and right, Howie, but I think you watch any channel in America, no matter their orientation, and there's much coverage, almost saturation coverage of the foreign policy implications, the potential for future terrorist attacks as a result of the withdrawal, discussion about the sacrifices that were made by the military over a 20-year forever period. So, all of that is going on. And then, of course, the 13 Americans who sacrificed their lives in the course of the withdrawal grew tremendous attention on left and right. So, in my opinion, we have had an ongoing discussion here about the consequences of all of the president's actions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, until now, we'll get to that in the next second. Now, Alex, we don't know how Donald Trump would have handled the execution of the withdrawal if he were still in office. But a lot of conservative media people didn't criticize Trump for making the deal with the Taliban, releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners, and just say that everything involved in this is Joe Biden's fault."

But a very interesting one, I think one that was newsworthy and people were interested in hearing about his perspective on this, when he was giving his side of the story in terms of what he would have done and what the implications were. So I thought that round of media interviews was really interesting. I think probably since his social media exile in the winter was probably the most prominent we've seen him in the news in terms of being a foil to the Biden administration in a serious way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, as you would expect but, of course, he was part of the process. And Juan, too many in the media, I think, as I said, are conflating two things. I think you started down this road as well. The disaster of a chaotic withdrawal that led to the horrible suicide bombing, among other problems, and the decision to withdraw, which you're right, new \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll says 77 percent of Americans agree with Biden's decision to get out of the 20-year war and which Donald Trump agreed with as well. But they're two separate things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "In my mind, there was never going to be an easy exit from Afghanistan. Just ask the Russians, ask the British, ask anybody. And of course, we couldn't have anticipated what happened with the Afghan government. And, again, to my mind, the United States, you know, it did not go well. But we put so much money into the afghan government, into training the Afghan military police, to literally arming them. So, yes, you're right, you can say it is two separate items, withdrawing from the war and how it was done. But in my mind, you can't guarantee anything in a military operation. And I would be critical I especially have great heart for those who lost their lives, our service people who put themselves on the line first. But I got to say that it is a difficult task. I don't think you could have said it could be done easily or with some precision that would have prevented any problems. I just think it was a catastrophic situation, once the government and the military on the Afghan side collapsed so rapidly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. But there were a lot of predictions. Nobody thought it was going to happen in 11 days. But there were a lot of predictions that the government and military would collapse quickly. There is a lot of self- dilution going on or perhaps misleading of the public. By the way, 60 percent in that same \"Washington Post\"/ABC poll disapproved of Biden's handling of Afghanistan as opposed to the more than three quarters who liked the decision. Alex, there is one thing that's unspinnable, really just unspinnable at the media, and that is the Biden administration did leave, despite its promises, at least couple of hundred Americans behind and tens of thousands of Afghan allies who risked their lives to help us during the war."

      "speaker": "WILKES",

And I think that there was an attempt to do a lot of acrobatic wordplay at the press podium and an attempt for them to try to get their way out of this situation by sort of picking apart Peter Doocy's word, stranded. That was sort of hotly debated there. But in the end, we saw that Americans were left behind."

White House Chief of Staff Ron Klein says they are going to try to do that. And then there is this woman who was interviewed by \"Voice of America.\" She is 24 years old, she is from California, she is newly-married, she is pregnant, and she can't get out or she's worried about not getting out.

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think it is part of the story. But again, I don't think we should get lost into this very emotional story and lose sight of the bigger picture. Clearly, as you were saying earlier, this has been going on for some time, the idea that, you know, former President Trump said get out in May. President Biden delayed it until August. Why people decided that they could wait until the last moment or whatever? I think at some point, despite U.S. reaching out, telegrams, e-mails, telephone, people who were delaying, and I think they got caught. Do I therefore blame the American media or the president or the American military? At some point, you say they got out 100 plus thousand people. That's an incredible success, Howie."

So I don't think it's gone away. And to my mind, the comments like those by the congressman really are damaging. Again, they fit in and they do fly around, especially the conservative echo chamber, and influence the way Americans think without saying, hey, wait, this is an extremist sentiment that really has no grounding. In fact, it's not reality. But it's said in a way, bloodshed, it would make you think that this is something that's putting us as the American people at greater risk.

Just the other day, Secretary of State Tony Blinken held a news conference that dealt almost entirely with Americans who have been left behind and efforts by the administration to somehow get them out. Fox News carried it live. CNN and MSNBC did not. Fox News carried the Biden administration briefing live. Now, other important stories have emerged. The massive northeast flooding, the Texas abortion law which we are going to talk about, but the war in some places has just kind of ceased to exist."

So I think there are other stories. Remember, media is about ratings. That's kind of the urgent story. To pick up on something that Alex was saying a moment ago, though, we don't have the cameras, the kind of coverage inside. We don't have Americans on the ground there. So, again, in terms of the American audience, they may feel like they have heard this story, they know this story, they're involved in the controversy, and it would just be, you know, at that point, just kind of putting too much on the cake."

There are a lot of conservatives who are very pro-life who don't think this law is terribly serious in Texas. But nevertheless, it's out there and one day we expect that the Supreme Court may act on it. But for now, the Supreme Court let it go because it is an unusual law."

The controversial thing here, as you know, is that anybody can sue people involved in providing an abortion, not the woman, and if they prevail, get $10,000.

And basically, \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page making it sound like this was unforced error, giving Democrats some ammunition when they seem to be down and out. And so a lot of people think this Mississippi law that is going to come up before the Supreme Court this fall is a lot more serious. Fifteen weeks kind of standard enforcement, this Texas law deputizes people to sue people for abortion, and so a lot of folks don't think it will hold up if court, Howie."

A third of all small businesses are now gone forever, only half the jobs have been recovered as opposed to two thirds the national average, the rise in the cost of living. The average price of a home in California just hit $800,000, that's a 150 percent more or 250 percent more depending upon on which study you read above the national average. I'm asked about the decline in the quality of public education. Eighty percent of the kids educated in California are black and brown.

They're not likely to contract the coronavirus, they're not likely to get really sick, they're not likely to go to hospital and they're certainly not likely to die. I believe that's consistent with the science of people like Dr. Marty Makary from Johns Hopkins and Scott Atlas from Hoover. I think that's consistent. But the point is he's trying to turn it into a referendum against scare. Because he can't defend his record on crime, he can't defend his record on homelessness, he can't defend his record on the rise of cost of living.

A good friend of mine, Phil Valentine, who is a radio talk show host, and he died just a few weeks ago. It was a tragedy. He was a great guy. He was a wonderful talent.

There is an animal version of it. But it won a Nobel Peace Prize or rather a Nobel Prize for science as a great treatment in human beings for parasites and various things.

So, I think he's getting a bit of a bad rap there. More broadly, we're now up to 1,500 new deaths a day, average for the country. We haven't seen those numbers in a long time. Let me move to the Texas abortion law, we talked earlier about a lot of anger at the Supreme Court and at Texas on the left. But even some conservatives say it goes too far. It's too draconian by allowing anybody to sue doctors, counselors, even the Uber driver who drives a woman to a clinic to get an abortion after six months and gives a $10,000 reward if you win.

It's actually something she does to her child and it's irreversible and irrevocable. And I wish people would really think about that the ultimate way to resolve this is to deal with the fact of personhood. That when an individual has his or her life taken without due process, it's a violation of the fifth and 14th amendments. So, the sooner we come to the conclusion that an unborn child is in fact a human being, a person, then the fifth and 14th amendment will take care of all of the abortion questions because right now we're losing a million babies a year with no due process whatsoever."

USA Today fact checking who said President Biden didn't actually check his watch during a ceremony for families of the fallen soldiers at Dover. That it appeared to be afterwards.

Speaking of meteorologists, Willard Scott, a fixture on NBC's D.C. station after serving as the first Ronald McDonald, went on to become a kind of a folk hero on the Today Show has died. He was a lovely guy who wore funny costumes, he wished people happy birthday. And despite scorn from some colleagues he proudly embraced his bufoon act, saying I may be a corn ball but I am me and viewers just loved Willard.
