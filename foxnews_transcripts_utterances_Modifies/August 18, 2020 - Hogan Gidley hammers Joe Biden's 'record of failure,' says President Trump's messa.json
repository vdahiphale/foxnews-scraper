Flashback now to 2012 when President Obama was seeking reelection. The former president stole the show and his powerful speech, despite a weak economy, helped to put President Obama over the top.",

Joe Biden finished in fourth place that night. Normally, that would be the death of a campaign. A week later, we're in New Hampshire, right? Six months ago, Joe Biden finished fifth that night. And it was only at the end of February down here in South Carolina, Saturday night, February 29, where Joe Biden just swept the field. And now it has been his stage ever since. It's important to remember that. And just if you think about how we got to this stage at this point, you lose Iowa, you lose New Hampshire, you leave New Hampshire for the ballots or even in and then you win South Carolina and you run the table. That's how Biden has done it. Well, how does Donald Trump then get a second term in the White House, 270 is your number? These are all the states we think we're locked in. Everything in gray, we think it's a tossup right now.  Let's say, Texas is not as blue as they think. We'll give that to Trump. Give Georgia to Trump as well. What did he do four years ago that he needs to do again? He's got to thread that needle. He won Florida by about a point, North Carolina by three and a half, Ohio by seven and a half. And then he'd be at 242. You mentioned battleground Arizona. He was there today. If he could hold that stays at 253, Iowa a bit earlier today. And still, he is not at the number 270.   Upper Midwest, Martha, this is where our focus goes yet again. Wisconsin yesterday, Minnesota as well. If you were to hold on to Wisconsin, he would still be one vote shy. If you were to flip Minnesota, rather, he would still be one vote shy. So, this is the scenario we start to throw in here. What I haven't talked about is Pennsylvania. So many times, Martha, we're going to keep coming back to Pennsylvania and the 20 electoral votes, that seems to be the key for Trump or Biden in order to get victory in 2020.  One of the things I'll show you here, Martha, toward the end of August is where we find ourselves Democratic Convention, followed by the Republicans next week. And look what you get six weeks from tonight. That is debate number one between Biden and Trump in whatever form that takes as of now in Cleveland, Ohio. That's the lay of the land, my lady.

HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, look, this campaign has built something that is quite frankly, the envy of the entire political universe, both with our ground game, our digital efforts, our ads on television, and we expect that to pull us through to the end, not to mention the fact we sure have the best candidate with the best message, the best work ethic and by far the best results. Let's be clear.  Joe Biden has a 50-year career of failure in elected office, so much so that his own boss for eight years, Barack Obama, who knows him pretty well at this point, tried to talk him out of running for president two times. Now, obviously, it didn't work this past time. But when you look at that record of failure, what you see is a complete dereliction of duty as it relates to the American people, the American worker, the American middle class. His decision on NAFTA kills 850,000 jobs, his decisions on China sent 3.5 million jobs directly away from American workers and over to China.   That's the difference and the decision that has to be made in this campaign and it's why this president, Donald Trump, has gone out around the country during this Democratic convention because he had to go to Minnesota, he had to go to Wisconsin, he had to go today to Arizona and then Pennsylvania later in the week because he knows if he gets his message out without the filter of the mainstream media, it resonates and the people are going to remember just all of the record setting successes in record setting time.",

We did see a 7 percent decline in the African American vote in 2016. So that, she's appealing, obviously, to suburban women, to all of the people that her voice resonates with from what we've seen in the past.

And I have to be clear, the leadership the Democrats are talking about, that kind of leadership allows a known rabid open anti-Semite and Linda Sarsour to speak to the American people. John Kerry, who sent billions of dollars in cash to Iran and then admitted that money would probably be used against Americans in acts of terrorism, and the leadership that doesn't exist in Democrat cities that have been allowed to devolve into lawlessness with death and destruction, burning churches, burning federal buildings. All of these cities have been controlled by Democrats for decades. You'd think we'd hear a little tidbit or two of how they're going to stop all that. None of that was mentioned.

Joe Biden finished in fourth place that night. Normally, that would be the death of a campaign. A week later, we're in New Hampshire, right? Six months ago, Joe Biden finished fifth that night. And it was only at the end of February down here in South Carolina, Saturday night, February 29, where Joe Biden just swept the field. And now it has been his stage ever since. It's important to remember that. And just if you think about how we got to this stage at this point, you lose Iowa, you lose New Hampshire, you leave New Hampshire for the ballots or even in and then you win South Carolina and you run the table. That's how Biden has done it. Well, how does Donald Trump then get a second term in the White House, 270 is your number? These are all the states we think we're locked in. Everything in gray, we think it's a tossup right now. Let's say, Texas is not as blue as they think. We'll give that to Trump. Give Georgia to Trump as well. What did he do four years ago that he needs to do again? He's got to thread that needle. He won Florida by about a point, North Carolina by three and a half, Ohio by seven and a half. And then he'd be at 242. You mentioned battleground Arizona. He was there today. If he could hold that stays at 253, Iowa a bit earlier today. And still, he is not at the number 270. Upper Midwest, Martha, this is where our focus goes yet again. Wisconsin yesterday, Minnesota as well. If you were to hold on to Wisconsin, he would still be one vote shy. If you were to flip Minnesota, rather, he would still be one vote shy. So, this is the scenario we start to throw in here. What I haven't talked about is Pennsylvania. So many times, Martha, we're going to keep coming back to Pennsylvania and the 20 electoral votes, that seems to be the key for Trump or Biden in order to get victory in 2020. One of the things I'll show you here, Martha, toward the end of August is where we find ourselves Democratic Convention, followed by the Republicans next week. And look what you get six weeks from tonight. That is debate number one between Biden and Trump in whatever form that takes as of now in Cleveland, Ohio. That's the lay of the land, my lady.

So, I mean, obviously, this is looking like a very tight race and the polls have been tightening in recent weeks.

HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, look, this campaign has built something that is quite frankly, the envy of the entire political universe, both with our ground game, our digital efforts, our ads on television, and we expect that to pull us through to the end, not to mention the fact we sure have the best candidate with the best message, the best work ethic and by far the best results. Let's be clear. Joe Biden has a 50-year career of failure in elected office, so much so that his own boss for eight years, Barack Obama, who knows him pretty well at this point, tried to talk him out of running for president two times. Now, obviously, it didn't work this past time. But when you look at that record of failure, what you see is a complete dereliction of duty as it relates to the American people, the American worker, the American middle class. His decision on NAFTA kills 850,000 jobs, his decisions on China sent 3.5 million jobs directly away from American workers and over to China. That's the difference and the decision that has to be made in this campaign and it's why this president, Donald Trump, has gone out around the country during this Democratic convention because he had to go to Minnesota, he had to go to Wisconsin, he had to go today to Arizona and then Pennsylvania later in the week because he knows if he gets his message out without the filter of the mainstream media, it resonates and the people are going to remember just all of the record setting successes in record setting time."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

We see Joe Biden not out on the campaign trail, and you see President Trump packing in two states, three states in a day, going to these battleground states that Bill Hemmer just pointed to. But one of the things that's interesting about Michelle Obama's get out the vote effort and she said, we need to vote like we voted back in 2012 and 2008. We did see a 7 percent decline in the African American vote in 2016. So that, she's appealing, obviously, to suburban women, to all of the people that her voice resonates with from what we've seen in the past. But I think it's interesting that Alice Johnson is on the list for the RNC and that will be President Trump's response in terms of what he offers to those voters. Right?"

      "utterance": "Right. Absolutely. And look, I understand people love Michelle Obama's speech, but neither Michelle Obama nor Barack Obama are actually on the ticket. Sadly, for the Democrats, it's Joe Biden. Tonight's theme is about leadership. And I have to be clear, the leadership the Democrats are talking about, that kind of leadership allows a known rabid open anti-Semite and Linda Sarsour to speak to the American people. John Kerry, who sent billions of dollars in cash to Iran and then admitted that money would probably be used against Americans in acts of terrorism, and the leadership that doesn't exist in Democrat cities that have been allowed to devolve into lawlessness with death and destruction, burning churches, burning federal buildings. All of these cities have been controlled by Democrats for decades. You'd think we'd hear a little tidbit or two of how they're going to stop all that. None of that was mentioned. In fact, they didn't even mention the two words, Joe Biden for like the - for the first two hours of the thing because they know how unpopular he is. And every time he pops out of the hide hole, it becomes a serious problem for Democrats."

On one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort, the committee found that Manafort's presence on the campaign and proximity to Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over and acquire confidential information on the Trump campaign. The intelligence panel also not pulling any punches about the role played by Russia's Vladimir Putin, writing, the committee found that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian effort to hack computer networks and accounts affiliated with the Democratic Party and leak information damaging to Hillary Clinton and her campaign for president. Acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio offering this conclusion, we can say without any hesitation that the committee found absolutely no evidence that then candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election. The panel's top Democrat says the report was thorough and calls the findings troubling."

That's the oldest motive known to man. He was cash strapped. He thought they owed him money. So, he's showing internal polls for himself, not to help Donald Trump, but to help himself. So, I congratulate Senate Intel. I mean, they worked hard on it. But in terms of takeaways, when you're talking about a Ukrainian or Russian whose name we can barely pronounce, that is not the narrative we've been fed over the last four years that Trump colluded with Russia. There's no evidence of that. And keep in mind what Marco said. Marco didn't say there's insufficient evidence. We couldn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. No evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia."

You've got the Mueller Report and you've got this Senate Intel report, which were independent and have the exact same finding. The FBI was flawed, according to the report, when it came to their handling of the Steele dossier and how seriously they took it and what they used it to achieve."

Number two, there is no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign in Russia. And number three, the world's premier law enforcement agency continues to not meet our basic expectations. It is one thing, Martha, to use information that's not been vetted. That's bad, but that's one thing. It is another thing to use information, you know, is unreliable. You know, it is not accurate and still continue to use it. This is Jim Comey's problem. But quite frankly, Martha, it has become Chris Wray's problem. He was warned by Devin, by Paul, by Bob Goodlatte, you can be part of the cleanup crew or you can be part of the cover up crew. And there are more things coming out with the Durham Report that show the FBI's primary concern is its own reputation."

You need documents before you interview witnesses. I mean, John Brennan has been around a long time. You need documents to hand to him and say, what did you mean in late 2015? What did you mean in 2016 What do your notes mean? Your handwritten notes. So, documents are great. John Durham is a good prosecutor.

Those so-called cages that she referred to, let's make clear, those so-called cages were actually built in 2014 and '15 under the Obama administration and I object to the use of the word cages as well. Those facilities were designed to take the overcrowded facilities that were never designed for children and families into a facility that was brand- new, thousands of square feet so we can better care for those families and kids and at that time, again built under the Obama administration, they were allotted as an absolute great thing. It's outrageous. And quickly, to talk, we are still talking about these individuals being peaceful protesters. Again, that's just not true. That's absolutely mischaracterizing what's happening. If you see rubber bullets going in a direction, I guarantee it's because that protester has now become a violent criminal opportunist, that's the fact and that's the truth, Martha."

Look, the wall as you know as you announced, we're here to really a tremendous achievement of 300-miles of wall system being built and that wall system it's not just about illegal immigration, Martha. That wall system increases our capability to stop drugs, for example, poured into this country that killed tens of thousands of Americans every single year. It gives us the ability to stop gangs from coming into this country like the MS-13, the most violent prolific gang that we've ever seen in this country that use machetes to hack up their victims and leave them decapitated. It gives us the ability operationally to improve our capability to stop criminal aliens from entering this country, meaning with violent criminal past to stop them from reoffending more American victims. That's the truth. What Mr. Biden said back then is the truth and what President Trump is saying today is the truth and we need the present administration that understands the threat and understands that border security is national security and open borders will not protect this country."

That they believe in the rule of law and they don't believe with lawlessness, and they believe that we've got to have an administration and president who understands that and who gets that, and it is for the rule of law. Again, if you look at what's going on in the border right now, we, America because of this present administration and the great men and women at CBP, we are better off, the health, safety and security of this country is better off today than we were three and a half years ago."

He thought about running it '84 but never sent in the paperwork and now at 77, he is about to be the nominee.

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I would agree with you in so many ways, Martha, because I think it's a moment when you see an increase in the number of Democrats who self-identify as liberal. It's about half of the party now. It's never been that high. Typically, the party was principally constituted of moderates and conservative Democrats. So now here comes a moderate Democrat representing a party that's increasingly liberal. Of course, I think that's a reflection of the feeling that the, you know, especially among the younger people, that they wish the party was more aggressive in its response to Donald Trump."

Donald Trump is a disaster. At some point, there is going to have to be more of what Joe Biden wants to do in the future. Maybe that's tomorrow night with Kamala Harris and the platform. Maybe it's Thursday night. It has to be Thursday night. But it will be interesting to see when we stop from being, the argument being just simply I'm not Joe -- I'm not Donald Trump, I'm Joe Biden instead, and start being to flesh out what Joe Biden really is."

      "utterance": "Yes, but the problem is that that's not what's motivating Democratic voters. They're not -- they are not for Joe Biden. They are against Donald Trump. If you look at all the polls, Trump voters would walk over broken glass to get to go vote for him they are so enthusiastic about Donald Trump. The Democratic voters are, you know, they might not even get out of their beds. They'd mail in ballots. They are -- they are motivated -- they have negative enthusiasm. They want -- they want to get rid of Donald Trump. They are not for Joe Biden. There's a reason why this night is 50 years in the making. I mean, Joe Biden came to Washington in 1972 when I was five years old. He's tried to -- he started thinking about running when Ronald Reagan was President of the United States and he finally got the nomination. Why? Because he is useful to the left. They see him as their Trojan horse, he's this nice moderate, reasonable bipartisan vessel. And inside is hiding an army of socialists. As soon as they get through the White House gates, they're going to take over the country. So, you know, this is why he is the nominee. It's not because of any -- because Joe Biden has a vision. It's because Joe Biden is a useful vessel for the left."

And you think about people who sort of, it was their turn. Right? You've got Hillary Clinton, you've got John McCain, Mitt Romney in that category, Bob Dole in that category. That has not historically ended well even though he is ahead in the polls right now."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right, but you have a moment here. You know, I was just listening to what Karl and Marc were saying, I think you've got it to put in context. You got a country in which most of the people think the country is headed in the wrong direction, Martha. People are very concerned about the virus, about the economy, about racism and think that the record of the incumbent is a record of failure. So, you have people looking for an alternative and as a result, this election has become a referendum about Donald Trump. And of course, Donald Trump takes the air out of the room. You talk about big personalities. He's a big personality, dominant in terms of the new cycles and I think people react to him. I don't think that necessarily means anything bad about Joe Biden. People know Joe Biden. Remember, Trump has tried to paint him as some kind of radical or puppet of the left, you know. John Kasich last night at the convention --"
