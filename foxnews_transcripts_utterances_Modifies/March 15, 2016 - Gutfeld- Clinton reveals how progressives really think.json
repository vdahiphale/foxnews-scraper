The problem is it depends on a green lie. As the left fights against fossil fuels, fracking and oil exploration, you've got to wonder if they even care about how people live or die. Here's a question to greenies: Would you want your parents' respirator powered by a windmill? A spasmodic energy source, to put it politely? Fossil fuels have saved more lives than all progressive programs combined. From 1970 onward, world coal usage has doubled. According to green mouthpieces, this should have led to global horror. Instead, life expectancy and income rose dramatically, especially among the poor. A billion people's lives improved. No thanks to Al Gore or his dancing monkey, Leo.  But maybe we should applaud Hillary's honesty about coal and about Benghazi. It's refreshing to hear what a progressive really thinks, if you could call it that.",
