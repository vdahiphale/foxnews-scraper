Buckle up, because in 26 days, we have midterm elections, and the country's fate, not to put pressure on you, it's all in your hands.  And I have been telling you for months, the single most important midterm election in our lifetime. Democrats, the destroy Trump media, they have no shame. They're not backing down.  Eric Holder is trying to walk back his \"kick 'em while they're down\" comments. We're going to explain that.  We have a major moment today at the White House. Phenomenal. Kanye West meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office. And not surprisingly, the left is in a meltdown mode over it. You will not believe -- well, yes, I guess you should, because it's predictable -- one of the despicable comments that were made about Kanye. We've got the tape.  Also, our first lady, Melania Trump, breaks her silence on being the target of bullying. And we've got the evidence to back her up. And Democrats sinking to a new law and they're trying to win, their attempts to win in November. Exclusively, Project Veritas, tonight, has exposed an explosive undercover video, we will show it to you. We got a lot to get to.  All right. It's time for tonight's breaking news -- we're glad you're with us -- opening monologue.",

We need more -- as many as possible.  We need every neighborhood in the country safe for every American.   And when Kanye was being open and honest and looking for solutions and giving his opinions, when was the left doing? Attacking him. What's wrong with what he's saying? What about jobs, what about safe neighborhoods? And, of course, we see the predictable, vile, bludgeoning that we see, now sadly almost on a daily basis. The media has been relentless, even before Kanye even met with the president.  Some members of the abusively biased media brought up his struggles with mental illness. Really? This is sick.

What Kanye West, and millions of other Americans are now realizing, you know what, the Democrats had eight years, they gave us a failed agenda, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s. More debt than all presidents before him combined with Obama. Really? The first president never to hit 3 percent GDP growth.   Look at what's happening. The Trump agenda is creating a future for the forgotten men and women in this country that Democrats claim that they love so much. That's a future for every American. That's a future for our kids. Ask yourself this, why is the left so threatened by a meeting talking about prison reform, and about jobs, and a better economy, and about violence in some neighborhoods and some parts of the country? Is it because the Democratic Party is exposed for having failed all these years?  All of the hysteria surrounding Kanye's pro-Trump comments, is an admission that President Trump is making progress, executing on an agenda, lower taxes, less burdensome regulation, lower unemployment, economic prosperity?  Fourteen states record low unemployment, Hispanic unemployment record low.  Record low unemployment for African-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace?  And, of course, we have more kids, more youth jobs available than we have had in 50 years. Well, Kanye is experiencing is what African-American conservatives sadly have experienced for years -- mock, demonized, ridiculed, punished by the leftist machine for daring to think on their own and questioned big government policies that have crippled people in this country and have failed miserably. Now, the modern Democratic Party is devoid of any ideas or solutions, this tired scheme of redistribution, a proven total failure. And anyone who dares to try and work with President Trump to craft real solutions that really will help people and create safer neighborhoods, is vilified. We see it today. Just look at the number of Democratic leaders encouraging mob violence against their political opponents. Just yesterday, what do we show you, video of Obama's attorney general, the top cop in the country, for whatever, eight years, less than that. Six years. Eric Holder, they go low, ditch civility, kick Republicans when they're on the ground, kick 'em.  Take a look.",

And then there's more disturbing news about Sinema. Just yesterday, foxnews.com reported that she, quote, promised events at Arizona State University, get this, featuring a lawyer convicted for aiding an Islamist terror organization. And its leader, the lawyer in question, represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the 1990s for plotting to blow up the U.N. and FBI building and more, in Arizona. Republican Martha McSally, the Republican, anything a tight race. She happens to be an American hero that has served her country. I hope the people of Arizona are paying attention tonight. And the people of Tennessee are paying attention. By the way, the people in Nevada, I hope you are paying attention. Dean Heller has just a slight lead in some of the polls. That is an important seat. Marsha Blackburn, friend of show, squaring off against the phony that we exposed tonight, she is in a tight race in Tennessee. And, of course, Blackburn with a slight edge. Now, let's take a look at the House of Representatives. Now, we've been telling you 10 congressional districts tonight, these are the districts that will decide the balance of power in Washington, D.C. Do you want Nancy Pelosi as your speaker? Pay attention. Now, we're going to show 10 more House districts that voters need to keep an eye on. This will define the election results in 26 days. Arkansas, second district, where Republican incumbent French Hill in a serious battle with Democratic challenger Clarke Tucker.  Next in Iowa, their first district, Republican incumbent, Rob Blum's seat, this a Freedom Caucus member, at risk of being overtaken by Democrats, is one of the Democrats' best opportunities to snag a seat. If you're in that district, you need to vote. Now, let's stay in Iowa where the third district is absolutely in play.  GOP incumbent David Young has a tough fight, Trump won there by four points in 2016. Kansas, a few races to watch in Kansas, district two, Republican Steve Watkins, is taking on a Democrat, Paul Davis. Kentucky's third district, Republican incumbent Kevin Yoder. He's been challenged by Democrat Sharice Davids in a district that Hillary took by one point. That's going to be a tight race. Now you go to the Kentucky sixth district, where another incumbent, Republican Andy Barr in a tight race, against Amy McGrath. Let's go back to Nevada for a few critical races out there. Their third district, Republican Danny Tarkanian, yes, that Tarkanian, the son of, faces an uphill battle against Democrat Susie Lee. And then there's Nevada fourth, where the Republican candidate Hardy is taking on the Democrat Horsford.  Wisconsin's first district, another open seat contest, Republican Brian Steele is facing Democrat Randy Bryce. This is a race to replace Speaker Paul Ryan. We need that seat to stay Republican. By the way, might want to stay and vote for Scott Walker who has done an amazing job for the people of Wisconsin, he's in the fight of his life in 26 days. In West Virginia 3, GOP candidate Carol Miller up against Democrat Richard Ojeda. And we're just 26 days out. Once again, you have the chance to shock the world like you did two years ago. You've got to go vote. Joining with us reaction, former Clinton pollster, adviser, Mark Penn.

Democrats, the destroy Trump media, they have no shame. They're not backing down. Eric Holder is trying to walk back his \"kick 'em while they're down\" comments. We're going to explain that. We have a major moment today at the White House. Phenomenal. Kanye West meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office. And not surprisingly, the left is in a meltdown mode over it. You will not believe -- well, yes, I guess you should, because it's predictable -- one of the despicable comments that were made about Kanye. We've got the tape. Also, our first lady, Melania Trump, breaks her silence on being the target of bullying. And we've got the evidence to back her up. And Democrats sinking to a new law and they're trying to win, their attempts to win in November. Exclusively, Project Veritas, tonight, has exposed an explosive undercover video, we will show it to you. We got a lot to get to. All right.

We need more -- as many as possible.  We need every neighborhood in the country safe for every American. And when Kanye was being open and honest and looking for solutions and giving his opinions, when was the left doing? Attacking him. What's wrong with what he's saying? What about jobs, what about safe neighborhoods? And, of course, we see the predictable, vile, bludgeoning that we see, now sadly almost on a daily basis. The media has been relentless, even before Kanye even met with the president. Some members of the abusively biased media brought up his struggles with mental illness. Really? This is sick.

What Kanye West, and millions of other Americans are now realizing, you know what, the Democrats had eight years, they gave us a failed agenda, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s. More debt than all presidents before him combined with Obama. Really? The first president never to hit 3 percent GDP growth. Look at what's happening. The Trump agenda is creating a future for the forgotten men and women in this country that Democrats claim that they love so much. That's a future for every American. That's a future for our kids. Ask yourself this, why is the left so threatened by a meeting talking about prison reform, and about jobs, and a better economy, and about violence in some neighborhoods and some parts of the country? Is it because the Democratic Party is exposed for having failed all these years? All of the hysteria surrounding Kanye's pro-Trump comments, is an admission that President Trump is making progress, executing on an agenda, lower taxes, less burdensome regulation, lower unemployment, economic prosperity?  Fourteen states record low unemployment, Hispanic unemployment record low.  Record low unemployment for African-Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace? And, of course, we have more kids, more youth jobs available than we have had in 50 years. Well, Kanye is experiencing is what African-American conservatives sadly have experienced for years -- mock, demonized, ridiculed, punished by the leftist machine for daring to think on their own and questioned big government policies that have crippled people in this country and have failed miserably. Now, the modern Democratic Party is devoid of any ideas or solutions, this tired scheme of redistribution, a proven total failure. And anyone who dares to try and work with President Trump to craft real solutions that really will help people and create safer neighborhoods, is vilified. We see it today. Just look at the number of Democratic leaders encouraging mob violence against their political opponents. Just yesterday, what do we show you, video of Obama's attorney general, the top cop in the country, for whatever, eight years, less than that. Six years. Eric Holder, they go low, ditch civility, kick Republicans when they're on the ground, kick 'em.  Take a look."

I'm saying Republicans are undermining our democracy. Democrats need to be tough, proud and stand for the values we believe in. No, we didn't put words in Eric Holder's mouth. He said kick 'em. He made those comments. So, Eric Holder can sit and spin anyway he wants, you saw the smile on his face, a crowd that supported him. We're not stupid. We know you meant it. He meant exactly what he said.  And he should have just said, yes, that's how I feel, sorry. Words like that have consequences.

And then there's more disturbing news about Sinema. Just yesterday, foxnews.com reported that she, quote, promised events at Arizona State University, get this, featuring a lawyer convicted for aiding an Islamist terror organization. And its leader, the lawyer in question, represented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the 1990s for plotting to blow up the U.N. and FBI building and more, in Arizona. Republican Martha McSally, the Republican, anything a tight race. She happens to be an American hero that has served her country. I hope the people of Arizona are paying attention tonight. And the people of Tennessee are paying attention. By the way, the people in Nevada, I hope you are paying attention. Dean Heller has just a slight lead in some of the polls. That is an important seat. Marsha Blackburn, friend of show, squaring off against the phony that we exposed tonight, she is in a tight race in Tennessee. And, of course, Blackburn with a slight edge. Now, let's take a look at the House of Representatives. Now, we've been telling you 10 congressional districts tonight, these are the districts that will decide the balance of power in Washington, D.C. Do you want Nancy Pelosi as your speaker? Pay attention. Now, we're going to show 10 more House districts that voters need to keep an eye on. This will define the election results in 26 days. Arkansas, second district, where Republican incumbent French Hill in a serious battle with Democratic challenger Clarke Tucker. Next in Iowa, their first district, Republican incumbent, Rob Blum's seat, this a Freedom Caucus member, at risk of being overtaken by Democrats, is one of the Democrats' best opportunities to snag a seat. If you're in that district, you need to vote. Now, let's stay in Iowa where the third district is absolutely in play.  GOP incumbent David Young has a tough fight, Trump won there by four points in 2016. Kansas, a few races to watch in Kansas, district two, Republican Steve Watkins, is taking on a Democrat, Paul Davis. Kentucky's third district, Republican incumbent Kevin Yoder. He's been challenged by Democrat Sharice Davids in a district that Hillary took by one point. That's going to be a tight race. Now you go to the Kentucky sixth district, where another incumbent, Republican Andy Barr in a tight race, against Amy McGrath. Let's go back to Nevada for a few critical races out there. Their third district, Republican Danny Tarkanian, yes, that Tarkanian, the son of, faces an uphill battle against Democrat Susie Lee. And then there's Nevada fourth, where the Republican candidate Hardy is taking on the Democrat Horsford. Wisconsin's first district, another open seat contest, Republican Brian Steele is facing Democrat Randy Bryce. This is a race to replace Speaker Paul Ryan. We need that seat to stay Republican. By the way, might want to stay and vote for Scott Walker who has done an amazing job for the people of Wisconsin, he's in the fight of his life in 26 days. In West Virginia 3, GOP candidate Carol Miller up against Democrat Richard Ojeda. And we're just 26 days out. Once again, you have the chance to shock the world like you did two years ago. You've got to go vote. Joining with us reaction, former Clinton pollster, adviser, Mark Penn.
