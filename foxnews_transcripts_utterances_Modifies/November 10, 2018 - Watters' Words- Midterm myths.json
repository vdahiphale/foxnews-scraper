      "sentences": "Now, the media is worse than your whole weatherman. No wonder nobody trusts the press. Going on to this weekend, Republicans have won three additional seats in the Senate and lost only 30 seats in the House. Just half of what Obama and Clinton lost in their first midterms.  Plus Republicans won key governorships in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire. Critical states to hold for President Trump's reelection campaign. Let's look at some more propaganda that went up in smoke. The media told us that Barack Obama still had juice, but Obama still has the midterm jinx. The former President he went one for five for the big ticket candidates that he campaigned for aggressively. Abrams for Georgia governor lost. Gillum for Florida governor losing. Nelson for Florida senator, losing. Donnelly for Indiana senator lost. Only Sinema in Arizona is barely ahead right now and that could change.  Donald Trump went 9 for 11 in the big state races he rallied in during the last two weeks before the election. What about the celebrity endorsements and campaign appearances? Did those do the trick for Democrats? Stacey Abrams in Georgia endorsed by Oprah lost. Beto O'Rourke in Texas endorsed by Beyonce and LeBron James and others lost. Andrew Gillum in Florida endorsed by Didi and Chelsea Handler losing. Phil Bredesen in Tennessee endorsed by Taylor Swift, lost.  Celebrities have become the kiss of death for Democrats. Now, remember when the media told us the millennials hated Trump so much that they were going to turn out and vote in record numbers this midterm. No. Millennials made up just 12% of the electorate. The same percentage of millennials who turned out in the last two midterms. Speaking of percentages. Let's look at the polls. Now, statewide polls were generally within the margin of error this year, but seemed to undercount Republicans by 2% in key races.  So let's look at the winning and losing pollsters in the big statewide match ups. Missouri, Now, Hawley won by about six points there. The worst performing poll was NBC News Marist who had McCaskill up three and the best poll, Trafalgar Group had Hawley, plus four.   And in the Florida Senate, final result there Scott 0.2% margin of victory and still counting. Now, the worst poll there Quinnipiac had Nelson up seven, the best poll again, Trafalgar Group had Scott plus two. And the Florida governorship, deSantis winning with about 0.7% of the vote. Worst again, Quinnipiac had Gillum up 7%. And best again, Trafalgar Group with deSantis three points ahead. And let's take a look at Arizona in the Senate, final result there, Sinema with about a half a percentage point of victory, but that's still being counted. Worst there, NBC News Marist had Sinema up six points going into election day and the best performing poll, Emerson had Sinema up one. Taking a look at Wisconsin governors. Evers beating Walker by a little over 1%. Worst poll again, NBC News Marist had Evers plus 10 and the best performing poll there, Marquette which had it at a tie. And there you have the polling team at Trafalgar Group had a great year, but the folks over at NBC News and Quinnipiac, check your samples, guys.  So leading up to 2020 when the media starts tipping the scales with predictions and push polls, telling you Obama has coattails, celebrity endorsements matter and it's the year of the millennial, take a step back and remember these words, \"Watters' Words.\"  And here to react, Donald Trump for President advisory board member Gina Loudon and Fox News national security strategist and author of \"Why We Fight,\" Dr. Sebastian Gorka. All right, ladies first, Gina, what do you think about \"Watters' Words?\"",

I'll give you two examples of what really was the underlying dynamic. You have people like Ron deSantis who I campaigned for who cleaved to the Make America Great Again agenda was proud of being a soldier for Donald Trump's Make America Great Again agenda and what happens? He wins. Then you have people such as the district where I live in in Virginia, Barbara Comstock, incumbents Republican congresswoman in her last flyer through my post box doesn't mention anywhere Donald Trump, doesn't mention the last two years.

He's the Commander-in-Chief and he can characterize something happening at our border however he wants. It's an invasion, it's an incursion, it's an intrusion.

Going on to this weekend, Republicans have won three additional seats in the Senate and lost only 30 seats in the House. Just half of what Obama and Clinton lost in their first midterms. Plus Republicans won key governorships in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and New Hampshire. Critical states to hold for President Trump's reelection campaign. Let's look at some more propaganda that went up in smoke. The media told us that Barack Obama still had juice, but Obama still has the midterm jinx. The former President he went one for five for the big ticket candidates that he campaigned for aggressively. Abrams for Georgia governor lost. Gillum for Florida governor losing. Nelson for Florida senator, losing. Donnelly for Indiana senator lost. Only Sinema in Arizona is barely ahead right now and that could change. Donald Trump went 9 for 11 in the big state races he rallied in during the last two weeks before the election. What about the celebrity endorsements and campaign appearances? Did those do the trick for Democrats? Stacey Abrams in Georgia endorsed by Oprah lost. Beto O'Rourke in Texas endorsed by Beyonce and LeBron James and others lost. Andrew Gillum in Florida endorsed by Didi and Chelsea Handler losing. Phil Bredesen in Tennessee endorsed by Taylor Swift, lost. Celebrities have become the kiss of death for Democrats. Now, remember when the media told us the millennials hated Trump so much that they were going to turn out and vote in record numbers this midterm. No. Millennials made up just 12% of the electorate. The same percentage of millennials who turned out in the last two midterms. Speaking of percentages. Let's look at the polls. Now, statewide polls were generally within the margin of error this year, but seemed to undercount Republicans by 2% in key races. So let's look at the winning and losing pollsters in the big statewide match ups. Missouri, Now, Hawley won by about six points there. The worst performing poll was NBC News Marist who had McCaskill up three and the best poll, Trafalgar Group had Hawley, plus four. And in the Florida Senate, final result there Scott 0.2% margin of victory and still counting. Now, the worst poll there Quinnipiac had Nelson up seven, the best poll again, Trafalgar Group had Scott plus two. And the Florida governorship, deSantis winning with about 0.7% of the vote. Worst again, Quinnipiac had Gillum up 7%. And best again, Trafalgar Group with deSantis three points ahead. And let's take a look at Arizona in the Senate, final result there, Sinema with about a half a percentage point of victory, but that's still being counted. Worst there, NBC News Marist had Sinema up six points going into election day and the best performing poll, Emerson had Sinema up one. Taking a look at Wisconsin governors. Evers beating Walker by a little over 1%. Worst poll again, NBC News Marist had Evers plus 10 and the best performing poll there, Marquette which had it at a tie. And there you have the polling team at Trafalgar Group had a great year, but the folks over at NBC News and Quinnipiac, check your samples, guys. So leading up to 2020 when the media starts tipping the scales with predictions and push polls, telling you Obama has coattails, celebrity endorsements matter and it's the year of the millennial, take a step back and remember these words, \"Watters' Words.\" And here to react, Donald Trump for President advisory board member Gina Loudon and Fox News national security strategist and author of \"Why We Fight,\" Dr. Sebastian Gorka. All right, ladies first, Gina, what do you think about \"Watters' Words?\""

I'll give you two examples of what really was the underlying dynamic. You have people like Ron deSantis who I campaigned for who cleaved to the Make America Great Again agenda was proud of being a soldier for Donald Trump's Make America Great Again agenda and what happens? He wins. Then you have people such as the district where I live in in Virginia, Barbara Comstock, incumbents Republican congresswoman in her last flyer through my post box doesn't mention anywhere Donald Trump, doesn't mention the last two years. What happens to the incumbent rhino, she gets crushed."

But they're not going to be able to attract the votes of the say the Midwestern states or the southern states that used to, in some cases be traditionally Democrat.

We should get down on bended knee and thank the founding fathers for their genius. This is why we have the Electoral College. This is why we guarantee that these urban centers have become hives of radical left- wing politics can't dominate rural America. So whether it's 2016 or whether it's 2018, the Electoral College is incredibly important and so is the system that we have. It's not first pass to post.

And what we've seen and I'm not accusing anybody of stealing elections, but I am just saying, it looks fishy down in Florida what's happening. All of a sudden, on Tuesday night you have Gillum and you have Nelson who lost, but you had Rick Scott win by about from 60,000 votes to 80,000 0 votes apiece, and then as the days go on, you start coming up with new votes.

But, Jesse, I think one of the really important things to note here is that, you know, stealing elections is evil. Nobody doubts that. But the left has so painted Donald Trump and his administration and even his supporters like myself as evil that anything you do to them is okay, even if it's stealing elections.

So, I just want to start off before we get to the whole arm push whether it was or whether it wasn't. This is the President of the United States. He's the Commander-in-Chief and he can characterize something happening at our border however he wants. It's an invasion, it's an incursion, it's an intrusion. He has authority over the border when it comes to national security. Remember, Barack Obama in Benghazi, he said that terrorist attack was a protest over a video. Now, that was an extreme mischaracterization of the truth and the media never challenged him on that at all. They let him slide on that. So to have Acosta come up over a difference of opinion, over the choice of words and try to argue with the President in such a rude and disrespectful way, I thought was uncalled for and just yanking the press pass is basically just saying, \"Listen, Jim, get on the time out, cool off for a second and we'll let you back next week.\" Dinesh, what do you think?"

I don't know if this is medically possible that you physically grow, but emotionally, you remain an infant and intellectually, because when you're an emotional infant, you want to grab something, you don't want to stop, you don't know enough, you want another cookie, another piece of candy and you won't take no for an answer.

There are dozens of other reporters in there, good ones, by the way. John Karl, ABC; Jeff Mason, Reuters, John Roberts from Fox News; Haley Jackson, NBC. They are not trying to ask four questions in this case. And remember the way Acosta started that. He says, \"I want to challenge you,\" and then he goes into a lecture around whether it's an invasion or not. This is the mid-40s version of the captain of the debate team, right, and that's not ..."

So for him, I give him an A plus on that. But aside from that, Michelle Obama needs to learn something that I learned in the military called integrity. She doesn't even uphold the fact, she will say that Trump is xenophobic, well her husband was forcing the exact same policies and laws. And by the way, I will add that I did have the pleasure of meeting President Trump. I'm a Hispanic American and he didn't throw his chancla at me and rock and say, \"Get out of the White House.\" So he is not xenophobic. It's ridiculous."

That is certainly valuable and should be respected. He still has ..."

Finding true love is difficult for anybody. But if you are a Trump supporter, you may get a little resistance when trying to find a date. So my next guest created a new dating app named Donald Daters that's specifically tailored just for Trump voters. Joining me now, the founder of Donald Daters, Emily Moreno and Jared Barker, who has signed up to find love. All right, Emily, did you create this because you saw that people that supported Donald Trump might be having trouble in the dating world?"

      "speaker": "EMILY MORENO, FOUNDER, DONALD DATERS",

      "speaker": "BARKER",

Do you see a risk there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORENO",

      "utterance": "I think that politics and love is definitely - you can have politics and love if you choose to, but with Donald Daters, what we offer is you don't have to just talk politics. Now, on a lot of these main stream apps, it becomes a deal breaker and the way I see it is this should be an icebreaker."

Jared, when you are online and you're on the Donald Dater scene, would you not even consider dating a Hillary supporter and you are just interested in dating Donald Trump supporters? What if there was a Hillary supporter and she was a knockout and you were infatuated with her, but I mean, she was just a crazy radical, would you make an exception?"
