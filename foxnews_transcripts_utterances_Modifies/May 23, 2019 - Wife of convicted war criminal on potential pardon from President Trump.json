Less than two hours ago, President Trump issuing a memo calling for the declassification of all materials related to the potential spying that occurred against the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. Rudy Giuliani was on this show last week telling us it was coming. And true to his word, this decision has come down.  Now, there are a lot of unknowns at this moment about the timeline of when we will have access and you'll have access to these documents and what in fact will be revealed. But for what lawmakers hope to find, we are joined by Congressman Mark Meadows, Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus.  Congressman, what is the most important thing we could learn from these documents?",

Additionally what we've got to find, Laura, is the additional documents in terms of what they knew, when they knew it.

I mean, you can't even wrap your mind around this problem. We were just at the border. We reported from there. We tried to bring you the story. But this means that in the course of this year, a million border crossers will have entered the United States, and most of them, of course, would be released into the United States. And as a reference point, that's more than the populations of six U.S. states and Washington, D.C. Do you think our country can handle that? Do any of you want that? Do you want to pay for it? Instead of sticking around D.C. to pass a bill that would provide aid to our border efforts and actually beds for children who have no place to stay, well, Democrats would rather lob ghoulish accusations at the administration and the men and women serving to keep our border safe."

Think about this. Both Joe Biden, the 2020 front-runner, and Speaker Pelosi are not just out- of-step with the American people on key issues. To watch them, to observe them, we see that they've kind of lost a step or two or three. Period. I mean, they look like they belong in commercials for visiting angels.

Democrats alone are to blame for the shameless overcapacity situation at our Border Patrol stations we just talked about with the DHS Secretary and the horrendous effects of the crisis, and what it has on the health and welfare of Americans and illegal immigrants.

But they're going to do the real investigation on Capitol Hill. They couldn't investigate their way out of a paper bag. This is all politics. Nancy Pelosi will continue to do what she just did in that sound bite - to dangle the prospect of impeachment, to mollify her nasty base of radicals, and of course, to irk the President. And this is perhaps the most serious concern of all. Pelosi is chipping away at the foundation of our Constitutional Republic that when one side loses, the other side accepts the outcome of the election. I still remember when they were wondering if Trump was going to accept the outcome if Hillary won. Now she's on the other foot. Democrats have never seen Trump as a legitimate President though. The queen of San Francisco has picked up where the deep state left off."
