Let's bring in our panel, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.  Jeff, at the White House they are still holding onto this optimism, but it is starting to kind of drag on. The president said it could be six hours or six weeks. It's definitely leaning towards six weeks at this point.   JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": It certainly is. And one thing he didn't say, Bret, was six months. They do have a deadline. They do need to get this done this year. He wants some of that money to be injected into the economy by next year, and he's going to have a whole new political reality next year with people in Congress beginning to run for reelection. So it is absolutely dragging on, and though the White House says it's not frustrated, it's hard not to see some frustration there with the fact that one of the main reasons it's dragging on is disagreement within the Democratic Party.",

On the surface that appears to have been an effort to make her more electable by courting moderate and conservative voters. If so, she may have overcompensated. Arizona is no West Virginia, and no other swing state Senator vexed Democratic leadership so thoroughly.

And is that perceived to be more progressive? Yes, but it really isn't. Here's the problem that we have with our Senator in Arizona and that she has. You mentioned it, you said it, Bret, popularity. Is that what she's concerned about? Because if she's concerned about her constituency, her constituents actually support this.  And speaking of West Virginia, which is more conservative than Arizona in her state, Joe Manchin's constituents in that state also support what the Democrats are trying to do. It bothers me that I see this in my party, but I am not surprised. I have seen it on the right when you have your Tea Party faction. I see it on the left with the progressive faction.

Even $1.5 trillion is going to be too big.  But back to Arizona. It's a fact that Senator Sinema is more popular than Senator Kelly, the Democrat from Arizona, the other Democrat from Arizona. So she has figured her stayed out better than the senator who is supporting all of this in the United States Senate. So I think the Democrats are still going through this very difficult strain of having a three vote majority in the House and a zero vote majority in the even tied Senate, and it's showing.
