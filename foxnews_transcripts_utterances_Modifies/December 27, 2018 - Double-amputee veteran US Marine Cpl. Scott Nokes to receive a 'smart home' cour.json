Turns out not even combat zones are immune from this horrific disease. It was a time in America when we were told politics at least ended at the water's edge. Yet now, Democratic lawmakers, some in the media have found yet another way to slam President Trump. First, they went after him for not going to the battlefield. Then, he and the first lady paid a holiday visit to our troops in Iraq. And the critics quickly pivoted to more attacks over a nice gesture.",

Around 1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this week alone. And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody by CBP, the first deaths of children in CBP custody for a decade.  As for the El Paso situation, immigration and customs enforcement officials say they have little choice but to release the immigrants there because of, decades of inaction by Congress. That they say has limited their ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally and set limits on how long they can hold those families.   So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso where aid groups are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.  DYLAN CORBETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (through translator): They have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now, they've been released.

And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown over President Trump's demand for a border wall that he says could stem the flow of illegal immigration.  Now some conservative commentators have pointed out that many Democrats supported the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which mandated 600 miles of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico and the 2013 immigration reform bill that called for 700 miles of pedestrian fencing. But consensus as we know it almost impossible to find right now. And a fence, of course, is physically and symbolically different to a wall. The Berlin Fence would have sounded very different to the Berlin Wall.  And Mr. Gorbachev tear down this fence, would have sounded very different to Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall.

Turns out not even combat zones are immune from this horrific disease. It was a time in America when we were told politics at least ended at the water's edge. Yet now, Democratic lawmakers, some in the media have found yet another way to slam President Trump. First, they went after him for not going to the battlefield. Then, he and the first lady paid a holiday visit to our troops in Iraq. And the critics quickly pivoted to more attacks over a nice gesture."

I'm Ed Henry, in again for Martha MacCallum, on the growing backlash over that petty criticism in moments. But first, the same nastiness is infecting the battle over funding for the wall on our southern border. Breaking tonight, a top Republican says \"the needle has moved toward a very long shutdown.\" That remark made to Fox News a short time ago but Congressman Mark Meadows signals not just that the shutdown is very likely to extend into the first week of January or maybe longer.

Around 1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this week alone. And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody by CBP, the first deaths of children in CBP custody for a decade. As for the El Paso situation, immigration and customs enforcement officials say they have little choice but to release the immigrants there because of, decades of inaction by Congress. That they say has limited their ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally and set limits on how long they can hold those families. So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso where aid groups are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today."

And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown over President Trump's demand for a border wall that he says could stem the flow of illegal immigration. Now some conservative commentators have pointed out that many Democrats supported the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which mandated 600 miles of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico and the 2013 immigration reform bill that called for 700 miles of pedestrian fencing. But consensus as we know it almost impossible to find right now. And a fence, of course, is physically and symbolically different to a wall. The Berlin Fence would have sounded very different to the Berlin Wall. And Mr. Gorbachev tear down this fence, would have sounded very different to Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall. As so, if there is to be some sort of consensus in the future, Ed, it may turn on language on building and most especially talking about fences and barriers rather than walls. Ed."

I mean, the problem is we have angel families, it's an organization of parents and loved ones of people who have been killed by illegal aliens. We have got to stop that. We've got to get it under control, and I hate to sound like I'm politicizing this because I'm not. Because I really have tremendous sympathy for this officer. But we have got to step it up as a Congress as of the United States and get this border wall built because it's the first step at restoring national security on this issue."

Let's start with the Democrats because of what I mentioned with the president's tweet a short time ago. It's rare this president quotes Barack Obama. But he quotes that tweet from 2011, where Barack Obama in a State of the Union address, this wasn't just some throwaway, said, \"We finally need to do something about cracking down on illegal immigration, that's 2011. What in the world have the Democrats done for the last seven years?"

They want open borders, they have supported legislation to authorize sanctuary cities throughout the country, and they've just gotten completely to the -- to the left wing of their party. And I just think it's antithetical to what most Americans want because we know we need the security and we know we need to change our immigration laws. But we have to enforce those laws. But before you get to that, you have to secure your border. And the best way to do that is a wall barrier -- a wall, actually."

In which, over 60 Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted for this. Including Chuck Schumer, all kinds of other folks that had 700 miles of they called it fencing. But why the flip-flop now? They were for fencing, walling, whatever you want to call it in 2013, but not now."

I think this is ultimately they do not want Donald Trump to get a victory. It was a linchpin to the Trump campaign. Republicans ran on this part of our platform. And you know what, I just don't believe that they think that this is a good thing to do for politics. And I really have a problem with that because that's placing politics above the safety and security of this country."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "All right, Congressman, I said it was going to come after both party. So, I mentioned what the Democrats have done or not done in recent years. What about the Republicans? Now, the Democrats defend those previous votes for the wall in part by saying they were getting something. They didn't really necessarily want a wall, but they were getting a path to citizenship for millions of illegals who are in the country now. I see the president now saying, I want $5 billion in funding to get the government back open. $5 billion for the wall what are the Democrats getting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But, Congressman, pardon me, you and I both know that's not what Nancy Pelosi's priorities, that's not what Chuck Schumer's priority is. So, what I'm trying to get at is, the president promise of the campaign the art of the deal, right? And so, part of the deal is he gets something, in this case, $5 billion. What -- why would Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer sign off on something where they're basically getting nothing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that you have to realize that there is a significant number of Democrats in this country that want border security. This is not to the -- to the broad Democrat Party that she's playing and the Chuck Schumer is playing to. They're playing to a narrow edge of their party. And that narrow edge, says, \"We want open borders.\" When you look at it, the people who are from independents and Democrats who voted for Donald Trump, they voted for him and he got -- he got the Republican Party nomination but the Democrats also voted for him when he started saying we're going to secure the border. We're going to build the border wall. But we're going to enforce our laws. When he did that, all of a sudden, the Rust Belt states that have been particularly hard hit by illegal immigration came to them. This would be a win for Democrats in my opinion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, right now they're dug in. At some point, their base is going to have to come to them say look, we want the government open. That's why the government shutdown is a leverage right now. You're not going to get there at this point because right now Chuck Schumer has said, we're not going to move off where we've been. That's why I think Mark Meadows said today, it's going to take longer. Going to take longer."

      "speaker": "CLAFFEY",
      "utterance": "So, I think that at this -- at this stage, the Democrats aren't getting too much, right? The president's asking for a lot. And from what I've heard, there hasn't been any real offers. You hear about them offering perhaps additional expansion or permanent status for the temporary protected status TPS recipients that the administration has slowly been eliminating. You hear them -- you know, that we just heard the congressman say that maybe, they would get the government open again. I think that that's not nearly enough. And if I'm Nancy Pelosi, I have a week until I get the House in my control. Why am I negotiating on anything right now?"

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Sure. And Bryan, when you get out of the politics, though, that may be good for Nancy Pelosi to wait and try at the beginning of January, open up and look like a hero. But I just mentioned, we have a cop killer on the loose right now in California who's an illegal immigrant."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Look, the broader issue, and including the gentleman that we are now trying to find is that we have a thousand to 3,000 people crossing the border every single day, both uninvited and unvetted. And so, there is a critical requirement by our Congress to solve this. Because every day we don't, we are increasing the risk of folks that are bringing themselves into this country, their families, their children, who we have seen two of them die. So this is a humanitarian issue, this is a security issue, and this is ultimately an economic issue because a lot of these folks are coming into the country, they're taking jobs that in turn depress the income that is the wages of people who are already here. So, this is a big problem that we need to solve not just because it's a wall or a fence but because it ties into so many other things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, and Lauren, what about the Democrats here who -- you know, I mentioned Barack Obama, 2011. President Trump retweeted that today, talking about cracking down on the illegal immigration. Bill Clinton did it in a State of the Union address, as well, many years before that. And yet, Democrat after Democrat now are against the wall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLAFFEY",
      "utterance": "That's mostly because the wall has become the symbol, right, for this populist anti-immigrant sentiment that they think that the president harbors. You know racist views et cetera. And what's lost in this conversation is when you say wall, physical barrier, fencing, other things, it's not actually what CBP says that they need. Most of the time when the Democrats have said that they would support border security, it's more personnel at the border CBP officers, it's additional technology like drone or other surveillance. It's tools that CBP can use to get operational control of the border. And that's what Democrats are traditionally supported in the past. And usually, they've supported it in conjunction with some form of pathway to legal citizenship for the illegal population that's already in the United States. So, when we talk about the Democrats before this, like for example, with the Gang of Eight bill. With the Gang of Eight bill, included massive provisions to increase legal immigration so they were getting a huge benefit to supporting border security which at that time was a non- political easy thing for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Bryan, I've got 30 seconds. To Lauren's point, why is it that Democrats in your own party, you are pretty tough in saying we need to crack down on the illegal immigration, but why there are other Democrats who fall back on what she said, which is that the president is a racist for wanting to do something that a lot of Americans think is actually common sense."

      "speaker": "WRIGHT",

So you're not giving in the party or people in Congress, that space to have those negotiations. And look, the second piece is our party has drifted hard left on this issue regarding the activists because of identity politics. We need to rebuild a base because we have abandoned rural America. We have really given up some of those traditional blue-collar voters."

When I first heard this news breaking, I said, this is absolutely fantastic. Republicans, Democrats, Americans we can all get behind this because there is literally nothing negative about the Commander-in-Chief going to visit troops who are in harm's way. And so this is real life for them. Every single day, they're going out on missions that are extremely dangerous. So they're not sitting there behind a desk in Washington D.C. researching the latest on political policy out of the Department of Defense. They're wondering if they're going to make it home tonight and if their butter -- buddy is going to too. So I think this criticism is absolutely ludicrous and they just want to criticize the President to criticize him.

Finally, he should have done it sooner but I think it's a good thing, Ed, and I think he gets credit for that. And some of the criticism goes too far. But I will say on two points it is absolutely fair to criticize the President. He told lies basically. I'll just say it. He said things that were not true to the troops about the fact that he said he was the first president to give them a pay raise in several years, that is not true. He said he gave them a period of 10 percent, that is also not true. It is absolutely fair to criticize that. He also did as you heard John Kirby say on another network, and let me tell you I know John Kirby. He is not a liberal Democrat. He's probably not even a Democrat as far as I know. He said that the President bringing in issues that are domestic political issues like the wall, going after Nancy Pelosi that substance is not appropriate, and that is fair to criticize."

I wanted to play this clip, December 6th, 2016 talking to the troops. And by the way, that's the picture of him signing autographs in 2008 that I mentioned earlier. So he signed autographs as well whether it's right or wrong, both sides have done it. Barack Obama was trying to be nice to the troops, so was President Trump. I'm not sure why that criticism. But then on your point about politicizing things with the troops, here's what Barack Obama said to the troops."

The United States of America is not a place where some citizens have to withstand greater scrutiny or carry a special I.D. card or prove that they're not an enemy from within. We're a country that has bled and struggled and sacrificed against that kind of discrimination, an arbitrary rule. In other words, we are a nation that at our best has been defined by hope and not fear."

Let me tell you what matters to those troops who were on the ground in Iraq. Some of who have been in Syria and who are back in Iraq now. They care about their Commander-in- chief who came to visit them. And you want to know why because him visiting them in country, in the war zone, says that they matter, that they are recognized and they're remembered by the American people. And so that's what they're going to take away from this, that the Commander-in-Chief took time out of his holiday schedule and came over into a combat zone to see them. That is what matters. And so when people are away from their families during the holidays, that's what they're going to remember not side comments against politics."

I am glad the President went to visit the troops. I think that going into the New Year, we as a country need to take a hard look at what our policy is in Syria, what it is in Iraq, who the next Secretary of Defense is going to be. These are bigger questions than political fights over a visit to troops which I think he was right to do, and I hope that the national security team is having those discussions right now because these are really important decisions we have to get right."

And there's a lot of nervousness in the market about what's going to happen next year. We are in a long-term growing economy and eventually we are going to hit a recession. Interest rates are going up. I don't think you can argue that the Fed increase in December can explain any of this. But the market knows that rates are going to be higher next year and that means--"

But to sort of decipher it for viewers I thought I heard Kevin Hassett, one of the president's economic advisors say that earnings are the mother's milk. And this is really important. He claims at least, earnings have been good and are going to continue being good. Is he wrong?"

I think the current estimates are they are going to come back a little bit from the predictions that people were making about a month ago which kind of raises Mary's point. How sustainable the recovery is and the growth is going into 2019 and beyond into 2020. I mean, in your introduction just before the commercial break you said what does it mean for people's wallets? I think the answer for that is hold on to your wallets. I mean, that's what the big money is doing on Wall Street. They are sitting on a lot of cash. They are waiting to see the bottom of this market. They don't know where it's going to be. Markets love predictability and now the watch word now is unpredictability anywhere you turn."

And you also have the shutdown, which if it drags on it's going to cost the economy. But I think the main problem here is that we don't know how much free money for so many years under the Bernanke and Janet Yellen Fed, how much did that inflate financial assets to levels that maybe they shouldn't be at in a real world?"

Just this week, the Huffington Post accusing her of this year's, quote, \"most shameful hijacking of feminism.\" Saying, quote, \"The shameful and shamefully affected cynicism of Collins politicking is uniquely insidious in this insidious year.

But as we have learned, since it has come to the fruition, is that, basically it's, you have to toe the liberal line. You can't just simply be a woman, you have to be a liberal woman. So, now Collins is being attacked for this.

Because most of the statistics revolving around today's current assault epidemic as we are told there is one, that's junk science. It is self-reported surveys that, you know, broadly the definition of sexual assault, so that pretty much anyone is a victim. And you know, there's a respondent, there's all kinds of problems with the studies. But the bigger issue here is, attacking Collins for standing up for, you know, due process."

And there is apparently video of the encounter. Though, Spacey's lawyers have already challenged exactly what the video shows. The 18-year-old sent the video at the time via SnapChat to his girlfriend, it allegedly shows Kevin Spacey touching the front of his pants. According to a police report field in Nantucket district court. Spacey's lawyers, though, argue the video merely shows someone's hand touching another person's shirt, according to audio of the court hearing obtained by the Boston Globe. Now the case came to light when former Boston news anchor, Heather Unruh, announced in November 2017 that Spacey has had groped her son. Spacey has not responded directly to the allegations, but on Monday -- on Monday, he released a video best described as odd in the voice of his \"House of Cards\" character Frank Underwood.
