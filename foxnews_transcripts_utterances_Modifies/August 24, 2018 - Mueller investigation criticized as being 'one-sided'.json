For the hour, we'll show you how Democrats, the deep state and the media are all working together against President Donald Trump. First, we'll address the special counsel's partisan probe into Russian collusion. While this administration pushes a sound conservative agenda, Mueller's witch- hunt is dividing the country and wreaking political havoc day after day.  Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is nowhere to be found. He's recused himself from all things Russia almost immediately after taking office and now, the relationship between President Trump and his absence the attorney general is at an all-time low.  Today, the president mocked Sessions on Twitter writing, quote, Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. Jeff, this is great. What everyone wants. So look into all of the corruption on the other side, including deleted emails, Comey lies and leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele and his phony and corrupt dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump campaign, Russian collusion by Dems, and so much more. Open up the papers and documents without redaction. Come on, Jeff. You can do it. The country is waiting. Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz is slamming Sessions for perpetuating our two-tiered system of justice. Take a look.",

I was the chairman of the Oversight Committee and Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we sent a letter the department of justice asked him to look if Hillary lied under oath, never gave a response.

Additionally because of our mush tougher trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they were once were, despite the U.N. Sanctions which are in place. Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our trading relationship with China is resolved.

And the president we saw did this in the line up to the Singapore talks where he cancelled the meeting with Kim Jong-un and then the North Koreans came back to the table in a way that is efficient from the president's perspective and the meeting went forward. So, I think we're really seeing here is so many different geopolitical things at play, Judge Jeanine. We are seeing trade talks happen with the Chinese, which I think are very tough and it did not seem to make a lot of progress over the past few days. The Chinese are playing Hardball, but so is this President more than any other President has. We're all seeing something a very strange dynamic that I think that we need to be aware and that is the South Koreans. President Moon is the -- for lack of a better word, he is the Barack Obama of Asia. And I think that we have to be very careful about what the South Koreans are doing. They made a speech last week, in which they're trying to build this inert- Korean peninsula. Almost similar to European Union of Asia. They want to land bridge to China and to the rest of Asia. So, I'm worried that the South Korean and the President and his very liberal stance is trying to push a position that is counter to the U.S. interest in the region.",

For the hour, we'll show you how Democrats, the deep state and the media are all working together against President Donald Trump. First, we'll address the special counsel's partisan probe into Russian collusion. While this administration pushes a sound conservative agenda, Mueller's witch- hunt is dividing the country and wreaking political havoc day after day. Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is nowhere to be found. He's recused himself from all things Russia almost immediately after taking office and now, the relationship between President Trump and his absence the attorney general is at an all-time low. Today, the president mocked Sessions on Twitter writing, quote, Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. Jeff, this is great. What everyone wants. So look into all of the corruption on the other side, including deleted emails, Comey lies and leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA abuse, Christopher Steele and his phony and corrupt dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump campaign, Russian collusion by Dems, and so much more. Open up the papers and documents without redaction. Come on, Jeff. You can do it. The country is waiting. Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz is slamming Sessions for perpetuating our two-tiered system of justice. Take a look."

He hasn't done nothing to go after what Congress has been asking for and giving the documents up he. Has done nothing to pursue what is known to be false statements to Congress. I was the chairman of the Oversight Committee and Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we sent a letter the department of justice asked him to look if Hillary lied under oath, never gave a response. That's because of politics, not because he's not do -- he's just not doing his job."

I think he's been a good attorney general. But this is not working. So I hope the relationship gets better, if it doesn't, I would imagine the president is going to look for a new attorney general because what's going on is unsustainable. I'm not blaming anybody.

I'm going to start with what Jason Chaffetz said that we just heard on that sound where he talked about sending a letter to Jeff Sessions and saying he never got a response with respect to his investigation of all of the wrongdoings or apparent wrongdoings of the Clinton campaign.

I mean, we live in a nation of laws and we have got to look at the Clinton emails, everything that you listed in your opening monologue. Everything President Trump said. We've got to look at Strzok, Page, everything, the FISA warrant, everything. But especially these FBI agents who either, like Lisa Page, got to resign or even the ones who are fired. I'm sorry.

The president rightly named more than a dozen things Sessions should be investigated for especially, Hillary Clinton and her conduct. James Comey twisted the facts, contorted the law to clear her.

Look, when you have lost the confidence of your boss, the president United States, when you've breached that trust, the good and honorable and right thing to do is to submit your letter of resignation, and that's what Jeff Sessions should have done a long time ago. He apparently did it a year ago but the president at the time felt it was unwise to accept it."

He gave her a chance and it -- you know, he believes in people, he believes in raising people up. But you know what? I'm going to go to you, Mark, on your -- on your article where you write about Cohen's plea deal is an attempt to set up Trump. All right. So, we now know that Michael Cohen has pled guilty and at the end of the plea or one of the last pleas had to do with the reference to campaign finances. What was your take on that? How does that set up the president?"

I think at the end of the day, they said, look, plead guilty to this, we'll reduce your sentence, we won't go after your wife. I think that was even now I understand on the table. And those things that he pled guilty to are not crimes. So, by getting him to plead guilty, they can now create an unindicted co-conspirator conspiracy kind of theory for impeachment on something that's not a crime. This was established with Clinton. It was established with Edwards very clearly when even the FEC ruled that these payments were not campaign contributions. And frankly, had they paid them out of the campaign, they'd probably be indicted for misuse of campaign funds for personal purposes."

Look, just think about it for a minute. One of them he's accused of coordinating, not actually even making the payment. And imagine if Michael Avenatti coordinated a payment to Stormy Daniels with CBS to air it to help Hillary, then that would have to be a campaign contribution just as a payment not to air it would be a campaign contribution."

And I still think that we need to see all of the facts, but I think Tuesday changed things fundamentally in this country. I think that Democrats can start talking about impeachment not saying that we should just remove the president without going through the full two-step process, right? But I think that if now is when we can't talk about impeachment, when can we talk about impeachment? The president was implicated in a crime and I can't imagine a scenario that is -- could be any more ripe for a serious discussion by responsible adults. It's exactly what the framers would have wanted."

They actually -- Democrats wrote that into this thing. I also find it a little curious, you know, I was one of the guys who blew the whistle on what Congress was doing by using taxpayer funds to pay secret sexual harassment settlements. And that was a bad practice. I blew the whistle on it we stopped it in the House. But I would reckon that some of these Democrats who were talking about impeaching, you know, they probably could potentially have been involved in that.

You know, that montage you just ran, Judge, was -- if it weren't so -- if it weren't so hilarious, it would be truly alarming to think that that these are serious people who met -- many of whom have been elected to assume a once serious party in America. But I do think that it's important to remember, you know, we can have an argument about high -- what high crimes and misdemeanors means, I would argue that you at least have to have a crime.

People -- a lot of people voted for Donald Trump who maybe don't like his tweets, maybe don't like the way he talks. But they like the fact that he wants to come and change the way things work in Washington. And I would say that the silver lining here for Republicans and for Donald Trump right now, with all this impeachment talk, is why all these Democrats are going insane and making complete fools of themselves, with all of this impeachment talk and over here, Donald Trump is talking about the economy, talking about the border wall --"

Trump tweeted, quote, I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Additionally because of our mush tougher trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they were once were, despite the U.N. Sanctions which are in place. Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our trading relationship with China is resolved. In the meantime, I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to the chairman (inaudible). I look forward to seeing him soon. Joining us now with reaction, National Security Global Affairs Analyst, Morgan Ortagus and Fox News contributor and retired CIA senior intelligence officer, Dan Hoffman. OK, Morgan, I will start with you. Yesterday, Mike Pompeo is going to North Korea along with a special envoy indicating that we're ready to continue serious negotiations with North Korea. Now today something very unusual happened when the President asked Secretary of State, Pompeo, not to go. What happened and how do you read this?"

I think what we're seeing happen is that Mike Pompeo the Secretary of State briefed the President today and it seems that the President got fed up and is frustrated with what he sees as a lack of progress on these talks. And the president we saw did this in the line up to the Singapore talks where he cancelled the meeting with Kim Jong-un and then the North Koreans came back to the table in a way that is efficient from the president's perspective and the meeting went forward. So, I think we're really seeing here is so many different geopolitical things at play, Judge Jeanine. We are seeing trade talks happen with the Chinese, which I think are very tough and it did not seem to make a lot of progress over the past few days. The Chinese are playing Hardball, but so is this President more than any other President has. We're all seeing something a very strange dynamic that I think that we need to be aware and that is the South Koreans. President Moon is the -- for lack of a better word, he is the Barack Obama of Asia. And I think that we have to be very careful about what the South Koreans are doing. They made a speech last week, in which they're trying to build this inert- Korean peninsula. Almost similar to European Union of Asia. They want to land bridge to China and to the rest of Asia. So, I'm worried that the South Korean and the President and his very liberal stance is trying to push a position that is counter to the U.S. interest in the region."

He needs immediate help and he has to play to his own stakeholders. And the military -- you may recall that just before the summit, Kim Jong-un removed three top defensive officials, including his chief of intelligence and his minster of defense. He is got to be very concerned and aware of the reaction from his own -- for lack of a better word, military base.

I think what's really smart about what this administration is doing -- and a lot of people would disagree with me on this, but I think the fact that we're looking at the Chinese, looking in this I.P. Looking at sanctions on North Korea, and trying to negotiate with them in a package. I think is a smart strategy, but mind you, this is not something that is going to happen that President Trump is going to win in the next month or maybe even the next year. This is something where we have to have sustained pressure against the Chinese, because most of the world thinks that when the going gets tough, that America cuts and runs. That is certainly our reputation for the last eight years."

      "utterance": "Look what happened in the Middle East. Look at Russia invaded Ukraine and President Obama did nothing. Our reputation is that when it gets tough we leave and people don't believe that President Trump is necessarily going to keep the required pressure on China and on North Korea. I believe he will. I believe this is a president who means what he says. And I think that the Chinese and the North Koreans are wrong to test him."

    {
      "speaker": "HOFFMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Morgan's points are spot-on. The North Korea challenge for us is intertwined with everything else in the region. There's no question that China and Russia would like to reduce if not eliminate altogether our military presence and our influence in the region. And so, we do need to demonstrate in it for a long haul. We also have to have realistic expectations. One more point, judge that I would highlight is when the president is making his decision, he had Andy Kim in the room. Andy is the chief of the CIA's Korea Mission Center, along with Secretary Pompeo. This shows the President making a very deliberate decision based on intelligence and the best diplomatic advice he could get from Secretary Pompeo. And I think we should be reassured by that process, which was spot-on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right. Second thought, Morgan. What about the satellite imagery that seems to indicate that they are still working on -- North Korea's still working on its nuclearization? Don't they know we can see that stuff?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "You would think they would know that by now for sure. And we also saw that Secretary Pompeo went to the U.N. just a few weeks ago and called out the Russians and called out the Chinese for these ship to ship oil transfers in which they were evading sanctions. So I think that the President might need to consider going back to the maximum pressure campaign. I think clearly from his tweets today he is still trying to keep a relationship with Kim Jong-un, because from his perspective, Kim Jong-un promise denuclearization that might be time to go back to maximum pressure."

      "utterance": "You know, it's interesting. We have the strongest economy in the history our nation. I hear about a blue wave, I say why is there a blue wave? We are doing better now with jobs. Today there are more people working than at any time ever in the history of our country. So, I don't think there's going to be blue wave. I hope there's a red wave. They keep saying that whoever's president they don't win the midterms. I just don't get it. That no president has ever had this economy. You have left-wing haters and radicals trying to tear down our institution, disrespect our great American flag, demean our law enforcement, think of that, our flag, a law enforcement, ICE, denigrate your history and disparage our great country. And they are going so far left and they are being drag left. I remember Schumer when he was like somebody you can talk to, but he has been brought so far left, he is not even rational anymore. But we're not going to let it happen, because we need our law enforcement, we need respect for our national anthem and for our flag."

Joining us now with reaction, Fox's news contributor and former Clinton pollster, Doug Schoen and GOPAC chairman, David Avella. All right guys, I will start with you Doug, you are sitting with me -- I was struck just then by what the president said about Senator Chuck Schumer from New York. He said that he is been brought left. I wonder if he is been brought left and what was the president trying to say? He seemed relatively calm about Schumer. He used to call him crying Chuck and Chuck has been an obstructionist."

      "speaker": "DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the President understands that for him to fully succeed, he needs some degree of bipartisan success legislatively. And if Schumer and the Democrats don't cooperate, it makes it tougher and tougher. And I have seen Schumer move to the left and the President is not incorrect in saying that he's caucus has moved left, his party had move left and so is Chuck."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But, David, the chances of Chuck Schumer moving to the left are like slim to none. I mean, moving to the right, I mean, in an effort to have some kind of bipartisan efforts in Congress. I mean, it is resist and obstruct on the part of the left."

    {
      "speaker": "DAVID AVELLA, GOPAC CHAIRMAN",
      "utterance": "Schumer is not going to move towards the right and he is not looking to work with this President, but it was completely appropriate that the President today is in Ohio where we finally got declared the winner of the Ohio 12 special election, which was the Republican nominee Troy Balderson. Because you may remember this was the definitive race. This was the race that was going to show that Democrats, we are going to clean the slate this year and Republicans didn't have a chance. And what happened? The Republican won. Which goes along with the other news we found out this week that in Wisconsin, (inaudible) who is challenging incumbent Pam Bondi is within the statistical margin of error. Rick Scott is up in Florida. Kevin Cramer is up in North Dakota. I mean, race after race, particularly in the senate, the Republican is beating the Democrat. This big discussion about the Democrats picking up a whole lot of seats, today those numbers don't seem to be there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But given what Doug, given what David is saying, I mean the truth is that the more the left pushes and pushes, I mean, Michael Cohen and then you've got David Pecker getting immunity form, you know, all of these other individuals that seem close to Trump, I mean, they're pulling all the stops right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "And that is really the problem the Republicans have, because the answer to the question the President posed, why won't there be a red wave? If all of the news is about Pecker, Cohen, Manafort, the economic news doesn't come through and the polling shows that the House is likely today to go Democratic. If the Republicans don't have a unified message, there's not going to be a red wave."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But Republican do have a unified message. And David, it appeared the president is you know, banging the drum saying, you know, we've got more people working than in any other time in history. I mean the president is a smart man. He understands what he needs to say and he is also a tough guy. This isn't going to get him off his game. Make them, bang all they want on the left, but he knows, he talks about law enforcement, he talks about the flag, and he talks about the economy. Those are almost like buzzwords."

      "speaker": "AVELLA",
      "utterance": "Every time someone opens up their investment account or paycheck, or gets another benefit at work, and goes to look for a job and realizes there are more jobs than workers right now in America, they get that it's been this President and the Republicans in Congress that have put those policies in place. And let's also not forget, there is a reason why the Democrats and many in the media need to talk every day about investigations and impeachment and the President is not up for being President, because if they actually focused on what Democrats say, they have no shot. You've got the Senate candidate a work down in Texas, who is out saying that NFL players should kneel before if they feel like it. You've got Elizabeth Warren with absolutely disgusting comments about immigration on the day that Mollie Tibbetts or we found out that Mollie Tibbetts was killed by an illegal immigrant. If we focus on the Democrats, they would have no chance of winning elections this year."

      "utterance": "Ted Cruz is not going to lose, just as it would be disappointing if Republicans don't pick up two or three Senate seats this year. Let's go through the numbers again. Rick Scott is winning in Florida. Josh Hawley is winning in Missouri. Kevin Cramer is winning in North Dakota. There is three. Leah Bootmer (ph) is within two in Wisconsin. Max Rosendale and Patrick Morrisey in Montana West Virginia respectively running competitive races. Republicans are running strong run."
