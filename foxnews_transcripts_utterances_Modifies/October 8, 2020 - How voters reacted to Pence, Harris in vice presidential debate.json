We didn't even have to offer a counter, but we did out of patriotism and because we want the American people to have this chance. So, we said, let's delay both debates back a week. So, October 22nd, October 29th. There is no reasonable way that anybody can try to use the pretext of COVID to say that we cannot have debates on October 22nd and 29th. They're trying to use they're playing pandemic politics, Bret. And they're trying to use the disease as a beard to cover up for them because the reality is, Joe Biden does not want the transparency and he does not want to be physically on stage without any assistance. We can't trust to do a Zoom call from his basement where he could be assisted by teleprompters and staff. No, if he wants to be the commander-in-chief of the greatest Republican history, he has to get on the stage himself and face off with Donald Trump.

Regarding Nancy Pelosi, you know, I wish she would stop slinging accusations and I wish she would get to work to actually help the American people because the president wants to continue assistance, badly needed assistance to people who are still out of work.  There's an economic renaissance, it's exploding in this country right now and it's amazing. But we also know that we still have work to do because of what China did to our country. Nancy Pelosi is standing in the way of that. And in a sense, by the way, whether is this debate being postponed or what Nancy Pelosi is doing, you know what they're really doing, the Democrats and the commission? They're allowing China to win. You know who won the debate next Thursday night? China won. And that's really, really unfortunate.

JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Every cycle it feels like there's one question for every candidate that lingers for a little while and they try to dodge and they try to get away without answering it, and then eventually you have to bend to reality, which is that you end up making these questions an even bigger deal by refusing to answer them. You ensure that in every interview, at every gaggle, at every debate that this is a central topic, and you end up giving it so much more oxygen then if you simply answered the question and then defended it.

JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think the Speaker has it right. They are trapped between their base and popular opinion in the country on packing the court, and it wasn't particularly -- it didn't go well for FDR when he wanted to go that route, so there's that precedent as well. As far as the debate, I thought Vice President Pence did a very good job. He had a very strong performance. The problem is I don't think he changed the dynamic of the race. I think Biden and Harris think they are sitting on a good lead deep in the fourth quarter here, and they just need to not screw it up. And I don't think that Kamala Harris made any huge errors last night that jeopardized the current state of the race. But it makes it all the more mystifying to me that Trump would, like Frank Luntz mentioned, step on the story this morning with this announcement about the next debate. I think it is in his interest to be on a stage with Joe Biden one on one. And if he tests negative for the virus, there's no reason that can't happen. But even if it's virtual, I think he would be making a mistake to pass up a one-on-one appearance with Joe Biden. More than 70 million people tuned into that first debate, and that's a big audience, and that is the best way to make his case that he's offering a contrast between himself and where he wants to take the country and where Biden wants to take the country.

And they have abandoned that public service in setting this up so unilaterally that they didn't try to figure out how to still arrive at three good debates. But two, I think the president doesn't have much leverage here. He needs these debates more than Joe Biden does. So if the second debate doesn't happen, it's really no skin off Joe Biden's back. It actually helps Biden. I think the smarter course for the president would have been to say, if I'm COVID positive, I'm not going. No one who is COVID positive should show up at work. But if I have no longer the virus, then people need to listen to the doctors and listen to science. And my doctor is a Navy commander, a medical doctor. People can listen to him.

We've asked the doctors, we asked the White House when was the last negative test that the president had and we can't get that answer. So, there is skepticism about what is coming and the people who are in the middle of these debates. So, here's what I'm asking you, what is the president planning to do? What is the counter offer by the campaign for the next debate? Obviously, you all need these debates to get more eyeballs prior to the election, correct?"

We want transparency for the American people and we believe that the more they see of Joe Biden and his agenda, the less they will -- they will -- they will like it and the more they were rally to our side. Here's what we have proposed, and by the way, I think this is incredibly reasonable because everything was already agreed to. We didn't even have to offer a counter, but we did out of patriotism and because we want the American people to have this chance. So, we said, let's delay both debates back a week. So, October 22nd, October 29th. There is no reasonable way that anybody can try to use the pretext of COVID to say that we cannot have debates on October 22nd and 29th. They're trying to use they're playing pandemic politics, Bret. And they're trying to use the disease as a beard to cover up for them because the reality is, Joe Biden does not want the transparency and he does not want to be physically on stage without any assistance. We can't trust to do a Zoom call from his basement where he could be assisted by teleprompters and staff. No, if he wants to be the commander-in-chief of the greatest Republican history, he has to get on the stage himself and face off with Donald Trump. And hopefully in this case, do so without a completely biased moderator who inserted himself into the process last time. We hope for much better this time, even though the Commission chose another person with no credentials for this debate, somebody who in fact worked for Joe Biden previously. That's what I'm talking about, this Commission is totally discredited. This is the swamp at its very worst."

And in the meantime, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is saying she's considering bidding -- bringing up a bill to talk about the 25th Amendment because of her concern about the president's health and making decisions. I want to you to respond to both as we wrap up here."

He is leading this country even though he's not physically yet able to travel and campaign and that's going to happen very shortly. Regarding Nancy Pelosi, you know, I wish she would stop slinging accusations and I wish she would get to work to actually help the American people because the president wants to continue assistance, badly needed assistance to people who are still out of work. There's an economic renaissance, it's exploding in this country right now and it's amazing. But we also know that we still have work to do because of what China did to our country. Nancy Pelosi is standing in the way of that. And in a sense, by the way, whether is this debate being postponed or what Nancy Pelosi is doing, you know what they're really doing, the Democrats and the commission? They're allowing China to win. You know who won the debate next Thursday night? China won. And that's really, really unfortunate. I think that case needs to be made to the American people that the only American leader capable and willing to be tough and stand up against Beijing is Donald Trump."

Let's go around the country and look at some of the key races. Some of them we weren't expecting to be that tight including one here in South Carolina.

Local media there reports investigators say Zul Mohamed sent 84 applications for 85 mail-in ballots which were later found at his residence. Zul faces 109 felony charges. A federal appeals court is blocking a decision to extend the deadline for counting absentee ballots by six days in Wisconsin. Democrats are likely going to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the ruling stands as is, absentee ballots will have to be delivered to Wisconsin election clerks by 8:00 p.m. on Election Day if they are to be counted. The U.S. Supreme Court, meantime, has rejected an effort by Montana Republicans to block Democrat Governor Steve Bullock's plan to send mail ballots to voters. Counties with approved plans intend to send those ballots to all registered voters tomorrow in Montana. Let's go over the latest numbers tonight in last night's debate with pollster Frank Luntz, who had a panel of undecided voters last night from key battleground states. Frank, good evening. So who won the debate and why, after talking to these folks?"

The reason they are undecided is that they don't feel like they've been given the information that they need to make that decision. Second, they're looking for somebody who is presidential, someone who they see could take over if either of the presidential candidates were to get sick or get incapacitated, and with us having the oldest nominees ever in American history, that becomes an issue. And third, of all the issues, even though COVID-19 is on our minds and a part of us, what we are asking from the presidential candidates, in this case the V.P. candidates, is the economy and jobs. They thought overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly that Mike Pence did a better job on those three issues. And I want to show you some of the sound, because this is how you understand who is still undecided and why they are undecided. Let's start with comments from the group about Mike Pence."

The problem with 2020 is that Pence had a good debate last night, but then the president steps on the story by saying he won't debate if they are going to do it virtual in a week's time.

      "utterance": "You will know my answer on court packing when the election is over, that's Joe Biden today in Arizona. He's been asked that numerous times. This is about adding Supreme Court justices to the Supreme Court. Neither he nor Kamala Harris, Senator Harris, have answered that question, and it's really starting to come up every time he takes questions. Let's just start there with the panel, former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, Julie Pace is the Washington Bureau Chief for the Associated Press, Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, author of the new book \"Trump and the American Future.\" Mr. Speaker, let me start with you. Is this tenable to not answer that question?"

      "utterance": "Biden and Harris have a real dilemma. If they answer honestly to please their left, which is they'll pack the court, the country by about two to one will repudiate them. On the other hand, if they please the average American by pledging not to pack the court, their entire activist base will repudiate them. And that's why you see this dodging and dance. I thought Frank Luntz said it exactly right, and I hope that Trump can pick up on how simple this is. This is an issue which goes to the heart of trust and power, and he can, I think, force Biden to either say yes, say no, or be on defense for three weeks. And that frankly, could change the whole election."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Julie, I don't think we've seen a candidate go this far in not answering a question, and the vice presidential nominee. Obviously we saw Speaker Nancy Pelosi say you'll see what's inside Obamacare after we pass it, on a specific bill, but he's been asked this a lot. JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Every cycle it feels like there's one question for every candidate that lingers for a little while and they try to dodge and they try to get away without answering it, and then eventually you have to bend to reality, which is that you end up making these questions an even bigger deal by refusing to answer them. You ensure that in every interview, at every gaggle, at every debate that this is a central topic, and you end up giving it so much more oxygen then if you simply answered the question and then defended it. And so I think it will be interesting to see if the Biden-Harris ticket reaches that same conclusion. There is only a couple of weeks left, but they are going to get hammered with this question at every opportunity until they just give the American people a straight answer on what their position is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Jason, the question didn't come up from the moderator last night. It came up from Vice President Pence posed to Kamala Harris, and there was not an answer. Your thoughts on this? JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think the Speaker has it right. They are trapped between their base and popular opinion in the country on packing the court, and it wasn't particularly -- it didn't go well for FDR when he wanted to go that route, so there's that precedent as well. As far as the debate, I thought Vice President Pence did a very good job. He had a very strong performance. The problem is I don't think he changed the dynamic of the race. I think Biden and Harris think they are sitting on a good lead deep in the fourth quarter here, and they just need to not screw it up. And I don't think that Kamala Harris made any huge errors last night that jeopardized the current state of the race. But it makes it all the more mystifying to me that Trump would, like Frank Luntz mentioned, step on the story this morning with this announcement about the next debate. I think it is in his interest to be on a stage with Joe Biden one on one. And if he tests negative for the virus, there's no reason that can't happen. But even if it's virtual, I think he would be making a mistake to pass up a one-on-one appearance with Joe Biden. More than 70 million people tuned into that first debate, and that's a big audience, and that is the best way to make his case that he's offering a contrast between himself and where he wants to take the country and where Biden wants to take the country. Biden wants to make this a referendum on President Trump."

      "utterance": "Two thing. One, I don't think the commission worked very hard to figure this out. I think they just quit, and that is really unfortunate, Bret, because our country has turned to the commission. They have provided three debates at the presidential level, one at the vice presidential, for a generation now. And they have abandoned that public service in setting this up so unilaterally that they didn't try to figure out how to still arrive at three good debates. But two, I think the president doesn't have much leverage here. He needs these debates more than Joe Biden does. So if the second debate doesn't happen, it's really no skin off Joe Biden's back. It actually helps Biden. I think the smarter course for the president would have been to say, if I'm COVID positive, I'm not going. No one who is COVID positive should show up at work. But if I have no longer the virus, then people need to listen to the doctors and listen to science. And my doctor is a Navy commander, a medical doctor. People can listen to him. And then let Joe Biden reject what doctors conclude. That would be a smarter way if I was Donald Trump."

What he ought to do is offer a John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon debate in a television studio spaced apart, 20, 30 feet, go at it, the two of them, and let's see Biden turn that down."
