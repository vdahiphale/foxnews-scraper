Moments ago, as you just saw in Toledo, in Ohio, the all-important swing state of Ohio, the president wrapped up a massive rally. We're going to have a lot and play a lot of his remarks, some of the best ones, straight ahead.  Meanwhile, in the Middle East tonight, U.S. intelligence now believes that the rogue regime in Iran was responsible for downing Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752, killing all 176 souls on board.  Pentagon officials telling Fox News, quote: an Iranian operated Russian- made A15 missile, which is part of the surface-to-air missile system, was the kind that brought down this aircraft. Officials also believe it was horrific accident.  But now, many Democrats, the media mob, they're doing what they predictably do. Let's blame Trump. The dog bites, the bee stings, you're feeling sad, blame Trump. We're going to have all the sick, disgusting details and their comments coming up tonight. But we begin with the D.C. swamp where a very angry and very confused, bewildered Nancy Pelosi continues inexplicably to cling on to her B.S. articles of impeachment.  I have a message for Republican senators coming up. First, let's watch Nancy.",

Pelosi has now paused this super important, super urgent process indefinitely. It is the kind of level of hypocrisy, outright dishonesty and lying that is unconscionable. But it is very fitting.  Democrats, with the help of, of course, their best friends in the media mob, state-run TV, the deep state -- they have been lying to you, to us, every step of the way. First, we have the compromise, corrupt, congenital liar, the pencil neck I guess the president calls him, Adam Schiff, lying about the transcript of the call between the president and President Zelensky.   Next, Schiff lied about the fake, non-whistleblower, hearsay whistleblower. Remember, he said his office, they would like to have contact, they'd like to hear from them. They had no contact with the individual, when, in fact, his office was, in fact, communicating with the hearsay non-whistleblower whistleblower even before he filed the bogus complaint. Up next, Democrats lied about witness testimony during the Schiff show, the first audition show, the secret closed-door witness rehearsal show. Democrats selectively were leaking only the misleading information in order to impugn the president and gain public favor. That's called propaganda.  Ultimately, they passed two bogus articles with only one fact witness. One, that's it, Ambassador Sondland, whose testimony was exculpatory for the president. He wanted nothing, no quid, no pro, no quo like Joe. I want nothing.  The proceeding was a dishonest train wreck from the very beginning, to deceive the American people and lied to get the support of the American people. There was never any evidence. It was nonexistent. There is for quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. Well, you're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor investigating my zero- experience son. Yes, the very thing they act so outraged about. There was no due process, like Newt Gingrich afforded Bill Clinton and his attorneys in '98 and '99. No basic fairness, no high crimes, no misdemeanors, no bribery, no treason. One nebulous abuse of power charge, whatever that is.   One totally made up obstruction of Congress because this president dared to do what all the presidents before him have done and that is when they can't get along with the executive and legislative branch, you can seek remedy. You can go to the court system. They settle those disputes. After all, they were in a rush. This was urgent.  Now, Pelosi has all the time in the world apparently. Guess it's not as urgent as they said -- another lie. She is demanding the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell follow her strict instructions for how the Senate trial should be run. She wants him to call all the witnesses they didn't call but, yet, they impeached him. They failed to get a subpoena.  She also wants to ensure a fair trial with total impartiality. Big problem there is her best friend, her BFF in the Senate, Chucky Schumer, totally agrees. But in the 1990s, when a Democrat was being impeached, Chuck was running on exonerating Clinton. Eleven separate felonies Ken Starr identified.  Take a look.",

Unless a miracle occurs, we will take one of the most serious and rare actions that this body can assume and impeach the president against the overwhelming will of the American people. But now, we are routinely using criminal accusations and scandals to win the political battles and ideological differences we cannot settle at the ballot box. History will show that we'd lowered the bar on impeachment so much, we have broken the seal on this extreme -- extreme penalty so cavalierly that it will be used as a routine tool to fight political battles. My fear is that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback.   There is no need to continue forward because there are certainly not too thirds for impeachment.

And now, top Democrats are asking Pelosi, end the charade. They are demanding it.  Even Senator Feinstein, fellow Californian, saying it's Pelosi's decision. But if they are serious and urgent, send them over. If it isn't, don't send it over.  Democrats Doug Jones, Angus King, Joe Manchin, Chris Murphy, Richard Blumenthal, Chris Coons, and others all echoing Feinstein's ultimatum. Even one House member, Adam Smith, he called for Pelosi to stop stalling. Then he had to recant probably after getting, well, beaten down in closed doors, smoke-filled rooms by friends of the speaker.  Look at this poll, a whopping 58 percent of Americans think Pelosi needs to send the articles over. That would be called due process and fundamental fairness. Of course, don't expect it tonight.

That's the latest example.  Let me address all of you, though, in the U.S. Senate tonight, all of you Republican senators. You do not and should not ever lend any credibility to this despicable, corrupt Schiff show. Don't do it, because all you're doing is hurting America people in the process. Let them do it, you don't be a part of it. Let the Democrats -- they -- OK, they impeach the president. Your job is to run the trial, of course, with the chief justice presiding. Let them present their case. They impeached him. Let them tell you why. Now, I'd like to hear -- they can bring in the one fact witness. But, constitutionally, they impeach and they present their case to you. They say they have the evidence to impeach, your constitutional role, you Republican senators, is the trial, the chief justice presides.   The only, and one fact witness, bring him in. Just one, everyone else is an opinion, hearsay witness. Rules of evidence, federal rules of evidence, don't allow hearsay evidence to be presented. Make them show you why they impeached Donald J. Trump. It is not your job, Republican senators, or your constitutional role to redo their sick, twisted corrupt investigation with no due process. Now, after the House managers present the reasons, their case which why they impeach the president, bring in the one relevant fact witness they use so he can repeat, Ambassador Sondland, what he said or read back, you know, to the House, or just read back the testimony, then you can vote. That's your job. You don't have to do their job. They impeach and then they're going to tell you why. They are going to present their case. It's not your job to fix their screw up. You Republican senators are weak and timid if you give credibility to this repulsive, corrupt political stunt. You are as guilty as Schiff, Nadler and Speaker-in-name-only Pelosi. They impeached, let them show you why.  When they fail spectacularly, and they already have, and they will, this will end the madness. In other words, Republican senators, stand up for the United States Constitution, that is your role. That is your job. And tonight, my next guest believes the ongoing impeachment charade was never about removing President Trump from office. Instead, it was designed as a tool to hurt Republican senators in blue and purple states. This is guy that has never lost a case as a prosecutor in his life. Pretty smart guy.

There is no mathematical way he is ever going to be convicted. And they know that. So their goal cannot be to remove Donald Trump from office. It is to neuter his second term. I think he is going to win in November. It's to neuter that second term by targeting the Cory Gardners and Martha McSallys and Thom Tillises and the Susan Collins and Joni Ernst.  Because if Trump wins and he doesn't have the Senate, then he is not going to get any judicial vacancies filled. He's not going to replace a Supreme Court justice if he or she retires. He's not going to get the foreign policy he wants. He is not going to get the cabinet he wants. So, I never thought this was about removing Donald Trump because they're not going to do it.

The Senate's job is to deliberate. It is not to investigate and then deliberate, because if that were true, we wouldn't need the House. Schiff was in such a hurry. I mean, keep in mind, Sean, all your viewers have to go to court if they have a disagreement with a fellow citizen. House Republicans had to go to court to get documents in Fast and Furious. We had to go fight Adam Schiff in court to find out who funded the dossier. So, we all know how to get to the courthouse. Schiff didn't want to go to court. He wants the Senate to call the very witnesses that he didn't have the courage to call himself. And that's not their job.

Whoever fired it no doubt believed the U.S. was attacking them. Iran is insisting still that plane was brought down by a technical failure. But the U.S. intelligence is strong. It's based on satellite images, infrared technology and communication intercept. One of the other big questions, what was this Ukrainian plane doing flying in the middle of the war zone? The U.S. FAA had banned its pilots and careers from flying anywhere near Iran, Iraq or the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless they were there.

You worked for \"60 Minutes.\" Kind of a big deal. You were out with our troops a lot. You know about Soleimani. I have known about Soleimani a long time, too. It's about as bad as you get.

And that's not -- you know, subjective saying that's -- and the U.S. -- he was designated as a foreign terrorist and that was because Iran has been using terrorism as a tool of state craft. They have made it part of their foreign policy. And he was the architect of that. And I guess what disturbs me most about the coverage is that there are millions of people in Iran who did not mourn Qassem Soleimani's death. So, where was their side of the story? Where were their voices? In fact, I was talking to some of the Iranian opposition leaders just yesterday, and one of them said to me, this funeral and this show of, you know, outpouring of grief was a theater for the Western media and they bought the whole thing. You know, where was the pictures such as the one I was sent of people burning Qassem Soleimani's picture in cities across Iran? Of people putting pictures of the Iranian opposition leaders? Where were those pictures? And you know, Sean, it was 1,500 people who were killed just a few months ago and there were Quds Force snipers on the streets of Iran, according to the opposition and according to news reports and to pictures that came out at the time. And those snipers shot young Iranians in the chest and in the head. So, those people, their families are not mourning Qassem Soleimani. And what about those funerals? How much coverage did you see of their funerals? It's quite extraordinary to me that he can be called an inspirational leader. Would have you called bin Laden an inspirational leader?

Pelosi rammed through the House in record time. Only one fact witness, the rest were just -- well, hearsay and opinion witnesses. Democrats, they didn't subpoena any of the key witnesses because according to them, the country couldn't afford to wait for a court decision.

Pelosi has now paused this super important, super urgent process indefinitely. It is the kind of level of hypocrisy, outright dishonesty and lying that is unconscionable. But it is very fitting. Democrats, with the help of, of course, their best friends in the media mob, state-run TV, the deep state -- they have been lying to you, to us, every step of the way. First, we have the compromise, corrupt, congenital liar, the pencil neck I guess the president calls him, Adam Schiff, lying about the transcript of the call between the president and President Zelensky. Next, Schiff lied about the fake, non-whistleblower, hearsay whistleblower. Remember, he said his office, they would like to have contact, they'd like to hear from them. They had no contact with the individual, when, in fact, his office was, in fact, communicating with the hearsay non-whistleblower whistleblower even before he filed the bogus complaint. Up next, Democrats lied about witness testimony during the Schiff show, the first audition show, the secret closed-door witness rehearsal show. Democrats selectively were leaking only the misleading information in order to impugn the president and gain public favor. That's called propaganda. Ultimately, they passed two bogus articles with only one fact witness. One, that's it, Ambassador Sondland, whose testimony was exculpatory for the president. He wanted nothing, no quid, no pro, no quo like Joe. I want nothing. The proceeding was a dishonest train wreck from the very beginning, to deceive the American people and lied to get the support of the American people. There was never any evidence. It was nonexistent. There is for quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. Well, you're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor investigating my zero- experience son. Yes, the very thing they act so outraged about. There was no due process, like Newt Gingrich afforded Bill Clinton and his attorneys in '98 and '99. No basic fairness, no high crimes, no misdemeanors, no bribery, no treason. One nebulous abuse of power charge, whatever that is. One totally made up obstruction of Congress because this president dared to do what all the presidents before him have done and that is when they can't get along with the executive and legislative branch, you can seek remedy. You can go to the court system. They settle those disputes. After all, they were in a rush. This was urgent. Now, Pelosi has all the time in the world apparently. Guess it's not as urgent as they said -- another lie. She is demanding the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell follow her strict instructions for how the Senate trial should be run. She wants him to call all the witnesses they didn't call but, yet, they impeached him. They failed to get a subpoena. She also wants to ensure a fair trial with total impartiality. Big problem there is her best friend, her BFF in the Senate, Chucky Schumer, totally agrees. But in the 1990s, when a Democrat was being impeached, Chuck was running on exonerating Clinton. Eleven separate felonies Ken Starr identified. Take a look."

And back then, the independent Starr report determined Clinton committed -- he identified 11 specific impeachable offenses including felonies.

That we will be in danger of all too frequently investigating presidents and seeking to remove them from office. Unless a miracle occurs, we will take one of the most serious and rare actions that this body can assume and impeach the president against the overwhelming will of the American people. But now, we are routinely using criminal accusations and scandals to win the political battles and ideological differences we cannot settle at the ballot box. History will show that we'd lowered the bar on impeachment so much, we have broken the seal on this extreme -- extreme penalty so cavalierly that it will be used as a routine tool to fight political battles. My fear is that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback. There is no need to continue forward because there are certainly not too thirds for impeachment. What we ought to be doing, instead of, this is doing what the American people want us to do."

Majority Leader McConnell has consistently offered the same rules and procedures that the Senate approved for the trial of Bill Clinton, 100 to zero. And now, top Democrats are asking Pelosi, end the charade. They are demanding it. Even Senator Feinstein, fellow Californian, saying it's Pelosi's decision. But if they are serious and urgent, send them over. If it isn't, don't send it over. Democrats Doug Jones, Angus King, Joe Manchin, Chris Murphy, Richard Blumenthal, Chris Coons, and others all echoing Feinstein's ultimatum. Even one House member, Adam Smith, he called for Pelosi to stop stalling. Then he had to recant probably after getting, well, beaten down in closed doors, smoke-filled rooms by friends of the speaker. Look at this poll, a whopping 58 percent of Americans think Pelosi needs to send the articles over. That would be called due process and fundamental fairness. Of course, don't expect it tonight. Pelosi is still desperately dragging this on and on. And President Trump, he is taking her to task -- pretty entertaining way as well. Take a look."

It's all been one, big, continuous, nonstop, never-ending political stunt, lies, conspiracies, slander, besmirchment, the nonbinding, unenforceable, meaningless War Powers resolution. That's the latest example. Let me address all of you, though, in the U.S. Senate tonight, all of you Republican senators. You do not and should not ever lend any credibility to this despicable, corrupt Schiff show. Don't do it, because all you're doing is hurting America people in the process. Let them do it, you don't be a part of it. Let the Democrats -- they -- OK, they impeach the president. Your job is to run the trial, of course, with the chief justice presiding. Let them present their case. They impeached him. Let them tell you why. Now, I'd like to hear -- they can bring in the one fact witness. But, constitutionally, they impeach and they present their case to you. They say they have the evidence to impeach, your constitutional role, you Republican senators, is the trial, the chief justice presides. The only, and one fact witness, bring him in. Just one, everyone else is an opinion, hearsay witness. Rules of evidence, federal rules of evidence, don't allow hearsay evidence to be presented. Make them show you why they impeached Donald J. Trump. It is not your job, Republican senators, or your constitutional role to redo their sick, twisted corrupt investigation with no due process. Now, after the House managers present the reasons, their case which why they impeach the president, bring in the one relevant fact witness they use so he can repeat, Ambassador Sondland, what he said or read back, you know, to the House, or just read back the testimony, then you can vote. That's your job. You don't have to do their job. They impeach and then they're going to tell you why. They are going to present their case. It's not your job to fix their screw up. You Republican senators are weak and timid if you give credibility to this repulsive, corrupt political stunt. You are as guilty as Schiff, Nadler and Speaker-in-name-only Pelosi. They impeached, let them show you why. When they fail spectacularly, and they already have, and they will, this will end the madness. In other words, Republican senators, stand up for the United States Constitution, that is your role. That is your job. And tonight, my next guest believes the ongoing impeachment charade was never about removing President Trump from office. Instead, it was designed as a tool to hurt Republican senators in blue and purple states. This is guy that has never lost a case as a prosecutor in his life. Pretty smart guy.

They voted, not a single Republican went along with them. In fact, they didn't even keep all the Democrats. But the House exercised its prerogative and they impeached the president. There is no mathematical way he is ever going to be convicted. And they know that. So their goal cannot be to remove Donald Trump from office. It is to neuter his second term. I think he is going to win in November. It's to neuter that second term by targeting the Cory Gardners and Martha McSallys and Thom Tillises and the Susan Collins and Joni Ernst. Because if Trump wins and he doesn't have the Senate, then he is not going to get any judicial vacancies filled. He's not going to replace a Supreme Court justice if he or she retires. He's not going to get the foreign policy he wants. He is not going to get the cabinet he wants. So, I never thought this was about removing Donald Trump because they're not going to do it. It's about putting Cory Gardner in a really tough series of votes so he has to defend him in November of this fall."

So, constitutionally, it's the sole role of the House of Representatives to impeach. It is the sole role of the Senate to put the trial on. We have the role for the chief justice of the Supreme Court, he presides. Now, the House managers will present their case.

The Senate's job is to deliberate. It is not to investigate and then deliberate, because if that were true, we wouldn't need the House. Schiff was in such a hurry. I mean, keep in mind, Sean, all your viewers have to go to court if they have a disagreement with a fellow citizen. House Republicans had to go to court to get documents in Fast and Furious. We had to go fight Adam Schiff in court to find out who funded the dossier. So, we all know how to get to the courthouse. Schiff didn't want to go to court. He wants the Senate to call the very witnesses that he didn't have the courage to call himself. And that's not their job. The good news is the senators that I talked to on a regular basis under the leadership of Mitch McConnell are not falling for Nancy Pelosi's trick. She can send them and they'll do what they want.

They continued to grow when Iran refused to hand over those black boxes, refused investigators access to the crash site. Now they are claiming those black boxes have been damaged and the memory lost. But the U.S., the U.K., and the Canadian government now believe that plane with 176 innocent people on board was shot down by an SA15 antimissile defense system purchased by the Iranians from Russia in a 2005, $700 million deal. Whoever fired it no doubt believed the U.S. was attacking them. Iran is insisting still that plane was brought down by a technical failure. But the U.S. intelligence is strong. It's based on satellite images, infrared technology and communication intercept. One of the other big questions, what was this Ukrainian plane doing flying in the middle of the war zone? The U.S. FAA had banned its pilots and careers from flying anywhere near Iran, Iraq or the Persian Gulf. Nevertheless they were there.

Earlier today, the president called on all Republicans to oppose crazy Nancy Pelosi and her War Powers Resolution and although the House voted for the purely symbolic, nonbinding resolution, not every Democrat supported it. We should also note, many legal scholars say the War Powers Act is unconstitutional. I agree with them. I agree with John Bolton. It infringes on the president's powers as commander-in-chief, Article 2 powers. Joining us now with reaction, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, House Oversight Committee member, Freedom Caucus member, founder, Mark Meadows, House Intel Committee ranking member, Devin Nunes. By the way, Devin Nunes would be the guy whose report was vindicated and proven 100 percent correct. And the compromised congenital liar was proven to lie again.

And yet they still impeached him anyway. It was disgraceful. There is a personal vendetta. You can see that Nancy Pelosi and her liberal lieutenants have used to carry out and continue on with this witch-hunt. But you know what? The American people have abandoned them. The American people are tired of that kind of personal attack style. They like that President Trump has gotten the economy back on track. And now, that he's keeping us safe. And he took out one of the most brutal terrorist in the history of our country. And he should be commended for it. They should be backing him like we all backed Barack Obama when he took out Osama bin Laden. We disagreed with him on a lot of other things but he got it right with bin Laden.

I guess the question is, it's a matter of law, can he withdraw his guilty plea or not? And I don't know, that's a legal question. And I know the judge has tried to get him to withdraw the guilty plea. I don't know where he -- it's in the process whether he can or cannot, and then what happens there.

And media writer for \"The Hill\", Joe Concha. Lara, you expressed disappointment, I saw it in an interview you gave, with your colleagues in the media. You worked for \"60 Minutes.\" Kind of a big deal. You were out with our troops a lot. You know about Soleimani. I have known about Soleimani a long time, too. It's about as bad as you get. LARA LOGAN, HOST OF \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\" ON FOX NATION: I do. Well, I mean, he was a terrorist. And that's not -- you know, subjective saying that's -- and the U.S. -- he was designated as a foreign terrorist and that was because Iran has been using terrorism as a tool of state craft. They have made it part of their foreign policy. And he was the architect of that. And I guess what disturbs me most about the coverage is that there are millions of people in Iran who did not mourn Qassem Soleimani's death. So, where was their side of the story? Where were their voices? In fact, I was talking to some of the Iranian opposition leaders just yesterday, and one of them said to me, this funeral and this show of, you know, outpouring of grief was a theater for the Western media and they bought the whole thing. You know, where was the pictures such as the one I was sent of people burning Qassem Soleimani's picture in cities across Iran? Of people putting pictures of the Iranian opposition leaders? Where were those pictures? And you know, Sean, it was 1,500 people who were killed just a few months ago and there were Quds Force snipers on the streets of Iran, according to the opposition and according to news reports and to pictures that came out at the time. And those snipers shot young Iranians in the chest and in the head. So, those people, their families are not mourning Qassem Soleimani. And what about those funerals? How much coverage did you see of their funerals? It's quite extraordinary to me that he can be called an inspirational leader. Would have you called bin Laden an inspirational leader? I mean, that would be my question? Where is the voice of the Iranian people? There is not just one voice here. It's not just the regime's --"

Get this, according to a new Fox News poll, billionaire, climate crusader Tom Steyer is now at a whopping 15 percent in South Carolina. And while Elizabeth Warren's campaign is scrambling to survive amid slumping poll numbers and weak fundraising. Here to explain them all -- we're going to call this the 2020 Rove white board segment, every week, because he's great at numbers. We call him the architect.

Buttigieg at 20, Biden at 19, Sanders at 18 and Warren at 15 percent. Now, in order to get a vote and get a delegate, have you got to get 15 percent in any Democratic caucus or primary. So this goes to show, I mean, how closely bunched up it is, because if this were to happen, here's how the delegates would likely split out -- seven for Buttigieg, six for Biden, six for Sanders and five for Warren. That isn't a big gap between any of them. That's what the first contest seemed to look like. You mentioned Iowa and it's a similar result."

And again, 12 delegates for Sanders, 11 delegates for Buttigieg, 10 for Biden and eight for warren. So, after the first two primaries, if everything plays out like this, think about this -- we'll have Sanders at 18, Buttigieg at 18, Biden at 16, and Warren at 13. This thing is going to be bunched up if it stays as close as this appears to be. And all the rest of these candidates are going to be out of the running when it comes to delegates because they don't get 15 percent if these polls are accurate. Nobody else comes close to 15 percent."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",

By the end of the night on March 3rd, 48 percent of the delegates to the national convention will be, if elected in the first four contests we are likely to see in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, we are likely to see three or four candidates in each state get 15 percent or more. And we could have on the third of March, because that's where Bloomberg begins to play, we could have as many in some instances as five candidates carving up the delegate pool. So, we could show up in Milwaukee with nobody with a clear majority on the first ballot."

The queen now appears to be in crisis mode, with \"The Daily Mail\" reporting that she's been on a four-way conference call all day with Harry, Charles, and Williams in an effort to resolve the couple's exit. The newspaper also reports that Meghan left the U.K. and flew back to Canada where she'd already left her 8-month-old son, Archie, with a nanny. And it appears Meghan may stay in Canada for the foreseeable future. Finally, Meghan Markle's visits to Buckingham Palace might be a thing of the past, with one royal source telling \"The Sun\" that their move was a, quote, declaration of war on the family -- Sean."
