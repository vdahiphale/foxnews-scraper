This is “The Five.” Reports of a divide inside the Democratic Party. Moderates now are facing threats and political retribution if they work with Republicans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly scolding more than two dozen Democrats who broke rank to support a Republican amendment in a gun control bill this week.  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez take it a step further by threatening to put those Democrats on a list for a primary challenge if they vote with the GOP in the future.  This is very interesting because how did they win in the midterms, Greg? It wasn't necessarily the left. It was in those moderate swing districts where they have to vote as the constituents want.",

It used to be the Kardashians and now it's President Trump and Congress. And so, people go one step further on a lot of issues and they go, wait a second. What does this cost? And that's how, you know, and Marie and I have talked about this a lot. Moderate Democrats who have made inroads in the party in critical parts of the country and Nancy Pelosi and AOC, a brand- new freshman congresswoman is telling them they have to vote in lockstep. Do you think that's going to be popular with their purple constituencies back home? No way! If they throw off the blob and show some independence, they are more electable. And if I want this job for a long time, and by the way I don't know who would want this job is. If you've people telling you if you don't vote a certain way, if you show any independence or logic at all you are going on a list? That's a horrible job."
