The North Koreans understand that we have the nuclear triad that can launch a nuclear weapon against North Korea. I think the disadvantages of doing that, feed into North Korea's propaganda, probably outweigh the benefits of doing that. At this point, we have to stay away from symbolic moves and move towards harsh sanctions. And increasing our military exercises would be one way to do that, especially in the interdiction phase, where we talk about how to interdict North Korean missiles, missile defense. Other things like that, I think, would be more practical on the defense side and not as symbolic.",

That makes it easier because -- they are kind of bound by Senate rules, so the House has to swallow a little bit of that. But there are other things, for instance, the House version only has four tax brackets. The Senate version has seven. The question of state and local income tax deductions. Right now, they're the same but will there be push back to increase that allowance. The difference in pass-through income for small businesses. The Senate version is more generous.

So anytime the government runs deficits that that crowds out private borrowing, raises interest rates and adds to the borrowing costs and slows the economy. We have an open-economy model, assuming the global capital markets won't be affected by a little bit of additional government borrowing, and so that is why our models prove a lot more growth."

But what about the growth impact of cutting the corporate rate like the bill proposes, expensing immediately at 100 percent? You guys give more growth credits than do a lot of other models."

So when you lower the cost of capital, you increase the amount of investment in the economy, which raises productivity, wages, living standards. That's all good for economic growth. So those are the most positive aspects of the bill. Unfortunately, they are the least politically popular, but they're the most pro-growth elements."

The top 1 percent of taxpayers pays a greater share of the tax burden than the bottom 90 percent combined. Over the years, and Congress has passed these child tax credits and other tax credits that have knocked millions of people off of tax rolls at the bottom, so the only people left paying taxes are the wealthy. Almost, by definition, anytime you try to cut taxes across the board, to some extent, it will benefit the rich."

These are relatively well-off, upper-middle-class taxpayers but most of them are Republican voters. And they are saying is, my taxes are going to go up after this bill because there's no real cut. As you know, there's no cut at all in the top rate, income tax rate in the House bill, and only a one percentage point cut in the Senate tax bill. So they say, I am going to pay hundreds, tens of thousands of dollars more on income. That sound plausible to you?"

First of all, I suspect Mike Flynn was essentially broke. Very expensive to defend yourself against a federal prosecutor. He's been in the military his whole life and I think he just had run out of money. Secondly, it looks like he did lie to the FBI. That is a felony. And for whatever reason he said these things to the FBI, that remains a mystery.

When FBI agents interviewed him, there was reporting at the time, and James Comey, in a private briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, said his agent did not believe Flynn was lying, that he had forgotten these conversations, what was discussed. So the fact this is changing makes a strong case that, as Dan said, he's simply trying to cut a deal to forestall being hit with larger charges. There's a good question of whether he did lie or not."

Whether it is local, from the district, or federal, it's taxpayer money. And something else that is disturbing, which is some of these payments seemed to have been serial. It wasn't just a one-time payment, but a number of payments.

The Constitution says the Congress in both Houses can expel a member by a two-thirds vote. That happened almost to Bob Packwood, of Oregon, in the '80s after a Senate Ethics Committee determined that he harassed women. And before they could expel him, he resigned.

Ten years of failed policies by Republican and Democratic administrations, and now we are only willing to give 10-months-worth of robust sanctions. Look at the other options. Diplomacy, North Korea doesn't want to talk to us. So what exactly are we going to talk about? The military option comes with several disadvantages. So we have to look at the options clear eyed.

And some of the things that these Chinese banks are doing to aid North Korea, sanctions evasion, they would have been punished very severely through the Iran sanctions program. So until we get to that point -- I think the Trump administration has gone the furthest of any presidential administration to target China and to go after its nationals and companies. They've held back from going after additional banks and they actually held back on some of the sanctions for issues they put forward. They need to really unleash the power of the Treasury Department to go after both Pyongyang and Beijing."

I think the disadvantages of doing that, feed into North Korea's propaganda, probably outweigh the benefits of doing that. At this point, we have to stay away from symbolic moves and move towards harsh sanctions. And increasing our military exercises would be one way to do that, especially in the interdiction phase, where we talk about how to interdict North Korean missiles, missile defense. Other things like that, I think, would be more practical on the defense side and not as symbolic."

Jose Ines Garcia Zarate was acquitted of murder and involuntary manslaughter charges as well as assault with a deadly weapon. President Trump, who made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, called the verdict disgraceful and promised the issue will hurt Democrats at the ballot box. Tweeting quote, \"The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a seven-time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on crime they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections. We are back with Dan Henninger, Mary Anastasia O'Grady, Jason Riley and Kim Strassel. So, Jason, explain this verdict to me. There were several charges they could have convicted him on, but they did convict him on any."

They had several charges they could have brought, first-degree murder, secondary murder, involuntary manslaughter, and they didn't find any of them sufficient. But I think, ultimately, Paul, sanctuary city politics are what killed Kate Steinle in addition to this man who pulled this trigger."

Because they have issues with this person. San Francisco has a noncooperation policy in place. And it remains in place today. If he were picked up, if he were being held, he would be released again. They have done nothing to change it. Moreover, the state of California has made it a state policy that moves more towards the San Francisco policy."

Instead of deporting him, they sent him to San Francisco to face a marijuana charge that was 20 years old, and then San Francisco let him go -- California let him go. But that was a mistake. But what about the INS. What about --"

That is what Jason is describing, a city that will not comply with federal law. You get a San Francisco jury and they go, we are not convicting this guy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, let's talk about the impact of this kind of decision on the politics of immigration. Because for those of us who are for relatively open immigration, and I am, and I think you are, too, this is a terrible verdict, because a lot of people who look at this verdict say, oh, there you go. People who might be open to immigration say, we can't enforce our borders adequately because he keeps coming back. And then when we catch somebody, we can't convict them if he commits a crime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, it definitely loses public sentiment. Because the view becomes, look, if we can't get even rid of somebody like this guy, multiple felony convictions, deported numerous times and just let out on the streets, our system is broken, and we can't afford, from a crime perspective or any other perspective, to do comprehensive immigration reform. On the San Francisco thing, too, I don't think a lot of Democrats are thrilled, as Dan said, that San Francisco is taking this stand, because they are worried about public sentiment. And that they're on the wrong side of it. That's why you even have people like Dianne Feinstein, California Democratic Senator, complaining about San Francisco's policies."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

If you want to deal on DACA, the DREAMers, why not speak up and say, you know what, this is not right, and this is not related to how we should think about immigration, and we will enforce those laws and we're going to cooperate. I think you are likely to get an easier chance getting a consensus for legal immigration and legalizing the DREAMers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",

But I think we should all make an exception for when he causes international incidents, which is what he did when he retweeted these anti-Muslim videos by a fringe group in the United Kingdom. When British Prime Minister Theresa May, her office criticized him, he then personally attacked the prime minister. Racial -- the religious question is tough enough without him elevating it and undermining one of our biggest allies in this fight."

I think these tactics by O'Keefe not only undermine serious investigative journalism, but they also trivial sexual assault. And I'm glad the \"Washington Post\" called him out on it."

This is the Washington transportation system, which said it was going to refuse to run ads on the sides of buses from the Catholic archdiocese of Washington, which said, \"Give the perfect gift,\" and showed some shepherds against a dark sky. Why? Because Washington Metro said this might promote religion or religious belief. Jesus, Mary and Joseph weren't even in the ads. Just a bunch of shepherds. This is where the ethos of \"happy holidays\" get you. I will tell you, Paul, Santa is next."
