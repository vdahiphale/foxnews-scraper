In fact, it was President Trump who brought black unemployment to its lowest rate, brought extended funding, permanent funding for HVCUs, criminal justice reform.

JESSICA TARLOV, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__BUSTLE.COM&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=9A1hOk-kPnkBBx9TT7Sn2yvGxK-iChHgeLiFJRTtC8U&s=XbG03qXy16wBrUHc0iUD53LgBntFfAqqwXL69jeekRE&e= : I'm not sure I would call it a mistake so much as a missed opportunity. I do think there was a way to gracefully talk about the difference between peaceful protest in honor of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement and rioting and looting that's going on between 1 and 4 o'clock in the morning in cities like Portland.  Lori Lightfoot was part of the convention, the mayor of Chicago. She has spoken out about the violence, raised the bridges over the last weekend for the first time in a very long time. We certainly could have had that discussion and in that way honored the good police officers and said the bad apples have no place in this dialogue. But I would say that this election comes down to health care and what's going on with COVID-19. And the contrast couldn't be starker than listening to Joe Biden talk to the families of the 170,000 Americans who lost their lives versus Donald Trump when asked about the COVID death toll, saying it is what it is, which has become a catchphrase across all of the DNC with Michelle Obama, most notably on Monday night using it. So, I think that Joe Biden did a great job with the contrast of light versus darkness.

An African immigrant who came here, saved all of his money, was a firefighter in Minneapolis to open a sports bar. It was closed for COVID-19 and he was about to reopen it. And then it got burned down. And Democrats didn't have anything to say about that. It's about the Ethiopian immigrant who owned a furniture store in Minneapolis. So, Democrats claim to be standing up for, but are completely ignoring on this issue.   Yes, COVID is at the top of mind of all Americans, but so is law and order and safety. And for Democrats just to completely ignore it and then stand on the soapbox of empathy doesn't really add up when it comes to policy positions and what they would actually do. And in terms of dealing with the pandemic, last night, Joe Biden talked all about how it doesn't have to be this way. He would have handled the pandemic differently but didn't give any details. And when he said that he would engage in PPE and testing.  Well, the Trump administration has done a lot of that. The testing is a little slower than it should be. But they created a test from scratch, pulled off a lot of government regulation to do it. And Democrats are the party that likes to put a lot of regulation onto private industry when the Trump administration has taken it off to fight this virus. And COVID isn't just about fighting the virus, by the way. It's about people's economic livelihood. It's about children's education. It's about suicide rates. It's about overdoses. So, the president has talked about all of those things and doing more than one thing at once. And Joe Biden hasn't addressed any of it in detail.",

I find it quite ironic, Martha, that this group endorses Joe Biden on the seventh anniversary of the biggest failure of Joe Biden's career when in Syria, Bashar al-Assad gassed children after the Obama-Biden team said they would do something about it.

Here are some of the scenes from those moments, as you see the front steps of the White House the president and the first lady with the family behind. Robert Trump was the youngest Trump brother. He died Saturday after being hospitalized in New York with an undisclosed illness. He was part of the family business at one point, as a top executive in the Trump organization and he is the person that the president had described as his best friend. He tweeted just a short time ago, Robert, I love you. Rest in peace. Robert Trump was 71 years old. You can hear the bagpipes there, sort of memory of their Scottish heritage in the family. President Trump's mother was -- her ancestry came from Scotland. So, we send our condolences to the family of course on this -- on this occasion today. So, coming on Sunday night, we start the whole new cycle with the Republican National Convention up next, and Bret Baier and I will kick off the whole week with a Sunday night special at 10 o'clock Eastern. We'll do that live in Washington, D.C. as we get ready to cover four nights of the Republican National Convention, some of it virtual, some of it live with a big event on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday night when the president gives his big speech. And we expect to see some fireworks there as well, and hopefully some fireworks throughout the week to report on for you as well. That's THE STORY of Friday, August 21, 2020. But as always, THE STORY continues as you know. So, we will be here for you on Sunday and throughout next week. Have a great weekend, everybody. Good night.

This race is tightening, tied right now in Minnesota and in Pennsylvania. Just to give you an idea, Katie Pavlich and Jessica Tarlov standing by to debate. But we begin tonight with the White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany. Kayleigh, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. We heard a little bit of the president's - great to have you. We heard a little bit of the president's reaction. One of the big themes throughout the course of this week was that the president is unfit. Many of the speakers said and they said that he is not up to the job. We heard that from Michelle Obama and a lot last night about leaving the darkness behind and going to a place that is lighter. What is the White House response to those to all of that?"

He has one singular priority and it is not the politicians that operate in this town. It is the American people. I've seen him make decisions on COVID, on the economy and what he has done each and every day to say, I don't care what the politicians are saying, I don't care what the establishment is saying. I'm working for the American people on a V shaped recovery, on a vaccine. By the end of the year. It will be the fastest pace for a vaccine, for a novel pathogen in history. That is his priority and its entirely off base the things you heard this week and I think next week you'll hear an entirely different story."

This was one of the major themes that we heard, the suggestion being that President Trump is not those things. They obviously have very different styles. And the president has said many times, if you don't like my tone, there's not much I can do about that. Does he try to counteract that in any way? Does he try to show himself in a different light at this convention or not?"

And look, I've watched him interact with parents who have lost their children because of crime on the streets. And I've watched him interact with families who lost their children to police brutality. We think most police are great, hardworking men and women in this country. But I've seen him on both sides of the issue, and I've watched him express empathy and come out of that room and be very affected by it. But I've also seen this, and it's something you don't always see from presidents, a president who looks the American people in the eye and says, I'll stand up to Iran, I'll stand up to dictatorships. I will fight for America first on the world stage. And I've watched him sit across from foreign leaders and not be afraid to say, how does this help America? How does this put the United States men and women first? He's unafraid. He's unabashed, and I'll fight for the American people aggressively. It's something he won't apologize for."

      "speaker": "HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE",

    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes, not in the slightest. The president signed into law the CARES Act, which provided a $10 billion line of credit for the post office. We offer $10 billion in negotiations to which Nancy Pelosi didn't accept and left town and now has manufactured a crisis. The real crisis here is this. When you have Nevada in their primary mass mail out voting, not mail in, mailing out to their entire voter rolls, ballots, which ended up in trash cans piled up in trash cans and the Las Vegas Journal Review did great reporting on this and pinned to the boards of apartment complexes that undoubtedly opens ourselves up to fraud. We saw charges in Paterson, New Jersey. There were charges in L.A. County. This is a system subject to fraud and this president will fight for the integrity of our elections."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, we've seen here in Paterson, New Jersey, they're going to redo that election of the one that you just mentioned. The president has said that he believes that that the only way he will lose is if this is a rigged election. Does he think that that is going to happen? It feels like both sides are preparing already for a post-November 3rd argument over who won and who lost. Do you think this thing goes on for some time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "We certainly hope that doesn't happen. The president wants an election with integrity. But when you look around the country, it's not just Nevada, it's not just New Jersey. We saw this in Pennsylvania as well when the system which was created and designed for absentee voting, voting for a reason when you're unable to vote, when it is flooded with a mass influx of ballots, what we see is what happened in New York, where it took more than six weeks to determine the outcome of Carolyn Maloney's race. And you had about 20 percent of ballots rejected. We want a system that enfranchise these people, that enables people to vote, and that ultimately captures the will of the American people. And that's what the president will fight for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, there was a lot of attempt during the last week at the Democratic National Convention to show themselves as a very diverse party. That was clearly one of the thrusts of all of the videos and a lot of the things that they that they put on the screen. There's a story that just came out a little while ago on Politico that that claims that there's a leaked audio of President Trump speaking with black civil rights leaders at a meeting and saying that he was glad that voter turnout, black voter turnout in 2016 was low. He said that that was great for him. Have you seen or heard this audio? Do you think it's of concern or is there different context that you think it should be seeing in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Literally, as I was walking out here so probably 60 seconds before I joined you, I had someone flagged that story for me. And what I was told is the broader context of this audio suggests that the president said it's a good thing that black voters realized that Hillary Clinton was not the candidate to advance their interests. In fact, it was President Trump who brought black unemployment to its lowest rate, brought extended funding, permanent funding for HVCUs, criminal justice reform. He's fought in for black men and women around this country. And I believe the election will tell that story in a very palpable way when you see the number of black men and women who show up to empower this president."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Just before I let you go, and I know you work at the White House and not in the campaign, but the big night is going to be at the White House. Is there anything that you can tell us about how the tone or any part of this is going to be very different given the virtual nature of all this than what we've seen so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a really good question. And I can tell you there's going to be a big difference. In the last convention, in the Democrat convention, you saw a whole lot of politicians. This convention, you're going to see a whole lot of American people. This is the president who's for the people, he's an outsider. And you're going to see the American people featured in a way that was deftly and toned deftly absent from the Democratic National Convention."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "It's what he didn't say. And he got through the speech and I thought he got through it in a very decent manner. It was the shortest speech they say ever made of its kind. So, it was short, didn't talk about law enforcement, didn't talk about what's happening in all these Democrat run cities like Chicago, New York, Portland, and many others."

So, do you think that that was a mistake, to not acknowledge what's going on there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, SENIOR DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, https",

I do think there was a way to gracefully talk about the difference between peaceful protest in honor of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement and rioting and looting that's going on between 1 and 4 o'clock in the morning in cities like Portland. Lori Lightfoot was part of the convention, the mayor of Chicago. She has spoken out about the violence, raised the bridges over the last weekend for the first time in a very long time. We certainly could have had that discussion and in that way honored the good police officers and said the bad apples have no place in this dialogue. But I would say that this election comes down to health care and what's going on with COVID-19. And the contrast couldn't be starker than listening to Joe Biden talk to the families of the 170,000 Americans who lost their lives versus Donald Trump when asked about the COVID death toll, saying it is what it is, which has become a catchphrase across all of the DNC with Michelle Obama, most notably on Monday night using it. So, I think that Joe Biden did a great job with the contrast of light versus darkness. I completely take your point there, but I think that we know who is really fighting for the soul of this nation and is the empathetic party, which is the Democrats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, two very big topics right now. When I think of darkness, though, I do think about a lot of these videos that we're seeing. I think about this man getting kicked in the head outside of his truck. I think about the former police officer in New York City that we just showed last night who was kicked and beaten by someone in the middle of broad daylight on 39 streets. So, I just do feel that there's an ignoring of this issue. And I don't think that voters like it when they feel like they're being told to sort of like, hey, look at this shiny thing over here. When something is happening right in front of them that they want to know how - what they're going to do about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Look, it is not empathetic to ignore rioting and burning down of businesses of the very people that Democrats claim to be standing up for, like immigrants in Minneapolis, for example. An African immigrant who came here, saved all of his money, was a firefighter in Minneapolis to open a sports bar. It was closed for COVID-19 and he was about to reopen it. And then it got burned down. And Democrats didn't have anything to say about that. It's about the Ethiopian immigrant who owned a furniture store in Minneapolis. So, Democrats claim to be standing up for, but are completely ignoring on this issue. Yes, COVID is at the top of mind of all Americans, but so is law and order and safety. And for Democrats just to completely ignore it and then stand on the soapbox of empathy doesn't really add up when it comes to policy positions and what they would actually do. And in terms of dealing with the pandemic, last night, Joe Biden talked all about how it doesn't have to be this way. He would have handled the pandemic differently but didn't give any details. And when he said that he would engage in PPE and testing. Well, the Trump administration has done a lot of that. The testing is a little slower than it should be. But they created a test from scratch, pulled off a lot of government regulation to do it. And Democrats are the party that likes to put a lot of regulation onto private industry when the Trump administration has taken it off to fight this virus. And COVID isn't just about fighting the virus, by the way. It's about people's economic livelihood. It's about children's education. It's about suicide rates. It's about overdoses. So, the president has talked about all of those things and doing more than one thing at once. And Joe Biden hasn't addressed any of it in detail."

He got millions of Americans back to work. He bailed out the industries that needed to be bailed out. He invested in infrastructure and in clean energy and created millions of jobs and on top of it got tens of millions of Americans health care. There is a formula for this, and it comes from the Obama-Biden administration. President Trump likes to run around talking about how great his record is. He built on the successes of Barack Obama. And it's time that he started admitting that from job creation to the black unemployment rate, it all started with Barack Obama."

Just last night, protesters in that city faced off with federal agents outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the 80 days since these protests began. Police in Portland have been forced to declare riots 17 times, which gives them a little bit more authority to move in. And in the city of Chicago, local reports state that the unrest, the violence and the looting, there may be one of the reasons that police officers are retiring at unusually rapid rates, which is something we're seeing in many cities as well.

You've got cops in your home; you have them outside your home. To extend it out is to pull cops from that district so everybody else gets less. So, in a way, it's hypocritical, you know what I mean? You have 80 percent approval rating, and yet you feel besieged by a really serious (ph) minority that we're seeing tear up as all over the country. And I just think at this point, it's just not credible. You took the job. You're not allowed to cordon off the world when the rest of us want exactly what you want. We would like the police to respond to us. We would like professional police to protect us. And when you do it, we don't have it. So, I guess this is up to Chicago to deal with it.

Look, their argument is the same, they don't like Donald Trump saying he's not going to start any new wars and he is going to bring our troops home. Many of these same individuals freaked out when we decided that we would move the U.S. troop level in Germany from 34,000 to 25,000. It's crazy to think that 25,000 troops in Germany is not enough. And so, the question has to be asked, at what point are these individuals going to be able to say that something new and different needs to happen? We've had foreign policy failures. I find it quite ironic, Martha, that this group endorses Joe Biden on the seventh anniversary of the biggest failure of Joe Biden's career when in Syria, Bashar al-Assad gassed children after the Obama-Biden team said they would do something about it. We saw this gassing of children, a genocide by all accounts, and nothing was done. So, I find it really troubling that this group which really pushes war inc. in so many ways, wants to somehow say that the return of Joe Biden and the return to the status quo is going to be better. It's really troubling to many Americans."

Here are some of the scenes from those moments, as you see the front steps of the White House the president and the first lady with the family behind. Robert Trump was the youngest Trump brother. He died Saturday after being hospitalized in New York with an undisclosed illness. He was part of the family business at one point, as a top executive in the Trump organization and he is the person that the president had described as his best friend. He tweeted just a short time ago, Robert, I love you. Rest in peace. Robert Trump was 71 years old. You can hear the bagpipes there, sort of memory of their Scottish heritage in the family. President Trump's mother was -- her ancestry came from Scotland. So, we send our condolences to the family of course on this -- on this occasion today. So, coming on Sunday night, we start the whole new cycle with the Republican National Convention up next, and Bret Baier and I will kick off the whole week with a Sunday night special at 10 o'clock Eastern. We'll do that live in Washington, D.C. as we get ready to cover four nights of the Republican National Convention, some of it virtual, some of it live with a big event on the South Lawn of the White House on Thursday night when the president gives his big speech. And we expect to see some fireworks there as well, and hopefully some fireworks throughout the week to report on for you as well. That's THE STORY of Friday, August 21, 2020.
