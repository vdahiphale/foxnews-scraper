First of all, they have got to get the website to work without a hitch this time. They have got to get people signed up. The have got to get through the Supreme Court.

You know, one of the things that people have never been sure about is will this program ultimately result in a lot of people being thrown off their employer-paid insurance and quote, unquote, \"dumped in the exchanges\"? So a lot of the critics of ObamaCare say the more people that go on the exchanges, the few people can keep their own doctors and stay with the health insurance they like and so forth.
