And there's a good chance that every Democrat will vote in a party-line vote against Mr. Pompeo. If they do that, that would be unfortunate.  Just over a year ago, the Senate confirmed Mike Pompeo to be CIA director. He got 66 votes. He had 14 Democrats vote to confirm him. This is a man who graduated first in his class from West Point, who has served this nation and who has been the CIA director.   And, as we look at this attack in Toronto -- we obviously don't know the details yet -- but it underscores what a dangerous world we're in. And we need a strong secretary of state in place. And so I hope the Democrats don't play politics with national security appointments, but instead confirm Mike Pompeo to this position.",

So, I believe we will take up Mike Pompeo on the floor of the Senate. And I'm hopeful and I`m confident we will get the votes to confirm him. I think Mike Pompeo will make a very strong secretary of state. This is a perilous time across the world. We need a strong, steady hand as secretary of state, and in particular we need a secretary of state who understands the threats posed by the nation of Iran and the dangers of a nuclear Iran.  Mike Pompeo is someone I have worked very closely with over the years in dealing with Iran and in using American diplomacy and economic sanctions and the full force and power of the United States to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon and using that weapon against Americans or against our allies.",

When it comes to NAFTA, another thing that I have urged the president and urged the administration to do is use NAFTA renegotiation to enact regulatory reform, and in particular to codify the REINS Act.   The REINS Act would provide that any economic regulation that imposes $100 million or more of cost on the economy can't go into the effect without an affirmative up/down vote from Congress. If enacted, it would be the most significant, far-reaching structural reg reform ever passed.  And if they attach it to NAFTA, then, under trade promotion authority, it goes straight to the Senate for an up/down vote at 50 votes, and the Democrats can't filibuster it. So it`s good for the economy. It's good for jobs. It would be a tremendous step for our country.",
