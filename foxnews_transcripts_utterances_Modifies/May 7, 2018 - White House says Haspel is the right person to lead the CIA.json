Administration sources confirm Haspel is willing to withdraw for consideration over the controversy about her role in the CIA's controversial interrogation program, but the White House is firmly standing behind her.",

They can do that to Republicans, Republicans can do that back. But, this is, and we always know this is the case. This is the byproduct of team sport politics. The other team cannot make it easy for your nominations to get through. It has nothing to do with qualifications, expertise or talent. They've just got to do it because you're not on the same team. But, the other thing, the long-term consequences of stuff like this, you will be punished in the future for the brave choices you make in the past. So, how will that influence present-day patriots when they have to deal with really, really tough choices in terms of people being threatened, or there could be an impending attack and you have to decide.

But also, remember, John Brennan, who was a superior to Gina Haspel, was confirmed to be CIA director, and he did not go through this kind of scrutiny. And so, the fact that she is, under President Trump, does leave a lot of room for questions in terms of the strategy, politically. Just a moment to talk about her, after 9/11, she was one of the men and women that were asked to do really tough things. She wasn't the lawyer. Ok. She was the intelligence operator. And the lawyers at the Justice Department deliberate over all of this, and they say here's where the law is. I can't think of a better way to empower terrorists than to take our men and women in intelligence, and what Greg was saying, basically make them second-guess themselves. Where there like, oh, should I, can I, would I? They had the legal clearance. They did really tough things. They caught people like -- I don't call them person, they've got terrorists, like Khalid Sheik Mohammed who cut off the head of Danny Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter. There were three terrorists who went through the waterboarding that was the one enhanced interrogation technique that they did not like. It is no longer available to be used unless this president or this Justice Department or this congress decides to change it.  The other thing -- I'll just mention one other point, Ron Wyden the senator from Oregon, said why her? I mean, there's so many women in national security who could do this job. No, actually, exactly her. She had 33 years of her career dedicated to public service. She asked to be transferred to the counterintelligence. She was transferred on September 11, 2001. That was her first day on that job. I think that they deserve a lot more of our support than this condemnation decades later. I do think she will be confirmed. The Democrats are choosing a really unfortunate reason to try to put her through the ringer. Just let her get through because she's going to be confirmed.",

And, all of a sudden, Leon Panetta does, wait a second, back off. I'm protecting my people. All of sudden, people say, wait a second, you're going after me for doing something the Justice Department allowed me to do to stop the next attack. If you read Jose Rodriguez's book, you read what the CIA men and women did at the time. There's no doubt they stopped the next attack. Not only do I hope that she embraces her role in the black sites and the enhanced interrogation. I think she should do it with pride. And I think she should invite people to have this dialogue. I did what I was supposed to do. I'm proud of what I did as an American. I follow the law. I'm very proud of it. After 32 years, to get to the point where I'm deputy, now acting. If you want to give me the job, go do it. If you don't like what I did, you should have stopped -- well, you shouldn't have allowed us to do the program because it was signed off by everyone. So, it comes down to votes.  Rand Paul is, you know, he was seeing -- he's an eye doctor at the time, so he's perfectly qualified to comment on this. So, he doesn't want to vote for her. But if Joe Manchin, Jon Tester, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, or Clair McCaskill has any hope of holding onto their seats in red states, they better vote for her. And, for her to say I don't want to be Ronny Jackson on Wednesday, and then to have to run to the CIA to say come on back, we're going to fight for you. It shows me the White House was slow to back her. They did not get the campaign going. And if Pompeo couldn't get 60 votes, she's saying why do I want to not only not get the job but ruin my reputation at the same time.

He's goal is to protect the president, protect the family. He's trying to be forthright and transparent and answer the questions. He's not ruling anything out or in, and that's how it should be. A smart lawyer doesn't like, you know, close doors. You have to make sure to say, OK. This is what we're looking at. We're going to evaluate it. Make case-by- case determination and bases here. In terms of whether or not the president would have to, you know, testify or to take the fifth, etcetera, there's some other legal hurdles and challenges here. And you've had some key rulings, as of late, that has actually benefited the president where you've seen the federal judges kind of put a stop to some of the nonsense, saying this is too wide a scope.

So, I think that there's going to be some legal hurdles for Mueller. Not to mention, how many people that he might have coming forward with the testimony. They're going to be impeached or have no credibility, whatsoever, like, you know, in terms of the Mueller investigation. So, I think that's going to be important too.

At the same time, she wants to do everything she can to protect the safety and security of Americans, which is why she's 100 percent committed to going through this confirmation process."

But I always wonder, what do the Democrats wants in a position like this? They never want an adult. Who do they want? Do they want Dr. Phil? Apparently, they don't think a woman who can do the job. They can do that to Republicans, Republicans can do that back. But, this is, and we always know this is the case. This is the byproduct of team sport politics. The other team cannot make it easy for your nominations to get through. It has nothing to do with qualifications, expertise or talent. They've just got to do it because you're not on the same team. But, the other thing, the long-term consequences of stuff like this, you will be punished in the future for the brave choices you make in the past. So, how will that influence present-day patriots when they have to deal with really, really tough choices in terms of people being threatened, or there could be an impending attack and you have to decide. Well, am I going to sacrifice my future and make a decision that could be looked upon later as illegal? Or do I just not do that and just make the world less safe now? That's the thing that scares name."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Think of the president has his finger on the pulse of where the American public is on this from the standpoint of being tough on terror. We've proven that again and again. But also, remember, John Brennan, who was a superior to Gina Haspel, was confirmed to be CIA director, and he did not go through this kind of scrutiny. And so, the fact that she is, under President Trump, does leave a lot of room for questions in terms of the strategy, politically. Just a moment to talk about her, after 9/11, she was one of the men and women that were asked to do really tough things. She wasn't the lawyer. Ok. She was the intelligence operator. And the lawyers at the Justice Department deliberate over all of this, and they say here's where the law is. I can't think of a better way to empower terrorists than to take our men and women in intelligence, and what Greg was saying, basically make them second-guess themselves. Where there like, oh, should I, can I, would I? They had the legal clearance. They did really tough things. They caught people like -- I don't call them person, they've got terrorists, like Khalid Sheik Mohammed who cut off the head of Danny Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter. There were three terrorists who went through the waterboarding that was the one enhanced interrogation technique that they did not like. It is no longer available to be used unless this president or this Justice Department or this congress decides to change it. The other thing -- I'll just mention one other point, Ron Wyden the senator from Oregon, said why her? I mean, there's so many women in national security who could do this job. No, actually, exactly her. She had 33 years of her career dedicated to public service. She asked to be transferred to the counterintelligence. She was transferred on September 11, 2001. That was her first day on that job. I think that they deserve a lot more of our support than this condemnation decades later. I do think she will be confirmed. The Democrats are choosing a really unfortunate reason to try to put her through the ringer. Just let her get through because she's going to be confirmed."

I don't usually like to say this, but what it means for women working in government for her to stick to it, take the support of the president, go forward and be confirmed is so important. She spent 33 years there. It takes a long time for women in government to get to these positions, but government is where women can really make a difference in leadership. Her going forward, standing tall, she has nothing to be ashamed of. She has everything to be proud of. It means a lot for women behind you coming up through the ranks if you go through this confirmation."

If you read Jose Rodriguez's book, you read what the CIA men and women did at the time. There's no doubt they stopped the next attack. Not only do I hope that she embraces her role in the black sites and the enhanced interrogation. I think she should do it with pride. And I think she should invite people to have this dialogue. I did what I was supposed to do. I'm proud of what I did as an American. I follow the law. I'm very proud of it. After 32 years, to get to the point where I'm deputy, now acting. If you want to give me the job, go do it. If you don't like what I did, you should have stopped -- well, you shouldn't have allowed us to do the program because it was signed off by everyone. So, it comes down to votes. Rand Paul is, you know, he was seeing -- he's an eye doctor at the time, so he's perfectly qualified to comment on this. So, he doesn't want to vote for her. But if Joe Manchin, Jon Tester, Joe Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, or Clair McCaskill has any hope of holding onto their seats in red states, they better vote for her. And, for her to say I don't want to be Ronny Jackson on Wednesday, and then to have to run to the CIA to say come on back, we're going to fight for you. It shows me the White House was slow to back her. They did not get the campaign going. And if Pompeo couldn't get 60 votes, she's saying why do I want to not only not get the job but ruin my reputation at the same time. I am horrified and I am embarrassed for lawmakers who will not run to her defense right now."

The communications department didn't know what he was doing, and the rest of the legal team didn't know what he was doing, and it totally dispirited the White House in particular. I think President Trump and Rudy Giuliani knew what they were doing. I don't think he was that surprised. I talked with him for half-hour on radio, half-hour on Fox & Friends, about 20 minutes on the phone the day before. There was no panic. There was no oops. There was no, what have I done here. He felt as though he was on path. What he has to do now is come back and say we have to speak with one voice.

I've never subscribed to that theory, but I know that it exists. And it will turn out however it turns out. The only thing I'm focused on is something that I asked John Yu who is the legal scholar at Berkeley, very accomplished lawyer, and he knows a lot about the branches of government and how they have to interact. And I said what is the settled law of whether a president can ignore a subpoena from the judicial branch, and he said that that is like one of the one thing that has never been decided by a Supreme Court, so that's, actually, this could be kind of interesting, should be the time -- the first time that it's actually decided."

And he's saying, look, he's come on to the case very quickly here. He's catching up, getting up speed on everything. So, now he's going through it. He's goal is to protect the president, protect the family. He's trying to be forthright and transparent and answer the questions. He's not ruling anything out or in, and that's how it should be. A smart lawyer doesn't like, you know, close doors. You have to make sure to say, OK. This is what we're looking at. We're going to evaluate it. Make case-by- case determination and bases here. In terms of whether or not the president would have to, you know, testify or to take the fifth, etcetera, there's some other legal hurdles and challenges here. And you've had some key rulings, as of late, that has actually benefited the president where you've seen the federal judges kind of put a stop to some of the nonsense, saying this is too wide a scope. We want to see the memos, the scope memos, to make sure you can't just engage in a fishing expedition and try to reel in the President of the United States, his family members, and anyone else that he might, you know, have communicated with or have knowledge of this. So, I think that there's going to be some legal hurdles for Mueller. Not to mention, how many people that he might have coming forward with the testimony. They're going to be impeached or have no credibility, whatsoever, like, you know, in terms of the Mueller investigation. So, I think that's going to be important too. Who's going to be left to testify that hasn't been -- inconsistent statements, or resign from the FBI, or written a book? Good luck."

It's self-fueled hysteria generated by those in the media who feed off it inside their bubble and they don't care that outside the bubble America really doesn't give a damn. We don't care. This is how it starts, they wake up in the morning, the TV executives, should we do Stormy or should we do Mueller? Let's do Stormy, OK. Somebody said something about Stormy. OK, let's get a panel and to talk about Stormy. All right. Now, let's get the legal panel to parse the words of the person who've just talked about Stormy. Then, we get the next panel in for the political ramifications. And while this is all going on, someone else will then start the process over again by saying something about Mueller, so then you can switch from Stormy to Mueller. Meanwhile, Trump's numbers continue to go up. America gets incredibly fed up and burned out by this.

I call it IPB, Identity Politics Blindness. They lost not because Hillary was a woman; they lost because all they saw was a woman. Meanwhile, Trump took nothing for granted. The fact is, many voters would have happily voted for a woman, just not that one, because unlike Trump, she didn't speak to their concerns. She only spoke of her entitlement. She just assumed that she had the votes. And just assuming a woman must vote for a woman seems pretty insulting, from a man. Humans are more complex, surprising and interesting than liberals give them credit for. But more than anything, Trump's election is a lesson in effort. At least he showed up, he fought. Hillary didn't. If Democrats learn from that, then they can win. But if they continue to dwell in this narrow-minded, intolerant universe where all people sit in their own identity buckets, where their behavior is fixed forever by sex or race, they will lose.

The working men and women across the country felt that this was movement they wanted to be part of. Be part of the Trump campaign and movement across the country to let blue-collar workers, families, middle class not be left behind. Now, if a fantastic female candidate who went out there and campaigned and hit all the spots you were supposed to, actually spoke to the people in that way, I 100 percent believe they could prevail. Perhaps someday Michelle Obama will run for office. I think she would do quite well. If Oprah Winfrey ran for office, she would do quite well. So it really is just, like, a measure of what you have to offer, what's going on in the country at the time, how you speak to the issues. And Hillary has given us quite a few excuses as to why she did not prevail in the campaign, and one of the latest that we discussed on the show was who she said that she felt the people thought she was a capitalist.

Maybe it will happen in the future. But at the same time, the -- the sand is shifting beneath the Democrats' feet. And there is a new coalition that was built in 2016, and I don't see what the Democrats are doing to try to win back the blue-collar workers. We have a segment coming up in the \"E\" block talking about economics, which is something, really, that is pretty - - quite remarkable, what the left is coming up with regards to talking about capitalism or not.

That, you know, clearly, we had the better credentialed, experienced in terms of preparing to be president candidate. And look what you guys elected. You have someone who has no experience, who's chaotic, impulsive and all the rest. So -- and remember, you've got 52 percent of white women who voted for Trump. And she's saying why is that? Previously, you know, Mrs. Obama has said, \"You know, you can't wait for the next person to save you.

Nothing to do with the fact that she's a woman. If you put Tulsi Gabbard against Nikki Haley, it's game on. It's someone who's a veteran, that understands people, that has a lot to offer. It would be something totally different. She did not lose because she was a woman. She didn't get a vote because she was a woman. By the end of it, it was two candidates.

The Catholic Church said \"You come in,\" to the illegal immigrants, \"and we'll protect families and the like.\" I can't imagine they're going to say, \"Oh, gun owners, guns, if you want, you know, freedom to carry\" -- what is it, conceal and carry or --?"
