      "sentences": "So you heard, we're opening up America again. President Trump gave states guidelines to start easing lockdown restrictions and the medical experts are on-board. It's a three-phase process that starts once a region sees a downward trend in COVID-19 cases for two weeks. Phase 1, still have got to avoid groups of more than ten. Restaurants, gyms and places of worship can open with social distancing guidelines. And you can finally have that elective surgery. Butt implants, here I come. But that's a good thing, and of course, those at risk need to stay home. Also good.  Phase 2, avoid groups of 50 or more. Schools can reopen. Bars can reopen with diminished occupancy -- sounds like me and non-essential travel can resume.  Phase 3, for states with no signs of a coronavirus rebound, workplaces can resume with unrestricted staffing and visits to hospitals and senior living facilities can resume.  So of these fairly specific guidelines, what did Nancy Pelosi call them? Vague and inconsistent. But how dialed in is she, really? Let's check in with the butt-kisser to the stars, James Corden.",

No job, no schedule. TV on all day. It's like being Dana's dog.  In Michigan, you saw a massive protest against a governor who said you couldn't buy gardening seeds. Gardening seeds. If that's not micro, micromanaging, what is? Seeds. It seems like an essential thing at a pandemic, no? Unlike clueless politicians. So, naturally people like, what the hell. See we will trust our leaders until they push their luck and then we get pissed, seeds or no seeds.  So, right now, we're looking at a pretty calm, cool and collected America but it could be like those fake sets on old TV westerns and what you find behind the calm facade is unrest, without pants.  I have a theory that we're all telepathic. That you and I at times know exactly what both of us are thinking because we are thinking the same thing. You know, what I mean, right?  See, you do. Let's say you and I are in a bar and some dude shows up with a snake and a tutu. You and I don't need to say a thing. We know without making eye contact, this place is great. This telepathy -- telepathy -- also happens on Oscar night into the third hour of this oozing wound of entertainment. The entire country knows it's time to turn it off, and we do, without even talking to each other.   We are like a boy band, NSYNC, we are a connected brain not separate identities, races or genders. Our humanity unites us and tells us when we are ready and now, it feels like we are ready. Maybe to go back to work in phases. I think it's week five and we're patient, we're patriotic, but you know and I know that there's going to be a limit.  We're adults. We did the heroic thing, but now we have to do the realistic thing which is weighing the risks of future behavior. We can't be shut down forever. We sacrificed a lot to protect the vulnerable and we still will do that, but as the unemployment rate inches closer to horrifying, we've got to ask, how much more can we take? Meanwhile, what's Adam Schiff doing? Remember the guy who was always trying to catch up with his eyeballs? He says his House Intelligence Committee is conducting real-time oversight of Trump's coronavirus response, but from home, so the guy who captured all the attention with no win impeachment porn causing the media to miss this outbreak is now trying to do it again.

The media went crazy, as did the resistance. They went crazy for a few days. And then what does he do? They issue guidelines that give the decision- making to the governors, which is what the governors wanted all along, so I think it makes sense. The only point that doesn't make any sense is in the first phase, in the very first phase of this, you're allowed to reopen the gyms because God forbid, there's no way that anything to get passed along or transmitted in a room full of sweaty people who are doing everything but licking the equipment.

It's a three-phase process that starts once a region sees a downward trend in COVID-19 cases for two weeks. Phase 1, still have got to avoid groups of more than ten. Restaurants, gyms and places of worship can open with social distancing guidelines. And you can finally have that elective surgery. Butt implants, here I come. But that's a good thing, and of course, those at risk need to stay home. Also good. Phase 2, avoid groups of 50 or more. Schools can reopen. Bars can reopen with diminished occupancy -- sounds like me and non-essential travel can resume. Phase 3, for states with no signs of a coronavirus rebound, workplaces can resume with unrestricted staffing and visits to hospitals and senior living facilities can resume. So of these fairly specific guidelines, what did Nancy Pelosi call them? Vague and inconsistent. But how dialed in is she, really? Let's check in with the butt-kisser to the stars, James Corden."

Maybe he should join Nancy's ice cream in the freezer. God knows, there's room. But as this surreal moment in time continues, so do you -- for now. There are stresses and they're starting to show. I'm not going to lie. It's been a strain on relationships. This was my wife and I before the quarantine -- and this is us now.

No job, no schedule. TV on all day. It's like being Dana's dog. In Michigan, you saw a massive protest against a governor who said you couldn't buy gardening seeds. Gardening seeds. If that's not micro, micromanaging, what is? Seeds. It seems like an essential thing at a pandemic, no? Unlike clueless politicians. So, naturally people like, what the hell. See we will trust our leaders until they push their luck and then we get pissed, seeds or no seeds. So, right now, we're looking at a pretty calm, cool and collected America but it could be like those fake sets on old TV westerns and what you find behind the calm facade is unrest, without pants. I have a theory that we're all telepathic. That you and I at times know exactly what both of us are thinking because we are thinking the same thing. You know, what I mean, right? See, you do. Let's say you and I are in a bar and some dude shows up with a snake and a tutu. You and I don't need to say a thing. We know without making eye contact, this place is great. This telepathy -- telepathy -- also happens on Oscar night into the third hour of this oozing wound of entertainment. The entire country knows it's time to turn it off, and we do, without even talking to each other. We are like a boy band, NSYNC, we are a connected brain not separate identities, races or genders. Our humanity unites us and tells us when we are ready and now, it feels like we are ready. Maybe to go back to work in phases. I think it's week five and we're patient, we're patriotic, but you know and I know that there's going to be a limit. We're adults. We did the heroic thing, but now we have to do the realistic thing which is weighing the risks of future behavior. We can't be shut down forever. We sacrificed a lot to protect the vulnerable and we still will do that, but as the unemployment rate inches closer to horrifying, we've got to ask, how much more can we take? Meanwhile, what's Adam Schiff doing? Remember the guy who was always trying to catch up with his eyeballs? He says his House Intelligence Committee is conducting real-time oversight of Trump's coronavirus response, but from home, so the guy who captured all the attention with no win impeachment porn causing the media to miss this outbreak is now trying to do it again. Man, you can imagine what he is really doing at home."

They refuse to see that Trump is just initiating a process he has done a million times, forcing an entity to do a better job or else. Show the guy a tire, and he's going to kick it. Unlike the media, he understands incentives and persuasion. He is the adult in the room. The media, the children who see tough decisions as scary and mean, I don't think they're going to get through this. But you will. The economy is going to return and you're going to exit this strange surreal moment in time smarter, wiser, stronger. We did the right thing. We sacrificed a lot, but maybe it's time for some of us to get back to work. If we don't, we're all screwed. It won't be the proverbial light switch, it's more like a fancy light dimmer, but you don't have to listen to me. It's okay because I'm listening to you and I hear what you're saying.

Look, Trump has got to be the world's greatest troller, right? He he came out and said that he had the total authority to decide when and how to reopen the country. The media went crazy, as did the resistance. They went crazy for a few days. And then what does he do? They issue guidelines that give the decision- making to the governors, which is what the governors wanted all along, so I think it makes sense. The only point that doesn't make any sense is in the first phase, in the very first phase of this, you're allowed to reopen the gyms because God forbid, there's no way that anything to get passed along or transmitted in a room full of sweaty people who are doing everything but licking the equipment. So, I love a gym. I just think maybe the gym should be in Phase 2 perhaps."

You know -- I had a problem with the total authority comment, too. I'm not saying you can never have a problem with anything he says, but if you're getting mad equally about opposite things in the same week, you don't have a problem with the thing, you just have a problem because he is the one saying it.

So, I really hate the narrative from the Democrats like they were blowing the whistle on this the whole time. It's like in February, you were only talking about impeachment. March 10th, Bill de Blasio was on TV saying, oh you know, it's no big deal coronavirus. So, it's just a bunch of garbage, this narrative. We need to focus on solving these things and again, the one thing that Joe Biden I think could do to help us through this that Trump can't is he is used to not knowing what day it is."

Yes, according to the great World Health Organization, any wet markets that are allowed to reopen must conform to stringent food and hygiene standards. Great. I'm sure the World Health Organization is going to head on over there and inspect them.

So I think, if they can do it safely, of course, it is a lot less numbers in terms of who is competing at one time, so you can control that. Obviously they have to have quite a few tests so there might be some issues with why the WWE have so many tests and you know that whole testing argument, I'm not going to go into.

It gives us some other things to talk about. I mean, personally I don't think I'm going to -- I mean, I'm in New York City right by a hospital, so I'm like in the heart of Wuhan right now where I live. I don't think I'm going to be able to leave my apartment anytime soon. But I really hate seeing people writing things off, concerns about opening things, concerns about the economy. The only people that write that off is being not compassionate are the people who are so rich and they're the elite of society that never need to worry about it."

Everyone is using hand sanitizer. I was in a Lowe's Home Improvement today. The staff was great. They all had masks. Everyone is doing hand sanitization. Employees are behaving like emergency room doctors and I think everyone across the country is going to be able to handle this. We're in New York. It's like the epicenter and I think everyone is behaving well and I think we can already get back to work."
