Kellyanne Conway, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Ric Grennel, Joe Concha, Lou Dobbs, Tomi Lahren are all here with reaction. But first tonight, the Senate Republicans have failed yet again on health care, but there is a free market path forward! We'll tell them about it tonight. And also, we will expose the anatomy of fake news after the media goes into a feeding frenzy. Why? Because President Trump actually spoke with Vladimir Putin at the G-20 dinner, which is what he is supposed to do. Tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, so after failing to keep their promise to repeal, replace, \"Obama care,\" dozens of Senate Republicans met with the president at the White House earlier today. The commander-in-chief let them have it! They needed to hear it. Watch this.",

I'm going to offer them free market capitalist solutions that even a U.S. senator should be able to understand.  Now, the Republican Party -- aren't they supposed to be part of the freedom party? Don't they believe in capitalism, free markets? Isn't it time to start embracing the things on the campaign trail that they say they stand for?   For example, I have interviewed with a doctor in Wichita, Kansas. His name, Dr. Josh Umbehr. He runs Atlas MD. He runs one of the most cost- effective medical practices, cooperatives in the country.

      "sentences": "You get that? 24/7, 365 access to your own doctor. You even have your doctor's cellphone account. Add to that a catastrophic plan, now, that with a high deductible, God forbid you have heart attack, you get cancer, you have a bad accident, you're fully and completely covered for so much less than what you're paying now! This is the type of real solutions Washington is needing. Government, it's never the solution. The free market is. Capitalism is. Now, think about how miserably big government ObamaCare has failed everybody in the country. Remember? We were all supposed to save on average $2,500 per family per year. Well, the opposite has happened. Premiums have gone up everywhere. It's gone up between, what, $5,000 and $8,000 since \"Obama care\" was implemented? OK, people can't afford that. Then the promise, keep your doctor, keep your plan, one of the biggest lies ever told in American politics!  So instead of trying to fix and tweak the disaster that is known as ObamaCare, which is in a death spiral, OK, Republicans, it's time to offer up conservative, free market, capitalist solutions for the American people, more choices, more freedom, more free market competition. And that means letting customers buy insurance across state lines. (INAUDIBLE) take it job to job.   How many years have I been talking about health care savings accounts? The Cato Institute years ago, patient power, Goodman (ph) and Musgrave (ph) -- they wrote is a great book about health saving accounts, how beneficial it is to the American people. Add to that price transparency and getting rid of strict, unnecessary, burdensome government mandates that all drive up costs -- in other words, the opposite of \"Obama care.\" Now, our friend, Senator Ted Cruz -- he offered up a great out of the box amendment, which allows people to buy health insurance plans that they want instead of what the government is dictating the kind of coverage you must have. It's simple. You know what you need a lot more than these bureaucrats in Washington.  And according to a new HHS analysis of Senator Cruz's consumer freedom amendment, enrollment would actually increase more under his plan than it would under ObamaCare, being forced to do it by 2014. Premiums would be dramatically lower, meaning that, God forbid, you get sick, you get hurt, you need to go to the doctor, you actually could use your plan, which so many people cannot do. Now, ideas like these -- this is what Republicans need to start getting behind. And you know what? We're going to put them out there because in spite of yourselves, we're not going to let you fail the American people that are suffering. And frankly, Republicans, you need to answer a simple question going forward. Do you want to be the party of freedom? Do you want to be the party of liberty, free market, capitalism, or not? You say you do. It's as simple as that.  And also tonight, our other top story, (INAUDIBLE) to expose the latest fake news so-called scandal the destroy Trump media created, and then they spread. And it spread like wildfire last night. Now, the press was hysterical after a story broke about President Trump holding what the media falsely claimed was a secret meeting with Vladimir at the G-20 dinner earlier this month.  Now, of course, the media didn't do any fact-checking. They immediately went into full freakout conspiracy mode. Take a look at this.",

Look at this head photo. This wasn't a meeting and it definitely wasn't secret! The conversation happened at a G- 20 dinner in front of world leaders, the media and other guests. And what's worse is the media -- they were allowed into the room a few minutes before the meal began. You're looking at the video that they shot! The media was in there! So how can you possible say the meeting is secret or undisclosed? And there's also pictures that prove just how conspiratorial the media really is. Look at the bottom of your screen, President Trump. He's seated next to the wife of Japan's prime minister. And at the top of the screen, there's Vladimir sitting next to our first lady, Melania Trump.   Now according to the White House, at some point during the dinner, Donald Trump did something so shocking, so -- that's never happened before. He actually walked over and talked to another guest, in this case, Vladimir Putin, who is sitting next to his wife. And guess what? President Trump and other leaders -- they also got up. They also talked during the dinner. That's the entire point of the G-20 summit. Now, look at all the people that were there. Just look at this. And I know the black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists -- they're foaming at the mouth and bubbling over in hysteria! But it took all of what, five minutes, less than five minutes for us to completely disprove all of their lies, all of their accusations.  Now, the establishment the destroy Trump media is now -- they're officially psychotic! These people need to be committed. I mean, if it wasn't so serious, it's actually laughable. They are suffering beyond Trump derangement syndrome. They need help. And it doesn't matter what President Trump does, they're going to find a way to spin some wild conspiracy web that somehow shows it leads to Russia and collusion. You know, Russia to the media -- that's like, you know, dropping Alka-Seltzer in water. They bubble and fizz and they foam at the mouth. It's a little -- it doesn't matter how big the story is.  And by the way, wait until next week. They're going to be losing it. Oh, Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort have been called to appear before Congress. But guess what? If this is the way they want to go, the road they want to go down, let's get these panels to investigate real scandals and real crimes we've been telling you about, the Ukrainian election interference, the Uranium One deal, Fusion GPS, the fake Trump dossier. All right, my advice to all of you, the destroy Trump establishment media is simple. You got to stop! Your credibility is already in the toilet. You're a laughingstock. Or maybe you don't stop. You know what? Because I'll keep laughing at you and you can keep embarrassing yourself and exposing that you're a bunch of so lazy, overpaid, rigid, radical left-wing ideologues programed to do one thing, hate the president. And you know what you're not doing? And this is the shame of all of it with your 24/7 conspiracy theory TV. You're not helping the American people. You're not talking about how America can become more prosperous, how we can get people out of poverty, off of food stamps and create jobs or talking about how to keep America safe. All you care about -- Russia, Russia, Russia nonstop. It's psychotic. You're losing it.   Earlier tonight, I spoke to Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president.",

Of course the disgusting game is meant supposedly in jest, but is it really?

And finally, is Hollywood ever going to stop rooting for the president to die, to fail, to get impeached, and maybe start rooting for this country to succeed? I doubt that's ever going to happen. And up next right here tonight on \"Hannity.\"",

I'm going to offer them free market capitalist solutions that even a U.S. senator should be able to understand. Now, the Republican Party -- aren't they supposed to be part of the freedom party? Don't they believe in capitalism, free markets? Isn't it time to start embracing the things on the campaign trail that they say they stand for? For example, I have interviewed with a doctor in Wichita, Kansas. His name, Dr. Josh Umbehr. He runs Atlas MD. He runs one of the most cost- effective medical practices, cooperatives in the country.

Add to that a catastrophic plan, now, that with a high deductible, God forbid you have heart attack, you get cancer, you have a bad accident, you're fully and completely covered for so much less than what you're paying now! This is the type of real solutions Washington is needing. Government, it's never the solution. The free market is. Capitalism is. Now, think about how miserably big government ObamaCare has failed everybody in the country. Remember? We were all supposed to save on average $2,500 per family per year. Well, the opposite has happened. Premiums have gone up everywhere. It's gone up between, what, $5,000 and $8,000 since \"Obama care\" was implemented? OK, people can't afford that. Then the promise, keep your doctor, keep your plan, one of the biggest lies ever told in American politics! So instead of trying to fix and tweak the disaster that is known as ObamaCare, which is in a death spiral, OK, Republicans, it's time to offer up conservative, free market, capitalist solutions for the American people, more choices, more freedom, more free market competition. And that means letting customers buy insurance across state lines. (INAUDIBLE) take it job to job. How many years have I been talking about health care savings accounts? The Cato Institute years ago, patient power, Goodman (ph) and Musgrave (ph) -- they wrote is a great book about health saving accounts, how beneficial it is to the American people. Add to that price transparency and getting rid of strict, unnecessary, burdensome government mandates that all drive up costs -- in other words, the opposite of \"Obama care.\" Now, our friend, Senator Ted Cruz -- he offered up a great out of the box amendment, which allows people to buy health insurance plans that they want instead of what the government is dictating the kind of coverage you must have. It's simple. You know what you need a lot more than these bureaucrats in Washington. And according to a new HHS analysis of Senator Cruz's consumer freedom amendment, enrollment would actually increase more under his plan than it would under ObamaCare, being forced to do it by 2014. Premiums would be dramatically lower, meaning that, God forbid, you get sick, you get hurt, you need to go to the doctor, you actually could use your plan, which so many people cannot do. Now, ideas like these -- this is what Republicans need to start getting behind. And you know what? We're going to put them out there because in spite of yourselves, we're not going to let you fail the American people that are suffering. And frankly, Republicans, you need to answer a simple question going forward. Do you want to be the party of freedom? Do you want to be the party of liberty, free market, capitalism, or not? You say you do. It's as simple as that. And also tonight, our other top story, (INAUDIBLE) to expose the latest fake news so-called scandal the destroy Trump media created, and then they spread. And it spread like wildfire last night. Now, the press was hysterical after a story broke about President Trump holding what the media falsely claimed was a secret meeting with Vladimir at the G-20 dinner earlier this month. Now, of course, the media didn't do any fact-checking. They immediately went into full freakout conspiracy mode. Take a look at this."

And what's worse is the media -- they were allowed into the room a few minutes before the meal began. You're looking at the video that they shot! The media was in there! So how can you possible say the meeting is secret or undisclosed? And there's also pictures that prove just how conspiratorial the media really is. Look at the bottom of your screen, President Trump. He's seated next to the wife of Japan's prime minister. And at the top of the screen, there's Vladimir sitting next to our first lady, Melania Trump. Now according to the White House, at some point during the dinner, Donald Trump did something so shocking, so -- that's never happened before. He actually walked over and talked to another guest, in this case, Vladimir Putin, who is sitting next to his wife. And guess what? President Trump and other leaders -- they also got up. They also talked during the dinner. That's the entire point of the G-20 summit. Now, look at all the people that were there. Just look at this. And I know the black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists -- they're foaming at the mouth and bubbling over in hysteria! But it took all of what, five minutes, less than five minutes for us to completely disprove all of their lies, all of their accusations. Now, the establishment the destroy Trump media is now -- they're officially psychotic! These people need to be committed. I mean, if it wasn't so serious, it's actually laughable. They are suffering beyond Trump derangement syndrome. They need help. And it doesn't matter what President Trump does, they're going to find a way to spin some wild conspiracy web that somehow shows it leads to Russia and collusion. You know, Russia to the media -- that's like, you know, dropping Alka-Seltzer in water. They bubble and fizz and they foam at the mouth. It's a little -- it doesn't matter how big the story is. And by the way, wait until next week. They're going to be losing it. Oh, Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort have been called to appear before Congress. But guess what? If this is the way they want to go, the road they want to go down, let's get these panels to investigate real scandals and real crimes we've been telling you about, the Ukrainian election interference, the Uranium One deal, Fusion GPS, the fake Trump dossier. All right, my advice to all of you, the destroy Trump establishment media is simple. You got to stop! Your credibility is already in the toilet. You're a laughingstock. Or maybe you don't stop. You know what? Because I'll keep laughing at you and you can keep embarrassing yourself and exposing that you're a bunch of so lazy, overpaid, rigid, radical left-wing ideologues programed to do one thing, hate the president. And you know what you're not doing? And this is the shame of all of it with your 24/7 conspiracy theory TV. You're not helping the American people. You're not talking about how America can become more prosperous, how we can get people out of poverty, off of food stamps and create jobs or talking about how to keep America safe.

He ran successfully on repealing, replacing \"Obama care.\" The House bill got passed. And he is waiting right behind me in his office pen in hand ready to sign it.

You have 6.5 million Americans willing to fork over $3 billion to the IRS, Sean, in taxes and penalties rather than to pay into \"Obama care.\" And most importantly, over 1,300 counties now if \"Obama care\" is not repealed -- over 1,300 counties will have one provider and 40 counties have zero providers!"

That's the problem with \"Obama care.\" People don't have access to insurance because they -- they don't have access to health care because they don't have an insurance card.

Of course the disgusting game is meant supposedly in jest, but is it really?

And finally, is Hollywood ever going to stop rooting for the president to die, to fail, to get impeached, and maybe start rooting for this country to succeed? I doubt that's ever going to happen. And up next right here tonight on \"Hannity.\""

I'm Ed Henry in Washington where tributes are pouring in from both parties after the breaking news that Senator John McCain has been diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer. Democrat Hillary Clinton declaring the senator is as tough as they come, while President Trump weighed in, quote \"Senator John McCain has always been a fighter. Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. Get well soon.\" Vice President Pence added in a tweet, \"Karen and I are praying for Senator John McCain. Cancer picked on the wrong guy. John McCain is a fighter, and he will win this fight, too. God bless.\" We will break in with more news throughout the night including a live edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that begins at the top of the hour. For now we'll got back to Sean Hannity and \"Hannity.\" And we will break in with news throughout the night as it warrants."

No ideas, nothing to fix the disaster that they created known as Obamacare. Here with reaction, author of the book \"Putin's Gambit,\" Fox Business host Lou Dobbs. I am watching them all celebrating, I'm watching them all really happy, Lou. And I'm thinking, hang on a second. Millions lost their doctors, millions lost their plans. There is what percentage of counties in the country that only have one option, that's it, one? They are mandated to buy it. The average increase in premiums since Obamacare has been in place is what, $6,000, $8,000 a year. This isn't funny to me or to the American people. And they don't offer any ideas."

      "utterance": "Nor should it be to anyone. And if there's anything I fault the Republicans for rather than their inaction in the Senate, it is that they are not telling the American people the truth of what is going on. We have seen the number of people covered by Obamacare drop by 20 percent. We have seen the cost of expanding Medicaid. It is actually 40 percent higher than the federal outlays in the exchanges for Obamacare. While premiums are spiraling, deductibles are bone crushing to families all over the country, we're watching the Democrats and Chuck Schumer acting like they are some kind of cute because they're not participating in this constitutional republic."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "They created the mess. They made the biggest mess. The president is right. What they really want is to go deeper into the mess. They think Canada's single payer system is so great. If it's so great, then why do all the tens of thousands flock to the United States when they need emergency heart surgery or cancer treatment? If their system was so great why don't they just stay in their own country?"

      "speaker": "DOBBS",
      "utterance": "And the venal, national leftwing media, Sean, as you well know, their stories are all about the Obama legacy of Obamacare is far more difficult than President Trump thought it would be or Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan thought it would be. That part is probably true, except what they are really talking about is punishment of millions of Americans who cannot afford Obamacare. They are simply losing access to Obamacare. Fewer Americans by the millions are able to afford and find some way to get Obamacare."

How many times have we talked about free markets, the party of freedom, capitalism, competition, driving down prices, increasing services? Where is this Republican Party? They are nonexistent."

    {
      "speaker": "DOBBS",

And he said, and not in my judgment entirely jokingly, that we should just let the Obamacare mess spiral to a complete and final resting place and then try and just wait for the Democrats to come to the table and get serious. It may take that, by the way, for the Democrats to join Republicans to care about Americans."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Do you care if it's repeal and transition as long as they don't blow the budget out on it? Or do you care if they do repeal and replace with, for example, the Cruz provision? Which I like a lot. It drives premiums down dramatically, just like the Freedom Caucus did. I will take either one at this point. I don't even know if they can get that done and over the finish line."

    {
      "speaker": "DOBBS",
      "utterance": "So long as we all understand repeal means eliminating higher taxes that were put in place by President Obama and the Dems creating Obamacare. Those taxes have got to be eliminated. We have got to see a real, intelligent, free market solution to health care in this country because that's the future. We're not going to be --"

And this time Rosie wants us to push the United States president off a cliff and laugh about it. Lovely. Just when we thought the Hollywood liberals may have learned from Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp, Madonna, and the rest of the psychos, no, they are still in their Hollywood elitist bubble and displaying their true colors with yet another celebration of a Trump assassination. And Rosie has the audacity to say Trump is mentally unstable? Really, Rosie? But can you imagine if a conservative promoted a game like this about Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton? Imagine the liberal outcry. Imagine the labels, racist, sexist, bigot, deplorable, pick one or all of them. Sean, I for one am sick and tired of being called all of those things for being a supporter of the president, but meanwhile Hollywood hate gets a pass. But here's the deal. These people aren't funny. They're pathetic and they're disturbed. And our prayers really do go out to them. And that's the final word, Sean."
