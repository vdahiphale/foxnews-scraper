      "utterance": "You know, Chairman, you probably heard already, but the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the math might not add up for you, or it's going to be prohibitive to get this through and to meet already the numbers that at least the Senate blueprint is working on, $1.5 billion in likely lost tax revenues over the next decade. This is something that carries north of a $5 trillion tab. How do you reconcile those numbers? And how do you get the other allowances, deductions to sort of meet the $1.5 trillion cost that your colleagues in the Senate have put together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so they have got their math wrong, because this is just the framework. A lot of the details filled in, where the brackets are, what the child credit will be..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Who has got the math wrong, sir? Who has got the math wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "The Center for Progress in their estimate."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Got it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Because they're looking at yet an incomplete tax reform proposal. The president has made it clear it's Congress and our Constitution that decides that we will introduce and draft the complete bill. That's what will do it. And I'm confident, at the end of the day, between economic growth and better jobs and better paychecks, and eliminating exemptions and deductions and loopholes, so we can lower the rates for everyone, that, at the end of the day, we can move this toward a balanced budget."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, that would have to be a lot of exemptions and loopholes, though, right? I mean, if you're just conservatively looking at their numbers -- and I understand what you're saying, that these numbers are all over the map. But let's say it's $3.5 trillion that has to be adjusted or reframed here to pay for the $5 trillion-plus tax package, where would that come from? Just the state and local tax deduction, removing that, I think is about $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Where would the rest come from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "I actually question the original premise of $5 trillion in additional costs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Really?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "So, look, I will look at their proposal in greater depth. But my guess is, they're making a lot of estimates that may not be true at the end of the day. So, it will be a combination of the growth and clearing out all the underbrush in the current tax code."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Chairman, the president talked about that 20 percent corporate rate, which is a lot lower than the 35 percent rate now. But I think, as you and I have discussed over the many months and years, actually, this has been kicked around, that very few companies pay at that rate. It's closer to the high 20s, I think. So, if the president has said that he wanted to come in at 15, settled for 20, but he doesn't want to budge on 20, is it likely he will get 20, or is it your sense, as it is Speaker Paul Ryan's sense, that it might be somewhere in the low 20s? Is that the closest the math makes sense?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "No. Yes, so we're driving straight to 20. That's why that number is there. And it's significant. One, it is for both the smallest business in America and the largest corporation, almost a 40 percent cut in the rate, so they can compete and win. Our American companies, like retailers that are just on the ground in our communities, they're paying the full freight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Our international ones, a different rate. But here's the deal. If we go with the 20 percent rate, they can deploy their capital back to the United States. To have a competitive tax code system, boy, it's a game-changer for our businesses and their workers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Finally, sir -- and I know you have got to go, and I appreciate your patience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The other issue was the president saying, find a way to take all the trillions of dollars -- it's hard to put the number -- to quantify that number. Some say $2.5 trillion, some as much as $5 trillion that is held abroad. Would you attach any litmus test or proviso to bringing that money back home, that companies can't just buy shares back or whatever; they have to commit either to jobs or expanding plants and operations, that sort of thing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm not. And here's why. No one has yet convinced me a dollar stranded overseas is better than a dollar brought back home here to America for any reasons. So, if a company needs it, whether it's to do research, buy another business in America, grow jobs or try to become more financially strong, that is good for the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, you think we could get a deal by the end of the year, or is that kind of wishful thinking?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "So, that's what we're focused on, this timetable. So, the next key question is getting a budget signed, sealed and delivered. And that's our next challenge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That's the first thing, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You have to have a budget. That's your blueprint to move from there, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK, and retroactive, the idea that they would -- these tax cuts would be retroactive to the beginning of the year, too late for that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so, too late, to be determined. Going to be part of the discussions."
    },
