And it has nothing to do with anything other than safety for the Americans, safety for our people, safety for our country. And a wall is a very good thing, not a bad thing. It's a moral thing, to put it in the opposite terms. And we have tremendous support. We're building it right now. We don't even say build the wall anymore. We say finish the wall because we've built a lot and we are renovating a tremendous amount of old stuff that was really in bad shape but it had good structure. So we are saying finish the wall. Now, walls are very important. If you don't have it, all the technology, Laura, all the drones that they have flying around so nicely up in the air, they don't mean a thing."

If I would've stayed with those numbers, Laura, we would've had an economy that would have been going way in reverse, right now. We opened it up. We got rid of regulations that were unnecessary. We did the biggest tax cuts we've ever done in our country. We opened up the oil. You know we're the largest oil exporter now. We are the largest oil and gas in the world right now. Nobody thought that was possible this quickly. We opened up our country. We are letting people work again.

They found absolutely no collusion between Trump and the Russia, which I could've told a lot of people, and which I have been saying to a lot of people. This has never happened. The Democrats know it's a hoax. This is a political game. So now the Russia thing is dead, and they say well, we're going to look at every company that Donald Trump was ever -- they don't have any information or anything. We're going to look at every company that Donald Trump was ever involved in. I did great. I made a lot of money. Now they want to go back and investigate every company. We want to go -- and we have and I think 79 different letters from different committees --"

All right, guys, we've got lot of ground to cover, not much time to do it.

But tonight, this was a bold move. For him to come to Beto O'Rourke's, Robert Francis O'Rourke's hometown, out draw him tonight, Laura. I think Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign came to an end. He may run, but it's over. When you can't carry your own town, when he comes out and turns out a crowd like this, it is over for Beto O'Rourke, and all the Democrats are going to seize on this tomorrow morning and say look what Beto did.

I don't know if he's going to be the Democratic nominee, but if he is, be careful. But the question I have to ask is, does the president does he think he was elected in 2008? He did not inherit a mess. Obama inherited a mess. He inherited a roaring economy that was already producing more energy than any country in the world when he took office. Things were going well, they continue to go well. Thank God for that. I give him some credit for that. But he didn't inherit a mess. He inherited a great thing. He got elected in 2016."

The American people voted in Donald Trump in large part to reverse most of what Barack Obama did, and to, in Donald Trump's words, make America great again. That's exactly what he has done in two short years. He has delivered a thriving economy. He has turned the country around in manufacturing and other economic areas. And he's also delivering a stronger U.S. military and U.S. international position. That's why what you saw tonight was the kickoff to 2020. And Laura, nobody does it better than Donald Trump."
