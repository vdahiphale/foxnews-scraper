Well, some big developments in the terror and national security front today, President Trump ordering the justice department to go after information leaked by U.S. officials on the Manchester suicide bombing. The leaks causing U.K. officials to shut down intelligence sharing with the U.S. over the attack, fearing they jeopardize the race to hunt down a network of bombing co- conspirators with at least men now in custody and more raids underway. Very quickly we'll talk to you, Kat. We've learned today the family of the Manchester bomber may have had substantial terror ties. Father, Ramadan, was allegedly affiliated with a group that was also affiliated with al Qaeda at one point. Ismail and Hashim, the brothers, planned to bomb a venue in Libya. And Salman himself had paramilitary training in Syria.  I'm going to tell you, if this has been going on for this many years why wasn't he in custody, right?",

Well, some big developments in the terror and national security front today, President Trump ordering the justice department to go after information leaked by U.S. officials on the Manchester suicide bombing. The leaks causing U.K. officials to shut down intelligence sharing with the U.S. over the attack, fearing they jeopardize the race to hunt down a network of bombing co- conspirators with at least men now in custody and more raids underway. Very quickly we'll talk to you, Kat. We've learned today the family of the Manchester bomber may have had substantial terror ties. Father, Ramadan, was allegedly affiliated with a group that was also affiliated with al Qaeda at one point. Ismail and Hashim, the brothers, planned to bomb a venue in Libya. And Salman himself had paramilitary training in Syria. I'm going to tell you, if this has been going on for this many years why wasn't he in custody, right?"

And thankfully with NATO, they're going to try to improve their intelligence a little bit, so that's some good news coming out of Trump's discussion with NATO today.

      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, THE FOX NEWS SPECIALIST HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. I mean, we should think twice about it. But regarding the leaks, of course it's a big problem. This is something the DNI director Dan Coats testified this week. It puts lives in jeopardy, puts lives at risk. And when you have an opportunity right now where President Trump is overseas trying to regain the trust of allies like Saudi Arabia and these Gulf States, as well as Israel, it hurts him to have these sorts of leaks. Because it hurts those relationships with other foreign leaders, as we're seeing with Britain, saying that they're no longer going to share some of this intelligence regarding the Manchester bombing."

Is it the same people or different people? If it's the same people, may be the narrative of that it was just to bring about -- excuse me, to bring down Trump, maybe that doesn't really work anymore. And also, these leaks, the information was correct, so do we need to take the other ones more seriously or not? We don't know until we know it's the same people or not."

What's interesting is that they were talking about whether or not he should be part of the leadership back in 2010, so a year before the raid. Osama Bin Laden actually encouraged him not to be part of -- to be successful don't be part of a jihad. The last thing Osama wanted was for Hamza to die in a drone strike, and actually hit him in Iran of all places. Strange bed fellows but they were in Iran. He decided himself he wanted to be part of it. He's got the brand, he's got the ideology."

They've got a lot of people. They're always growing new people just like Hamza like I mention since 2010, they're trying to get him -- he wanted to be a leader. They brought him with senior leaders to Iran. They trained him up on it. He's got everything that they need. We are underestimating them. Same ideology as ISIS, they're the -- they're based on a version out of Saudi Arabia. But what ISIS does is they want -- the attack was someone blowing someone there. They stay in your home country and blow things up. Al Qaeda knows not to attack Turkey because that's the way in and they want to be hit. And, you know, we can't forget about them."

And what I'm waiting to see is where are the Democrats, where are they leading -- and where's there charge for getting these leakers? Do they seem really concerned about it when it was Podesta's email? But now we have national security, people's lives at stake, not just, you know, political gossip that might bring down -- somebody who's going to go down anyway. So I think this -- we need to see leadership on -- not just from the White House, they need to get this. But we also need to see congress putting pressure to get these people. This is a treasonous act."

      "utterance": "You know, I don't know, but obviously it's a problem. As I mention at the top of the show and as Rachel just eloquently mentioned, it's hurting our relationships with other countries. And I think at a time where we just saw what happened in Manchester, now is the time to have these trusting relationships with other countries for intelligence sharing purposes. So, this isn't just hurting the Trump administration which I think is the goal of the individuals who are sharing this information with reporters who are more than happy to carry that and report it, but it's also hurting our country at a really critical juncture where we are facing these threats with al Qaeda, we're facing these threats with ISIS and other terror-minded groups."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Your thoughts, Kat, on -- what do you do when you're President Trump and he's worried about leaks coming out of the White House. He's worried about leaks coming from the intel department. Look, there are a lot of people who don't like Donald Trump, but when you start leaking information that's affecting terror and our national security, it's a whole new ball game."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, a whole new ballgame. They can't share this information with us. President Trump has every right to be upset about it. But everybody should be upset about it. Absolutely, everybody should. I don't know who these people are. I don't know if they hate Trump so much that they hate him more than they love the country. Or if maybe they've just -- they've never had anyone pay attention to them in their lives and they want to see themselves in the newspaper and be like, I did that, and they just don't care if it hurts the country. But we need to look into these leaks, and I'm really curious to see if these are the same people or the same group as the earlier leaks mostly centered around Russia, and what would that say about those leaks if it was the same group of people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "So this all dovetails into the next part of this segment which is that Trump is trying to keep the country safe. He's trying to do what he thinks is in the best interest of keeping national security in check and keeping terrorism away from our shores, out of our country. The fourth circuit Court of Appeals today, making President Trump's ability to keep America safe that much harder today, in a 10-3 ruling the court upheld a nationwide block on his travel ban, temporary moratorium, actually, which targeted six terror plague countries. The case may now be headed for the Supreme Court. Let's talk about that for a second. Trump wants to keep -- let me -- I'm sorry, we'll bring it around. Let's start with Rob, your thoughts on this temporary moratorium on these six -- people from these six countries coming to America."

    {
      "speaker": "O'NEILL",
      "utterance": "The people coming to America, the problem right now with the leaks and everything like that is that we're seeing partisan politics at its worst, and President Trump proved with a lot of solidarity going to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, first, that it's not a Muslim ban. Muslim ban is brought up by people who want President Trump to fail. We need help from them to bring people in. The countries that we're not letting people come from, yes, they're primary Muslim but there's no embassies there. There is no way to vet people that come in. And the enemy has said to us, and they're not dumb people, they said to us before they will use our immigration system, they will use our welfare system until they have enough soldiers in the streets of America to bring blood to the streets. They said it. They're not lying to us."

But, look, all of this has been way overblown. We're literary talking about a very temporary pause from countries that were identified by the Obama administration and congress for travel restrictions. The idea that this is somehow a Muslim ban is asinine, considering the fact the three biggest Muslim populations are not even included in this temporary pause. So, I mean, the entire thing has gotten so over sensationalized, well, by the president critics."

Personally, there's not a single attack, a fatal attacks since 9/11 in this country that this ban would have prevented. Not a single instance. And if you look there's so many other threats. What are we going to do? Belgium? They have all these terrorist all there. We're going to ban people from Belgium? If you start there, where does it end up? We need to look at homegrown terrorism. We already have great communication -- go ahead."

I turned on another network before I got on, just to get the temperature of what was being said out there. Sorry about that, fans out these. But they seemed gleeful about what -- this stop on the ban. And I just thought, God, they're so out of touch.

We're already doing everyone else our fair share and everyone else's. We're just demanding that if you're going to be part of NATO, you be able to defend yourself because in the event that we have to go to war for you because you picked a fight with someone else, you better be able to at least start to defend yourself and everyone else has to pitch in too."

I mean, this is -- I aim to move towards -- what could be more European? That means nothing. That means they have no intention of paying this, and it's embarrassing to them.

And he also said that they should be paying more of their fair share which is what we've been talking about.

Besides being a bit overzealous, anti-Trump rhetoric, you guys are leaders in the eyes of many liberal journalists. They take their cues from you, and blow it up a hundred times worse. Being against Trump in the New York Times newsroom is a badge of honor. So anything they can blame on Trump, they will and they do. And over at the Washington Post, the story doesn't even need to be vetted before they post anti-Trump news, real or fake. The hypocrisy in the mainstream media is extraordinary. Do they blame Obama when Bowe Bergdahl defected by walking away from his base in Afghanistan? Or for the six soldiers who may have died while looking for Bergdahl? Did they blame Bill Clinton for the -- let's just say -- indiscreet activity that took place during his years in office? No, they didn't. So stop treating Trump differently. He's the commander in chief. Respect the man or, at the very least, muster up the character to respect the office. Now is a good time to start.

They also have powerful pop culture. We saw even last week Jimmy Kimmel had to apologize for humanizing Trump, which is a really weird thing. So I think that the American people are smart. They get it, and they don't see this as just an attack on Donald Trump. They see it as an attack on them. They voted. They don't believe in do-overs of the election. They see that the left, the media, the \"never Trumpers\" and the deep state are trying to undo their election. And they're mad about it. I can tell you, I live in middle America.

Obviously, there's people in circumstances that can't get out of and are tough, but attitude does have a lot to do with it. I don't think that if you say you can, then you can, because sometimes you say you can and you don't. But if you say you can't, you can't. That's true, because you're not even going to try.

This is a different message. This was about empowerment. This was about telling people, \"We're not going to make you comfortable in your poverty. We're going to, as government, provide ladders of opportunity for you to rise out of poverty. I'm passionate about this, because this is my family's story. And I'm sitting here today because there's an American dream.\" And what they want to tell you is the dream is not alive; the dream is dead, because if the dream is dead and you can't lift yourself up, guess what?
