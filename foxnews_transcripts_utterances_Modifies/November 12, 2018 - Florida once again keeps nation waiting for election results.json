Thursday the results of the machine recount are set to be finished, but not all of them are going to be finished. Friday, overseas and military ballots, traditionally trending Republican, will be counted. They have to be postmarked or signed no later than Election Day. Sunday all counties have a 12:00 p.m. deadline to complete the manual recounts, if needed, and to report the official returns. And then Tuesday, November 20th, official results from the county is certified by the state. Everybody have that, got it?  Here we go. Let's bring in our panel: Chris Stirewalt, politics editor here at Fox News; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist.
