And Raymond Arroyo is here for seen and unseen. The media's race obsession over the royal baby. Wow. And Frank Luntz is also going to stop by on why the Democrats are struggling to get on message.  But first, Democrats hold America in contempt. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now, as they prepare to vote for a resolution of contempt against Attorney General Bill Barr, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee revealed themselves once again. It's a depressing and yet very illuminating spectacle for our country to see elected officials acting like meth dealers, because after relentlessly pushing Russian collusion for two years, they were finally busted. No collusion and no obstruction. But Democrats refuse to accept reality and instead they continue to sell their poison to scandal addicts on the left",

I think the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jordan among them have correctly pointed out that what's really going on here is a failing an effort to successfully attack the President.

So, the Attorney General had no choice but to follow the law and they're holding him in contempt for it. I think the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jordan among them have correctly pointed out that what's really going on here is a failing an effort to successfully attack the President. They have now gone on to try to attack Bill Barr's integrity. Remember that he's only been in office less than three months as the Attorney General under the President.

And they didn't expect you would run to court right away and try to litigate it, go to the Supreme Court, ask for their permission for they said ambition should counteract ambition.

The Supreme Court said quite clearly. Communications between the president and his top advisers are protected and, in that case, they were even - might have been protected against the need by the courts to resolve the Watergate tapes case. I think they would definitely be privileged against a request by Congress and even though McGahn is not working for him anymore, he can still invoke the privilege just like if you and I had an attorney and then we don't have that attorney, we fire the attorney, our attorney client privilege still exists."

      "utterance": "Former FBI Director Jim Comey has kind of long held himself out as a paragon of truth and honesty among the redwoods. He recent New York Times piece decried President Trump and Attorney General Barr as amoral leaders. So was Comey a moral leader at the FBI, an agency whose leadership targeted American individuals on phony predicates using confidential informants? Is he honest now when he says this with a straight face during his latest media blitz?"

Joining me now, Kevin Brock, he was the first FBI assistant director of intelligence, and former special agent for 24 years, and Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary and FOX News contributor. Kevin, first to you. When Jim Comey says the FBI doesn't spy, is that the truth?"

      "speaker": "KEVIN BROCK, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE",
      "utterance": "Here's a tip for America. Let's not get caught up in the euphemism of spy versus investigate. That's not the point. The point is did the FBI or was the FBI manipulated by James Comey and others that he surrounded himself to run an investigation out of his office on behalf of one political party against another? That's what we've got to understand, and that's the truth we have got to reach."

It's time to move one to the most important thing we do, which is vote to decide who should represent us as president of the United States? The great middle of America represents our values, and they stir every so often, and I hope they are stirring now. I see signs of it, and are going to vote their values."

      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Laura, it is entirely inappropriate for a former director of the FBI to enter partisan politics like this. None else have done it. No secretaries of defense do it like this. There's a reason we hold those agencies in a lofty status. And think about what those partisan statements mean to the men and women working, the brick agents of the FBI. It's demoralizing when they see their former leader call for the American people to elect one party to office. It damages their ability to be seen as nonpartisan. James Comey's ego is uncontrollable, and that's what's led him to take these actions and make these speeches. He needs to stop doing this. He is hurting the FBI."

      "speaker": "BROCK",

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Kevin, you said something during the break I want everyone to hear about the FBI's use of these confidential informants. They do use confidential informants, but particularly the way they were used, it looks like, at the origins of this Mueller investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROCK",
      "utterance": "That's right. The FBI has strict guidelines as to when they can use confidential human sources, particularly against a U.S. person. There has to be substantial predication, as the attorney general likes to say, to do something like that. We have indications that the FBI was running sources against people like George Papadopoulos and others where the case either wasn't even opened yet or was in its infancy where they couldn't have had the required predicate to do that type of activity. I think one of the things that's making Jim Comey nervous is to whether or not they colored outside the lines."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "No. And I get such a kick, Carl Bernstein on CNN has been yipping about a Constitutional crisis for nine months. A Constitutional crisis is when we will all know it. And when you have to advocate on behalf of it, there isn't one. But this is all part of the Democrats' strategy to get their base out. That's what it is, Laura. And it doesn't matter who they tar, they are tarring a good man, an attorney general who actually makes decisions, not like Loretta Lynch who recused herself and allowed James Comey they to make the decisions about Hillary Clinton. This is an attorney general who followed the rule of law, made the hard calls.  It's what attorney generals do. And the Democrats blame him for doing his job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And by the way, Kevin, tonight apparently Woodward was on another network saying this is a dire governing crisis. They are running out of descriptions for the crisis. It's a dire governing crisis. Things are so bad in Washington, I'd say because they're not actually doing work for the American people. They are doing these charades day in and day out after this report is already written."

      "speaker": "BROCK",
      "utterance": "The crisis of loss of trust in the FBI by the American people. And that was bought on by James Comey under McCabe and this little investigative cabal that they had at headquarters. We have to get to the bottom of what they did and carefully look at how they started."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "As Jim Jordan said, my friend, this can happen to any of us if it can happen to the president of the United States. That was a chilling line from him today. Both of you, thank you for political analysis, and former veteran of our great FBI. While 2020 Democrats hopefuls spin their wheels, searching for a message to defeat Trump, the president showed tonight why he is still in the driver's seat. Media guru Frank Luntz is here next to break down the moments that mattered the most from tonight's rally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "2020 Democrats are really struggling with their messaging, and it's fairly embarrassing, frankly. Take a look at these headlines.  \"Politico\" is saying Dems don't have a robust economic message. The New York Times revealing Kamala Harris is trying to reset her campaign already to take on the Trump. But as he showed tonight, the president has no problem hitting the messages that created a movement and got him elected. Let's bring in Republican pollster, Frank Luntz. Frank, I want to take you through a few moments from tonight that I think speak to this. Let's begin with what the president said about jobs under the previous administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Under the previous administration the United States lost a quarter of a million manufacturing jobs. You remember that. They let other countries raid our factories, steal our jobs, and rob us blind. Other than that, they were very nice."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "He is going back to his single greatest strength as president, the single greatest success of this administration. When you have unemployment at 50 year lows, employment at 50 year highs, and particularly among African-American Latino workers, you have a success story. And the more that he focuses on it, and the more that he draws the contrast between himself and Barack Obama, the more credit we is going to get for the economy. And Laura, this is one place where his approval numbers are up in the mid- 50s, very strong. This what he is going to need to be successful in the next 18 months."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We see these polls, we saw them earlier, 56 percent on the economy, 46 percent Gallup, which his above where Barack Obama was at this point in his presidency. Here Frank in the rally tonight, we see Trump covering a point he did cover over and over again in 2016. But let's listen tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Democrats say they care about the poor, but their open border policies drive down wages, drain social services, and hurt the poorest Americans more than anybody else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Frank, I just came back from the border. We do have an open border. Unfortunately, it's under the Trump administration. So how do Democrats respond to this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "The first thing is I would say to the president, instead of making the statement, ask the question. Who does the open border hurt the most?  When you put in a rhetorical question, it causes people to answer it themselves rather than hearing somebody else answer it for them. You get an extra five or 10 points. I would make that stylistic change. But the public does not believe in open borders. They believe in national security. They believe in safety. They believe that that's the first responsibility of the president to keep the people safe. So again, I think that that is a successful message if he just makes that small change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Frank, we talked about using the word home. Your home, the homeland. Home is a very powerful image, is it now, especially for women, some of them turned off a bit by some of the president's tonalities and tweets and so forth. But keeping the home prosperous and secure and safe, I think that's a winner for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "In that case I would do your home. I would actually have him be specific. Your home, your neighborhood, your community prosperous and safe. When you personalize it and individualize it, it has a more powerful impact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Fascinating, Frank. We're going to bring you back a lot as we get close and closer to this 2020 race, and thank you so much. We'll be right back with the Last Bite."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Aren't you lucky tonight, because we have two Last Bites. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked today about Steve Mnuchin's refusal to release President Trump's tax returns. Her response, put the Treasury Secretary behind bars?"
