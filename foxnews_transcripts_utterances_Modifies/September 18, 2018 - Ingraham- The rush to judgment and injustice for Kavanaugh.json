And given what we know of the accuser's political inclination and her support of left-wing causes, it's not unreasonable to believe that she has a political axe to grind. The hyperbolic overheated reaction to these charges is somewhat reminiscent of what happened to the Duke Lacrosse team more than a decade ago.  Remember in 2006, the Duke Lacrosse team haired a pair of exotic dancers for a party at a rental house near the Duke campus. One of the dancers, a black woman claimed that three of the Lacrosse players brutally raped her in a bathroom. Dave Evans, the captain of the team and one of the accused, he spoke to the media the moment he learned of the charges against him.",

A media swarm and rush to judgment follows. The Duke Lacrosse coach, Mike Pressler, who stood by his team in the face of these false accusations was fired for it and the young men's reputations were dragged through the mud.  Only later did we discover that the three accused men were not near the dancer long enough for the alleged assault to have happened. One of the three men accused was a mile away at an ATM machine and thankfully it was captured on security video at the time of the alleged incident. All three men were eventually cleared of the charges. North Carolina's then attorney general Roy Cooper in declaring their innocence said, the men had been victims of a tragic rush to accuse and the failure to verify serious allegations. The crusading Durham District Attorney, Mike Nifong who cooked evidence and raced to prosecute was disbarred and convicted of contempt for his actions.   Now this should be in a different fact, there's a cautionary tale as we weigh and determine the credibility of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. At least the Duke Lacrosse case was kind of contemporary when it comes to the timing, with witnesses and a crime scene. Thirty-six years later, Ms. Ford can't recall exactly when or where her alleged incident even took place. Yet throughout the media, the drum beat goes on and on and there is an implicit message that senators dare not submit the accuser to any tough questioning as they did with Anita Hill.",

Do they recognize that a rush to judgment is not only unfair but destructive to the process and to individual lives?  Every accuser has a right to speak out but should be obliged to have his or her allegations challenged and sometimes aggressively so. The accused meanwhile should not be presumed guilty and he or she should have every opportunity to clear his or her good name.  Now, Chairman Grassley has dedicated Monday to a public hearing where both Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Ms. Ford, have been invited to appear. Kavanaugh is ready, but according to reports out late tonight and a letter from her attorney, Ms. Ford wants the FBI to investigate her allegations before she agrees to appear. That was a late-breaking letter that her attorney submitted to the Senate tonight. Well, the question is, who will blink first?

Mercedes Schlapp from the White House will be here. And former intel chiefs are bristling at the President Trump's decision to declassify important documents related to the Russia investigation. What are they scared of? What are they hiding? And Hollywood, as Hannity said, showing once again why Americans are watching less TV today. Raymond Arroyo is here with a report on Emmy Award train wreck. But first, the rush to judgment, that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Listen closely to the media coverage of the 36-year-old accusation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the chorus is hard to miss."

Has any evidence been produced? Is there any corroborating witness? So far the answer is no. In fact, the only other person named in the accusation says it never happened. And given what we know of the accuser's political inclination and her support of left-wing causes, it's not unreasonable to believe that she has a political axe to grind. The hyperbolic overheated reaction to these charges is somewhat reminiscent of what happened to the Duke Lacrosse team more than a decade ago. Remember in 2006, the Duke Lacrosse team haired a pair of exotic dancers for a party at a rental house near the Duke campus. One of the dancers, a black woman claimed that three of the Lacrosse players brutally raped her in a bathroom. Dave Evans, the captain of the team and one of the accused, he spoke to the media the moment he learned of the charges against him."

A media swarm and rush to judgment follows. The Duke Lacrosse coach, Mike Pressler, who stood by his team in the face of these false accusations was fired for it and the young men's reputations were dragged through the mud. Only later did we discover that the three accused men were not near the dancer long enough for the alleged assault to have happened. One of the three men accused was a mile away at an ATM machine and thankfully it was captured on security video at the time of the alleged incident. All three men were eventually cleared of the charges. North Carolina's then attorney general Roy Cooper in declaring their innocence said, the men had been victims of a tragic rush to accuse and the failure to verify serious allegations. The crusading Durham District Attorney, Mike Nifong who cooked evidence and raced to prosecute was disbarred and convicted of contempt for his actions. Now this should be in a different fact, there's a cautionary tale as we weigh and determine the credibility of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. At least the Duke Lacrosse case was kind of contemporary when it comes to the timing, with witnesses and a crime scene. Thirty-six years later, Ms. Ford can't recall exactly when or where her alleged incident even took place. Yet throughout the media, the drum beat goes on and on and there is an implicit message that senators dare not submit the accuser to any tough questioning as they did with Anita Hill."

But the more serious question is, have the Democrats learned any lessons about the toxicity of false charges coupled with a media pile on as demonstrated by both the Duke Lacrosse and the Clarence Thomas cases. Do they recognize that a rush to judgment is not only unfair but destructive to the process and to individual lives? Every accuser has a right to speak out but should be obliged to have his or her allegations challenged and sometimes aggressively so. The accused meanwhile should not be presumed guilty and he or she should have every opportunity to clear his or her good name. Now, Chairman Grassley has dedicated Monday to a public hearing where both Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Ms. Ford, have been invited to appear. Kavanaugh is ready, but according to reports out late tonight and a letter from her attorney, Ms. Ford wants the FBI to investigate her allegations before she agrees to appear. That was a late-breaking letter that her attorney submitted to the Senate tonight. Well, the question is, who will blink first?

Nicole, I want to start with you because tonight the attorney for Ms. Ford has told the committee her client is not ready to proceed to testify on Monday.

I don't think that the vote should be had until I've had a chance to have my story. And it sounds like what they're doing is giving her an opportunity to tell the story and now she says I want to wait. This is an interesting wrinkle. I do think that it's better for everyone if she has a chance to air what it is she has to say. The reputation damage has already been done. He might as well have an opportunity to rebut it.

That's not how investigations work.

And what are we seeing, Laura? We're seeing the fact that none of this with regards to this accusation being made was brought up to the attention of judge Kavanaugh.

Well joining us now with answers is Thomas Mauriello, a former polygraph expert at the DOD and a current professor of criminology in the University of Maryland and we're also joined by Peggy Nance, the president of Concerned Women for America who is herself a rape victim and she has serious questions about Ms. Ford's claims. Thank you to both of your for being here today. Thomas, I want to begin with you on the reliability of polygraphs because I think a lot of people out there hear, oh, she passed the lie detector test in August. What does that really mean and how important would that be even if this were a prosecutable crime?"

      "speaker": "THOMAS MAURIELLO, FORMER DOD SENIOR POLYGRAPH EXAMINIER",
      "utterance": "It means absolutely nothing. First of all, we have to understand that the polygraph is not a lie detector. It has never been and hopefully it never will be. I never used the world pass or fail. I either say successful or not successful. But when somebody says they passed a test that simply means that they didn't react to certain questions that were asked. You have to ask what were the questions? How were they asked? How were they formulated? What did the examiner say to you before the test began? All of those things affect how a person is going to react. And most importantly, what is the reaction? It's not a lie. The reaction is simply -- your sympathetic nervous system, hearing a question and deciding whether it's threatening or not. And it could be threatening for a lot of different reasons other than you're going to tell the truth or not."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

And you know, I think probably something did happen to this woman. But we should all want justice. And there's no justice in destroying a man's reputation, destroying his career based on allegations that, you know, are unprovable. So all of this -- the Democrats hope that this is more about gender identity politics. But Concerned Women for America are still standing firmly behind Judge Kavanaugh. We will be there Monday in support of him as we've been throughout this process. It has been a circus. I have watched as they have disrupted. Activists have yelled and screamed and disrupted the decorum of the Senate. I've seen women parading around as handmaids, and believe me, as I tell you, grown men dressed as human condoms. This has been a circus, and it's an outrage, and this has really damaged the credibility and the dignity of the Senate."

And anyone who doesn't think an FBI investigation should go forth is clearly anti-victim. You don't want women to be heard. It makes no sense. Of course, we want her to be heard. She can be heard Monday. I think she could have been heard today or maybe tomorrow or Friday. But she could be heard Monday. She doesn't want to be heard. Kamala Harris came out today and said this.

So it's either, well, she pass add lie detector test. This is -- she's representing all women who have been victims of sexual assault. She's kind of a representative of women. Again, God bless her, whatever happened to her. Now it's FBI do your job, and anyone who stands in the way, you're part of the problem. You're anti- woman, you're anti-sexual abuse victim."

Sadly, it seems much has not changed. While Democrats howl for answers from Brett Kavanaugh in an opaque charge, they're not asking the same of DNC co-chair Keith Ellison. Last month his former girlfriend, Karen Monahan, alleged that Ellison sent her threatening text messages and once screamed obscenities at her as he dragged her off a bed by her feet. No calls for his resignation. And the investigation the DNC said it was launching has pretty much gone silent. Joining us now with reaction, Monica Crowley from the Center for Policy Research, and Anthony Tall, an attorney and Democratic strategist. Let's go to you first, Monica. It's wild to go back and think about what was said back in '98 and so forth. But tonight, Hillary Clinton was asked about due process regarding sexual assault allegations by Rachel Maddow.

And she not only stood by her man but she also led the charge to discredit, smear, and threaten those women to come forward 20 odd years ago to accuse her husband. Look, Laura, this is the rot of hypocrisy. Democratic Party of today is now back to being the party of Bill Clinton, full of hypocrites on this matter. You saw the case of Keith Ellison. In that case, we have got police reports, we've got an alleged video, and yet little to no media coverage.

My therapist released records stating that I've been dealing and healing from the abuse.\" That's 2017. It's not 36 years ago.

With regard to Kavanaugh in this case, the accuser does have a corroborating witness which was 2012. So I think that's one of the problems --"

Medical records that were released, doctors' notes, and she said she's been smeared, including apparently by Democrats. You said, well, the problem is Democrats don't believe her. No kidding. That goes to the point that some allegations have merit. The allegations against Democrats have no merit and the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh from 36 years ago should end a Supreme Court nomination. Ellison is in Congress."

But I hope at one point in time that he realizes or he feels that all of the people, whether they're poor, white, blacks, or Hispanics that come before him, now perhaps he sees how they feel to be accused of something and have a whole system come at you and whether it's fair or unfair.

      "utterance": "To be clear about Keith Ellison's, he's the Democrats' number two man, number two at the DNC, and he's running to be attorney general of a major state, Minnesota, and he probably has higher political aspirations than that. So the idea that the Democrats are protecting him while running wild on Brett Kavanaugh is a disgrace. Laura, this is all about the broader war on Donald Trump and his agenda. Brett Kavanaugh is just the latest proxy in this war, to take down this president, undermine his agenda, make it stillborn, and destroy all of his appointees and anybody that dares to serve this president or to be appointed by this president. It is about Roe versus Wade, of course, but it is also about undermining and ultimately taking down this president."

And remember, this is not unlikely for victims to come forward with years later. That happens all the time. I believe that Kavanaugh has a right to put his side of the story out, and I believe she has a right to put her side of the story out."

It's not about whether you're protecting women or you think this is a woman's issue. This is just rank politics. And I think the more that we just say that and dispense with this idea that we're going to find out what happened at a pool party in 1983 is just easier for everybody, it's just about whether you're going to have a lifetime appointment on the court, period. I don't think it's about women. Otherwise they would be concerned about Keith Ellison. Guys, thanks so much."

But they had to scramble. Then there were media leaks. There was a strategy it looks like of media leaks. So there was a constant feedback loop to indicate more of a need for more surveillance and more of an investigation. And then moving on to Mueller.

You have Director Comey advocating vote for Democrats because in this election they want to shut all this investigation. They want to shut it down.
