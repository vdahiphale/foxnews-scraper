You never know when you really need a dose of patriotism until you get it into your system and then it's like, wow! That felt pretty awesome. We're referring to an American Olympian getting a ton of attention for all the right reasons. Tamyra Mensah-Stock making history in Tokyo after becoming the first Black American woman to take home a gold medal in wrestling. But unlike some other athletes who have used their platforms to protest America she has no problems praising our country. Tamyra saying, quote, \"I love representing the U.S. I freaking love living there. I love it. And I'm so happy I get to represent USA.\" She then went on to give this emotional response at a press conference.",

Contrast that with the activists' persona which dictates any expression of glee or gratitude is viewed as counter to their mission. Everything must be part of the great struggle against perceived depression caused by the evil country you represent. But last night this great athlete reminded everyone why the Olympics is so special. It should be the greatest time of your life for you and your country and I'm saying that as someone who hates the Olympics. I'll just stare. So, Katie, now, that's like old school Olympics, like you remember growing up. Happy, happy athletes, happy winners, patriotism. Everybody is adorable.",

She's a small-town gal from Texas. And her dad is an immigrant from Ghana who came here somewhat recently and believed in the dream of America for himself and for his family. And to watch his daughter take home a gold medal to represent the United States of America is amazing. And I think it is what everybody really needed and I just love everything about her and I hope that she gets to go back again. This was her first Olympics. Also, impressive to go in and win gold the first time. So, congratulations to her and thank you giving us all some optimism and gratitude.",

But I think that using the Olympics as a stage to make a political point is a cheap shot. And I really believe that, for instance, the woman soccer team, and how they started their run, there were so many Americans that I knew were cheering Sweden in the three zip rout of the American soccer team, I know that's a very controversial statement and I apologize if I offend you, but I detest people grabbing the opportunism of that stage and cheapening it.

And he did the polling, he put it out there, they leaked it out and says, like, everybody on notice that this nonsense could cost us the majority. And he wanted everybody to know that. On top of that, President Biden's numbers have gone down in the Quinnipiac poll that just came out today. In May, he was at 49 percent approval. Today, August 4th, he's at 46 percent. That's about where President Trump was. So, he's lost quite a bit of ground on that front. And so, the president who is in power in his first midterm in the first term, he usually loses seats. The Republicans have three other things going for them, redistricting. That's probably going to give them five to six seats. Recruiting, excellent recruiting, and Kevin McCarthy puts a lot of emphasis on that. And fundraising, nobody's going to be short of money. My last point is this. The Republicans now have yet another issue, because what the Biden administration did yesterday to landlords all across the country that owned 23 million rental housing units all across the country just found out that they were going to get screwed again. So -- and they can't get the help that the federal government gave out because the states don't know how to get it to them.

We're referring to an American Olympian getting a ton of attention for all the right reasons. Tamyra Mensah-Stock making history in Tokyo after becoming the first Black American woman to take home a gold medal in wrestling. But unlike some other athletes who have used their platforms to protest America she has no problems praising our country.

Contrast that with the activists' persona which dictates any expression of glee or gratitude is viewed as counter to their mission. Everything must be part of the great struggle against perceived depression caused by the evil country you represent. But last night this great athlete reminded everyone why the Olympics is so special. It should be the greatest time of your life for you and your country and I'm saying that as someone who hates the Olympics. I'll just stare.

She's a small-town gal from Texas. And her dad is an immigrant from Ghana who came here somewhat recently and believed in the dream of America for himself and for his family. And to watch his daughter take home a gold medal to represent the United States of America is amazing. And I think it is what everybody really needed and I just love everything about her and I hope that she gets to go back again. This was her first Olympics.

The reason I love the Olympics, one of the reasons, aside from the superb athleticism, is that it's the old fashioned patriot -- there is the flag of Mexico and, you know, the -- this country -- pick a country, France, and this, and Africa, and where is that country Cote d'Ivoire and all of this, I mean, Ivory Coast, however you say it. But I think that using the Olympics as a stage to make a political point is a cheap shot. And I really believe that, for instance, the woman soccer team, and how they started their run, there were so many Americans that I knew were cheering Sweden in the three zip rout of the American soccer team, I know that's a very controversial statement and I apologize if I offend you, but I detest people grabbing the opportunism of that stage and cheapening it.

And regardless of that, they've tried to push through a lot of really far left-wing ideas, and also in the senate being 50-50, they've taken advantage of that. Now, when it comes to what the issues are, inflation, obviously is a big one. Crime is up. When you have 42 percent of people saying that they don't think -- that Democrats can't be trusted on the economy, that's a big problem for Democrats given these factors. And when you're talking about people's livelihoods and crime, and Democrats not being trusted with that at all and defunding the police and having to kind of crawl back from going in on the deep end with activists who were totally on board with defunding the police, that's going to be a hard message for them to go.

One issue, which is pretty local is about Israel and, you know, support for Israel. The Squad, because -- in many ways, I agree with them about the Palestinians being even-handed and so forth, but the Jewish community is very, very suspicious. Like in Cleveland, we just had an election for the ages. I think it broke all the records in terms of the money that was spent on the election. Shontel Brown, the Joe Biden Democrat against Nina Turner, the surrogate for Bernie Sanders. So, there was this clash. But Nina Turner had in the past said things about Israel, that they call them to question her loyalty to Israel.

And he did the polling, he put it out there, they leaked it out and says, like, everybody on notice that this nonsense could cost us the majority. And he wanted everybody to know that. On top of that, President Biden's numbers have gone down in the Quinnipiac poll that just came out today. In May, he was at 49 percent approval. Today, August 4th, he's at 46 percent. That's about where President Trump was. So, he's lost quite a bit of ground on that front. And so, the president who is in power in his first midterm in the first term, he usually loses seats. The Republicans have three other things going for them, redistricting. That's probably going to give them five to six seats. Recruiting, excellent recruiting, and Kevin McCarthy puts a lot of emphasis on that. And fundraising, nobody's going to be short of money. My last point is this. The Republicans now have yet another issue, because what the Biden administration did yesterday to landlords all across the country that owned 23 million rental housing units all across the country just found out that they were going to get screwed again. So -- and they can't get the help that the federal government gave out because the states don't know how to get it to them. So, there's an opportunity there for Republicans can figure out a way to message to them and to get to them. They might be able to get those votes too."
