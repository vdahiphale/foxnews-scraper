Roger Stone, Sara Carter, Dan Bongino, Gregg Jarrett, Jesse Watters, Jessica Tarlov, Sean Spicer, Joe Concha, all here with reaction tonight. Now, the abusively biased media goes wall-to-wall to exploit the unhinged former advisor Sam Nunberg, who was clearly in the middle of a personal crisis and breakdown.  Now, plus, this is CNN, the fake news network, they actually travel to Thailand to interview a jailed Russia, quote, sex coach and prostitute who's claiming to have information about the 2016 election interference. Is fake news CNN really that desperate? Also, brand new tonight, more evidence that the fix was in with FBI's Clinton email investigation. FOX News reporting right here that the Trump- hating FBI agent Peter Strzok was told about a possible breach to Clinton's private server but he never followed it up. That's dangerous.  Breaking now, Sara Carter has an explosive report about John Kerry. Now, the former secretary of state is now being investigated by the House Intel Committee for his possible ties to the codes and bought and paid for dossier and key Republican committee chairman are now calling, as we are, for a second special counsel to be empaneled to investigate the investigators in a severe FISA abuse and FBI bias.   And there is a potential tonight, a nuclear breakthrough with North Korea, dictator Kim Jong-un is saying he's willing to talk to the U.S. about giving up his nukes.

It didn't matter if Nunberg wasn't making any sense, that he was contradicting himself or perhaps intoxicated because the media saw this as an opportunity to attack the president and they seized on it just like they always do. Here's another point. While the mainstream media was obsessing over Nunberg's freak out, they completely missed huge developments in stories they should have been covering, like irrefutable concrete evidence of real Russia collusion. It's pretty shameful, a complete a disservice to you, the American people.   But we do know there liberal media in this country, they stopped caring about the truth, about facts, a long time ago. It's why the so-called facts first network, fake news CNN, they will go anywhere in the world to try and prove their Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory to be true. OK, I'm not making this example up. It's true.  From fake news CNN, they actually sent a reporter to Thailand. Why? To interview a jailed Russian prostitute/sex coach who's claiming to have information about 2016 election interference. CNN couldn't bring in a camera in the prison. But here's what they reported.

If you want evidence of real Russia collusion, real crimes that are committed, you don't have to waste your time traveling around the world and diving in dumpsters and going to jail to meet sex coaches. It's right in front of your faces and has been for over a year.  We on this program, we have been exposing how all roads in this Russia investigation lead directly back to Hillary Clinton. She is at the center of everything. You have the Clinton bought and paid for Russia dossier, the lying dossier, Russian propaganda and lies. John Solomon reporting that, that Australian diplomat that started the Russia investigation, he has deep ties to the Clintons, involved in 25 million going to the foundation. Then you got Sid Vicious Blumenthal, Cody Shearer, they were feeding anti- Trump dirt to the Obama State Department.  And tonight, we have a major new update for my investigative reporter Sara Carter. She's reporting at the House Intel Committee is now investigating former Secretary of State John Kerry and his possible role in the phone and completely unverified dossier. And as we just told you, Kerry's State Department, they were receiving anti-Trump information from longtime Clinton allies. We will investigate -- are you going to investigate that, CNN? And former State Department official, remember Jonathan Winer, he is admitting he met with former British spy Christopher Steele. Plus, former State Department official Victoria Nuland, she said that Steele gave the State Department pages of information that she apparently turned over to the FBI. So, here are the key questions. What did John Kerry know now? When did he know it? And did this information from Steele and Clinton's allies make it to his desk? The House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes, he did send a list of ten key questions about that dossier to former Obama officials, but it's unclear John Kerry is one of them. Sara Carter will reveal all in a report coming up in mere moments.  And also right now, even more evidence that the fix was in for the FBI's corrupt Clinton email investigation. Tonight, Fox is reporting that that Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok, he was told that Hillary Clinton's private server may have been hacked but then he didn't do anything about it. Just more proof the FBI did not ever at any point conduct a real investigation that the fix was in, and it was very rigged for Hillary Clinton in the beginning.  We do know that Comey and Strzok and others -- they were drafting the exoneration statement months before interviewing Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses. In that exoneration letter, they changed the language that said it was reasonably likely that Clinton's server was hacked and it was possible the server was accessed by hostile, foreign actors. Hm? Maybe Russia. Think about it for a second. It was previously reported that five foreign actors had hacked Clinton's server. Well, we can guess one of them probably has to be Russia. Another being China. Possibly Iran? Was it North Korea? All these people that had access to top-secret material. That means American sources and methods were revealed, which means American lives were then put in danger.  So, Strzok put his personal biases ahead of protecting Americans and American national security while Russia and others were literally looking page by page and stealing our national security secrets. What Strzok did here is beyond the dereliction of duty. It's crime. Which is why we have to ask, how does Peter Strzok still have a job? And better yet, why isn't he being investigated? We now have a mountain of evidence of bias and wrongdoing against Peter Strzok and so many others, and this is only new information to add to the list. So, it's time to hold him accountable. We also have breaking tonight, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte and the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee Trey Gowdy, they are making a joint plea to the Department of Justice, I'd like to join them, requesting the Attorney General Jeff Sessions appoint a second special counsel to investigate all this misconduct, all this bias within the Department of Justice and the FBI.   According to the request, the second special counsel would investigate FISA abuses during and after the 2016 election, including why the unvetted, unverified phony Steele dossier, how was it ever able to be used to obtain a warrant against Carter Page? How did that ever happen? As we said so many times on this program, the special counsel is needed. They can't investigate themselves. And it's the Attorney General Jeff Sessions's job, to make this happen. Finally tonight, after decades of inaction and so much diplomatic failure that resulted in a nuclear armed North Korea, Clinton's bribery, Bill Clinton, didn't work, while I break your potential is on the horizon. Talks between North and South Korea have been progressing and officials in Pyongyang are now reportedly opening -- open to renegotiating the denuclearization in the region. Of course, the kingdom has also expressed interest in normalizing communication of the United States, has allegedly made offers to end nuclear ballistic missile tests, and, of course, this comes just weeks after the Trump administration enacted tough new sanctions against North Korea and months since President Trump moved a third carrier strike group to the region. Here's what President Trump had to say about all of these new developments earlier today.",

So, China has been a big help. I think that's been a factor. But the sanctions have been very, very strong and very biting, and we don't want that to happen. So I really believe they are sincere.

So, Kerry was briefed after Winer gave his summary to Victoria Nuland and to Jon Finer, who was his chief of staff. Then Finer went and briefed Kerry. So, how far did this go? What the House Intelligence Committee and other congressional members along with Senate Judiciary want to know is how high up the change of the information on the dossier go?

On that same day, Sarah had two combat veterans sitting on stage that just met with President Trump who he thanked for their service. Sergeant John Peck and Sergeant Liam Dwyer. Both individuals were injured in Iraq separately, went back and reenlisted to go to Iraq. Both cases, both got further injured. Sergeant Peck lost both his arms and both his legs.

Roger Stone, Sara Carter, Dan Bongino, Gregg Jarrett, Jesse Watters, Jessica Tarlov, Sean Spicer, Joe Concha, all here with reaction tonight. Now, the abusively biased media goes wall-to-wall to exploit the unhinged former advisor Sam Nunberg, who was clearly in the middle of a personal crisis and breakdown. Now, plus, this is CNN, the fake news network, they actually travel to Thailand to interview a jailed Russia, quote, sex coach and prostitute who's claiming to have information about the 2016 election interference. Is fake news CNN really that desperate? Also, brand new tonight, more evidence that the fix was in with FBI's Clinton email investigation. FOX News reporting right here that the Trump- hating FBI agent Peter Strzok was told about a possible breach to Clinton's private server but he never followed it up. That's dangerous. Breaking now, Sara Carter has an explosive report about John Kerry. Now, the former secretary of state is now being investigated by the House Intel Committee for his possible ties to the codes and bought and paid for dossier and key Republican committee chairman are now calling, as we are, for a second special counsel to be empaneled to investigate the investigators in a severe FISA abuse and FBI bias. And there is a potential tonight, a nuclear breakthrough with North Korea, dictator Kim Jong-un is saying he's willing to talk to the U.S. about giving up his nukes.

They didn't care if this guy was literally melting down on national television because they were using him as a tool to attack the Trump administration. It didn't matter if Nunberg wasn't making any sense, that he was contradicting himself or perhaps intoxicated because the media saw this as an opportunity to attack the president and they seized on it just like they always do. Here's another point. While the mainstream media was obsessing over Nunberg's freak out, they completely missed huge developments in stories they should have been covering, like irrefutable concrete evidence of real Russia collusion. It's pretty shameful, a complete a disservice to you, the American people. But we do know there liberal media in this country, they stopped caring about the truth, about facts, a long time ago. It's why the so-called facts first network, fake news CNN, they will go anywhere in the world to try and prove their Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory to be true. OK, I'm not making this example up. It's true. From fake news CNN, they actually sent a reporter to Thailand. Why? To interview a jailed Russian prostitute/sex coach who's claiming to have information about 2016 election interference. CNN couldn't bring in a camera in the prison. But here's what they reported.

If you want evidence of real Russia collusion, real crimes that are committed, you don't have to waste your time traveling around the world and diving in dumpsters and going to jail to meet sex coaches. It's right in front of your faces and has been for over a year. We on this program, we have been exposing how all roads in this Russia investigation lead directly back to Hillary Clinton. She is at the center of everything. You have the Clinton bought and paid for Russia dossier, the lying dossier, Russian propaganda and lies. John Solomon reporting that, that Australian diplomat that started the Russia investigation, he has deep ties to the Clintons, involved in 25 million going to the foundation. Then you got Sid Vicious Blumenthal, Cody Shearer, they were feeding anti- Trump dirt to the Obama State Department. And tonight, we have a major new update for my investigative reporter Sara Carter. She's reporting at the House Intel Committee is now investigating former Secretary of State John Kerry and his possible role in the phone and completely unverified dossier. And as we just told you, Kerry's State Department, they were receiving anti-Trump information from longtime Clinton allies. We will investigate -- are you going to investigate that, CNN? And former State Department official, remember Jonathan Winer, he is admitting he met with former British spy Christopher Steele. Plus, former State Department official Victoria Nuland, she said that Steele gave the State Department pages of information that she apparently turned over to the FBI. So, here are the key questions. What did John Kerry know now? When did he know it? And did this information from Steele and Clinton's allies make it to his desk? The House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes, he did send a list of ten key questions about that dossier to former Obama officials, but it's unclear John Kerry is one of them. Sara Carter will reveal all in a report coming up in mere moments. And also right now, even more evidence that the fix was in for the FBI's corrupt Clinton email investigation. Tonight, Fox is reporting that that Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok, he was told that Hillary Clinton's private server may have been hacked but then he didn't do anything about it. Just more proof the FBI did not ever at any point conduct a real investigation that the fix was in, and it was very rigged for Hillary Clinton in the beginning. We do know that Comey and Strzok and others -- they were drafting the exoneration statement months before interviewing Hillary Clinton and 17 other key witnesses. In that exoneration letter, they changed the language that said it was reasonably likely that Clinton's server was hacked and it was possible the server was accessed by hostile, foreign actors. Hm? Maybe Russia. Think about it for a second. It was previously reported that five foreign actors had hacked Clinton's server. Well, we can guess one of them probably has to be Russia. Another being China. Possibly Iran? Was it North Korea? All these people that had access to top-secret material. That means American sources and methods were revealed, which means American lives were then put in danger. So, Strzok put his personal biases ahead of protecting Americans and American national security while Russia and others were literally looking page by page and stealing our national security secrets. What Strzok did here is beyond the dereliction of duty. It's crime. Which is why we have to ask, how does Peter Strzok still have a job? And better yet, why isn't he being investigated? We now have a mountain of evidence of bias and wrongdoing against Peter Strzok and so many others, and this is only new information to add to the list. So, it's time to hold him accountable. We also have breaking tonight, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bob Goodlatte and the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee Trey Gowdy, they are making a joint plea to the Department of Justice, I'd like to join them, requesting the Attorney General Jeff Sessions appoint a second special counsel to investigate all this misconduct, all this bias within the Department of Justice and the FBI. According to the request, the second special counsel would investigate FISA abuses during and after the 2016 election, including why the unvetted, unverified phony Steele dossier, how was it ever able to be used to obtain a warrant against Carter Page? How did that ever happen? As we said so many times on this program, the special counsel is needed. They can't investigate themselves. And it's the Attorney General Jeff Sessions's job, to make this happen. Finally tonight, after decades of inaction and so much diplomatic failure that resulted in a nuclear armed North Korea, Clinton's bribery, Bill Clinton, didn't work, while I break your potential is on the horizon. Talks between North and South Korea have been progressing and officials in Pyongyang are now reportedly opening -- open to renegotiating the denuclearization in the region. Of course, the kingdom has also expressed interest in normalizing communication of the United States, has allegedly made offers to end nuclear ballistic missile tests, and, of course, this comes just weeks after the Trump administration enacted tough new sanctions against North Korea and months since President Trump moved a third carrier strike group to the region. Here's what President Trump had to say about all of these new developments earlier today."

      "utterance": "Me. No. I think that -- nobody got that. I think that they are sincere but I think that they are sincere also because the sanctions and what we are doing with respect to North Korea, including, you know, the great help we have been given from China, they can do more, but I think they've done more than certainly they've ever done for our country before. So, China has been a big help. I think that's been a factor. But the sanctions have been very, very strong and very biting, and we don't want that to happen. So I really believe they are sincere. I hope they are sincere. We're going to soon find out."

      "utterance": "While these revelations may present and represent a potential diplomatic breakthrough, it's unlikely that the United States will hold bilateral direct talks with North Korea until Kim Jong Un gets rid of his nuclear weapons program. I say that move is highly unlikely. Beware. Joining us now with reaction to all the breaking news tonight, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, NRA TV contributor and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Sara, let start with new news, and take it from there."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, what we know now is that the House Intelligence Committee has expanded to include in their second phase, which is the State Department, John Kerry. And the reason is, Sean, that there is new evidence that has been surfacing, part of it came out and Jonathan Winer's op-ed that was in \"The Washington Post\" and recently in a story published by the New Yorker, and expose with Christopher Steele, where it's actually -- they buried deep in the story, you'll see that Kerry was actually briefed on the dossier sometime during September 2016 or October. So, Kerry was briefed after Winer gave his summary to Victoria Nuland and to Jon Finer, who was his chief of staff. Then Finer went and briefed Kerry. So, how far did this go? What the House Intelligence Committee and other congressional members along with Senate Judiciary want to know is how high up the change of the information on the dossier go? Was it just to the high level officials liked Kerry, did it go all the way up to the president? And I think that's why that's so imperative in their questioning, they ask if anybody had briefed President Obama on the dossier prior to January 5th."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "speaker": "JARRETT",

We now know when and by whom Comey's exoneration statement was altered to clear Hillary Clinton. Of course, Peter Strzok is the one who launched the investigation of Donald Trump to try to frame him for something he didn't do, Trump-Russian collusion. And here we are, you know, a year and half later, and there is still no evidence of it. The special counsel 10 months later doesn't have any evidence of it, either. You know, there were a lot of bad characters in all of this and I was glad to see today two but very powerful law and order chairman, Bob Goodlatte and Trey Gowdy, call for a second special counsel."

I mean, I am no fan of the media, the left-wing media, that's no secret. But it was one of the more disgusting episodes I have ever seen in my 43 years on the planet. It was grotesque.

It's actually sad because they're not informing the public. And a lot of the public, the part of the public that watches CNN, I know their ratings have gone way down, but there are people watching it aren't getting the full facts. And lawmakers are not being serviced, as well, with the facts, to make better decisions. So, they don't need to go that far. They just need to look right here and start their own investigation and I welcome them to start following these investigations because I think they're going to go much further. I think they're going to lead to bigger, bigger stories, Sean. This is just the beginning. Remember, after the IG report, looking at a possible special counsel, that could easily happen.

Yet, on the heels of Sam's interview, \"Vice,\" \"The Washington Post,\" MSNBC, and others, say that my indictment is imminent because I received hacked DNC material from WikiLeaks or Julian Assange, and I gave it to the Trump campaign and Donald Trump."

The question that I think we've got to ask ourselves, if Robert Mueller, if his mandate, which has now expanded even into the UAE and well beyond what is original mandate is. But if his mandate is to discover Trump-Russia collusion, where these emails came from, did they come from Russia, don't you think the first guy you might want to ask or try and get information from would be the guy that -- the one person on earth that you know knows where that came from, whether you like Julian or don't like Julian.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions is in California himself tonight declaring he is determined to enforce the law and reduce crime and is seeking an injunction to block the three California laws, including one that justice officials say is preventing private companies from voluntarily cooperating with ICE officials. This confrontation of course comes shortly after Oakland mayor took the resist movement to a whole new level, warning potential targets that ICE agents were planning to arrest them around the bay area last month. The President struck back this week with a major court victory. A Federal Judge ruling, the White House can withhold a million dollar federal grant California, because of concerns about back stage Sanctuary City policies. Basically it's a sanctuary state right now. Giving refuge to about 2.5 million illegal immigrants right now. On the other side of the country in Harpers Ferry West Virginia, several MS-13 gang members were facing life sentences after they were convicted of restraining and killing a Virginia man who is believed to be aligned with a rival gang member. The gruesome parties, the man was stabbed more than 50 times after being lowered to a rock quarry. Then his body was dumped into a ditch while the MS-13 gang members tried to burn their own clothing to destroy the evidence.

With respect to Mr. Acosta, what this comes down to in the recent tweet that he sent with respect to Sarah Sanders, he said that she by not calling him didn't show courage. Let's be honest. Jim Acosta is a carnival barker in the press room that is clueless and classless. The day that briefing was taking place, Sarah answered over 40 questions. Because Jim Acosta didn't get his practice questions in, he feels that showed a lack of courage. On that same day, Sarah had two combat veterans sitting on stage that just met with President Trump who he thanked for their service. Sergeant John Peck and Sergeant Liam Dwyer. Both individuals were injured in Iraq separately, went back and reenlisted to go to Iraq. Both cases, both got further injured. Sergeant Peck lost both his arms and both his legs. Staff Sergeant Dwyer lost an arm. He has had over 50 surgeries. That, Mr. Acosta, is courage. That is courage. Don't talk about not getting a question being a lack of courage. Real courage will serve this country and act like an adult."

We are right about 1 mile from the school, so all week he is got the experience of running to school. Since he is been running to school this week is behavior is gotten much better. His teachers have approved of his behavior this week. He hasn't got in trouble at school this week, where last week he was just absolutely out of his mind. This right here is just old school parenting."
