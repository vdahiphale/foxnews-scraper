It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" President Trump threatening bold new action in the fight over border security, Trump saying he'll shut down the southern border amid new warnings about a wave of immigrants overwhelming the system. The president already cutting foreign aids to three Central American countries, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, this weekend.  This comes as border patrol agents expect to see over 100,000 apprehensions in March alone. That's the highest in over a decade. And the custom border patrol commissioner saying the situation is at a breaking point and that he's, quote, never seen anything like this before.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announcing she's ordering hundreds of additional agents to the border to deal with the problem. This latest potential move by President Trump is igniting fierce debate from both sides.",

You can do things like the Flora's Degree. You can close loopholes like loopholes in the 2008 anti-human trafficking law that changes the way -- differentiates the way you treat Central American unaccompanied minors versus those coming from Mexico. There's things Congress can do. Or look at our asylum and look at the disconnect between the amount of people that pass that initial screening, but just -- really small amount like 9 percent that actually get granted asylum in the courts. But instead, Congress is making the problem worse.  So we see that with the conferee solution that came -- for DHS funding. And essentially what they did is you had Democrats trying to reduce the amount of ICE detention bills. You have the -- tying the hand of President Trump in both funding for a wall in a way that he could build the wall.  And even things like Section 224 which essentially gives deportation immunity to potential sponsors with unaccompanied minors. So instead of helping the situation, Congress has made it worse.",

We know that votes weren't changed. That's not what's sowed discord in the country, what did was the dossier. Democrat funded Russian disinformation piece which is essentially what it is. You look at Christopher Steele sources it's former Kremlin intel officers, it's a foreign Russian ministry officer. That is what has caused division in this country.

There has to be somebody who's campuses, hey don't talk because what's making this, polarize this as he came out and when he made that statement, I wouldn't be my mother's son, if I didn't tell you I was always and that at that moment, it became outrage.",

She was the one who gave her son's badge to President Bush on the day he visited Ground Zero shortly after the attacks. George, Arlene's son was an NYPD officer. He raced into the city on his day off to help save as many lives as he could. President Bush actually carried that badge with him every day of his presidency as a symbol of lives lost. And when he addressed a joint session of Congress the following week, he had it there saying it was given to him as a proud memorial. Arlene served as a naval clerk during World War II. She went on to hold a special place in President Bush's heart, but also everybody in America. She was very close friends with Long Island Congressman Peter King, and he described her as strong, tough and caring and indeed she was. Rest in Peace, Arlene.",

The president already cutting foreign aids to three Central American countries, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, this weekend. This comes as border patrol agents expect to see over 100,000 apprehensions in March alone. That's the highest in over a decade. And the custom border patrol commissioner saying the situation is at a breaking point and that he's, quote, never seen anything like this before. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announcing she's ordering hundreds of additional agents to the border to deal with the problem.

You have leaders of those countries that are helping to facilitate their citizens to leave those countries through Mexico to our country. Yet, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars -- billions over years trying to fix their governmental structures and their economy so that we don't have this problem.

You can do things like the Flora's Degree. You can close loopholes like loopholes in the 2008 anti-human trafficking law that changes the way -- differentiates the way you treat Central American unaccompanied minors versus those coming from Mexico. There's things Congress can do. Or look at our asylum and look at the disconnect between the amount of people that pass that initial screening, but just -- really small amount like 9 percent that actually get granted asylum in the courts. But instead, Congress is making the problem worse. So we see that with the conferee solution that came -- for DHS funding. And essentially what they did is you had Democrats trying to reduce the amount of ICE detention bills. You have the -- tying the hand of President Trump in both funding for a wall in a way that he could build the wall. And even things like Section 224 which essentially gives deportation immunity to potential sponsors with unaccompanied minors. So instead of helping the situation, Congress has made it worse."

And looking -- I was doing some investigating and the hiring process is broken to get these border patrol agents out there. Nine out of ten applicants failed a polygraph, which means there's really -- like if they make -- especially with our veterans.

One, they've got to fix those visa loopholes because most of our illegal immigrants are coming over legally, they're just not going back. So that's another big issue. So there's a lot of things going on. And on top of all that, speaking of crisis, while we're dealing with all the stuff on our borders, let's not forget our farmers.

The latest example comes from Congressman. Others are pretending that their former hero, Bob Mueller, no longer exist. Juan, I'll ask you which -- is bob Mueller still a hero? Is he a truth teller?

I will say this, I don't see if there's anything wrong in Jerry Nadler and people in Congress saying we want to see the actual report. I think it's like 80-plus percent of Americans, Republicans and Democrats want to see this report. And certainly is the Congress' responsibility, I mean, the constitution to make every effort to obtain this report and to act it with oversight of the executive branch.

And if the report -- if his summary was so off base, I truly believe that Mueller or somebody on his team, presumably, of course, many of them are much more political and left-leaning than Mueller was. Mueller was a Republican. I think that you would have heard something by now. So I'm not surprised that there's this constitutional dispute. That's very classic.

If the report says that there were -- if there was questionable activity but nothing that was strong enough to warrant criminal prosecutions that's going to be, oh, well, he still did something. So it's just like I've said. Unfortunately, we live in a time where facts don't really mean anything. So, it's going to continue to be that way.

But the Democrats are honest about really getting to the bottom of Russian meddling. Where they would look is the dossier. Because if you look who has the biggest -- or what has had the biggest impact in sowing discord in the country it's not been $300 spent on Pennsylvania, on Facebook ads, or 2000 Wisconsin. We know that votes weren't changed. That's not what's sowed discord in the country, what did was the dossier. Democrat funded Russian disinformation piece which is essentially what it is. You look at Christopher Steele sources it's former Kremlin intel officers, it's a foreign Russian ministry officer. That is what has caused division in this country. So we need to get to the bottom of that. And also how it was used by the FBI. And Daniel Hoffman who works here that a, you know, 30-year CIA officer, actually wrote about this in 2018 for the Wall Street Journal which was particularly oppression."

And also, there's nobody on his team that can raise questions as to her political motivations, right? So basically by not having a campaign, he benefits by not having any expectations in this Q1 fundraising round that we're expecting -- the deadline was last night at midnight. So he doesn't have a way to respond to attacks. And the media has mostly given Flores a pass on these questions of her political motivations while everybody else who are his competitors, Klobucher, Bernie, Elizabeth Warren are all saying we have no reason not to believe her. I don't have any reason not to believe her either. But I would say this, there's a big movement about political Me Too stuff.

And I'm so proud that other black people are doing, so it's clearly, it's not a racial thing. It's really, I think people said on this show, you know it's a money thing.

So, Foxx wrote an op ed in The Chicago Tribune and she alludes to the fact that you know evidence and testimony provided her would make prosecution uncertain. However, how does that square with what the police have told us because they've come out and pointed at hard core evidence, things like the $3500 check, the letter that he sent himself. Those two individuals, the brothers on camera buying all these supplies. So, how do you square those two?"

In this case, you don't have a videotape. You have the words of a man who proven to be false. And so, I think from the public perception, it's when you see corruption, when you see privilege, you see political correctness, you see lies about race crimes which are so visceral inside the American consciousness. You want that day in court, present the evidence if you have it and let someone else decide, not a prosecutor who could potentially be on one side of that issue, especially when you see the police come out the way they have. I've rarely seen police come out so strongly about something, because they think their time was wasted and money wasted and resources as well."

And this has become a big issue in this case. I love the editorial writer Clarence Page and he writes for The Chicago Tribune. And he doesn't think it's funny, right. But he is saying that it's an odd sign of progress to see that a black man with enough wealth and the right connections can receive the same sort of special breaks from the criminal justice system that used to be reserved with a nod and a wink for rich and well-connected white men. We know about - that's one of the reasons we have the first step back that President Trump just signed. But he also said, more troubling is the possibility in this instance. That Smollett exploited his race and sexuality more than he was penalized for it and even the appearance of impropriety makes an ugly image."

She was the one who gave her son's badge to President Bush on the day he visited Ground Zero shortly after the attacks. George, Arlene's son was an NYPD officer. He raced into the city on his day off to help save as many lives as he could. President Bush actually carried that badge with him every day of his presidency as a symbol of lives lost. And when he addressed a joint session of Congress the following week, he had it there saying it was given to him as a proud memorial. Arlene served as a naval clerk during World War II. She went on to hold a special place in President Bush's heart, but also everybody in America. She was very close friends with Long Island Congressman Peter King, and he described her as strong, tough and caring and indeed she was. Rest in Peace, Arlene."
