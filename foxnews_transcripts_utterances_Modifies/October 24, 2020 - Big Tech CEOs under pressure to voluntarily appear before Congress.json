We're not quite clear what she is putting up and what Republicans are putting up.   But we know we have kind of got, when it comes to the Senate, a shut-up from them, because there is zero interest in any big spending plan over half-a-trillion dollars. The president is pushing the point with Republicans, especially in the Senate, that we should go big, really big. But that's apparently a lot bigger than Mitch McConnell wants to go.  So, the big hassle right now is not only getting the two sides together in the House -- and we're told right now that they're close -- but whether it could be a moot point trying to win over the Senate.  We are all over this story that had the markets on a wild ride. More on that in a second.  First to Chad Pergram, where all of this stands right now. Hey, Chad.",

Then, the less likely it looks, they pull back. I think, by now, you know the drill here, so stocks really just focusing on this for the time being and whether it can ever come to pass.

If we got nothing, that would be a massively negative surprise for the market, and we should expect a fall.  I think we're going to get something by first quarter of next year after Inauguration Day. And, Neil, what I'm telling our clients is to invest in industrials and materials in front of the election. And I'm so daring to do that before an election because I think, regarding of who wins, whether it's President Trump or former Vice President Biden, this fiscal stimulus package is coming.

So the idea that that's in play and leaning blue, the idea of what happened in 2008 with the blue wave, now Georgia is in play. You have South Carolina's in play, away from Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan that I think we will take up this time around. So, listen, I'm cautiously optimistic, but 20 days is a lifetime. We have a debate. We have a lot of things that can happen between now and then. But I think it's more important right now to say that it's time for a relief package.

It turned out that it added about 2.2 million. That's pretty much why the stock is falling better than 4 percent, almost 5 percent in after-hours trading. Now, this could be a post-pandemic response, now that we're out of the pandemic. But with more people out of their homes, they're probably not streaming as much or doing as much sitting on a couch. But that is a phenomenon to watch here, because, of course, Netflix had been on fire and was one of the best-performing stocks throughout the pandemic. When people were shut in, they were streaming on, and the stock was zooming up. So we will look at that a little bit later. In the meantime, still looking at the pile-on, on tech, not on Netflix, but on a host of big tech players right now from all sorts of interests, including Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter.

So it's fluid right now. It could even be pushed again. Now, what's really interesting here is that, according to Senator Roger Wicker -- he's a Republican from Mississippi -- he was speaking at a lunch today -- he explained that Judiciary looks at antitrust issues. Commerce looks at Section 230 issues, including privacy. The Commerce hearing next week will have Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Sundar Pichai of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. They will all appear virtually and voluntarily. With respect to the Judiciary Committee inquiry, there's speculation that it will include more than just Dorsey. Mark Zuckerberg's name is being floated, too, because Facebook also blocked that story to fact-check it -- fact-check it. What's interesting here is a subpoena, right, not voluntary participation anymore. Now, the central question, with two weeks to go until the election, is controlling the messaging on these platforms, some sort of breach. And that's what everyone's trying to get to. You have already had Elizabeth Warren advocating for breaking up big tech.  Donald Trump has even said it's necessary, but maybe for different reasons. One is about financial power and scope. The other is more about influence, like censorship. It's not a new issue. Big tech was supposed to be in the hot seat for most of this year. But the pandemic, remember, slowed that down. Then, of course, today, you have got the news that Google is being sued by the Department of Justice. One of the issues there, does it monopolize search functionality? So, what's being set up here is a big battle over what to do with these companies that will continue on into 2021, Neil. And depending on who has the White House, we're going to see how this goes.",

In the first debate, the president was very aggressive, interrupted Joe Biden a whole bunch of times. And did that turn out to be a big winner for him? Not really. In the polls, it seemed to hurt him. And we have heard word that the president is going to tone it down a little this time.

We're not quite clear what she is putting up and what Republicans are putting up. But we know we have kind of got, when it comes to the Senate, a shut-up from them, because there is zero interest in any big spending plan over half-a-trillion dollars. The president is pushing the point with Republicans, especially in the Senate, that we should go big, really big. But that's apparently a lot bigger than Mitch McConnell wants to go. So, the big hassle right now is not only getting the two sides together in the House -- and we're told right now that they're close -- but whether it could be a moot point trying to win over the Senate. We are all over this story that had the markets on a wild ride. More on that in a second. First to Chad Pergram, where all of this stands right now. Hey, Chad."

As I indicated earlier in the day, we didn't think we would find out where they went with these talks until after the markets closed. And I just checked a few minutes ago to see if there was any update. Nothing just yet. But the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, says that they are inching along and getting closer. Listen."

Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, weighed in on that. Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, was skeptical that they could get a deal. There's a lot of Republicans who are saying they want a targeted bill. They would be willing to spend more if it's targeted, but that's going to be in the eye of the beholder. There's not even an agreement on what's targeted. And if you start to target, then you start to lose Democrats. Again, this is about finding that sweet spot in the middle. This is kind of Goldilocks and the three bears. Not too hot. Not too cold. Just right. But just right has been elusive so far -- Neil."

No room for bears today, though, so maybe they're confident that something can be done at the corner of Wall and Broad today. We were all over the map, pared our gains from better than 350 points to about 113 points. A lot of this follows on the possibility we're going to get stimulus. Then, the less likely it looks, they pull back. I think, by now, you know the drill here, so stocks really just focusing on this for the time being and whether it can ever come to pass. Let's get the read from Robert Wolf, the former UBS Americas chairman and CEO, 32 Advisors CEO. We have also got Kathryn Rooney Vera here with us, the Bulltick Capital Markets Big chase. So, Kathryn, end it with you, begin with you on the markets sort of waiting for this and waiting and waiting and waiting. The math is prohibitive. They're -- just getting it done in the House is one thing. Getting it picked up in the Senate is quite another. It doesn't seem likely to me. So what happens if that reality finally hits Wall Street?"

      "speaker": "KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS",

And I think that's correct. Something is in the pipeline. And that's what the market is de facto banking on. If we got nothing, that would be a massively negative surprise for the market, and we should expect a fall. I think we're going to get something by first quarter of next year after Inauguration Day. And, Neil, what I'm telling our clients is to invest in industrials and materials in front of the election. And I'm so daring to do that before an election because I think, regarding of who wins, whether it's President Trump or former Vice President Biden, this fiscal stimulus package is coming. And you can bank on industrials and materials outperforming other sectors of the S&P 500 in that eventuality."

I know he's preparing for the debate these next couple of days, while the president crisscrosses the country. There was that memo over the weekend where there was concern expressed by some Democrats that this is not a gimme, don't assume that, Trump has come back before, he can do it again. So, you know that. I mean, do you have any of those concerns? Do you think the president is making headway as Joe Biden stays home?"

      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "Of course we're worried that a campaign and an election is going to be close. But, today, I'd rather be Joe Biden's campaign than Donald Trump's campaign. He has many more avenues of success to win. Now that Arizona is actually in play, and right now leaning towards Biden, that wasn't even a swing state with Obama nor Clinton. So the idea that that's in play and leaning blue, the idea of what happened in 2008 with the blue wave, now Georgia is in play. You have South Carolina's in play, away from Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan that I think we will take up this time around. So, listen, I'm cautiously optimistic, but 20 days is a lifetime. We have a debate. We have a lot of things that can happen between now and then. But I think it's more important right now to say that it's time for a relief package. Last week, jobless claims were higher than the entire month of September job gains. We need Congress to go back to work. It's time for Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell to get at the table and get a deal done. All big deals have to have all of the leadership."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Goldman Sachs, the big investment firm, it said today that if there is a blue wave, if there is a blue wave -- that means that the Democrats take the White House and take the Senate -- then there's going to be a whole lot of massive spending, but it would boost the economy. So, whatever fears there would be about tax hikes on the well-to-do, everyone else and the economy itself will benefit. Do you buy that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROONEY VERA",
      "utterance": "I think it's quite rich to say that Mitch McConnell and President Trump have to come to the table, when it's been de facto Speaker Pelosi who has been largely stalling the next round of stimulus package. I mean, I don't think it's going to come, because I think there's very close to zero chance that Pelosi is going to give Trump a win, regardless of the magnitude of the stimulus. I think it's particularly interesting to note that we have had several packages, of which, Neil, they dwarf what the fiscal response was to the Lehman Brothers crisis, if your audience remembers, back in 2008, which brought around the financial crisis."

But, guys, I want to thank you very, very much. I do want to get the latest from John Roberts on how all of this is going, because they have got to redo schedules here, including one regarding the full Senate confirmation, if it comes to that, for Judge Amy Barrett, I believe now pushed back to next Monday, but a lot more going in between -- John."

Speaking of schedules, Steven Mnuchin is talking to Nancy Pelosi from the Middle East, where it's midnight. So he's really burning the candle at both ends here, trying to get a deal. As Chad Pergram was alluding to, it was a real surprise this morning what the president said. Senate Republicans proposed a $500 billion deal, which the Democrats rejected. The White House offered up about $1.6 trillion to $1.8 trillion, which the Democrats rejected. But when the president said it this morning, it really kind of upped the ante here.

But the president -- and here's the key -- he's willing to go higher if the money is spent on items that could provide some return on investment, such as infrastructure projects or incentives for companies to move manufacturing back to the United States from China. In the past, Republicans have not been big fans of a big relief bill. Last week, the president, though, said, if he gets something that he likes, regardless of how big it is, he will make sure that his Republican colleagues like it too.

In Washington, they have been asking nicely, the Judiciary Committee, well maybe we'd like to hear the Twitter CEO come by and talk to us, or maybe we can subpoena him, on the very same day the antitrust case is being made against Google and Alphabet fame. The issue there, you have gotten too big for your britches -- after this."

      "utterance": "We talk about the markets and things that could move them. After-hours, we're learning that Netflix disappointed on the earnings front. What's kind of interesting about that, it's not so much how much money it's making, how many new subscribers it is getting. Most had thought it would add about 3.3 million new ones. It turned out that it added about 2.2 million. That's pretty much why the stock is falling better than 4 percent, almost 5 percent in after-hours trading. Now, this could be a post-pandemic response, now that we're out of the pandemic. But with more people out of their homes, they're probably not streaming as much or doing as much sitting on a couch. But that is a phenomenon to watch here, because, of course, Netflix had been on fire and was one of the best-performing stocks throughout the pandemic. When people were shut in, they were streaming on, and the stock was zooming up. So we will look at that a little bit later. In the meantime, still looking at the pile-on, on tech, not on Netflix, but on a host of big tech players right now from all sorts of interests, including Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter. You know the backstory there. Jackie DeAngelis here from FBN to put it all together for us. Lots of news on lots of tech companies, huh, Jackie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Good afternoon, Neil. Look, from what we know, the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering the big tech subpoenas on Thursday. That would include the issue of how the companies handled that New York Post Hunter Biden story. But that's also when the committee is supposed to consider the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. So it's fluid right now. It could even be pushed again. Now, what's really interesting here is that, according to Senator Roger Wicker -- he's a Republican from Mississippi -- he was speaking at a lunch today -- he explained that Judiciary looks at antitrust issues. Commerce looks at Section 230 issues, including privacy. The Commerce hearing next week will have Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Sundar Pichai of Google, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. They will all appear virtually and voluntarily. With respect to the Judiciary Committee inquiry, there's speculation that it will include more than just Dorsey. Mark Zuckerberg's name is being floated, too, because Facebook also blocked that story to fact-check it -- fact-check it. What's interesting here is a subpoena, right, not voluntary participation anymore. Now, the central question, with two weeks to go until the election, is controlling the messaging on these platforms, some sort of breach. And that's what everyone's trying to get to. You have already had Elizabeth Warren advocating for breaking up big tech. Donald Trump has even said it's necessary, but maybe for different reasons. One is about financial power and scope. The other is more about influence, like censorship. It's not a new issue. Big tech was supposed to be in the hot seat for most of this year. But the pandemic, remember, slowed that down. Then, of course, today, you have got the news that Google is being sued by the Department of Justice. One of the issues there, does it monopolize search functionality? So, what's being set up here is a big battle over what to do with these companies that will continue on into 2021, Neil. And depending on who has the White House, we're going to see how this goes."

But I'm prepared to vote for a subpoena if we can't work out a similar arrangement. We will be talking about it when we convene on Thursday in the Judiciary Committee. And I just hope that these big tech firms answer our requests to come before the committee and stack it up with the Commerce Committee hearings that we will hear next week. There's a lot of important things to talk about. Section 230 is a key one when it has to do that -- which is largely within the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, but the antitrust issues, a number of other things, factual and fair publishing of content, something I think the American people want to hear more about. And it may require Congress to act at some point."

The polls show both the president and Joe Biden almost dead even, the same for you. And you were given up for -- in serious trouble. And, right now, you're technically tied with Cal Cunningham, your opponent. I'm just wondering -- I know there are separate issues with Mr. Cunningham and these controversial texts, but I'm wondering if there's something else going on here. How would you describe it?"

Cal Cunningham ran a campaign talking about truth and honor matters. He's under investigation with the Army right now. He's going to get a letter of reprimand. And depending upon the circumstances of now two affairs, he could ultimately be subject to court-martial. And I think that matters to North Carolina voters. And I believe we were trending well before these revelations. I think, on Election Day, we win the day and we hold the Senate."

But the investigation with the Army will go past the election. But there's no question ,based on former JAG officers that I have spoken with, that he will have a letter of reprimand, and, again, depending upon the circumstances of now two affairs that occurred during this campaign. This is not years ago. This is weeks ago in his own home. Then it could rise to a higher level within a court-martial."

To put that number into perspective, as of four days ago, early voting numbers were four-and-a-half times what they were for the same time period in 2016. And Democrats are dominating the early voting game. In Florida, Democrats have cast 386,000 more ballots than Republicans. In Kenosha, Wisconsin now notorious for the police-involved shooting of Jacob Blake, African-American led organizations marked the first day of early voting with a march from Kenosha to Milwaukee with a message to vote, and vote early. Indelibly blue Cook County, Illinois, quadrupled mail-in voting. Early numbers, however, could be distracting. Remember, President Trump criticized particularly mail-in voting."

    {
      "speaker": "HAGEL",

I don't blame the president of the United States for all of this. I think there's an underlying dynamic and factor across our country that we have seen coming in many ways. It's a breakdown in trust and confidence in our institutions, in our system, in our leaders. That's not the president's fault. But he doesn't add to it, he doesn't help when he makes comments like he does. He could be making a different set of and a different kind, different tone of comments about have confidence and trust and do what you can to make the system work. But he goes the other way."

We hear ballots miscast, thousands thrown out. I think, in the percentage of things, and I have been following this, they're very small, in the 33 million ballots we have had so far tabulated, not counted, but tabulated. So that might be an exaggeration. But the concern is that it's going to overwhelm the system, particularly when they do have to start counting all of these. And therein lies the repeated 2000 fears.

And I think most Americans understand how important this is. And we're going to have, I believe, a huge turnout. And a lot of it is going to be different because of COVID-19, and a lot of people who are going to vote by mail-in ballots, absentee ballots. So there's going to be a lot of ballots that are going to be presented to these state election officials around the country. And the most important thing right now is that all of us have to be patient and allow this process to play out. There's going to be some bumps. There will be some incidents, as we have seen. But I think, if we're patient and allow these election officials in these different states to do their job, to count the ballots, then I think, ultimately, we will get a result that will represent a free and fair election for all of the American people."

In California, we have already received our mail- in ballots and sent them in. We -- there's a lot of that going on around the country. I think there's a great deal of interest in this election. There's clearly a lot of division here in the country, a lot of concern about our future. And I think people are going to go to the polls and indicate what kind of direction they want for the future. And I -- that's a great opportunity for the American people. I'm a believer in our democracy. I'm a believer in the ability of voters to decide what happens in our democracy. The ultimate check and balance in our system is the ability of the American people to vote. That's the -- that's the most important check and balance we have."

I don't know how that's going to work out, nor do I know how the power of the moderator has to cut a microphone on either one of these guys, how that will fare out. But I'd be curious to get your views, Secretary, while I have you here, about this New York Post Biden e-mail story. Many have kind of pooh-poohed. And social media, of course, came under scrutiny for not even allowing users to resend it or retweet it, whatever the terminology is. I'm not very technologically hip, guys. But do you think it should come up? Do you think that the president will force the issue, Secretary Hagel, and really push it? Do you think that would be a wise idea? What do you think of it as an issue, period?"

      "speaker": "HAGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, if you're talking about foreign policy as an issue, it is an issue. It's a big issue. We live in an interconnected world. We are dependent on allies, on alliances, on relationships all over the world. Our trade, our economy, our national security, our intelligence-sharing and -gathering, every aspect of our lives, of Americans lives', is connected to the global dynamic. And so foreign policy, I know, has, in most presidential elections, taken a backseat. Most of them have. And I get that. And I understand why, and especially now, because of COVID-19, the consequences, economic consequences that have happened. We're in a recession, and all that flows from that. But foreign policy is so critical, so important. And I think it deserves a place on the agenda, the debate agenda, should be in all the debates. So, no, I'm a strong believer in that, that you have to include that in the larger scope, the larger framework of America's interest, because it is not exactly central, but it is a big part of our national interest."

I don't know where this goes, but is it an issue to pursue? I mean, it's been operation ignore on the part of the Biden campaign.

We don't know, and things could be very different. But what do you think the environment will be if this were to drag on, let's say 30 days, and we're -- kind of like a 2000 phenomena, where we don't know? Some have worried about violence.

I don't think the society today is near as tolerant as where we were in 2000. The American people let it go on and on. The Supreme Court made a decision. Al Gore was a gentleman. And he said, I have lost, and that was it. I don't think that is the same kind of situation as we have today. So, I am worried. I am concerned. Some of the points that Leon made about both sides need to tamper everything -- have -- tamper it down -- tamp it down, and let the system work, let the process work. It will work.

And now in recent polls, we're seeing that drop to about four points for President Trump, and this is the state that he has campaigned in frequently. So, it would appear that that is helping him.

In the first debate, the president was very aggressive, interrupted Joe Biden a whole bunch of times. And did that turn out to be a big winner for him? Not really. In the polls, it seemed to hurt him. And we have heard word that the president is going to tone it down a little this time. So, in that debate, which many people thought was a disaster, voters could look and draw conclusions from what they saw.
