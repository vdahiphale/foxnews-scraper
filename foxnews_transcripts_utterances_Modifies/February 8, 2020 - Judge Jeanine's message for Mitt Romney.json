      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to JUSTICE. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. And yes, the rumors are true. We did it again last weekend. JUSTICE was number one the whole weekend long in viewers all day Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night. So thanks for keeping the streak alive.  And tonight the odds are in our favor again. I've got Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Corey Lewandowski, former Congressman Darrell Issa, Charlie Kirk -- all with me live.  But first, my open.  This week, we witnessed the difference between a leader and a wannabe. The stark contrast between someone who is a world leader and someone who is hoping his day will come. But being a leader takes vision, fortitude, persistence, and a selflessness, a dogged determination to a goal that never changes.  By way of example, permit me to introduce you to a non-leader, the first United States Senator in American history to vote to convict the President of his own party, Mitt Romney, the sole and only republican to vote to convict President Trump. How dare he? How could he and why would he? Mitt dared to do what he thought was good for him individually, not for the party, not for us, and certainly not for America.  He knew his vote would change nothing regarding impeachment, but he tried to set himself up as a leader going against everyone else. He took a stand he thought would impress others. It did.   Many on the loony left defended him, saying his vote was very patriotic. Yes, he endeared himself to the Trump-hating left, the radicals, not interested in the America First agenda. The ones who were all about power, not truth. So why? Mitt says his strong faith is the reason, and that God demanded it of me.",

The transcript of the telephone call, which no one expected the President would release is the corpus, it is the body of the alleged wrong doing, anything before, after, around it is irrelevant and immaterial.  What was said in that conversation is what acquits or convicts the President. Curious. You use Bolton as an excuse to convict when you don't even know what he's going to say, and when the prosecutors haven't even made out of prima facie provable case.   Mr. Wannabe, did you ask or even wonder why the Democratic House Managers didn't subpoena Bolton? When the prosecution doesn't present evidence that you want, and you don't have the slightest idea what that evidence might be or whether it's even relevant, you want to use that nothing burger to convict the President of the United States? Are you stupid, too? You take non-evidence that the Democrats refused to present as the reason to convict the President in an economy that is unparalleled, with a military whose strength is unequaled, with a population where 90 percent are happy with their lives? You really are stupid. You used the prosecutors' inability to make a case as a reason to vote guilty. Run that one by America, again, Mitt? The facts before you make it clear there was no pressure, no demands, no Ukrainian investigation, where the money was actually delivered before required, where our President under an international treaty had the right to ask for help, in fact and an obligation to investigate corruption, especially where United States taxpayers money goes to foreign countries.  And you say, this is the most difficult to decision you've ever made. Mitt, you're full of it.  And since you're such a scholar, did you ever consider the President's constitutional rights that were stripped from him in the Star Chamber? Or he was denied the presumption of innocence? The truth is, Mitt, you simply despise Donald Trump. Your jealousy of this man is a constant rage burning within you because you can never rise to the heights that he has, because guys like you fold like wusses and you don't have any selflessness or the ability to think about others as Donald Trump has thought about making America first.   And by the way, you're an embarrassment. I should know, I said it four years ago.",

You need to be removed from office. How about you get the hell out of the United States Senate? The people in Utah are furious with you and your dream of endearing yourself to the Trump-hating left is a joke.  So Mitt, pack your bags. Take some time off and ride around with their dog on the roof of your car like you did when you used to vacation with your family. And don't forget, when you lie with dogs, you get fleas.

They don't want to talk about that. They're trying to destroy this man, but they don't have an agenda compete with him, so they make it personal.

Ultimately, though, if people get through, commit crimes and we cannot get them out of the country or keep them in jail, we're going to be unable to protect the American people. That's where the President's leadership -- President Trump's leadership in the State of the Union -- he threw down the gauntlet as he should to say that Congress needs to and he will protect the American people in spite of California, New York and other sanctuary laws. The problem with this whole concept of sanctuary and not agreeing is rather than protecting, as they say they want to, people who commit petty crimes or in fact, simply undocumented workers. They've clearly crossed so much so that some current members of Congress have suggested using your tax dollars to actually fly people who have been deported back.",

JUSTICE was number one the whole weekend long in viewers all day Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday and Sunday night. So thanks for keeping the streak alive. And tonight the odds are in our favor again. I've got Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Corey Lewandowski, former Congressman Darrell Issa, Charlie Kirk -- all with me live. But first, my open. This week, we witnessed the difference between a leader and a wannabe. The stark contrast between someone who is a world leader and someone who is hoping his day will come. But being a leader takes vision, fortitude, persistence, and a selflessness, a dogged determination to a goal that never changes. By way of example, permit me to introduce you to a non-leader, the first United States Senator in American history to vote to convict the President of his own party, Mitt Romney, the sole and only republican to vote to convict President Trump. How dare he? How could he and why would he? Mitt dared to do what he thought was good for him individually, not for the party, not for us, and certainly not for America. He knew his vote would change nothing regarding impeachment, but he tried to set himself up as a leader going against everyone else. He took a stand he thought would impress others. It did. Many on the loony left defended him, saying his vote was very patriotic. Yes, he endeared himself to the Trump-hating left, the radicals, not interested in the America First agenda. The ones who were all about power, not truth. So why? Mitt says his strong faith is the reason, and that God demanded it of me."

Kind of like Nancy Pelosi, who so hates Donald Trump, that she almost has a conniption when she tries to get us to believe she prays for him every day and does not hate him. Who do these people think they're fooling? What a bunch of phonies. I can't wait to hear what they're going to tell St. Peter when they get there.

      "utterance": "Mitt, a primer. The transcript of the telephone call, which no one expected the President would release is the corpus, it is the body of the alleged wrong doing, anything before, after, around it is irrelevant and immaterial. What was said in that conversation is what acquits or convicts the President. Curious. You use Bolton as an excuse to convict when you don't even know what he's going to say, and when the prosecutors haven't even made out of prima facie provable case. Mr. Wannabe, did you ask or even wonder why the Democratic House Managers didn't subpoena Bolton? When the prosecution doesn't present evidence that you want, and you don't have the slightest idea what that evidence might be or whether it's even relevant, you want to use that nothing burger to convict the President of the United States? Are you stupid, too? You take non-evidence that the Democrats refused to present as the reason to convict the President in an economy that is unparalleled, with a military whose strength is unequaled, with a population where 90 percent are happy with their lives? You really are stupid. You used the prosecutors' inability to make a case as a reason to vote guilty. Run that one by America, again, Mitt? The facts before you make it clear there was no pressure, no demands, no Ukrainian investigation, where the money was actually delivered before required, where our President under an international treaty had the right to ask for help, in fact and an obligation to investigate corruption, especially where United States taxpayers money goes to foreign countries. And you say, this is the most difficult to decision you've ever made. Mitt, you're full of it. And since you're such a scholar, did you ever consider the President's constitutional rights that were stripped from him in the Star Chamber? Or he was denied the presumption of innocence? The truth is, Mitt, you simply despise Donald Trump. Your jealousy of this man is a constant rage burning within you because you can never rise to the heights that he has, because guys like you fold like wusses and you don't have any selflessness or the ability to think about others as Donald Trump has thought about making America first. And by the way, you're an embarrassment. I should know, I said it four years ago."

What you'll say to them, you just did it again. You ought to think about telling them that you're the reason Barack Obama got four more years with an economy in the tank, a Caliphate that was growing, law enforcement and military morale in the garbage. You haven't always been able to hide the real you. In fact, the people who know you best when you ran, the people of Massachusetts, voted against you.

You need to be removed from office. How about you get the hell out of the United States Senate? The people in Utah are furious with you and your dream of endearing yourself to the Trump-hating left is a joke. So Mitt, pack your bags. Take some time off and ride around with their dog on the roof of your car like you did when you used to vacation with your family. And don't forget, when you lie with dogs, you get fleas. But that'll never be as bad as the stain you have forged upon whatever legacy you think you have. That's my open. Let me know what you think on Facebook, Twitter #JudgeJeanine.

And what was that all about? He suspended -- President Trump -- aid to the Ukraine for a short period of time to leverage an investigation that never occurred. They got the money, there was no investigation. God's commonsense should allow all of us to understand this was partisan BS, a process used that would destroy the presidency that is legitimized. This was a bad decision for anybody to vote guilty on these facts."

They don't want to talk about that. They're trying to destroy this man, but they don't have an agenda compete with him, so they make it personal. How this man does it, President Trump, I'll never know. He's been through hell. They've taken a wrecking ball to his family. He's still standing. He's one of the toughest people I've ever met in my entire life. Nobody I know could have went through this and they were going to impeach him for suspending aid that the Ukraine eventually got ahead of schedule to leverage an investigation that never occurred.

Her managers voted for impeachment a year before the phone call ever took place. But thank God the American public saw through this, and our President was strong enough.

And before I walked out of the voting precinct in Jamaica, Iowa, I knew exactly how many votes Donald Trump received that night.

It looks like there's not much hope for Biden either in Iowa, not that they can count there -- no, I take that back. I don't mean to be mean about Iowans.

He is begging right now hanging on by the hair on his legs that he has those children grab, you know, to third place right now and he is probably going to fall to fourth place because Elizabeth Warren is going to pass him because he has no momentum. The latest poll I've seen from a rival network has Bernie Sanders up by about seven points to Pete Buttigieg and I think come Tuesday night, Bernie Sanders is going to win here as the Democrat.

That was the case four years ago. It's the case now. And the Democrats should be embracing that now. Granted, Bernie Sanders is a self-avowed socialist, and he can't win any state that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. And Donald Trump is going to mop up the floor with anybody who runs.

And under the law in New York, his name had to be disclosed to the defendants and the defendants and I believe that there were -- the gang members who ended up repeatedly stabbing this one individual and beating him in the head with a bat, which is how they do it.

That's where the President's leadership -- President Trump's leadership in the State of the Union -- he threw down the gauntlet as he should to say that Congress needs to and he will protect the American people in spite of California, New York and other sanctuary laws. The problem with this whole concept of sanctuary and not agreeing is rather than protecting, as they say they want to, people who commit petty crimes or in fact, simply undocumented workers.

They weren't able to impeach the President of the United States. The economy is roaring. His approval rating has hit a record high, and they've had some sort of a --"

And I'll tell you, Judge, they are really, really reeling right now and they can't figure out who they want to lead their party into the socialist direction. They are alternating between Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders. It's a complete mess on their side and President Donald Trump, he remains stronger than ever, with an amazing economy and his support is greater today than it was in 2016 despite the best efforts of the left."

I've been on campuses. Why do they hate him and us? And you, Turning Point people have been beaten up on university campuses?"

      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, so that individual is screaming at our Students for Trump Chapter, and that's a movement that's growing very quickly across the country and it's very exciting to see. And I just want everyone to think back just about a year ago, our entire news cycle was consumed by the Covington Catholic controversy with Nick Sandmann. So there you had a Native American individual who came up and banged the drum in his face and Nick did nothing wrong and the media went absolutely out of control. Here you have a student threatening violence and death against Trump supporters, mind you, the President of that Students for Trump Chapter at Arizona State University is Muslim and that is what he was screaming at. And the media does not cover it at all. But here's the thing. This is emblematic that we are winning. That's what the movement is growing."

      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Well, and also at the individuals that were actually at the table. It was a Students for Trump Campus advocacy event at the campus of Arizona State University who the President of that chapter just happens to be a Muslim. I bring that up because the media has been completely silent on this, all together."
