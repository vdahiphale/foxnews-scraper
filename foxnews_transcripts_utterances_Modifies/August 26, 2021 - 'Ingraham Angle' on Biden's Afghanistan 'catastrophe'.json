They struck down the administration's latest eviction ban that eviction moratorium we have more on that later with Mark Meadows. But first we start in Afghanistan where heartbreak and fury. That is what Americans across the nation are feeling tonight after suicide blast at the Kabul Airport, killed 12 U.S. Marines, one Navy medic, and it leaves more than a dozen wounded. Now, it's been two decades of war since 9/11, leaving behind deep physical and emotional pain for many of the hundreds of thousands, who bravely served here. And many, of course, remember on multiple tours. And as we finally wrap up U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, our enemies are gleefully exploiting our presidents and aptitude. And the results as we saw today are deadly. Tonight, we're going to bring you straight analysis of this rapidly deteriorating situation. We have all the military and political shockwaves covered perspective from Ed Byers, Retired Navy SEAL Master Chief. He was the recipient of the Medal of Honor for rescuing an American hostage from the Taliban along with Afghanistan vets, Congressman Waltz Greene and Brian Mast and for the political fallout Newt Gingrich and Mark Meadows. But first, Biden's body bags. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". For the past week, Biden and his team have spun it over and over that the evacuation was going well. Well, today, we saw the truth. This was all total crap. This is a catastrophe. And if you and your team Mr. President can't handle this mission, why should we trust you to handle any mission? Our enemies know that we're being led by a band of incompetence, and none of them are shaking in their boots from this Biden promise.",

They failed to organize a withdrawal that didn't devolve into total chaos. And they failed to first extract Americans still in harm's way and instead, they prioritize Afghan nationals. As far as we know, hundreds of Americans still remain in Afghanistan. How many more men and women in uniform might die because Blinken, Milley and the rest have no idea what they're doing. These young men and women joined the military to serve and protect their country. But now they're forced to serve under leaders who couldn't run a school crosswalk. All Americans should have been withdrawn weeks ago, not in the last moments. So once they created chaos all around the airport, it created impossible situation one that allowed ISIS militants to murder our soldiers. Just like Joe Biden created a magnet for illegals and the cartels at the southern border. His plan created a magnet for terrorists at the airport in Kabul.",

I cannot believe this is happening in the United States of America, encouraging thousands of desperate Afghans to flock to that airport of course, just an idiotic endeavor. We've seen it play out at our southern border, desperate migrants, they're rushing in. And it's just pain and suffering caused along the way. These are purely political calculations that Biden's team has made. They wanted millions of migrants at the southern border, they got them. And now they want hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees here in the United States, and we're on track to get that number as well. My friends, they cannot be allowed to continue this. This cannot be allowed to happen. Joe Biden has proved himself to be completely incompetent. A single American serviceman or woman should not die under the regime that they've created. The military leaders from Milley to the Head of Central Command to what we've seen in our Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin none of them should be still in their positions, none of them. Accountability is something we need in Washington, D.C. And I remember earlier this week, we heard Biden's and his teams say, oh, now's not the time, Antony Blinken, now's not the time to ask these questions. No. Now is the time to ask these questions. Now is the time to demand accountability. And tonight, we're going to do that. We have a great lineup of guests, men who've served in Afghanistan, men who know how the struggle for our men and women in uniform goes on a daily basis? They're not just talking about it. They did it. So joining me first our three House Lawmakers who served in Afghanistan, Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, Greenbrae Brian Mast a Bomb Disposal Expert and Tennessee Congressman Mark Green, Special Ops Congressman Waltz, let's start with you.

Now we have this false choice of either stay and continue to suffer attacks in an indefensible position in Kabul Airport.

He said, I don't care go to 600. He arbitrarily picked a number out of the sky. And they couldn't hold that base with 600. So they collapsed to Kabul. This is Joe Biden, and his incompetence that made that decision. And that decision is what cost those lives today. The perimeter around that base is a street wide. That's it. But out of Bagram, you had kilometers of range that you can see the enemy coming. But not when it's just a street in the middle of an urban area. It's a horrible decision. It's 100 percent Joe Biden's and that's not the first lie this guy has told or I should say he's totally disconnected from the truth, many, many other lies, and it just he needs to step down.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is a \"Fox News Alert\" another blow to Joe Biden moments ago by a 6/3 vote at the Supreme Court. They struck down the administration's latest eviction ban that eviction moratorium we have more on that later with Mark Meadows. But first we start in Afghanistan where heartbreak and fury. That is what Americans across the nation are feeling tonight after suicide blast at the Kabul Airport, killed 12 U.S. Marines, one Navy medic, and it leaves more than a dozen wounded. Now, it's been two decades of war since 9/11, leaving behind deep physical and emotional pain for many of the hundreds of thousands, who bravely served here. And many, of course, remember on multiple tours. And as we finally wrap up U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, our enemies are gleefully exploiting our presidents and aptitude. And the results as we saw today are deadly. Tonight, we're going to bring you straight analysis of this rapidly deteriorating situation. We have all the military and political shockwaves covered perspective from Ed Byers, Retired Navy SEAL Master Chief. He was the recipient of the Medal of Honor for rescuing an American hostage from the Taliban along with Afghanistan vets, Congressman Waltz Greene and Brian Mast and for the political fallout Newt Gingrich and Mark Meadows. But first, Biden's body bags. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". For the past week, Biden and his team have spun it over and over that the evacuation was going well. Well, today, we saw the truth. This was all total crap. This is a catastrophe. And if you and your team Mr. President can't handle this mission, why should we trust you to handle any mission? Our enemies know that we're being led by a band of incompetence, and none of them are shaking in their boots from this Biden promise."

      "utterance": "The fact is President Biden and his handpicked military leaders have failed the American people. They failed to bring and build an Afghan army to withstand the Taliban. They failed to organize a withdrawal that didn't devolve into total chaos. And they failed to first extract Americans still in harm's way and instead, they prioritize Afghan nationals. As far as we know, hundreds of Americans still remain in Afghanistan. How many more men and women in uniform might die because Blinken, Milley and the rest have no idea what they're doing. These young men and women joined the military to serve and protect their country. But now they're forced to serve under leaders who couldn't run a school crosswalk. All Americans should have been withdrawn weeks ago, not in the last moments. So once they created chaos all around the airport, it created impossible situation one that allowed ISIS militants to murder our soldiers. Just like Joe Biden created a magnet for illegals and the cartels at the southern border. His plan created a magnet for terrorists at the airport in Kabul."

We're relying on the people who we've been at war with for the last 20 years for protection and safe passage. Now we're letting them play TSA for us in Kabul. Of course, that's not even the worst part. It turns out that the Biden Administration actually gave their Taliban counterparts a list of Americans in country and the list of Afghans - for evacuation."

      "utterance": "It's actually scarier hearing that the second time around by the way, I only heard it once. That was the second time. It's terrifying. I cannot believe this is happening in the United States of America, encouraging thousands of desperate Afghans to flock to that airport of course, just an idiotic endeavor. We've seen it play out at our southern border, desperate migrants, they're rushing in. And it's just pain and suffering caused along the way. These are purely political calculations that Biden's team has made. They wanted millions of migrants at the southern border, they got them. And now they want hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees here in the United States, and we're on track to get that number as well. My friends, they cannot be allowed to continue this. This cannot be allowed to happen. Joe Biden has proved himself to be completely incompetent. A single American serviceman or woman should not die under the regime that they've created. The military leaders from Milley to the Head of Central Command to what we've seen in our Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin none of them should be still in their positions, none of them. Accountability is something we need in Washington, D.C. And I remember earlier this week, we heard Biden's and his teams say, oh, now's not the time, Antony Blinken, now's not the time to ask these questions. No. Now is the time to ask these questions. Now is the time to demand accountability. And tonight, we're going to do that. We have a great lineup of guests, men who've served in Afghanistan, men who know how the struggle for our men and women in uniform goes on a daily basis? They're not just talking about it. They did it. So joining me first our three House Lawmakers who served in Afghanistan, Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, Greenbrae Brian Mast a Bomb Disposal Expert and Tennessee Congressman Mark Green, Special Ops Congressman Waltz, let's start with you. Was this - this is kind of a give me question. Was this all avoidable today? And if so, why have we not seen any resignations?"

The same ones that were responsible for Benghazi that we're responsible for the rise of ISIS, that we're responsible for the -- trade have now created this mess. And Biden was there too. And here's where we are. And now he has this in a position because he pulled out too fast too soon. Let the Afghan army collapse did take no action when it was happening. Shut down our main Air Base. Now we have this false choice of either stay and continue to suffer attacks in an indefensible position in Kabul Airport. And or go and leave Americans behind and create the largest mass hostage situation in American history. It'll make 1979 look like child's play. That's what this team and that's where Biden has gotten us on top of 13 dead Marines."

That's obvious, but I am so - I'm just livid about how this has been able to happen to our troops. Joe Biden gets up there. And he praises the leadership from the Central Command. Well, we're all - we're all unanimous on the decisions we made. If they're all unanimous on the decisions we made to leave those troops that sitting ducks there.

And we can look at their words and analyze this. He said we won't be intimidated. America won't be intimidated. Then being intimidated was what brought all of this about from beginning to end, being intimidated into a red line of the day being intimidated into not following through on their red lines such as any interruption of our operations will be met with a swift response. Remember Biden saying that I would call the Taliban cordon around the airport in interruption, then not letting people through an interruption taking our Embassy and Bagram Airbase that would be considered interruption stealing our equipment that would be an interruption. Zero response and I just say this about him. His words are empty. We know that his head is empty, that his heart is empty. And it's costing our friends lives."

      "utterance": "Well, thanks for having us on, Laura. It was a huge mistake, one of the biggest mistakes in our nation's military history. But it was Joe Biden, who made that decision. I know for a fact that the military advised him not to leave Bagram. He said we're going to downsize to 600 Marines. And the leadership told him we can't hold Bagram with 600 Marines. He said, I don't care go to 600. He arbitrarily picked a number out of the sky. And they couldn't hold that base with 600. So they collapsed to Kabul. This is Joe Biden, and his incompetence that made that decision. And that decision is what cost those lives today. The perimeter around that base is a street wide. That's it. But out of Bagram, you had kilometers of range that you can see the enemy coming. But not when it's just a street in the middle of an urban area. It's a horrible decision. It's 100 percent Joe Biden's and that's not the first lie this guy has told or I should say he's totally disconnected from the truth, many, many other lies, and it just he needs to step down. He needs to resign or the cabinet needs to do something."

And he once again didn't choose to do so. So, on the one hand he didn't listen about shutting it down too fast. By the way, 5000, hardened ISIS, Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners are now on the loose, and then he didn't listen when they had to go back in to evacuate our Embassy after the after the collapse of Kabul. And now he's tying the hands of our special forces who are chomping at the bit to go out into the city and outside of the city to get our Americans that are stranded. He won't let them do that either. Their hands are being tied. So this is just in competence. And it's just outrageous."

But given what we know they are capable of - how are those words even coming out of their mouths?

Those are the ones that you're relying on. Everybody scratch their head and said, excuse me, the people that are now \"Have the most sophisticated military weaponry, shoulder fired rocket launcher surface to air assets, mortars, rounds\", you name it. Those are the ones that's who you're talking about. We all had a collective exact response that you just question. You're doing what? And it made no sense to one person on the face of this earth."

I mean, again, going back to CENTCOM, all the money we spent on CENTCOM, all the personnel, all the expertise, and the general says, yes, we expect more of these attacks. So our troops just going to be sitting ducks target practice for the terrorists, or are we going to bring in firepower to do something about this?"
    },

      "speaker": "GREEN",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly hope they do bring in the firepower. They got to push that perimeter out to where they have actual fields of fire and fields of vision to see an enemy when it's coming. They can't just sit in the middle of that city and expect to know what the enemy is doing. I mean, they have to push that perimeter out. And then they have to defend it. And they can do that by sending those Special Forces out, just like Congressman Waltz mentioned. Right now they're tying their hands. So they're not out in that city, looking for the enemy, finding the enemy pushing the enemy away. There's no buffer zone at all. So until they do that, yes, we're going to continue to see this.

It was always going to be a mess? Not this messy, but it was people were going to be left behind. Is that not the case to play devil's advocate here?"

You know set aside the debate of continuing with a small presence of Special Forces, an Intel, which I believe we are going to have to do one way or another, because one thing the Intel is clear on is that Al Qaeda is coming back. And Al Qaeda intends to hit the United States again, and Al Qaeda and the Taliban are married at the hit. But if you decide to withdraw, there's a lot better ways to do it. You don't yank everything out at once. In one fell swoop, we took the Afghan army's logistics support, maintenance, support, intelligence support, and their air support, in the middle of the fighting season, and announced to the world a date that we were going to do it by. You know, there are ways to do it gradually to do it, where it's not such a shock to the Afghan army."

But Congressman Mast, here my problem with all of us is that we have people in charge, our troops are relying on competence to lead them. We have people in charge, which again, I wouldn't trust to -- to do security in an elementary school. And we're going to have them plan a mission where they're going to go door to door to get Americans or the women that the people at NBC say helped us in a translation. I mean, I'm sorry, I don't trust the leadership. So until we have a consensus, political consensus in our country, to go back in there and essentially declare war all over again, on with new leadership, military leadership.

That was one of the first things their press team said no, it's not a combat operation, you know, which is putting people's lives at risk when it's all optics. They're not meeting strategic objectives. And you can't do that if you don't have something that you have to meet. We're going to make - we're going to eliminate the Taliban.

It's on the military side, as well. And it has been done wrong. It needs to be done right. And I submit to you that we can't let this stand. We have to go back in there. I have been part of beating the Afghan -- the Taliban and Al Qaeda twice, and we can do it again. And that's what we need to do. We cannot let this stand. And you can't do business with the Taliban, you can't do business with ISIS, you can't do business with Al Qaeda. It is just the wrong thing to do. That's one thing we have learned, and all these generals should know that. And this has been a disappointment --"

I just don't. And so, right now, I want to bring in Kash Patel, former Defense Department chief of staff. Trump brought him in to run the Afghan withdrawal. Kash, your reaction to all of this? People are like Laura, you seem flabbergasted. I'm infuriated. As an American citizen, I see the suffering of these men and women in uniform, and they are suffering. They are suffering for 20 years, for this unending war that keeps going on, they are suffering. And today, I'm infuriated. Kash?"

He basically said you cannot have and unleash the fury of the American Defense Department if it is hamstrung by your political leadership. And Laura, I'm glad you're the only person finally talking about Cent Com leadership. A little bit about that. Central Command is responsible for the Afghan theater of war, and the four star general in charge right now, McKenzie, just gave a press conference that led to an abject failure in the confidence of American military leadership. He was one of the least favorite generals we had serving under President Trump. His credibility cratered then because of his handling of a situations in the Middle East. And now he is running to the podium to try to gain political favor with the media and to try to brush over his failures -- and they are his failures, he is the commanding general for Afghanistan. And on top of him sits Chairman Milley and Secretary Austin, and all they want to talk about are deflections and other blame, when we under President Trump had a methodical plan that led to no casualties and a successful withdrawal because we removed the political apparatus from the Department of Defense and let them do their job."

They have to get the Biden administration to clean house, get it all together, pick a new national security team, a consensus team, and just present it to Joe Biden. Say, Joe, this is what you're going to do now. Something has got to change here. This dynamic cannot continue. It puts our men and women needlessly in harm's way. Joining me now is Newt Gingrich, FOX News contributor, former Speaker of the House. Newt, putting American interests first, both our national security interests and avoiding another needless loss of Americans' lives, as we saw today, what role should Congress play here, given what's unfolding?"

We have not seen a president this incompetent, we haven't seen a president surrender to an enemy in a way that Joe Biden has, and he has allowed a seventh century tribal group to defeat the most powerful country in the 21st century. It's an astonishing outcome. So I think the Congress, if they actually cared about America and wanted to put America first rather than partisan politics, both the House and Senate would go into special sessions, one, to hold hearings and really try to get at the truth, two, I think, to insist on firing an entire group of people. You can't, as a practical matter, fire the president, but the national security advisor, the secretary of state, secretary of defense, chairman of the joint chiefs, commander of the Central Command. We've learned the system has failed. And it's failed in a way which is humiliating America around the world. It's failed in a way which has gotten some courageous young Marines killed and other people killed, with a likelihood to continue to have this going on. The comments by central command, commander, oh, there will be more attacks like this -- what nonsense. The whole point is you bring in enough troops that you block the attacks. You bring enough intelligence assets, enough overhead things like predators, you do what you have to do to your people. And I think this is the most pathetic, ignorant, and wrongheaded act of national security, I think, certainly in my lifetime, and maybe in the history of the country. This is an astonishing --"

But he didn't go and surrender to Castro. He didn't turn over American equipment to the Cuban communists. You look at what Biden has been doing, and I found it very chilling today when he shifted to we are going to get as many people out as we can. Boy, that is one thing Congress ought to insist on. Every American and every Afghan ally gets out, or we don't leave. We don't listen to the Taliban. We tell the Taliban. And if that means putting B-52s and B-2s over Afghanistan again, and if it means using predators and doing, frankly, to the senior leadership exactly what we did to Soleimani. The thing that Trump had done is he had really scared them, because he wasn't going to go after their riflemen. He was going to specifically target the leaders of the Taliban.

That's right, we had no casualties under President Trump's conditions-based withdrawal, and he comes in and now we have more casualties than we have had in a decade. So I think this is a glaring admission by the president of his failures in leadership. And the fact he keeps deflecting over two President Trump. No, President Biden, you are the commander in chief. You are in charge of our armed forces. You are the one who surrendered Bagram Air Force Base. What are you doing to safeguard American citizens in country besides having your press secretary have Americans be texted and phone called and emailed? No, send it our forces operators to go rescue American citizens in Afghanistan. That's what our military does."

Kash, you know what I was thinking about as I was driving it tonight. We have spent the better part of, what, seven months -- still today, articles in the \"L.A. Times,\" where I am -- \"The New York Times,\" about January 6th. The Democrats have obsessed singularly on the insurrection as a real insurrection is unfolding in Afghanistan against our people, who are trying to have some type of orderly process under terrible command. But imagine if they had spent all that energy and time doing their oversight work of this executive branch, and this group of buffoons, whose actions are ending up getting our guys killed. January 6th and Critical Race Theory, what these idiots have been focused on, it's an embarrassment."

January 6th is the height of the politicization of the national security apparatus of the United States, and it has continued into Afghanistan. But the oversight people in Congress want to focus on his narrative because it hurts President Trump. Stop blaming the past and start taking charge of the now so no more servicemembers are killed. Do your oversight responsibility. Call President Biden and tell him to lead, and unleash our military, and stop micromanaging this war like LBJ did to Vietnam."

And I'm right there with them, but this is not how they wanted it to happen. And Biden is suffering at the polls as we see for his incompetence, and everything that happened today, a horrible loss of life. \"USA Today\"-Suffolk University poll this week put Biden's approval rating at just 41 percent, 62 percent of Americans disapproved of his handling of the withdrawal. Joining us now, Mark Meadows, former Trump chief of staff. Mark, you were in the room where difficult decisions were made, very difficult decisions.

What we see is with Joe Biden, it's not only a bad press conference today, but we had a tragic loss of American soldiers, Marines, Navy corpsmen, their lives today. And it's not going to be the end. The decisions that have been made, not just by Joe Biden, but by Chairman Milley, by Secretary Austin, when they gave the best military advice and they said that they were surprised that this would happen, it's not consistent with what I know, it's not consistent with what many in the intel community knows, and quite frankly, it's just not the truth. This was 100 percent avoidable. Heads need to roll. You know why -- Joe Biden was knocking on wood. President Trump was knocking heads. And that's what they feared.
