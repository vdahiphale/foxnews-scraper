The governor's race could end up close enough as well. But there is, as of this point, 504 in the east coast on Friday, there is no evidence that we have seen a voter fraud. There's a lot of allegations. There's a lot of people who have partisan interest in these races making claims. And we just need to take a deep breath. We need to have some transparency.

I never said he should resign, but I say he should recuse himself and he did that. You cannot like Jeff Sessions and now think he was a good attorney general. And also believe that you should be worried that President Trump fired him, put someone in that position who has very negative feelings about the Mueller investigation. He has made those clear publicly. And I think preserving records is a definite. We need transparency. And I also think you're going to hear from congress. You know, Jeff Flake and Chris Coons are going to introduce a bill to protect Mueller. It probably won't go anywhere. But I do think when they put a new A.G. up to be confirmed by the senate, you will hear Republicans Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, when he's in the senate, making sure that the new attorney general supports Mueller continuing to the end. That's all we're asking for is Mueller be able to finish his job without interference."

The thing -- I think the way that he's gone about suggesting Mark Whitaker as the acting A.G. will probably fall apart.

So there is a new film. It's called \"The Care They've Earn,\" and it's released today on Amazon Video by the Concerned Veterans for American -- excuse me, the Concerned Veterans for America Foundation. It's a group that's focused on empowering veterans and their families. And the documentary highlight some veterans' experiences with the V.A. and examines some of the issues that the V.A. has in caring for our veterans. It's out today on Amazon Prime, or you can go to TheyCare -- TheCareTheyveEarned.com. TheyCareTheyveEarned.com for more information. You can watch it this weekend with your kids and everything.
