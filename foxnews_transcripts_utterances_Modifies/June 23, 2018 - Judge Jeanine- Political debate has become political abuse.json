      "sentences": "President Trump rallying Republicans in Nevada, holding firm on his tough stance on immigration. Hello, and welcome to \"Justice\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. More from President Trump ahead, plus, in an outrageous move, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is told to leave a Virginia restaurant. Has the left really lost its collective mind? That and more in a moment. And also, I want to thank you for making us number one last weekend.  First now my opening statement. It's come to this? No more civil discourse? What's happening in this country today is beyond anything we have ever seen in American politics. Political debate at the very heart of the founding of this country has devolved into political harassment and outright political abuse. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, one of the most of prestigious jobs in Washington, DC, out to dinner, places her order and is then told to leave by the owner because she works for the president of the United States. Sarah quietly leaves. The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen this week was literally screamed and heckled out of a restaurant while eating her dinner.  Trump supporters are being harassed all across this country by a hysterical left unwilling to accept the decision and the will of the American people who put Donald Trump in office. These unhinged leftists are normalizing outrageous behavior which is only getting worse. So why is this happening? Once the democrats 24-7, Russia collusion illusion nonsense fizzled, because there was no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion other than corruption on the part of those at the top level of the FBI and DOJ to frame Donald Trump, the left needed a new issue, a new deflection to some other made-up wrongdoing on the part of Donald Trump. What to accuse him of? What can we blame him for now? They then deflect to the inhumane separation of children from their families at the border. Now, I want to be clear. I have spent my professional life fighting for children, children who have been victimized and injured and harmed. There is nothing more heartbreaking than children being separated from their parents.  Every day, family court separates parents from their children; every day criminal judges separate parents from their children and every day, children are placed in foster care away from their parents. And I haven't heard anyone on the left complain. Now, for those of you who are so blinded by Trump hatred, there are laws in this country. A primer.   When you cross the border into the United States illegally, expect to be arrested. You do not have the right to come here. We did not invite you here and you cannot stay here, but on your way out, you can thank Bill Clinton and his Flores settlement that requires that children be taken away from their parents within 20 days of crossing the border, and you can also thank Presidents Bush and Obama for signing into law that children cannot be detained at the border longer than 20 days under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. And now everyone wants to go after President Trump. This is not something that President Trump created. George Bush did nothing about it. Barack Obama did nothing about it. And by the way, Laura Bush, we haven't seen you for a while, thanks for entering the fray and calling the removal of children cruel and inhumane. Why didn't you just roll over one night and tell your husband, the president, that his zero tolerance policy was cruel and inhumane? The left just doesn't care what the facts are. Politicians are willing to stand up and totally contradict themselves in their efforts to create political chaos, hatred and abuse. And Steny Hoyer, the most of senior- ranking Democrat in Congress says this.",

The separating of children from their families only hurts if Donald Trump is President? And Peter Fonda, he says, \"We should rip the President's son from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles.\" Hey Peter, how about you get on your motorcycle and take an easy ride off the planet. J-Lo bemoans and trashes the president for this separation of children from parents, except this child is separated from her parents in Mosul by ISIS.  Even TIME magazine is so blinded that they ignore all journalistic standards to trash Donald Trump. The child depicted here on the cover was not separated from her mother. In fact, the child here was taken by the mother without the father's permission or knowledge or consent from her home country and this mother by the way had previously been deported.  We cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants. The only resolution to this problem is to build the wall. Amnesty does nothing but create an incentive for additional crossings by illegals. Make no mistake, the Democrats are simply looking for an issue for the 2018 mid-terms. And even if they have to lie, create false images and a movement to intimidate Trump supporters, they will stop at nothing. Folks, we are in a dangerous place right now. Hate is hate. Hates lead to harassment and abuse, and that abuse leads to violence, and that violence leads to retaliation. Any threat of violence that conjures up a visual of violence is more dangerous than just having different political views. We are a very short distance from those who are willing to cross the line of political debate to those willing to cross the line into political abuse.  That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine.

It changed these asylum laws which are inviting a lot of the stuff we're seeing at the border now. So it did - it ended chain migration. It ended the diversity lottery.

There is still more chain migration there. It will not solve the problem, it will lead to a massive border surge next summer and just as you said in your opening, Judge, when you do amnesty, you are inviting more illegal immigration. I think that's what the leadership bill will do. There is no way, had they put that on the floor this week, after Goodlatte's bill got 193, I don't think it would have even snipped the hundred votes because I think the American people would see it for what it is.

      "utterance": "President Trump rallying Republicans in Nevada, holding firm on his tough stance on immigration. Hello, and welcome to \"Justice\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight. More from President Trump ahead, plus, in an outrageous move, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is told to leave a Virginia restaurant. Has the left really lost its collective mind? That and more in a moment. And also, I want to thank you for making us number one last weekend. First now my opening statement. It's come to this? No more civil discourse? What's happening in this country today is beyond anything we have ever seen in American politics. Political debate at the very heart of the founding of this country has devolved into political harassment and outright political abuse. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, one of the most of prestigious jobs in Washington, DC, out to dinner, places her order and is then told to leave by the owner because she works for the president of the United States. Sarah quietly leaves. The Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen this week was literally screamed and heckled out of a restaurant while eating her dinner. Trump supporters are being harassed all across this country by a hysterical left unwilling to accept the decision and the will of the American people who put Donald Trump in office. These unhinged leftists are normalizing outrageous behavior which is only getting worse. So why is this happening? Once the democrats 24-7, Russia collusion illusion nonsense fizzled, because there was no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion other than corruption on the part of those at the top level of the FBI and DOJ to frame Donald Trump, the left needed a new issue, a new deflection to some other made-up wrongdoing on the part of Donald Trump. What to accuse him of? What can we blame him for now? They then deflect to the inhumane separation of children from their families at the border. Now, I want to be clear. I have spent my professional life fighting for children, children who have been victimized and injured and harmed. There is nothing more heartbreaking than children being separated from their parents. Every day, family court separates parents from their children; every day criminal judges separate parents from their children and every day, children are placed in foster care away from their parents. And I haven't heard anyone on the left complain. Now, for those of you who are so blinded by Trump hatred, there are laws in this country. A primer. When you cross the border into the United States illegally, expect to be arrested. You do not have the right to come here. We did not invite you here and you cannot stay here, but on your way out, you can thank Bill Clinton and his Flores settlement that requires that children be taken away from their parents within 20 days of crossing the border, and you can also thank Presidents Bush and Obama for signing into law that children cannot be detained at the border longer than 20 days under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. And now everyone wants to go after President Trump. This is not something that President Trump created. George Bush did nothing about it. Barack Obama did nothing about it. And by the way, Laura Bush, we haven't seen you for a while, thanks for entering the fray and calling the removal of children cruel and inhumane. Why didn't you just roll over one night and tell your husband, the president, that his zero tolerance policy was cruel and inhumane? The left just doesn't care what the facts are. Politicians are willing to stand up and totally contradict themselves in their efforts to create political chaos, hatred and abuse. And Steny Hoyer, the most of senior- ranking Democrat in Congress says this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. STENY HOYER, D-MARYLAND",
      "utterance": "He is taking infant children hostage, wrenching them from the arms of their parents, traumatizing them perhaps for life."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Hey, Steny, you have been in Congress for 37 years. You said nothing during the Clinton, Bush or Obama administration, and now you are worried? And Senator Kamala Harris says this."

      "utterance": "We imprisoned them. We imprison them. We put them behind barbed wires."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Kamala, when you were Attorney General in California, over one million people were separated from their children. The separating of children from their families only hurts if Donald Trump is President? And Peter Fonda, he says, \"We should rip the President's son from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles.\" Hey Peter, how about you get on your motorcycle and take an easy ride off the planet. J-Lo bemoans and trashes the president for this separation of children from parents, except this child is separated from her parents in Mosul by ISIS. Even TIME magazine is so blinded that they ignore all journalistic standards to trash Donald Trump. The child depicted here on the cover was not separated from her mother. In fact, the child here was taken by the mother without the father's permission or knowledge or consent from her home country and this mother by the way had previously been deported. We cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants. The only resolution to this problem is to build the wall. Amnesty does nothing but create an incentive for additional crossings by illegals. Make no mistake, the Democrats are simply looking for an issue for the 2018 mid-terms. And even if they have to lie, create false images and a movement to intimidate Trump supporters, they will stop at nothing. Folks, we are in a dangerous place right now. Hate is hate. Hates lead to harassment and abuse, and that abuse leads to violence, and that violence leads to retaliation. Any threat of violence that conjures up a visual of violence is more dangerous than just having different political views. We are a very short distance from those who are willing to cross the line of political debate to those willing to cross the line into political abuse. That's my open. Tell me what you think on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, #judgejeanine. And remember, if you like my open, you're going to love my book \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case against the Anti- Trump Conspiracy,\" it is out next month, but you can preorder on Amazon and Barnes & Noble now. And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement, and more of this week's news, Congressman Ron DeSantis. Congressman, good evening."

      "utterance": "All right, you heard my open. I am stunned at way they are treating people who work for the president of the United States. Literally heckling them out of restaurants. Screaming at them, trashing them. If people saying things like your child should be in a cage with pedophiles, have you ever seen it this bad?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "No, I haven't, Judge, and I think the left is just totally unhinged and they are just taking this to a level that is not healthy for our society. Look, politically it is going to end up benefiting Trump and Republicans, because I think middle America looks like that and I think they recoil with that kind of conduct, but it would certainly be better if people could actually air difference civilly, but the left is not in the mood for civil. They hate Trump. They hate people associated with him and they let that show time and time again. It's really, really troubling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so this week, you were in Congress, this week, there was a bill that was submitted, and we couldn't get the votes so it was folded and next week, there is hope that there might be a bill. What is going on in the House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "No, Judge, we voted on a bill which is exactly what President Trump promised and what most of us who ran promised. It got 193 votes. No Democrat voted for it. We had 40 Republicans vote against it. It was the only bill I have seen since I had been in Congress that would actually solve the problem of illegal immigration. It authorized Trump's wall. It had e-verify so that you have to check to make sure people are legally here. It defunded sanctuary cities. It changed these asylum laws which are inviting a lot of the stuff we're seeing at the border now. So it did - it ended chain migration. It ended the diversity lottery. It did everything we've promised, and yet you couldn't even get all the Republicans to stand with President Trump and pass that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Why? Why Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Because here's the dirty secret with the illegal immigration, the Democrats want more illegal immigration because they think you set up cycles of amnesty and that gives them more Democratic voters, but there is a sliver of Republicans who are part of the cheap labor wing of the Republican Party, who also don't want to have security, who want to see more people coming illegally because that's cheaper labor for some of the businesses, which is not good for society because it contributes to lawlessness and it lowers wages for Americans, but there are some powerful forces that are supporting it, so I think the combination of those two have been the reason why we've not had border security year after year after year in this country which a majority of Americans desperately want."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so now, the president says something very interesting. He says, \"Look, I don't care at this point because it is not going to pass the Senate. Mitch McConnell doesn't have the chutzpah, let's call it that, to get rid of the filibuster. The President is right. The Senate is not going to pass it if the House even does pass something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he is exactly right, but what the leadership is trying to do is try to pass not the bill that got 193 votes that the conservatives support, that the American people support, they want to support - they want to pass a big amnesty bill which I think would be a total disaster, it's like a $2 million person amnesty, and the people can also amnesty their parents. There is still more chain migration there. It will not solve the problem, it will lead to a massive border surge next summer and just as you said in your opening, Judge, when you do amnesty, you are inviting more illegal immigration. I think that's what the leadership bill will do. There is no way, had they put that on the floor this week, after Goodlatte's bill got 193, I don't think it would have even snipped the hundred votes because I think the American people would see it for what it is. So, I agree with the president, if all you are trying to put up is an amnesty bill, that is not going to work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, well, what about, let's talk about drugs. If 80% of the drugs in this country come from the southern border, 90% of the heroin in this country is coming from the southern border, aren't these people - forget politics, forget the demographics of illegals voting Democrat, therefore, they want the illegals and open border. They want to trash Donald Trump. What about drugs that are killing a thousand people a week in this country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "The number one reason to support Trump's wall is to save lives because you interdict the drugs. We interdicted enough fentanyl, Judge, as you know..."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "That would kill millions and millions of Americans because it's so lethal. So, you build a wall, you seal off the southern border from the drugs coming across, you are going to save thousands and thousands of American lives, and yes, I think we need to do the wall for that reason alone, also for the immigration stuff, but it is absolutely mission critical, and if you look at the opioid problem right now, the prescription abuse has actually declined. States have taken action. We were better positioned there. It's the street drugs that are really killing a lot of people, and that's fueling the crisis and making it worse and worse every day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Let's talk about the fact that - one more question, if we absorb so many people who come here, then what we've got is a system where the people who do it the right way are then pretty much punished and the people who do it illegally and all the Democrats who are supporting them and who want open borders, they flout the law and we give them education, medication, housing and everything. So, I mean, what is the message that we are sending illegals right now in this country around the world?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "The message is particularly from the Democrats is, \"You are much better off coming illegally. Why would you go through the whole process?\" And that's a terrible message to send. And it's also sending a message to people waiting in line legally. You guys are suckers. Why are you doing this? And I am telling you, Judge, legal immigrants who are here and naturalized, they really resent what the Democrats are doing with this illegal immigration and the amnesty because they did it the right way and they are proud to be Americans and proud to have done it the right way."

Ron is strong on borders, tough on crime, big on cutting taxes, loves our military and our vets. He will be a great governor in Florida.\" I've got to tell you, Ron, that's pretty good.

We should just let them loose.\" Okay, now I want you to follow me. You have 2.7 million American kids whose parents are in jail. Should we let those parents out and let them loose? Mr. America couldn't let them together, they can be together? Why is it different for people who choose to flout our laws and come here?"

I brought this on Anderson Cooper on CNN with Jorge Ramos and he's bashing Trump, bashing America, making it like this is somehow showing we're uncompassionate. I said, \"Wait a minute. These people from come through Honduras, through Guatemala up through Mexico. Mexico stopped them and said, \"Hey, we'll give you asylum. We'll give you refugee status,\" and they said, \"Excuse me, no we want the United States because we want American welfare. We want American healthcare. We want education, we want in-state tuition.\" Our own citizens don't even get these same benefits and this is outrageous."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BABEAU",

The bottom line is, we have to - not only these children, the parents who are coming, if don't apprehend them and deport all of them back to their countries of origin, what it does- it is a throwback to the Obama days of, it sends a message to everybody, every family in Central America and in Mexico that, \"Make it to the border. Give these prepared statements and lines of persecution and you are home free in the United States.\" We cannot allow that to happen. There were 52,000 illegals who were apprehended just in May. So, imagine all those who weren't caught and apprehended."

They are talking about children who were separated in all of these concentration camps to go to the showers to be murdered. Millions and millions of Jews. How dare these Democrats go there. Not one of these children have been harmed or abused. They are breaking our laws. These parents knowingly, willingly brought them through multiple countries risking robbery, rape and many times, murder to come here and then they scratch their head wondering why on earth we are enforcing our laws here in the United States, we are a sovereign nation. That's our right. The laws are on the books. It was under Obama and under Bush before. This is where President Trump is putting our country, our laws and our people first just like he did yesterday with the Angel families talking about them and the victims. This is what these Democrats, they don't want to hear one of these stories that our American citizens have been murdered or killed by criminal illegals, but they want to talk about some story of a family being separated."

I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me.
