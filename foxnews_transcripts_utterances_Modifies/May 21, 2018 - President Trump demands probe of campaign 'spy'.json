It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" President Trump just wrapping up a meeting with FBI Director Chris Wray, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and director of national intelligence Dan Coats at the White House. This comes as the president is demanding answers over a series of reports that an FBI informant was in contact with associates of his campaign. Trump tweeting that the DOJ needs to investigate if his campaign was, quote, infiltrated or surveilled and if the Obama administration was involved. The DOJ is responding by asking its inspector general to look at these allegations. Vice President Mike Pence is reacting to the latest development in a sit down with Martha MacCallum.",

But that didn't happen. So, it's sort of just really belies the truth and accuracy of it, and then you saw the New York Times sort of preempt, put this out there in advance of the I.G. report, which is expected to be quite damning, right? So they put this out, they say, well, this is why we were doing -- we're looking out for you, we're looking to protect you, but it just doesn't ring true. That it because it just seems why wouldn't you be transparent and tell them instead of sort of trying to catch or entrap or do something like that?

That's like saying I'm stalking you as a favor. I stole your car so no one else would steal your car. It's actually the plot of National Treasure, when Nicolas Cage stole the Declaration of Independence, so Bean -- what's his name -- Sean Bean's gang wouldn't take it. I get that as a movie. But here it's a bit absurd. So why did this happen? Why did Brennan, if it was Brennan, why did they do this set up, why did they set the trap? I believe that they thought they were doing God's work, that they were energized by the frantic alarmist media about Trump, of which, I include myself in it because I was every bit as like worried about Trump as anybody during the campaign. So I have to say that I'm part of that alarmist media.

So, again, this is a Laurel and Yanny moment: Some look at Friday and hear, too many guns, others hear we need more armed personnel. People hear other factors to be blame as well. For example, a pop culture that glorifies violence like video games; social networks that expose status inequality; a generation drenched in medications, bullying and nihilism. It's natural to seek causes after a ghastly event. Meanwhile, according to recent research, shootings involving students have been declining since the '90s. It's weird because of anything it feels like the opposite is the case. It leaves you scratching your head without alleviating any pain for the victim's families. So, the only thing certain is uncertainty except when it comes to us: the media. It's been reported that the killer spared some victims hoping they'd tell his side of the story. So, where would that story be told? Here, by us. As long as we do our part to tell the story with ceaseless coverage featuring the coward's face and name these events will continue.  It's the simplest cause and effect: If someone performs an act for the sake of infamy and you provide him that infamy, mission accomplished. And it's a mission that leads ultimately to another. K.G., when you see the facts and you hear that mass shootings are in decline, I can understand why that wouldn't matter because if you replace mass shootings with terror, it wouldn't matter to me. I would go, like, you still must be vigilant. But the thing is the statistics fly in the face of what we emotionally believe is correct.",

But you make such a good point. People are saying these things, all well protected because someone is carrying to put the money in and the time to make sure they are safe. What is going on? I feel the frustration of the parents that have had children, that had been injured or maimed or killed because why is it that even one more school shooting is acceptable as a casualty or collateral damage, et cetera? Why can't -- it's not hard to do. I would have dogs at the school. I would have one point of entry so if there's somebody coming in and there is an attacker, you can just bottle cap him in and secure and prevent additional loss of life throughout the school. You've got to prevent them from being able to go in deeper into the school and having more targets, right? And if you have a metal detector, so what. I'd rather have my son go to school, OK, through a metal detector and maybe have somebody there, you know, armed with the guard and dogs there because I know that he's going to come home that night.

They want, number one, stricter background checks, and number two, more money spent on mental health screenings. So, to demonize the NRA is a political solution, but it's not a practical solution because NRA members aren't masked shooters. They usually neutralize masked shooters. And Planned Parenthood and the labor unions they spend much more money lobbying then does the NRA.

This comes as the president is demanding answers over a series of reports that an FBI informant was in contact with associates of his campaign. Trump tweeting that the DOJ needs to investigate if his campaign was, quote, infiltrated or surveilled and if the Obama administration was involved. The DOJ is responding by asking its inspector general to look at these allegations. Vice President Mike Pence is reacting to the latest development in a sit down with Martha MacCallum."

But that didn't happen. So, it's sort of just really belies the truth and accuracy of it, and then you saw the New York Times sort of preempt, put this out there in advance of the I.G. report, which is expected to be quite damning, right? So they put this out, they say, well, this is why we were doing -- we're looking out for you, we're looking to protect you, but it just doesn't ring true. That it because it just seems why wouldn't you be transparent and tell them instead of sort of trying to catch or entrap or do something like that? The FBI's job is not to spy on, you know, campaigns or play somebody within an organization like that. It's just simply completely out-of-bounds."

They sent an informant in to trap Trump. IT's easier to explain. I love the media explanation for this. We only sent this informant in there to protect Donald Trump. We were spying on you as a favor. That's like saying I'm stalking you as a favor. I stole your car so no one else would steal your car. It's actually the plot of National Treasure, when Nicolas Cage stole the Declaration of Independence, so Bean -- what's his name -- Sean Bean's gang wouldn't take it. I get that as a movie. But here it's a bit absurd. So why did this happen? Why did Brennan, if it was Brennan, why did they do this set up, why did they set the trap? I believe that they thought they were doing God's work, that they were energized by the frantic alarmist media about Trump, of which, I include myself in it because I was every bit as like worried about Trump as anybody during the campaign. So I have to say that I'm part of that alarmist media. I think if you watch the news, and you're part of the news, and you're part of the government, you convince yourself that if Trump became president the country was in peril, and therefore doing something like this, which was illegal, is actually patriotic."

So far, President Trump has taken every step to make it longer. So, I don't know. I don't know if -- when Rudy Giuliani said this weekend that Mueller told me it will be wrapped up by September 1st. Like, I don't even know if I would say that, because do you want to hang out this whole summer. And I am willing to believe that the Obama team had done this, right? They were like politically motivated. But, all of these things, if it's true, if it's true, if it's true, reminds me of -- they've wiretapped me up Trump Tower, which turns out not to have been the case.

I do think that the Hillary Clinton team has a right to be somewhat mad, that their position is -- you mean to tell me that the FBI was willing to go out on the record with the director to say that I would - - I was being investigated by Hillary Clinton.

For example, a pop culture that glorifies violence like video games; social networks that expose status inequality; a generation drenched in medications, bullying and nihilism. It's natural to seek causes after a ghastly event. Meanwhile, according to recent research, shootings involving students have been declining since the '90s. It's weird because of anything it feels like the opposite is the case. It leaves you scratching your head without alleviating any pain for the victim's families. So, the only thing certain is uncertainty except when it comes to us: the media. It's been reported that the killer spared some victims hoping they'd tell his side of the story. So, where would that story be told? Here, by us. As long as we do our part to tell the story with ceaseless coverage featuring the coward's face and name these events will continue."

But you make such a good point. People are saying these things, all well protected because someone is carrying to put the money in and the time to make sure they are safe. What is going on? I feel the frustration of the parents that have had children, that had been injured or maimed or killed because why is it that even one more school shooting is acceptable as a casualty or collateral damage, et cetera? Why can't -- it's not hard to do. I would have dogs at the school. I would have one point of entry so if there's somebody coming in and there is an attacker, you can just bottle cap him in and secure and prevent additional loss of life throughout the school. You've got to prevent them from being able to go in deeper into the school and having more targets, right? And if you have a metal detector, so what. I'd rather have my son go to school, OK, through a metal detector and maybe have somebody there, you know, armed with the guard and dogs there because I know that he's going to come home that night. So that's how you have to put it. Yes, it's not pleasant but it's reality and you have to deal with it. It's like not treating a disease.

I would say this in response to Kimberly, I think that that school in Texas was given an award for being a hardened target.

There's the rise of social media and the iPhone. There's the over prescription of psychiatric drugs to teens. They've got the promise program. Cyberbullying, where, you know, they're not trying to criminalize criminal kids. So, look at the polls, the polls say 57 percent of this country thinks it's a mental health issue. Only 20 or so percent believe it's a gun-control issue. And most people do want stricter gun control. But you know the two things they want? They want, number one, stricter background checks, and number two, more money spent on mental health screenings. So, to demonize the NRA is a political solution, but it's not a practical solution because NRA members aren't masked shooters. They usually neutralize masked shooters. And Planned Parenthood and the labor unions they spend much more money lobbying then does the NRA. If the Democrats really wanted to do something about gun control, they have the house and senate for two years under Obama, they didn't do it.

A whopping 29.2 million viewers here in the United States tuned in to watch the couple tie the knot on Saturday morning at Windsor Castle, according to Nielsen. And that's over 6 million more viewers than Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding in 2011. Now meanwhile, we're seeing brand-new gorgeous portraits of the newlyweds from the big day.
