So there's nothing there. Speaking of nothing there, Cohen destroyed the campaign finance violation allegation against Donald Trump. Remember Stormy Daniels was paid for her so-called story in the fall of 2016? Now these things happen when you're as rich and famous as Donald Trump is. You pay for negative allegations to go away to protect your personal and family reputation.

So when did he become a racist? The man is 72 years old. Most people don't suddenly change their entire life long philosophy at the age of 72. I'd like for someone to tell me the moment in time at which he suddenly switched from being this guy that every one of every race loved and wanted to hang out with to being a racist, tell me when that happened, and if you can't, you really don't have anything to pin on him."

Some people call it infanticide, you deliver the baby and the baby is terminated on the table. No coverage at all. Look at Tuesday's coverage, the networks totally spikes this thing. Zero minutes from ABC, zero from CBS, zero from NBC. This was a vote the Democrats were against and they're all on record as supporting now partial birth abortion and the mainstream media ran a protection ring around them. Governor, what do you think?"

I mean, this is actually murder of a child that has already been delivered and that's what I think a lot of people don't understand and one of the senators said, \"Well, the reason I didn't vote for it was because it offends women's reproductive health.\" Look, at this point, the woman has already reproduced. The baby is out of her womb. It's no longer a part of her. It's not an abortion. This is a child laying on a table 15 feet from her and instead of the doctor doing what he can to save this attempted abortion of a baby, he actually goes in and actively kills the baby after it's been born alive. And when Democrats can't vote for something that would protect a crying baby, then they are party of the Canaanites of ancient days and they ought to be turned away forever. Just disgusting."
