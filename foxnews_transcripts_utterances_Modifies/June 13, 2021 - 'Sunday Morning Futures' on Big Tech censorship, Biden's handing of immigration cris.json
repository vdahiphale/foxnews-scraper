Later today, the president will meet with Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle.  Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for being here. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Let me bring in Florida Governor Ron DeSantis now, get some reaction to what we just heard.  Governor, thanks very much for being here and standing by throughout our live coverage of the G7 close-out meeting. Your reaction to what you heard from the president?",

I think that President Biden is someone that's much more passive on the world stage, not nearly as assertive as somebody like Donald Trump was. I think his energy level is obviously much lower.  And so I think that's just something that people are sizing up. I think that our adversaries are watching that. I didn't hear very much in the way of holding China accountable for their role in covering up the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. I think that's absolutely essential that China be held accountable for their role in that, as well as any bureaucrats in the United States who may have been covering it up.   But they were talking economically a lot about other countries. He was talking about reducing energy production worldwide. And I couldn't help but think, here in the United States, he's leaving a lot of people behind. Look at all the workers he left behind by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline.",

And this was about Florida. And it says the average taxpayer who moved to Florida from the other 49 states had an average income -- this is an average gross income of $110,000, which is about twice the average household income. Of course, you don't have income tax in Florida. And it's actually helped your economy. Tell us -- assess the economy right now in Florida.

I think you're seeing a lot of people move here.  Obviously, we have a very favorable tax climate. Florida is the lowest per capita tax burden, individual tax burden, in the country. And we are very proud of that. That has led, obviously, to more businesses moving here. So we have got a lot of great things, I think, on the horizon.  But it's a lesson in how you do this. You tax people, you attack business, you do all of those things, in a country like ours, it's very mobile. People vote with their feet. And so what we have been able to do is, with low taxes and a favorable environment, we end up taking in more revenue than we probably would if we had higher taxes because of the underlying dynamism of the economy.",

And let me start with the bill that you just signed to stop the censorship of Floridians. Last week on this program, we went through the Fauci Facebook files, where it's clear, based on e-mails between Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Anthony Fauci, they were coordinating in terms of what should be reported on Facebook and what shouldn't be. Facebook took down many posts about the origins of COVID-19, only to have egg on its face when they had to change the policy again. Do you believe Fauci colluded with Mark Zuckerberg? Does this expose Facebook to legal action, which, of course, is what Senator Ted Cruz told us last week?",

They were also censoring around the same time last year any criticisms of lockdowns. And we know now lockdowns didn't work. States like Florida that were open were better off for it.  And so you often hear people say, hey, these are private companies, they can do what they want, yadda, yadda, yadda. But here's an example of working with Fauci where Facebook, you could argue, is essentially acting as an arm of the state, because they're suppressing what the government wants suppressed. And so I think this issue with big tech is unlike anything we have seen. They have massive amounts of power. These are monopolies that are much stronger than the monopolies of the early 20th century. They control, in effect, a handful of companies, a huge percentage of the political speech in this country.   And so I think, when you have a situations, they're not just censoring based on partisanship. Obviously, we have seen conservatives be censored. But when they're censoring things about some of the most important issues that we have ever addressed, how COVID started, whether lockdowns work...",

It really tracks what Justice Clarence Thomas laid out in his -- one of his concurrences a few months ago, where these companies really are more akin to common carriers.  And so they should be treated as such. And our view is, is, yes, you can have certain, obviously, guidelines or however you do it, but you have got to apply it evenly. And if you don't, you're advertising as an open platform, you're saying you're not publishers, but then you're acting as publishers by stifling speech you don't like, that's a fraud on the consumer, and people deserve to be able to vindicate their rights in court.",

I had people that fled socialist Venezuela talking about how important it was to combat censorship, because they lived through really bad periods of censorship.  You look at how big tech has handled the CCP, they are very deferential to the Communist Party of China. And I think that China was very much invested in promoting lockdowns as we started getting into 2020, February, March. Obviously, Italy, those Italy lockdowns were very much patterned off what we saw in Wuhan. And Facebook and some of these big companies, they were really serving to elevate the lockdown hysteria and to absolutely suppress people who were raising questions and concerns about lockdowns. And the reason why that's so -- I think, so galling is because, up until COVID, public health guidance was never, in a pandemic, to just lock down indefinitely.   This was kind of a new invention that was really fueled by the Chinese experience. And so I think the relationship between big tech and the CCP is very problematic and, quite frankly, a lot of these big corporations, particularly in entertainment and some of these other fields of the American economy.",

I know that you have talked about the CCP infiltrating Florida universities. You have got Confucius centers. This is a very important point. And I want you to talk about what you're doing, these two bills that you just signed, in terms of stopping the influence, foreign influence in universities, because the CCP has been able to get inside of important institutions in this country and steal data.   We know that Secretary Pompeo has said they are now inside the gates. There was a string of indictments in 2020 by the Pompeo State Department, everyone from a -- the head of the biology department at Harvard, to an NYPD officer, to shutting down the embassy in Houston. They do get inside of our institutions. What can you do to stop it? And tell me about those Confucius centers in Florida.",

So, we actually had a Confucius Institute that was done at Miami-Dade College. Fortunately, when I became governor, we looked at that, and we had the college get rid of it.  However, this is something, I think, that's going to be a continued concern. So, our bill we signed basically bans things like Confucius Institutes from getting a foothold on Florida universities. And I think that's really important. But, as you document, there -- it seems like, every other week, there will be some academic researcher who's identified as having ties with the CCP.

There's very credible evidence that this could in fact be how this terrible virus started. They were wrong on the lockdown, as the governor said, and they were wrong on some of the things they criticized relative to hydroxychloroquine, based on some of the recent studies. So, Maria, I think there are four big why questions here. The first question is, why were we giving money to a Chinese lab in the first place, your hard-earned tax dollars, your viewers' hard-earned tax dollars? Why were we doing that? Why did Dr. Fauci and others downplay the lab leak theory a year-and-a-half ago, when all kinds of credible people were around them, e-mailing them, talking to them saying, hey, we think this lab leak theory could in fact be how this thing started? Why did -- why did they redact the big portion of the e-mail between Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Fauci? And the main question for me is, why don't Democrats in the United States Congress want to investigate how this virus started? So, those are four big questions I think we need answers to. And the only way to do it is to have an investigation that the Congress does, bring in Dr. Fauci, bring in Mr. Collins, ask them the tough questions, and, frankly, bring in this guy who -- Chris Hassell, who's the head of the board that oversees any grants, any applications, any grant applications that deal with -- quote -- \"gain on function research.\" He has said that they -- that the definition is way too narrow. And he's only dealt with a couple of grant applications in the time that this board has been in operation. So, I think we have to do it. There's a select committee in Congress.

We have the report from Judge Boasberg on what happened with the FISA process at the FBI. This is an attack on Americans liberties, and it should rightly concern every single citizen.

I think you're seeing a lot of people move here. Obviously, we have a very favorable tax climate. Florida is the lowest per capita tax burden, individual tax burden, in the country. And we are very proud of that. That has led, obviously, to more businesses moving here. So we have got a lot of great things, I think, on the horizon. But it's a lesson in how you do this. You tax people, you attack business, you do all of those things, in a country like ours, it's very mobile. People vote with their feet. And so what we have been able to do is, with low taxes and a favorable environment, we end up taking in more revenue than we probably would if we had higher taxes because of the underlying dynamism of the economy."

      "utterance": "Yes, it's incredible. You have been doing so much, Governor. I want to get into some of your moves. And let me start with the bill that you just signed to stop the censorship of Floridians. Last week on this program, we went through the Fauci Facebook files, where it's clear, based on e-mails between Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Anthony Fauci, they were coordinating in terms of what should be reported on Facebook and what shouldn't be. Facebook took down many posts about the origins of COVID-19, only to have egg on its face when they had to change the policy again. Do you believe Fauci colluded with Mark Zuckerberg? Does this expose Facebook to legal action, which, of course, is what Senator Ted Cruz told us last week?"

    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, you pointed out something important, Maria. What they censored was actually true. They called it a conspiracy theory if you said this may have leaked from the lab. They were also censoring around the same time last year any criticisms of lockdowns. And we know now lockdowns didn't work. States like Florida that were open were better off for it. And so you often hear people say, hey, these are private companies, they can do what they want, yadda, yadda, yadda. But here's an example of working with Fauci where Facebook, you could argue, is essentially acting as an arm of the state, because they're suppressing what the government wants suppressed. And so I think this issue with big tech is unlike anything we have seen. They have massive amounts of power. These are monopolies that are much stronger than the monopolies of the early 20th century. They control, in effect, a handful of companies, a huge percentage of the political speech in this country. And so I think, when you have a situations, they're not just censoring based on partisanship. Obviously, we have seen conservatives be censored. But when they're censoring things about some of the most important issues that we have ever addressed, how COVID started, whether lockdowns work..."

It really tracks what Justice Clarence Thomas laid out in his -- one of his concurrences a few months ago, where these companies really are more akin to common carriers. And so they should be treated as such. And our view is, is, yes, you can have certain, obviously, guidelines or however you do it, but you have got to apply it evenly. And if you don't, you're advertising as an open platform, you're saying you're not publishers, but then you're acting as publishers by stifling speech you don't like, that's a fraud on the consumer, and people deserve to be able to vindicate their rights in court."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",

I had people that fled socialist Venezuela talking about how important it was to combat censorship, because they lived through really bad periods of censorship. You look at how big tech has handled the CCP, they are very deferential to the Communist Party of China. And I think that China was very much invested in promoting lockdowns as we started getting into 2020, February, March. Obviously, Italy, those Italy lockdowns were very much patterned off what we saw in Wuhan. And Facebook and some of these big companies, they were really serving to elevate the lockdown hysteria and to absolutely suppress people who were raising questions and concerns about lockdowns. And the reason why that's so -- I think, so galling is because, up until COVID, public health guidance was never, in a pandemic, to just lock down indefinitely. This was kind of a new invention that was really fueled by the Chinese experience. And so I think the relationship between big tech and the CCP is very problematic and, quite frankly, a lot of these big corporations, particularly in entertainment and some of these other fields of the American economy."

I know that you have talked about the CCP infiltrating Florida universities. You have got Confucius centers. This is a very important point. And I want you to talk about what you're doing, these two bills that you just signed, in terms of stopping the influence, foreign influence in universities, because the CCP has been able to get inside of important institutions in this country and steal data. We know that Secretary Pompeo has said they are now inside the gates. There was a string of indictments in 2020 by the Pompeo State Department, everyone from a -- the head of the biology department at Harvard, to an NYPD officer, to shutting down the embassy in Houston. They do get inside of our institutions. What can you do to stop it? And tell me about those Confucius centers in Florida."

So, we actually had a Confucius Institute that was done at Miami-Dade College. Fortunately, when I became governor, we looked at that, and we had the college get rid of it. However, this is something, I think, that's going to be a continued concern. So, our bill we signed basically bans things like Confucius Institutes from getting a foothold on Florida universities. And I think that's really important. But, as you document, there -- it seems like, every other week, there will be some academic researcher who's identified as having ties with the CCP. People get indicted. People flee America once they're -- once they're found out about this."

They caused immense damage throughout the world by allowing this virus to be unleashed on the rest of the world.

And so, once we're past the CDC's intransigence, then they're going to be free to sail in Florida. They, of course, are going to have to fall -- follow Florida law. But they're going to be able to do it without requiring vaccine passports. The CDC, Maria, they don't recognize immunity conferred through infection. And we know there have been tens of millions of people who have immunity through that way. Why would you say they can't participate in society? Why do we want people to be divulging all this health information?

There's very credible evidence that this could in fact be how this terrible virus started. They were wrong on the lockdown, as the governor said, and they were wrong on some of the things they criticized relative to hydroxychloroquine, based on some of the recent studies. So, Maria, I think there are four big why questions here. The first question is, why were we giving money to a Chinese lab in the first place, your hard-earned tax dollars, your viewers' hard-earned tax dollars? Why were we doing that? Why did Dr. Fauci and others downplay the lab leak theory a year-and-a-half ago, when all kinds of credible people were around them, e-mailing them, talking to them saying, hey, we think this lab leak theory could in fact be how this thing started? Why did -- why did they redact the big portion of the e-mail between Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Fauci? And the main question for me is, why don't Democrats in the United States Congress want to investigate how this virus started? So, those are four big questions I think we need answers to. And the only way to do it is to have an investigation that the Congress does, bring in Dr. Fauci, bring in Mr. Collins, ask them the tough questions, and, frankly, bring in this guy who -- Chris Hassell, who's the head of the board that oversees any grants, any applications, any grant applications that deal with -- quote -- \"gain on function research.\" He has said that they -- that the definition is way too narrow. And he's only dealt with a couple of grant applications in the time that this board has been in operation. So, I think we have to do it. There's a select committee in Congress. Why in the world aren't we focused on how this virus started?"

We know what Inspector General Horowitz told us a year-and-a-half ago specifically relative to the Carter Page FISA, which is what they used to spy on the Trump campaign, that there were 61 lies in that FISA application. So this is a concern for Americans, because you think about -- we have this report this past week with what the IRS did with American citizens' tax returns. We have the report from Judge Boasberg on what happened with the FISA process at the FBI. This is an attack on Americans liberties, and it should rightly concern every single citizen. And that's why we have asked questions about it. That's why we probe here. That's why we tried to change the FISA law a year-and-a-half ago as well.

Tens of thousands more were watched on surveillance cameras getting away. Now they have -- we have no idea where they are. They have likely made it into the interior of our country. Joining me right now, a man who is on the ground dealing with this firsthand, the national Border Patrol Council president, Brandon Judd. Brandon, it's good to have you this morning. Let me apologize for our abbreviated time here. But assess where we are right now. One would have expected maybe Kamala Harris would have made a surprise visit to the border, given all of the interest in it. But that was not the case."

She even came out and said that she's an advocate for illegal aliens. She's supposed to be an advocate for citizens of this country, yet she's coming out and she's saying that she's advocating for lawlessness. That's the reason that we're seeing all of the problems that we're seeing in cities like Oregon, New York, Chicago. All of this lawlessness is existing because she advocates for lawlessness."
