It's now the party of anti-Semitism. Yes. And the President is weighing in. We'll get to that ahead. Plus, it isn't just a Republican saying they found no evidence of Russian collusion. Wait until we reveal why the resistance might be feeling a little burned tonight. And Beto O'Rourke spoke at an anti-wall protest last night. He ignored our request for an interview (inaudible). But we crashed his party. Raymond Arroyo was there, and he brings us his report later.  But first, the border wall becomes a border stall. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  I hate to tell you I told you so, but I told you so. When the White House and the GOP failed to act on the Trump immigration agenda in the first 100 days of his Presidency, his pledge to build a wall would be jeopardized. Trump's initial instinct, which is usually spot on, was to veto that omnibus bill last year. I'm telling you, he was right then. But Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell promised him that they would get this wall funded in full in the lame duck session, if that was necessary. Well, big shocker. That never happened.  So after Speaker Paul \"I need to spend weekends at home\" Ryan handed the majority to the Democrats, well, the President faced an even higher wall of resistance. A lame old border deal was announced right before the President took to the stage in El Paso last night, and by the morning, the details started trickling in.",

      "sentences": "Well, that won't happen though, not unless the President finds the money elsewhere or declares a national emergency, which will immediately be challenged of course by the left in court.   And tonight, after speaking with one of the Republican architects, Richard Shelby, Senator from Alabama with the latest deal, the President tweeted, \"Was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal by hard working Senator Richard Shelby. Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. Will be getting almost $23 billion for border security. Regardless of wall money, it is being built as we speak.\" We'll get into that in a little bit. But - so what's in this deal? What's really in it? The official language hasn't fully been released. And I love this. We're doing at the last minute, trying to rush it through. But here are some of the basics of the deal, as reported. $1.375 billion for barriers that are not called but look a heck of a lot like the steel slanted structure, the barrier that Trump had already approved. Second, an average daily cap of 40,520 beds for detaining illegals. Now, that's almost 9,000 fewer than we're detaining now. But Trump would have the authority to boost that number, pulling the money from other sources.   Now, there's more to it, too. But it's simple to see what's going on here. The Democrats' ultimate goal is to codify catch and release, where if an illegal makes it into the country, he or she will be welcome to stay along with any child he or she brings with them across the border. Now what does this do? I mean, this is not a difficult concept, right? It only encourages more illegal immigration. Now, remember, the President asks for $25 billion last year for the wall and a bunch of other reforms as well that made a lot of sense. But the Dems wouldn't budge on issues like chain migration or those diversity visas. They wouldn't go near it. Then in December - now, moving into lame duck session, he asked for one- fifth of that. I'm still pretty good at math sort of. It's $5 billion of the $25 billion. Now, he perhaps thought that this would become some type of annual wall expenditure. Well, fat chance. They don't want a call. They never wanted a wall. But on the bright side - and I have to look at the glass half-full here. The current deal does expose just how far left the Democrat Party has gone on the issue of illegal immigration. They've gone from this--",

Remember this gem that when Congressman O'Rourke sent out in 2015. It read, \"Tear down this wall.\" Oh, boy! That's a keeper. Well, I can tell you that the people we met in El Paso last night, they disagreed vehemently. And an under-reported fact is that about half of the audience at the Trump rally were themselves Hispanic. And they most certainly do not want the wall between the cartel-run Juarez and El Paso torn down. No way. They love their peaceful community. It was a really fun place to be.

Of them, 200,000 will not even be apprehended. And of the 200,000 who are, 90 percent will be caught and released like you know because we allow judicially created catch-and- release to govern our border security. The cartels have operational control of our border. It's time for us to do our job. And this deal isn't doing our job. $1.375 billion is the baseline. We need to get the money that is necessary so the border patrol aren't down on the border, without the radio signals they need, without the ability to have the fencing to stop the flow.

And I want to quote it for you, Congressman. \"The bill was still being written tonight, Tuesday night, and lawmakers from both parties were pushing to include a number of favored provisions.\" Those are called pork provisions. Well, \"Some Democrats wanted to add language that would provide back-pay to federal contractors who were caught in the middle of the recent shutdown, but it's unclear if lawmakers would be successful in getting the provision included.\"   Now, I'm hearing tonight that that could destroy any possibility of this thing even going forward, but people have to understand, we don't even have the language yet and we know stuff gets slipped in, Congressman McClintock, at the last minute.

Other than interrupting you, I don't know how to get -- but I think I got the point from both of you and I really appreciate the fac that you both came on. We'll be covering this. We want to try to be fair about it. The left, by the way, has told us that we aren't allowed to talk about the need for immigrants to assimilate into the American culture. That, too, is racist. That is especially as it relates to the public school system. The question is, why is assimilation even in the school system now controversial? The reason is simple, but grossly punitive. They wish to inoculate the entire public school system in the United States and thus the powerful teachers unions from criticism, even if it means a diminished product for the kids. The Center for Immigration Studies recently found 700 immigrant saturated school districts where half of the new students are from immigrant households. Quote \"The number of children from immigrant households and schools is now so high in some areas that it raises profound questions about assimilation. Immigration has added enormously to the number of public school students who are in poverty and the number who speak a foreign language. This cannot help but to create significant challenges for schools often in areas already struggling to educate students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.\" Joining us now is the man behind this study, Steve Camerota from the Center for Immigration Studies. Steve, now, people are going to say the fact that we are even talking about this is meanspirited and it's anti-Hispanic, and I will say, we are calling you on your you know what if you say that, because this is about kids and learning and the wonders of America. So what do the public education folks, they don't seem to care about this, they don't seem to understand the enormity of the problem? What going on?",

But it doesn't answer the fundamental question of how many people should we let in the country? How do we enforce our immigration laws against illegal immigration? There are about one out of every four kids in public school today is from an immigrant family. About one-third of all the kids in poverty in public school today are from an immigrant family. Even in a state like Minnesota, you are looking at about 49 percent of all the kids in public school in poverty, I should say 40 percent, of all the kids in public school in poverty in the state of Minnesota come from an immigrant family. So these are important questions. A more moderate pace of immigration, enforcing our laws, a more moderate pace of legal immigration, these things would tend to take a lot of pressure off of public schools, making it easier to educate the kids already here, which I think most people agree is important.",

During the last great wave, for example, of immigration around 1900, there was much great consensus among our elites, including our public schools, including the people who ran the public schools in the big cities where the immigrants settled, that there was an idea that we should Americanize immigrants. And that doesn't just mean that they learn English, though incredibly important, it also means that they come to identify with their country, come to see America's founding as the founding of their country as well and not see that is something that dead white men did. The other thing is the numbers are so big. One of the ways immigration assimilation works is that immigrants and their kids interact with so many kids from native backgrounds so that assimilation becomes kind of a foregone conclusion.

It's now the party of anti-Semitism. Yes. And the President is weighing in. We'll get to that ahead. Plus, it isn't just a Republican saying they found no evidence of Russian collusion. Wait until we reveal why the resistance might be feeling a little burned tonight. And Beto O'Rourke spoke at an anti-wall protest last night. He ignored our request for an interview (inaudible). But we crashed his party. Raymond Arroyo was there, and he brings us his report later. But first, the border wall becomes a border stall. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” I hate to tell you I told you so, but I told you so. When the White House and the GOP failed to act on the Trump immigration agenda in the first 100 days of his Presidency, his pledge to build a wall would be jeopardized. Trump's initial instinct, which is usually spot on, was to veto that omnibus bill last year. I'm telling you, he was right then. But Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell promised him that they would get this wall funded in full in the lame duck session, if that was necessary. Well, big shocker. That never happened. So after Speaker Paul \"I need to spend weekends at home\" Ryan handed the majority to the Democrats, well, the President faced an even higher wall of resistance. A lame old border deal was announced right before the President took to the stage in El Paso last night, and by the morning, the details started trickling in."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, that won't happen though, not unless the President finds the money elsewhere or declares a national emergency, which will immediately be challenged of course by the left in court. And tonight, after speaking with one of the Republican architects, Richard Shelby, Senator from Alabama with the latest deal, the President tweeted, \"Was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal by hard working Senator Richard Shelby. Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources. Will be getting almost $23 billion for border security. Regardless of wall money, it is being built as we speak.\" We'll get into that in a little bit. But - so what's in this deal? What's really in it? The official language hasn't fully been released. And I love this. We're doing at the last minute, trying to rush it through. But here are some of the basics of the deal, as reported. $1.375 billion for barriers that are not called but look a heck of a lot like the steel slanted structure, the barrier that Trump had already approved. Second, an average daily cap of 40,520 beds for detaining illegals. Now, that's almost 9,000 fewer than we're detaining now. But Trump would have the authority to boost that number, pulling the money from other sources. Now, there's more to it, too. But it's simple to see what's going on here. The Democrats' ultimate goal is to codify catch and release, where if an illegal makes it into the country, he or she will be welcome to stay along with any child he or she brings with them across the border. Now what does this do? I mean, this is not a difficult concept, right? It only encourages more illegal immigration. Now, remember, the President asks for $25 billion last year for the wall and a bunch of other reforms as well that made a lot of sense. But the Dems wouldn't budge on issues like chain migration or those diversity visas. They wouldn't go near it. Then in December - now, moving into lame duck session, he asked for one- fifth of that. I'm still pretty good at math sort of. It's $5 billion of the $25 billion. Now, he perhaps thought that this would become some type of annual wall expenditure. Well, fat chance. They don't want a call. They never wanted a wall. But on the bright side - and I have to look at the glass half-full here. The current deal does expose just how far left the Democrat Party has gone on the issue of illegal immigration. They've gone from this--"

Remember this gem that when Congressman O'Rourke sent out in 2015. It read, \"Tear down this wall.\" Oh, boy! That's a keeper. Well, I can tell you that the people we met in El Paso last night, they disagreed vehemently. And an under-reported fact is that about half of the audience at the Trump rally were themselves Hispanic. And they most certainly do not want the wall between the cartel-run Juarez and El Paso torn down. No way. They love their peaceful community. It was a really fun place to be.

And there's a lot of other great news as well that would be distracted from if this thing continued in a shutdown form, including the China negotiations going on right now in Beijing.

I was just down in the Rio Grande Valley last week and visiting with Border Patrol, where we see 400,000 people that are going to be streaming across the Rio Grande Valley this year. Of them, 200,000 will not even be apprehended. And of the 200,000 who are, 90 percent will be caught and released like you know because we allow judicially created catch-and- release to govern our border security. The cartels have operational control of our border. It's time for us to do our job. And this deal isn't doing our job. $1.375 billion is the baseline. We need to get the money that is necessary so the border patrol aren't down on the border, without the radio signals they need, without the ability to have the fencing to stop the flow.

And I want to quote it for you, Congressman. \"The bill was still being written tonight, Tuesday night, and lawmakers from both parties were pushing to include a number of favored provisions.\" Those are called pork provisions. Well, \"Some Democrats wanted to add language that would provide back-pay to federal contractors who were caught in the middle of the recent shutdown, but it's unclear if lawmakers would be successful in getting the provision included.\" Now, I'm hearing tonight that that could destroy any possibility of this thing even going forward, but people have to understand, we don't even have the language yet and we know stuff gets slipped in, Congressman McClintock, at the last minute.

And the things we're not talking about are the extent to which the cartels have literal operational control of our border. Tamaulipas, the state just across the Rio Grande Valley, is a level-four state. It's a danger zone. We're not allowed to travel. We're not supposed to travel.

When they talk about moving money around, we do that every year. The last three years I've been in D.C., (inaudible) pulled their money every year but one. And they never funded ICE at an appropriate level. And they say you move money wrong. What does that mean? It means taking money from the Coast Guard, taking money from FEMA, taking money from the Secret Service. It's ridiculous because they have missions too that are very important. Fund is at the level it's supposed to be funded. ICE asked for 52,000 beds and justified it on paper because right now they're holding 49 and they're releasing people as it is because they don't have enough beds. You said it yourself.

And Democratic consultants I've talked to have talked about shifting. They're shifting away from solid support for Israel. You saw what happened with the Iran deal, and it was so surprising to see so few Democratic voices stand up against that deal. They really pretty much folded.

It's really hard for the viewers to get what either of you are saying when we are talking over one another. Other than interrupting you, I don't know how to get -- but I think I got the point from both of you and I really appreciate the fac that you both came on. We'll be covering this. We want to try to be fair about it. The left, by the way, has told us that we aren't allowed to talk about the need for immigrants to assimilate into the American culture. That, too, is racist. That is especially as it relates to the public school system. The question is, why is assimilation even in the school system now controversial? The reason is simple, but grossly punitive. They wish to inoculate the entire public school system in the United States and thus the powerful teachers unions from criticism, even if it means a diminished product for the kids. The Center for Immigration Studies recently found 700 immigrant saturated school districts where half of the new students are from immigrant households. Quote \"The number of children from immigrant households and schools is now so high in some areas that it raises profound questions about assimilation. Immigration has added enormously to the number of public school students who are in poverty and the number who speak a foreign language. This cannot help but to create significant challenges for schools often in areas already struggling to educate students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.\" Joining us now is the man behind this study, Steve Camerota from the Center for Immigration Studies. Steve, now, people are going to say the fact that we are even talking about this is meanspirited and it's anti-Hispanic, and I will say, we are calling you on your you know what if you say that, because this is about kids and learning and the wonders of America. So what do the public education folks, they don't seem to care about this, they don't seem to understand the enormity of the problem? What going on?"

But it doesn't answer the fundamental question of how many people should we let in the country? How do we enforce our immigration laws against illegal immigration? There are about one out of every four kids in public school today is from an immigrant family. About one-third of all the kids in poverty in public school today are from an immigrant family. Even in a state like Minnesota, you are looking at about 49 percent of all the kids in public school in poverty, I should say 40 percent, of all the kids in public school in poverty in the state of Minnesota come from an immigrant family. So these are important questions. A more moderate pace of immigration, enforcing our laws, a more moderate pace of legal immigration, these things would tend to take a lot of pressure off of public schools, making it easier to educate the kids already here, which I think most people agree is important."

During the last great wave, for example, of immigration around 1900, there was much great consensus among our elites, including our public schools, including the people who ran the public schools in the big cities where the immigrants settled, that there was an idea that we should Americanize immigrants. And that doesn't just mean that they learn English, though incredibly important, it also means that they come to identify with their country, come to see America's founding as the founding of their country as well and not see that is something that dead white men did. The other thing is the numbers are so big. One of the ways immigration assimilation works is that immigrants and their kids interact with so many kids from native backgrounds so that assimilation becomes kind of a foregone conclusion. But in many places, most of the kids are from immigrant backgrounds."

But, Ronald Reagan in his final address to the American people as president talked about the need to teach history, the important moments in American history so we can all understand. Thanks so much, Steve. And it isn't just Republicans knocking down the Russian collusion narratives. Wait until you're here with the Democrats have now revealed. Charade, up next."

This has never happened to -- the Democrats know it's a hoax. This is a political game. So now the Russia thing is dead."

      "utterance": "President Trump noting in my exclusive interview last night that Republicans on the Senate Intel Committee have found zero Russian collusion. But what about the Democrats? NBC News revealing -- they didn't want to do it today -- that after two years and 200 interviews and your tax dollars wasted, even they had to admit, quote, let's read it, \"uncovered no direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.\" Here now to discuss, Sol Wisenberg, former deputy independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and FOX News contributor. Sol, how different might Mueller's conclusions be, however, from the Senate Intel Committee's report?"

      "speaker": "SOLOMON WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, WHITEWATER",
      "utterance": "I don't think that will be any different at all. You have to remember he has far more power, far more investigative power, subpoena power, power to compel witnesses than the Senate does, and he has got a very highly-trained, professional staff with him. And it has been very clear to knowledgeable observers for quite some time that he did not have that case. And the reason you can tell is by looking at the various plea agreements that have been signed by people who have pled guilty. They are all crimes either that have nothing to do with Trump and the collusion conspiracy, or they have to do with lying to Mueller. So I think that there's nothing surprising whatsoever about this, just surprising the way Congressman Schiff tried to spin it."

I want to play something for you. This is from John Brennan, and we'll talk about it on the other side. Let's watch."

There were engagements at the Trump Tower. There were the back and forth between the various individuals who were affiliated campaign and Russian individuals. That collusion I think it's quite obvious and apparent."

      "utterance": "Now by the way, that is Brennan from today. The man is unhinged and has lied multiple times before Congress. Byron, I've heard a lot, but that pretty much took the cake. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Brennan's comments have always been really irresponsible because any reasonable listener might conclude that he was using secret information that he had as head of the CIA that other people didn't have and that was somehow informing his comments and made them more reliable. But this new Richard Burr thing, the new report about Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee I think has really rattling a lot of members of the resistance because it came on the heels of reports we've been hearing about Mueller, his investigation not finding any sort of collusion. And I think together, that has been the spur for all this talk that we are hearing in the House about doing their own investigation, because you have to remember, most House Democrats were depending on Mueller to give them the roadmap and the cover they needed for impeachment. And now they are thinking, well, what if he doesn't. We've got to do it ourselves. So you're hearing more about more and and more House investigations."

Now, who knows, Byron, you've noted this, who knows if that's the case or not. But I want to get back to how this -- and he calls it a witch hunt and everyone gets all upset. This thing was started on a fraud. There was no crime. It was an investigation in search of a crime. I know Bob Mueller, everyone says he's the best guy ever, give him the Nobel prize for being the best guy ever, fine. But this investigation started on a total fraud. And the fact that this president has had to deal with this for the last two years, imagine what he had accomplished had he not had this. Sol, maybe you disagree."

Most from California, Colorado, Canada, even Mexico along with some Texans. The Women's March helped organize both this protest march and rally. So it was a mixed bag, kind of an anti-Trump crowded with the hardcore remnants of O'Rourke's failed senatorial run. We talked to some of those assembled about Beto's primary critique of the wall.

And from 2010 to 2018, the amount of drugs seized in El Paso was halved, cut in half. So you have to have an honest debate here. And you see the conflict.
