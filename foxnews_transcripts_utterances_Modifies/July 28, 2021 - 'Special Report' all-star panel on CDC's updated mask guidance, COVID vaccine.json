We have been through all of this. A lot of people got vaccinated, and now here we are again because of this variant. JONAH GOLDBERG, \"THE DISPATCH\": Yes. I have to say I'm infuriated by all of it. I think that this is a terrible idea. It is -- it is an example of how badly handled this has been, not just by government officials and local officials, but also big swaths of the American people. I know the media likes to focus on how there are Republican vaccine hesitant people out there, and statistically that's definitely true. But in pure number terms, the biggest problems with the unvaccinated or the vaccine hesitant are in major urban areas that didn't overwhelmingly vote by Trump by any measure, and also places like public schools, or New York City public schools. Something like 40 percent of the public teachers haven't been vaccinated. It is scandalous that people haven't taken this more seriously, and I am furious what this is going to do to kids as we backslide into this mask stuff.",

It's really weird, too, because actually there's a way of looking at this that things have gone well. I understand that there is a variant that is increasing the cases, but you are looking at hospitalizations and deaths that are a much better situation than we had last year. You have 89 percent of the elderly population vaccinated. You have had a great success story. And it seems that this idea of coercion and mandates and lockdowns are clearly not about science.

A lot of people think that's a logical way to go. And Biden has been very cautious about doings it. To recommend it, require it for the Veterans Administration given that they are hospital organization primarily is a pretty logical application of the rule. But I'm struck, actually, by how nonaggressive he is being on mandates in terms of vaccinations. As I have said before, I would like to see more thought given to incentivizing. Governor Jared Polis of Colorado has a really interesting program they just started last week, give people $100 gift cards when they get vaccinated. That, too, there is controversy about that.
