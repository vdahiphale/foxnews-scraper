It's 5 o'clock here at Fox Square in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert, it's decision day in America. Control of Congress is up for grabs as millions of Americans cast their ballots in what's shaping up to be historic midterm elections. The first polls are closing in less than two hours from now. We'll also tell you about the key toss-up races to keep an eye on tonight.  Plus, we're debuting our brand-new Fox News voter analysis results. We have a lot of ground to cover this hour. Jesse is getting rained on, so let's bring in Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum who are co-anchoring tonight's special election coverage. They're there in the studio at the election headquarters. How is it going tonight, Martha?  MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST, \"THE STORY\": So far, so good, Dana. We're waiting for that data to come in. And it's going to be a whole new ball game with this information that we have, 125,000 people polled. Exit polls used to be about 25,000.  BRET BAIER, ANCHOR, \"SPECIAL REPORT\": And so, it's over five days. And you look at the early voting totals, more than 38 million Americans have either early voted or absentee ballots. And you're looking at probably historic early voting. And we might be looking at historic midterm voting before we get to the end of the night.",

Traditionally, historically, the party in power loses anywhere from 25 to 33 seats in a midterm election.  This could be different. It could be, obviously, more than that in a blue wave.

Waiting for the president to get into his election watching evening, which he's going to be doing. He has invited family and some friends over to watch some of the early results. The president believing that there's nothing else he could have done to pull Republicans across the finish line since Labor Day. He's had 13 rallies, did 11 in 8 states over the last six days. And pretty much has said that's all I can do. But he did work the phones today, was working twitter as well. So now they just have to sit back and see the results.  But the feeling around here is they'll probably net pick up a couple of seats in the senate, so they'll maintain control of the senate and extend their margin. A big question around here tonight, what happens in the house? The predictions are that the Democrats are going to take control of the house. But a lot of people remember that this time in 2016, we were getting briefings and how all the exit polls showed that we're probably going to declare Hillary Clinton the winner of the presidency. About 11 o'clock at night, and then everything started to turn around. At about 9 o'clock in the evening, and they're wondering if that might be the case again in 2018. All the projections would seem to suggest that that won't happen. Here at the White House, they're holding out hope for may be a minor miracle sometime this evening. I don't know if they'll get it, Jesse.  But there's no question, you heard Martha and Bret talking about it, so much enthusiasm in this midterm election, which is so unusual, so many people coming out in early voting and a lot of people coming out today to vote, despite the weather.

So it was, you're going to hurt the kid with cancer, you're going to hurt the grandmother who needs those special operation. So it's back to the scare tactics on Obamacare. That's the main say. That's the one policy they really focus on. The separation of the kids at the border, I don't think most people are going to vote on that. But they -- that was the one issue I think that they honed in on that might deliver some dividends.  However, I think most of the resistance voters out there are resisting the tone of Trump. They're resisting, as Greg said, his personality. It's like they're putting blinders on of all the greatness. There's never a better time to be an American than today. I think in my lifetime, even during Reagan. This is just -- if you want to work, you're going to work.  If you want to make a better living and you follow the rules, you don't, you know, go to jail or something, you're going to get -- make a better living if you want that.  But the left is so jacked to send a bad -- send a message to the president that, oh, no, we're not going to be fool again. We were embarrassed in 2016. We're going to embarrass you now. It's personal with the left. And Republicans are about -- sometimes about charts and numbers and GDP. The storytelling -- the art of the storytelling sometimes is lost on Republicans. Maybe if it doesn't go the way that the Republicans want, they can learn a little bit about the storytelling of this great recovery.",

And a lot of the Republicans that decided to retire were in districts that Hillary Clinton won by a little bit, maybe like you're looking at Dean Heller in his race. That's not a district. That's a whole state of Nevada. But I think that -- the fact that there're some good candidates recruitment on the Republican side does help them. There was some good -- on the Democratic side in the house, in particularly, 172 veterans are running for congress right now, so some of them are going to win.  And there's going to be some new energy. And there might be some willingness by some of these people to actually work together. Let's just say that the Democrats take back the house, are they going to deny working with President Trump on an infrastructure bill that they have wanted for a long time? Will they deny an immigration deal that the president might offer to them? Will they deny an opportunity to go against price control for pharmaceutical companies, which is not a conservative position but something that the White House is pushing forward.

And Trump does make a great target. He's a law & order guy, defending the process behind borders, national and domestic security. It's one word, boundaries. Boundaries exist to frame the path toward a goal.  Wyoming without fences is just another chunk of the planet. That fence is -- and you get order and logic. You need them for a country's identity.  And you need them as laws, which allow people to lead free lives without harm. What's the problem? Well, any law & order stance becomes heartless because the left separates the process, which is enforcing laws from the results which is creating order. So, military, cops, ICE, they're just big meanies. It's childish to pretend that laws don't lead to better lives, but it works. So today votes it's about adults versus those with a teenage view of the world. And even though the kids know that without grown-ups, they'd be dead. Who cares?

We're talking with more than 130,000 Americans all across the country, so let's jump in. First of all, the economy. Now, most voters feel it is an excellent or good shape, 65 percent. That's great for incumbents out there. Now on the issue of immigration. Such a hot topic in the final days of campaigning. Views are divided on the border wall. Forty-six percent say they favor it; 53 percent say they oppose it. On Obamacare, the views are even more closely divided. Half want to repeal at least part of the law. Half would keep it all in place and even expand it. All right, next up, lots of Republicans complaining about the P.C. culture these days. Two-thirds of voters agree. They feel the pressure to be politically correct. They say that it has gone too far. Republicans are nearly twice as likely as Democrats to feel that way. Now, last one. We've heard the Democrats talk a lot about voter I.D. laws, how they can be used for suppression, in their estimation. So we asked nonvoters, \"Why aren't you getting out and voting this year?\" And many of them say they're not into politics. They don't like the candidates. At the bottom of the list, though, there is a percentage that says they don't have identification, about three percent. Now, all night long, we'll have a lots more voter analysis through the evening. State-by-state, we'll be able to dig into individual races and issues throughout the night as those polls start to close. Guys, back to you.",

And it was Republicans' responsibility to make their alternative clear, even if John McCain was going to go and vote against it at the last minute. I don't think the American people, I don't think Paul Ryan, I don't think the Senate leadership really made this clear. I think that was a missed opportunity.

That's fantastic. On Obamacare, we've heard for years how Obamacare is even more popular now.  And everybody loves Obamacare. In fact, a majority, although slight, wants it repealed. And then the P.C. culture, overwhelmingly people reject P.C. culture. And we've been all hearing for years about how we have to be so sensitive and walk around on eggshells with everything you say and hear. Look at that.  That's not where the American middle is. And I would just finally close with this. The white working men and women of this country, the working-class, blue-collar voters, that is the Trump base. They usually swing elections. Those are the people that Clinton got, Bush got, Obama got, and then Trump recaptured with his trade, immigration, and un-P.C. narrative in 2016.

We'll also tell you about the key toss-up races to keep an eye on tonight. Plus, we're debuting our brand-new Fox News voter analysis results. We have a lot of ground to cover this hour. Jesse is getting rained on, so let's bring in Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum who are co-anchoring tonight's special election coverage. They're there in the studio at the election headquarters. How is it going tonight, Martha? MARTHA MACCALLUM, HOST, \"THE STORY\": So far, so good, Dana. We're waiting for that data to come in. And it's going to be a whole new ball game with this information that we have, 125,000 people polled. Exit polls used to be about 25,000.

And, right now, when you look at his numbers, it's about 40, 41, 42 percent approval. And for a president at that standing, historically, you're going to lose seats about 30 plus. Do you have any sense right now what the margin might be in the house?"

It's going to start scrolling different states and different facts and figures coming from this voter analysis that we've been doing.  But we don't, Juan. And you're right. Traditionally, historically, the party in power loses anywhere from 25 to 33 seats in a midterm election.  This could be different. It could be, obviously, more than that in a blue wave. And, you know, the caveats is it could fall short of the 23. One thing is clear, there is a weakness in the rust belt and that may for the GOP, and maybe tied to some of the tariff situations and some of the backlash for that particular policy."

So it's very possible that those 30 seats are like a rest stop on the freeway to Trump-ville. It's like a temporary oasis. There's no getting around it.

Waiting for the president to get into his election watching evening, which he's going to be doing. He has invited family and some friends over to watch some of the early results. The president believing that there's nothing else he could have done to pull Republicans across the finish line since Labor Day. He's had 13 rallies, did 11 in 8 states over the last six days. And pretty much has said that's all I can do. But he did work the phones today, was working twitter as well. So now they just have to sit back and see the results. But the feeling around here is they'll probably net pick up a couple of seats in the senate, so they'll maintain control of the senate and extend their margin. A big question around here tonight, what happens in the house? The predictions are that the Democrats are going to take control of the house. But a lot of people remember that this time in 2016, we were getting briefings and how all the exit polls showed that we're probably going to declare Hillary Clinton the winner of the presidency. About 11 o'clock at night, and then everything started to turn around. At about 9 o'clock in the evening, and they're wondering if that might be the case again in 2018. All the projections would seem to suggest that that won't happen. Here at the White House, they're holding out hope for may be a minor miracle sometime this evening. I don't know if they'll get it, Jesse.  But there's no question, you heard Martha and Bret talking about it, so much enthusiasm in this midterm election, which is so unusual, so many people coming out in early voting and a lot of people coming out today to vote, despite the weather. So we'll see. It's going to be an interesting night."

Do you see, right now, with no recession, no scandal, hot economy, do you see any reason substantively for Republicans to lose the house?"

      "utterance": "I mean, I think when you look at these ads across the country, and I've had a chance to travel across the country a lot in the last three or four weeks, there is one issue that they did focus on and its health care. So it was, you're going to hurt the kid with cancer, you're going to hurt the grandmother who needs those special operation. So it's back to the scare tactics on Obamacare. That's the main say. That's the one policy they really focus on. The separation of the kids at the border, I don't think most people are going to vote on that. But they -- that was the one issue I think that they honed in on that might deliver some dividends. However, I think most of the resistance voters out there are resisting the tone of Trump. They're resisting, as Greg said, his personality. It's like they're putting blinders on of all the greatness. There's never a better time to be an American than today. I think in my lifetime, even during Reagan. This is just -- if you want to work, you're going to work.  If you want to make a better living and you follow the rules, you don't, you know, go to jail or something, you're going to get -- make a better living if you want that. But the left is so jacked to send a bad -- send a message to the president that, oh, no, we're not going to be fool again. We were embarrassed in 2016. We're going to embarrass you now. It's personal with the left. And Republicans are about -- sometimes about charts and numbers and GDP. The storytelling -- the art of the storytelling sometimes is lost on Republicans. Maybe if it doesn't go the way that the Republicans want, they can learn a little bit about the storytelling of this great recovery."

It really is a majority vote. And in these congressional districts, some of them are very close. And a lot of the Republicans that decided to retire were in districts that Hillary Clinton won by a little bit, maybe like you're looking at Dean Heller in his race. That's not a district. That's a whole state of Nevada. But I think that -- the fact that there're some good candidates recruitment on the Republican side does help them. There was some good -- on the Democratic side in the house, in particularly, 172 veterans are running for congress right now, so some of them are going to win. And there's going to be some new energy. And there might be some willingness by some of these people to actually work together. Let's just say that the Democrats take back the house, are they going to deny working with President Trump on an infrastructure bill that they have wanted for a long time? Will they deny an immigration deal that the president might offer to them? Will they deny an opportunity to go against price control for pharmaceutical companies, which is not a conservative position but something that the White House is pushing forward. So I think a lot remains to be seen. It's not the worst thing in the world for anyone to have a midterm as Greg was saying. It's like a -- it's a way station."

And Trump does make a great target. He's a law & order guy, defending the process behind borders, national and domestic security. It's one word, boundaries. Boundaries exist to frame the path toward a goal.  Wyoming without fences is just another chunk of the planet. That fence is -- and you get order and logic. You need them for a country's identity.  And you need them as laws, which allow people to lead free lives without harm. What's the problem? Well, any law & order stance becomes heartless because the left separates the process, which is enforcing laws from the results which is creating order. So, military, cops, ICE, they're just big meanies. It's childish to pretend that laws don't lead to better lives, but it works. So today votes it's about adults versus those with a teenage view of the world. And even though the kids know that without grown-ups, they'd be dead. Who cares? Because the adults will always be around, hurting feelings, making rules and posing limits. Making life possible. Kids just have a hard time forgiving grown-ups for making life impossible.

      "utterance": "All right, Juan, as you all have talked about earlier, we are using a new, innovative approach this year to find out what is motivating voters? Fox News Voter Analysis. We're talking with more than 130,000 Americans all across the country, so let's jump in. First of all, the economy. Now, most voters feel it is an excellent or good shape, 65 percent. That's great for incumbents out there. Now on the issue of immigration. Such a hot topic in the final days of campaigning. Views are divided on the border wall. Forty-six percent say they favor it; 53 percent say they oppose it. On Obamacare, the views are even more closely divided. Half want to repeal at least part of the law. Half would keep it all in place and even expand it. All right, next up, lots of Republicans complaining about the P.C. culture these days. Two-thirds of voters agree. They feel the pressure to be politically correct. They say that it has gone too far. Republicans are nearly twice as likely as Democrats to feel that way. Now, last one. We've heard the Democrats talk a lot about voter I.D. laws, how they can be used for suppression, in their estimation. So we asked nonvoters, \"Why aren't you getting out and voting this year?\" And many of them say they're not into politics. They don't like the candidates. At the bottom of the list, though, there is a percentage that says they don't have identification, about three percent. Now, all night long, we'll have a lots more voter analysis through the evening. State-by-state, we'll be able to dig into individual races and issues throughout the night as those polls start to close. Guys, back to you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think on health care, I'm going to go back to that for a moment. I think, again, the storytelling on what Republicans were going to do with health care was really lame. I don't think they explained it well to the American people. I don't think a lot of people still understand what Obamacare actually does. And it was Republicans' responsibility to make their alternative clear, even if John McCain was going to go and vote against it at the last minute. I don't think the American people, I don't think Paul Ryan, I don't think the Senate leadership really made this clear. I think that was a missed opportunity. Today, most people don't know that the Democrats do have a plan for health care. It's called Medicare for all, and it will cost about $32 trillion to implement. Thirty two -- people get what that is."

People don't want a speech code from college campuses foisted upon American society. It's too much, it's too repressive, it's too anti- free speech. That is Trump. That's the Trump effect. Not everything's racist; not everything's anti-Semitic. There are some things that are racist, and there are some things that are anti-Semitic at that should be called out. But not everything someone says or not everything on television that disagrees with your point of view is racist.  I think that is an interesting barometer of where we are today."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It's evenly split. I think a lot of maybe even Republicans that don't want the wall, don't like the cost of it, or are more business friendly. But if Republicans look at those numbers from that analysis that we just showed, I think they come away with a positive afterglow. If you look at the economy, two-thirds are very satisfied. That's fantastic. On Obamacare, we've heard for years how Obamacare is even more popular now.  And everybody loves Obamacare. In fact, a majority, although slight, wants it repealed. And then the P.C. culture, overwhelmingly people reject P.C. culture. And we've been all hearing for years about how we have to be so sensitive and walk around on eggshells with everything you say and hear. Look at that.  That's not where the American middle is. And I would just finally close with this. The white working men and women of this country, the working-class, blue-collar voters, that is the Trump base. They usually swing elections. Those are the people that Clinton got, Bush got, Obama got, and then Trump recaptured with his trade, immigration, and un-P.C. narrative in 2016. Whether those white working- class voters stay with the Republican Party, because they're not cemented down at all, I think that's going to be the key to the election."

Like, you get a choice. So I think that the number, the 65 percent of people saying the economy is wrong, if the president can find a way to make these gains durable for the next 18 months, his reelection is probably in pretty good shape."

Voters in Wake County, North Carolina, struggled to get certain voting machines working and their ballots. And here is what Wake County Board of Elections Director Gary Sims said was at the root of the problem."

The machines have been in place since 2006, and they're reportedly going to be replaced after this election. It's raining outside in New York, and we women generally don't like humidity, and neither do certain voting machines."
