And tonight, there are a lot of new salvos flying back and forth. Good evening, I'm Martha MacCallum.  So, tonight, The New York Times and the Washington Post breaking stories that add new layers to the ammunition against the president, and there is pushback from the administration. We are going to break it all down for you and help you navigate the incoming here so that you can see what is going on, on all sides.  Also tonight, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call with the Ukrainian president, which raises questions that no doubt will be put to Secretary of State Pompeo about his interpretation of that phone call.  So, all of this fuel for the fire as Democrats are ramping up their timeline, hoping perhaps to be done with this impeachment process even by the end of this year.",

So, when asked if the push to impeach is based on facts or is it based on partisan politics, 56 percent said the latter. Let's bring in Ronna McDaniel, exclusively tonight chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. Ronna, good to have you here.   Obviously, your job is to look, you know, up and down the chain, from the White House, all the way through the Senate to Congress, if there is a vote to impeach in the House. And then, that moves to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader McConnell has said he will take that up. Which means he would put it into the process on the Senate side.

But now, they want to have a government takeover of elections. And they want to negate the voices and the votes of the American people that elected Donald Trump.   They've done it for three years, there is no there, there. There is nothing that rises to the level of high creams crimes and misdemeanors. I don't think this will go anywhere in the Senate.

A cabinet position in a Democratic administration. No word of Al Franken has issued a comment about the new allegation.

There are things such as licensing agreements where all the players are able to gain some sort of revenue from whether it's video games or whatever that may be.

We are going to break it all down for you and help you navigate the incoming here so that you can see what is going on, on all sides. Also tonight, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call with the Ukrainian president, which raises questions that no doubt will be put to Secretary of State Pompeo about his interpretation of that phone call.

So, when asked if the push to impeach is based on facts or is it based on partisan politics, 56 percent said the latter. Let's bring in Ronna McDaniel, exclusively tonight chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. Ronna, good to have you here. Obviously, your job is to look, you know, up and down the chain, from the White House, all the way through the Senate to Congress, if there is a vote to impeach in the House. And then, that moves to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader McConnell has said he will take that up. Which means he would put it into the process on the Senate side.

But now, they want to have a government takeover of elections. And they want to negate the voices and the votes of the American people that elected Donald Trump. They've done it for three years, there is no there, there. There is nothing that rises to the level of high creams crimes and misdemeanors. I don't think this will go anywhere in the Senate.

This is just another attempt by Democrats to overturn the election. They didn't like Donald Trump being elected. They did the Mueller report that didn't go anywhere, and now, they're rushing to judgment on this. They even started the impeachment inquiry before they read the transcript, before the I.G. report.

And to tear that will away, we're going to talk more about that with Bill Bennett in just a moment. Now, with regard to Texas, which is, you know, a state that -- you know the Democrats feel maybe could come into their -- you know, into their arms a bit. Today, Mac Thornberry became the sixth Texas Republican to announce that he is not seeking re-election in 2020. This is what Nancy Pelosi said about turning Texas blue."

Listen, Democrats want to turn everything in their favor. They've talked about getting rid of the Electoral College, changing the voting age to 16, stacking the Supreme Court, and now, they're trying to overturn an election through Congress to this ridiculous impeachment inquiry. What I'm going to say to Nancy Pelosi is we're coming for these Democrats in districts where President Trump won. We're starting an ad campaign. Many of these Democrats said they wouldn't vote for a Nancy Pelosi, they lied to their constituents that way, and now they said -- and then, they said, we're going to go work with Republicans or work with this president. And now they're backing this phony impeachment inquiry.

We're seeing massive enthusiasm our volunteers are energized. They recognize what the Democrat party is doing. And I think, in the end, it's going to help us win the election. But it's sad for our country, it's sad that Nancy jumped the gun, it's sad to see Adam Schiff come out and make a false statement, and make a fictional opening statement as something is serious as an impeachment inquiry. This is not what the American people want. They want Washington to work for them. President Trump's done that day in and day out and Democrats all they have done is obstruct, resist, and now, try to investigate.

What happened is Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate, she didn't show up in our state and she didn't have a message that resonates.

And now they say that they are in fear for their safety. The President says he believes for his part that he deserves to be able to face his accuser but there were others who tipped off the whistleblower, as I said. And then you have these new leaks about the Australian Prime Minister's conversation. So who is talking about that and putting all of this out into the atmosphere? And what about the two calls back at the beginning of the administration with foreign leaders? These are important questions.

I'm sure there's a -- you know, I've been hanging out -- I'm hanging out with cops all the time with DEA in D.C and in Virginia, you know, you get around the bar. I have no doubt that this guy is the deep state guy in the sense that he's part of the permanent government. And I think they what he has done is extremely destructive. And for him to now worry about his identity being revealed going to witness protection, you're threatening the presidency for only the third time in 243 years, this is a big deal.

And the new accusations are coming in, while the old accusations are still being dealt with. For example, Al Franken says the reason he stepped down from the Senate instead of defending himself against several allegations of sexual misconduct, is because he was put in a, quote, \"untenable situation,\" saying he was under tremendous pressure and did not have a choice.

Franken's ninth accuser says back in 2006 when she was photographed with Franken at a political fund-raiser, he repeatedly squeezed her buttocks. The woman claims the reason she didn't initially tell anyone is out of embarrassment and eventually decided making the accusation might hurt her chances of getting her dream job. A cabinet position in a Democratic administration. No word of Al Franken has issued a comment about the new allegation. And speaking of new accusers, Ronan Farrell who wrote many of the Me Too stories is out with a new book on October 15th and it includes a group of women who make new sexual harassment claims against former Today Show host Matt Lauer. The exact number of ne accusers is unclear but the woman whose initial complaint to NBC led to Matt Lauer getting fired is also coming forward in the book to tell her story.

We also know that there are adults and as adults they should be afforded the life any other adults have which is to profit off of their notoriety profit, off of their ability whether that's from signing autographs or from getting endorsements from jersey sales or whatever that may be. I think this is a step in the right direction. And also, I think that obviously it's going to take some time for this to become law. But this could set a new standard that I think it's beneficial for the NCAA, and also beneficial for the athletes."

What happens in that relationship? I spoke to a former college NFL player today, you know, who basically said, look, they get a huge stage across America during these four years, and they get an education, a college education. And that is the trade-off and that's what has worked for so long. What do you say?"

      "utterance": "Well, he's right and that's what has worked or that's what has been the status quo. But we all, Americans are interested in increasing and bettering things. And so, as the revenue goes, I mean, you know, obviously colleges and the NFL, but when you look posted salaries, many of them rival those in the NFL. When you look at the states, (Inaudible) many of the rivals when you look at revenues. It's all pass for the same thing. And so, in my opinion these are the rules in college football but what it does do is, it allows athletes to capitalize. And you mention the guys who are on the team that maybe don't play that maybe don't have the notoriety of some of the higher profile players. There are things such as licensing agreements where all the players are able to gain some sort of revenue from whether it's video games or whatever that may be. There are ways to allow the masses of players whatever sport they're in to receive something from this type of the law. But also allows us players that a(Inaudible) to pursue, hey, everybody who is going to join the stadium even though they had their name, it has their number you know who's jersey it is, it's their place for them to actually capitalize more so. I think we can approach both of them and we can look out for the players, as you mentioned that may not be as popular as the other."

I mean, the NCAA is saying, you know, maybe California won't be able to compete, as part of the NCAA anymore because they have separate rules. What's the impact from that? WATSON Well, I think that's why we're seeing that this law won't take place until maybe four years from now. There are some kinks to work out obviously, but I think that California is taking a step in the right direction. My hope is that other states and other conferences will follow suit before now and then. I know there's a lot of conversation that needed to be had but the NCAA would have meet. The NCAA would have meet that there needs to be something done."

I think the merits are on one side and the demerits on the other. I think the Democrats have decided this is what they want to do. A priori before any facts are in. I think that was proved, Martha, by Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi announcing they were going to go ahead with this before the transcript was even out. So, I don't think they are playing fair at all. Nevertheless, the fact is the country is divided. This now seems to be a pattern at least occurs every so often too frequently in presidential terms now. The country is torn, it's driven. A friend of mine, Allen Guelzo, who teaches at Gettysburg and Princeton said he doesn't think there's a -- the country has been so torn and divided since the Civil War. And I think that may be true. I'm hoping that it's just the political elites, that is just the political types and the people who were deeply engaged in politics who were feeling this way. If you are engaged in politics, as I am, it's hard not to feel this way. Because the sense that, you know, a terrible thing is being done. But the rest of the country as a question and I fear that a lot of this is spreading to the rest of the country. You get reports from neighborhoods around the country that these kinds of division are real. A realtor tell me, people say, well, this is a conservative or a liberal neighborhood?"

It's not the sober and difficult, and I think a lot of us felt very trying times of the Nixon time. And even somewhat in the Clinton times.

Look, the secret of democracy is courage and paying attention. And people need to pay attention to this. It's a fearful time.
