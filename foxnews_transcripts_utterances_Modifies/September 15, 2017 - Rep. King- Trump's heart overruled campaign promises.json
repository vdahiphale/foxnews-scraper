      "sentences": "Hi, Martha. It looks like this one is dissipating at the moment. You can you see the police line; they've just backed all the way up across Clark Street. And can you see the building there next to right now is the police headquarters itself? There was a bit of a dust-up earlier. I can show you some. This is a piece of concrete that the demonstrators were using to flake off pieces of it, turn that into the rocks and they threw that at the police. Some bottles, mostly plastic bottles, I didn't see any glass bottles that went out.  Now, to show you the demonstrators. You've got a few still milling around in the middle of the street. Most of them have gone about a quarter mile down the road. Now, the dust-up started about an hour ago when the demonstrators came and mass up the street. They went in front of police headquarters. And you've got some tape of this. They climbed aboard on one of the police SUVs, started jumping up and down. In the end, the windshield was broken out of the police SUV. And ultimately, the police came with a little bit more force. We saw the cops with the riot gear and pepper spray came out. A few bits of pushing and shoving melees.  And again, you had the rocks and bottles going out. Pepper spray came out. If you look at some the demonstrators, you'll see them now with white on their faces. I'll point them out when they come out, and that he was because -- we see them. And that's because after they get pepper sprayed they believe they can minimize the sting of that pepper spray by putting a combination milk and Maalox over their faces. So, at the moment, it looks like this situation is diffusing, but a lot of intel that there's going to be a lot throughout the night, Martha.",

When a bomb in a subway in London explodes at rush hour, injuring 29 people, most with burns, others with broken bones from being trampled and it becomes just another news story of the day. It is clear that what's been called the new normal is anything but. Prime Minister, Theresa May, is now a seasoned leader when it comes to this. It is the fifth terror attack on her watch in the United Kingdom this year, including these horrific scenes that we all remember too well from Manchester and from Westminster Bridge. She has raised her country's terror alert once again to the highest level; it is now at critical, which means the authority there believed that another attack in London could be imminent. May knows that this attack is not just a crime. It is a kind of cancer in the bloodstream and it needs to be eradicated.",

The Islamic State did take credit for this, saying the soldiers of the caliphate attack crusaders, detonating bombs. They are clearly ramping up their activities now as we squeeze the caliphate in Iraq and Syria. We're seeing these foreign fighters returning along with this massive migration into Europe.

I don't believe for a minute they're going to hit anything regarding Guam or the West Coast. I think it's all about them trying to push harder for appeasement for something from us. And this is where we need to depart, again, from the past tradition. We do have the military options, no doubt. But we have to hold accountable, Martha -- those nations which have been most pervasive and most effective in allowing the North Koreans to obtain the weapons, both the nuclear weapons, hydrogen bomb and delivery systems, and that is the Chinese. They are the ones holding the bag. I think we needed to look at economic sanctions against them and the Russians because of the Russians involvement, and also the Iranians -- there's been several credible reports talking about the Iranians essentially outsourcing their nuclear program, their ballistic missile program to the North Koreans paying for.

And so, as this thing begins to hockey stick up, we've got to ask ourselves a question: would we rather fight them now or we rather fight them later? And right now, we have the capability. Yes, nobody wants a war on the Korean Peninsula. But, at the same time, if we're employing our economic element of power, our diplomatic element of power, an informational element of power, and it's not getting the job done, then what we need to do is begin a noncombatant evacuation from South Korea, the Republic of Korea. And then, we need to begin to move rapid reaction forces like the 18th Airborne Corps, like the marine expeditionary force and air wing and begin to position them in the western Pacific so that there are teeth behind what we're saying. Because right now, what we have in place are forces that are pretty much already there. And we're saying these bellicose things, and I believe that we mean them.",

Manning then copied hundreds of thousands of documents, including intel assessments, classified conversations, and videos that purportedly showed civilians being shot and killed. The material was turned over to WikiLeaks and published in 2010. Manning was caught, arrested, and arraigned on 22 charges, saying in a statement, quote, I only wanted to help people. When I chose to disclose classified information, I did so out of a love for my country and a sense of duty for others. Clearly, others disagreed. Top military officials said the 700,000 plus documents put people's lives at risk, including some 900 Afghans helping U.S. troops whose names were not redacted. After being sentenced to 35 years, Manning announced he was transitioning to become female. Martha.",

But now, 29 senators, Democrat senators, have signed a letter to DeVos and they're defending the Obama-era policy writing, quote, the current guidance is critical to ensuring that schools understand and take seriously their responsibilities under the law. And we urge you to leave the current guidance in place. Rescinding the guidance would be a step in the wrong direction in addressing the national epidemic of campus sexual assault. We're going to explain this. Molly Hemmingway is senior editor for The Federalist, and Jessica Tarlov author of America in the age of Trump, both are Fox News contributors. So, basically, in 2011, the Obama administration office of civil rights issued a letter to college campuses across the country, and they basically said that conduct may constitute unlawful sexual harassment under title 9, even if the police do not have sufficient evidence of a criminal violation. And as a result of this, campuses really felt pressure because they could lose their federal funding if they didn't create sort of a quasi-campus court, which was made up of professors on campuses, and it said to them, OK, we're going to put these young people in front of you and you decide whether or not a sexual assault happened in the dorm room when both people were drunk, which is what happens in most of these cases or many of them. Molly, what do you think about what Betsy DeVos is doing here?",

I don't think many people who have looked at this issue would say that the guidance has turned out even as the people who put it out there intended. It ends up creating two sets of victims. On the one hand you have victims of sexual assault, who their attackers are kept out of the criminal justice system, just kept in colleges. And the most punishment that they get, for say, raping a student would be getting kicked out of college where they can go to another place and continue their actions. On the other hand, there is such a low standard of evidence required to achieve a conviction in these kangaroo courts that a lot of innocent people are being convicted and having their lives ruined because of this guidance. So it doesn't address the actual problem of sexual assault on campus, and it creates a whole new set of victims.",

And can you see the building there next to right now is the police headquarters itself? There was a bit of a dust-up earlier. I can show you some. This is a piece of concrete that the demonstrators were using to flake off pieces of it, turn that into the rocks and they threw that at the police. Some bottles, mostly plastic bottles, I didn't see any glass bottles that went out. Now, to show you the demonstrators. You've got a few still milling around in the middle of the street. Most of them have gone about a quarter mile down the road. Now, the dust-up started about an hour ago when the demonstrators came and mass up the street. They went in front of police headquarters. And you've got some tape of this. They climbed aboard on one of the police SUVs, started jumping up and down. In the end, the windshield was broken out of the police SUV. And ultimately, the police came with a little bit more force. We saw the cops with the riot gear and pepper spray came out. A few bits of pushing and shoving melees. And again, you had the rocks and bottles going out. Pepper spray came out. If you look at some the demonstrators, you'll see them now with white on their faces. I'll point them out when they come out, and that he was because -- we see them. And that's because after they get pepper sprayed they believe they can minimize the sting of that pepper spray by putting a combination milk and Maalox over their faces.

And I think in terms of the travel ban, I've always said we need to ramp up our vetting in high-threat areas to make sure that these terrorists, while they are going to Europe, they are one flight away from the United States, and we don't want them coming into the homeland."

So, I think that will be -- before the Supreme Court, and the executive and chief, the commander-in-chief, has enormous powers under the Constitution, I think, when it comes to immigration and denying terrorists a safe haven both abroad and in the United States. So, my committee, we also have a visa security bill to put ICE agents in embassies and consulate offices in these high-threat areas so we can do better vetting over there to ensure they don't come here."

This neglect has been made worse by administration after administration, essentially appeasing the North Koreans. And so, that's why you see this behavior now. I don't believe for a minute they're going to hit anything regarding Guam or the West Coast. I think it's all about them trying to push harder for appeasement for something from us. And this is where we need to depart, again, from the past tradition. We do have the military options, no doubt. But we have to hold accountable, Martha -- those nations which have been most pervasive and most effective in allowing the North Koreans to obtain the weapons, both the nuclear weapons, hydrogen bomb and delivery systems, and that is the Chinese. They are the ones holding the bag. I think we needed to look at economic sanctions against them and the Russians because of the Russians involvement, and also the Iranians -- there's been several credible reports talking about the Iranians essentially outsourcing their nuclear program, their ballistic missile program to the North Koreans paying for. So, this is something we have to look at next."

And I think the thing you said earlier that this missile went further and higher than previous missiles, I think what we're seeing is an exponential acceleration of North Korea's nuclear program. They're testing more frequently both the missiles and the bombs and they have the capability. And so, as this thing begins to hockey stick up, we've got to ask ourselves a question: would we rather fight them now or we rather fight them later? And right now, we have the capability. Yes, nobody wants a war on the Korean Peninsula. But, at the same time, if we're employing our economic element of power, our diplomatic element of power, an informational element of power, and it's not getting the job done, then what we need to do is begin a noncombatant evacuation from South Korea, the Republic of Korea. And then, we need to begin to move rapid reaction forces like the 18th Airborne Corps, like the marine expeditionary force and air wing and begin to position them in the western Pacific so that there are teeth behind what we're saying. Because right now, what we have in place are forces that are pretty much already there. And we're saying these bellicose things, and I believe that we mean them."

I don't know that that ever gets me to amnesty, but it may get others there. And so -- and I understand the president, I believe on this. I mean, his heart kind of overruled his campaign promises and he served up DACA to Congress and threw it out and said, well, I'm going to keep my campaign promise this way -- eight months late with a six-month delay. And then, Congress, it's the equivalent of throwing DACA into Congress to try to write a bill that satisfies the president is equivalent to throwing a cat into the kennel and let the dogs turn them loose. We've been through this immigration debate multiple times, 86 under Reagan, 2005 through 2000, and actually eight under George W. Bush, and again in 2013 under Barack Obama. And each time the thing that killed it all off was amnesty, rewarding lawbreakers."

Let's put up a Marist Poll that the question is: do you favor or oppose Congress providing a way for undocumented immigrants who are currently in the U.S. to gain legal citizenship if they learn English, pay fines, and have a job that pays taxes.

Follow the law. That really means this that go home and apply the legal way but get to the back of the line.

And if we get there we're restoring the respect for the rule of law, that's three to five years under an effective president and administration.

It was the promise that caused the Bush amnesty to fail and Obama amnesty to fail. And by the way, that was the promise that Bush 41th took. We'll get tax cuts, we'll get spending cuts later if I will give you a tax increase today. That never happens. You have to get those things that are conservative first before you can take up the other part of this or it will fail and we'll see more and more illegals and we'll see not amnesty 1.0 and never again because that was the promise of 1986. We'll see DACA 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, it will never, never end unless we have --"

      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH",
      "utterance": "Well, Congressman King is if anything consistent, and that is to abuse the word amnesty. Amnesty is the forgiveness of a fault without any penalty. And think about that question that you asked, Martha, it said undocumented immigrants gain citizenship if they learn English, pay a fine, have jobs and pay taxes. It strikes me there are at least several requirements and a couple of fines and penalties in there. And you're right, among all Republicans 69/27, among independents 83-14; among moderates 83-13, and among conservatives and very conservatives 70-26. So, the American people are a fair-minded group of people. And if you say these kids, who were brought here at the age -- an average of 6 and a half years old -- who are hereby no fault of their own, who only know one country, the United States of America, who are now becoming adults, should be allowed to have a path to legal citizenship if they kept their nose clean, serve in the military, get good grades in school, have a job, pay taxes and haven't committed crimes. They ought to be able to earn their citizenship in the United States. The American people believe that overwhelmingly. If Congressman King had the courage of his convictions, he ought to sponsor a bill that says our objective is to remove every one of those people out of the country now because they have violated our laws. If he believes that let him bring it up, get a piece of legislation or resolution in Congress and get co-sponsors."

We came up with the kind of prescription that you just discussed, you know, learn English, pay taxes, all of those parts of the deal -- and it really hasn't worked. We've continued to see influxes of illegal immigrants in the country. And then, the second part of it is at what point do stop that? At what age do you say, well, actually, if you came here last year, you're no longer accepted as part of this DACA program. It doesn't have a lid."

And, for example, one thing that needs to be done, this is part of our legislation in five, six, and seven, that Barack Obama said he was going to support and then opposed was e-verify. The requirement that in order for you to get a job in the United States of America, we would do something that Americans don't like to do, and that is to have you check in with the federal government and confirm that you are a citizen or have a green card or legitimate to hold a job. We're going to have to quire every business in America to do that in order to remove the magnet that draws people here. The only way that you get a job is to come here legally, then you're not going to come here. And we're going to have to do some other things that are on the border that require tough measures that Americans are not going to like. But you are right, we've got to have both compassion for people who are here illegally, and we've got to step up security on the border. I would remind you, it was George W. Bush whom Steve King refused -- has refused ever to acknowledge this who ended catch and release. It took us five years to get to Congress to give us the money and facilities to do it, but you've got to have tough measures like that."

But no, I'm a white supremacist now, because this is the way the left works, right? If you don't agree with them everyone is a white supremacist.

So how Antifa works that they like to infiltrate civilian crowds, they pop out, they put on their mask, they do something violent, they pop back into the crowd, and then they disappear. That's how they work. The cops weren't having any of that last night. This is really attributes to the UCPD and for the Berkeley P.D. for doing their job.

One person was arrested for having some sort of baton in his backpack. One was arrested for spitting on a police officer. So the idea that if the police hadn't been there, there would have been violence, I think that's probably true given the fact that all of Berkeley was basically shut down. I mean, there's businesses shutting early yesterday. There were -- Bank of America, actually, boarded up its own ATM's because they were concerned that Antifa was going to destroy the ATM's again. Antifa, again, they've been led by the city to believe that they rule the city, and last night was the first time that the police were actually allowed to engage in a show of force saying you don't rule the city. And if you try to violate the law we'll arrest you. I talked to a bunch of police officers yesterday. They were really, really happy that for the first time the leftist administration at Berkeley, and in the city of Berkeley, allowed them to do their jobs."

I want to ask you one quick question about the ESPN thing as well, because today there was internal memo that was leaked, and let's put some of it up on the screen, by the leadership at ESPN. OK. The ESPN president in a memo to staff says that ESPN is about sports. It is not a political organization. And, obviously, that was in reference to Jemele Hill, the woman who said that the president was a white supremacist. What do you think?"

You can't turn on a broadcast on ESPN without getting 45 minutes about the wonders of Collin Kaepernick or the heroism of Caitlin Jenner. I mean, they fired Dick Cotton, Curt Schilling, basically, for saying things that were mildly right-wing. The idea they're not political is just absurd. By the way, I think that Jemele Hill should keep her job, because I think as long as ESPN is going to be overtly political with Jemele Hill, I think they should hire back Dick Cotton, they should hire back Shilling. The whole thing is ridiculous."

House Speaker Paul Ryan says it sets a dangerous precedent. So when Harvard offered Manning a visiting fellowship the outrage was quick and loud. CIA director and Harvard grad, Mike Pompeo, immediately backed out of a speaking engagement at Harvard and issued a statement saying, quote, I believe it is shameful for Harvard to place its stamp of approval upon her treasonous actions. Harvard has now reversed course. Rescinded the fellowship and admitted the mistake. Yet, Chelsea Manning is still invited to speak at a school forum and spend the day there. Manning responded to Harvard's actions on twitter saying, quote, they kill marginalized voices under CIA pressure. Back in 2007, then Bradley Manning joined the army and was sent to Baghdad to work as an intel analyst with access to classified computer systems. Manning then became disillusioned with the U.S. occupation there and felt if the public had access to more information it would, quote, spark a domestic debate on the role of the military. Manning then copied hundreds of thousands of documents, including intel assessments, classified conversations, and videos that purportedly showed civilians being shot and killed. The material was turned over to WikiLeaks and published in 2010. Manning was caught, arrested, and arraigned on 22 charges, saying in a statement, quote, I only wanted to help people. When I chose to disclose classified information, I did so out of a love for my country and a sense of duty for others. Clearly, others disagreed. Top military officials said the 700,000 plus documents put people's lives at risk, including some 900 Afghans helping U.S. troops whose names were not redacted. After being sentenced to 35 years, Manning announced he was transitioning to become female. Martha."

But, she does walk the streets now and has a twitter account as we saw. The fact that she's been invited to speak at Harvard is their decision. I don't think it's a great decision to invite her, period. But, since it was extended, I think the fact that they have not rescinded the invitation completely, I get that. I'm OK with that. I'm not big on dis-invitations. But, giving her a place of honor and calling her a fellow at Harvard, that is not something that should be bestowed upon a traitor to this country."

But isn't there a difference between having an issue and trying to shut down someone with whom you disagree where you have policy differences, or you think their politics are wrong as opposed to someone who is an actual, convicted traitor to America?

What Guy has eloquently said himself, but that I will reiterate to make the point clear, there is a difference between having different, you know, thoughts, different feelings about political thought and theory, and being a convicted traitor to the country who put a lot of people's lives in grey danger. And when you're Harvard University, and I know you don't care about the brats at Harvard University as you said, or whatever, but we still actually live in a country where we do give some esteem and we have standards that we expect some of our educational institutions to live up to, so that's why this is an issue.

I mean, look, she undoubtedly, objectively, offers a unique perspective on accountability and transparency in the United States role in war and peace. Again, I like to be very clear, I disagreed with her leaking.

And up next, is a potential battle that would actually affect students all across this country. Education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is really putting her out on the line with the move that she is now making. Powerful Democratic senators are lining up to oppose her. And it's all about college sexual assault policy. Mollie Hemingway and Jessica Tarlov debate the issue when we come back."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So there is a pretty big battle brewing right now over controversial Obama-era school policies. Education secretary Betsy DeVos says that she plans to rescind title 9 sexual assault guidance for college campuses. But now, 29 senators, Democrat senators, have signed a letter to DeVos and they're defending the Obama-era policy writing, quote, the current guidance is critical to ensuring that schools understand and take seriously their responsibilities under the law. And we urge you to leave the current guidance in place. Rescinding the guidance would be a step in the wrong direction in addressing the national epidemic of campus sexual assault. We're going to explain this. Molly Hemmingway is senior editor for The Federalist, and Jessica Tarlov author of America in the age of Trump, both are Fox News contributors. So, basically, in 2011, the Obama administration office of civil rights issued a letter to college campuses across the country, and they basically said that conduct may constitute unlawful sexual harassment under title 9, even if the police do not have sufficient evidence of a criminal violation. And as a result of this, campuses really felt pressure because they could lose their federal funding if they didn't create sort of a quasi-campus court, which was made up of professors on campuses, and it said to them, OK, we're going to put these young people in front of you and you decide whether or not a sexual assault happened in the dorm room when both people were drunk, which is what happens in most of these cases or many of them. Molly, what do you think about what Betsy DeVos is doing here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRUBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a much needed correction. I don't think many people who have looked at this issue would say that the guidance has turned out even as the people who put it out there intended. It ends up creating two sets of victims. On the one hand you have victims of sexual assault, who their attackers are kept out of the criminal justice system, just kept in colleges. And the most punishment that they get, for say, raping a student would be getting kicked out of college where they can go to another place and continue their actions. On the other hand, there is such a low standard of evidence required to achieve a conviction in these kangaroo courts that a lot of innocent people are being convicted and having their lives ruined because of this guidance. So it doesn't address the actual problem of sexual assault on campus, and it creates a whole new set of victims."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, obviously, no one wants to get away with anyone who commits a sexual assault on any campus in this country. The problem is things like this situation in Columbia, and put up a picture of mattress girl who became famous across the country for pressing charges against a young man at Columbia. The problem is that both the court system at Columbia made up of professors said he didn't do this, and then the police in the Bronx also said that he didn't do it. But she continued to try him in the court of public opinion and essentially ruined his life. He sued Columbia, Jessica, and he has won a reverse title 9 discrimination case against Columbia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And he certainly should have. We all remember when that was going on. And what a splash it made, and how important it was originally to the sexual assault movement. And a lot of the causes Christian Gillibrand, our hometown senator here, this is her main issue and talks about this, and then the impact of the reversal. And the reversal that we've seen in other cases where it turns out that there was an accusation that was completely unfounded and some bad reporting that contributed to that where people didn't go deep enough. What I would say is that while I agree with the premise that we should reexamine these guidelines, the dear colleague letter guidelines, the issue of what Betsy DeVos has done is that she hasn't put forward new policies and new protections."

Now if 20 percent of women were sexually assaulted at college, no parent would allow their children to go to college. Not a single one. Because that would mean that you didn't love your child enough to keep them from being sexually assaulted at a place. But it is true that there is a sexual assault problem, and that colleges need to have good ways of handling this. They need to have good policies. Denying people the right to life, liberty, and property, from being denied unless they -- unless you have due process is not a good way to go about."
