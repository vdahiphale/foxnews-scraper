And now a belief that regulation, not deregulation is not good for international markets.  And that first year you saw the stock market really do well. There was a 30 percent increase in the first year. And recently you've seen a six percent decrease in the stock market. Now that's not to say the only thing that matters is corporations' bottom lines, and I think Donald Trump has been consistent that he believes this is part of some larger philosophy in that he needs to show strength here.
