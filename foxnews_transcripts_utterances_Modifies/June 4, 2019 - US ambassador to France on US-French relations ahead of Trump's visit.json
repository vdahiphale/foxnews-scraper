And, you know, some of the veterans who had fought were there, and they were kind of wandering through and their sort of humble way, and it was quite a powerful experience. And, of course, when you remember what they did there, what a difficult thing it was to assault those beaches with the Germans entrenched on the bluffs high above, raining down withering gunfire with the -- with the tide in places running red with the blood of these Yanks who were coming -- trying to come ashore and fight their way inland. It was a near thing, Martha, as you know, it almost failed but its success was crucial. And it paves a way not just for the liberation of France, but for the ultimate liberation of Europe.

And Britain would be at the back of the queue for a trading with America. Well, Trump has turned that upside down. He is encouraging a Brexit without a deal, and saying, \"Look, you come to us. Come on over with us, the water's fine over here, we got great potential.\"  And I don't think that while a lot of you're a lot of Europe -- a lot of British may not have gone very much to Donald Trump, I don't think that official Britain has forgotten what Barack Obama said there at the end. And I think that Trump's warming up to them in the way he has is appreciated in official circles there. But the paramount event here, I think really, Martha is the unity of these two countries and the -- and the alliance that was in place before World War II, but certainly strengthened then, and it has remained so very strong ever since. It really is, I mean, I know it's a cliche, and everybody says it all the time. But it really is a special relationship.

And he is simply rejected that, rejected it outright. And calls himself tariff man. And he's wielding tariffs now as his tool of choice in all kinds of ways. He's trying to help solve his immigration crisis at the border with the -- with the tariffs threatened against Mexico. He's obviously using them and to accomplish trades concessions from China and, of course, you know, economic sanctions are a critical part of his effort with North Korea. So, he's got them in play everywhere, or, at least, a number of major places. And, you know, one begins to wonder -- I mean, you do have this might work, Martha. And if he gets trade deals out of all this and concessions from Mexico, it will be a huge victory. But it is risky. Because a big trade war that doesn't result in a deal, and sometimes soon could the thing that derails the recovery we've had going on now for 10 years, that's in -- for the United States, that's the longest -- perhaps, the longest will be the longest ever.

Jennifer Dulos had told friends that their flagrant affair had her fearful about the impact on her children. And today the mother of Jennifer Dulos filed for custody of her daughter's five children.

Green New Deal is like political kryptonite to those people. They don't want anything to do with the Green New Deal. So, he is splitting the difference, he's got Green New Deal promises without Green New Deal funding. It's only 1.7 trillion in federal spending which is a lot of money but to the left today, that's a piton. They want World War II level mobilization.  You're in Normandy.

The planet is not going to fizzle up and burn up in 12 years, but every community, look at the corn belt now which they can't plant their seed. Look at the droughts and the fires and the hurricanes in Puerto Rico, in Houston, and Florida. This is not a joking issue especially to millennials. So, he is taking this out not because of where it gives him the opportunity to speak about it in a debate, he is doing it because of what he believes in as he did back when he was a senator in the 80s. He's took --his take out ground on the climate issue before it was fashionable. And Obama and he and the White House had a very aggressive plan which frankly reduced emissions quite substantially and at the same time that the U.S. became an exporter of fossil fuels. So, you can actually have it both ways but they see this as an existential issue and I do think it will be -- it's like guns, years ago Democrats wouldn't touch the gun control issue and now they do because they see that the public has shifted a little bit.

But the problem, you know, you are right, Richard, that the Obama administration, Obama-Biden administration did a lot and what happened was in the industrial Midwest 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost on their watch. But Donald Trump has come into office and there are half a million in manufacturing jobs have been added.  So, these voters in these key swing states are looking at Biden's plan and they're thinking, do we want to go back to the war on fossil fuels? To the tax increases, to the regulations that drove our jobs away when Donald Trump has lifted all of those and all of a sudden manufacturing jobs are coming back. People without a high school education or at the lowest employment rate in history. Do we want to go back to Obama-Biden and exactly what you're describing?

It appears he did to the FBI about whether he leaked to the media this salacious and unverified dossier that would violate 18 USC 1001, same statute Michael Flynn was convicted under.

And, you know, some of the veterans who had fought were there, and they were kind of wandering through and their sort of humble way, and it was quite a powerful experience. And, of course, when you remember what they did there, what a difficult thing it was to assault those beaches with the Germans entrenched on the bluffs high above, raining down withering gunfire with the -- with the tide in places running red with the blood of these Yanks who were coming -- trying to come ashore and fight their way inland. It was a near thing, Martha, as you know, it almost failed but its success was crucial. And it paves a way not just for the liberation of France, but for the ultimate liberation of Europe. So, it was -- it was one of the most momentous and consequential battles in modern military history. And you were there at the sight of it and quiet -- and quiet a place it is."

And I know you talked about you know getting choked up when you watch these veterans as they come through, because they are looking for specific people who they knew and who they fought alongside to pay their respects, and we're going to see a lot of that over the next several days. It also strikes me Brit that the president is following the path of D-Day. Tomorrow, he will be in Portsmouth, which is where the troops gather. They were there for three months in some cases before they made that move across the channel."

And warning them that if they did so, and that -- you know, the U.S. would be negotiating with what's -- the remaining E.U. And Britain would be at the back of the queue for a trading with America. Well, Trump has turned that upside down. He is encouraging a Brexit without a deal, and saying, \"Look, you come to us. Come on over with us, the water's fine over here, we got great potential.\" And I don't think that while a lot of you're a lot of Europe -- a lot of British may not have gone very much to Donald Trump, I don't think that official Britain has forgotten what Barack Obama said there at the end. And I think that Trump's warming up to them in the way he has is appreciated in official circles there. But the paramount event here, I think really, Martha is the unity of these two countries and the -- and the alliance that was in place before World War II, but certainly strengthened then, and it has remained so very strong ever since. It really is, I mean, I know it's a cliche, and everybody says it all the time. But it really is a special relationship. And the president seems to have fitted himself in his role into it quite ably on this trip and it seems to have gone rather smoothly with the protests being less than, than some anticipated.

But you know, with regard to the -- to the tariff issue and the way that the president handles these relationships. He always looks at security and the economics of these relationships hand-in-hand. He's getting pushed back now on the deal that he wants to -- the tariff deal that he wants to put in place on Mexico. He's got Republicans who are pushing back on that. He's about to come to France where no doubt the whole issue of tariffs on Europe are also going to come into play. What do you think about how that part of this is going for him, Bret?"

And said, \"This is folly, if you go there, you can't help but you're going to fail and you're going to cause more harm than, than you could possibly -- anything you could possibly achieve. And he is simply rejected that, rejected it outright. And calls himself tariff man. And he's wielding tariffs now as his tool of choice in all kinds of ways. He's trying to help solve his immigration crisis at the border with the -- with the tariffs threatened against Mexico. He's obviously using them and to accomplish trades concessions from China and, of course, you know, economic sanctions are a critical part of his effort with North Korea. So, he's got them in play everywhere, or, at least, a number of major places. And, you know, one begins to wonder -- I mean, you do have this might work, Martha. And if he gets trade deals out of all this and concessions from Mexico, it will be a huge victory. But it is risky. Because a big trade war that doesn't result in a deal, and sometimes soon could the thing that derails the recovery we've had going on now for 10 years, that's in -- for the United States, that's the longest -- perhaps, the longest will be the longest ever.

And look, I was -- when I heard the news that he had a climate plan, I didn't know that Neil Kinnock had come up with a climate plan because it sounds like Joe Biden plagiarized a lot of it cutting and pasting from all these different climate groups into his -- into his plan. So you know, he -- I don't know how quite original it is. But what -- he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't because he's caught in a pincer. The -- if he doesn't go for a full green new deal, then he's going to alienate the far left of the Democratic Party that is controls a nominating process. But if he does go full green new deal, then he's going to alienate the swing voters, working-class swing voters in the industrialized Midwest that he has to win back to win -- to win back the presidency. The whole premise of Joe Biden's presidential campaign is that he's the guy who can win back those Obama-Biden voters in swing states like Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Wisconsin that switch to Donald Trump in 2016. Green New Deal is like political kryptonite to those people. They don't want anything to do with the Green New Deal. So, he is splitting the difference, he's got Green New Deal promises without Green New Deal funding. It's only 1.7 trillion in federal spending which is a lot of money but to the left today, that's a piton. They want World War II level mobilization. You're in Normandy. If they want to spend 40 to 50 percent of GDP on this problem and Joe Biden isn't going anywhere near that. So, he is trying to assuage the left but not do it in a way that alienate those voters."

So, is this, Richard Goodstein, you know, sort of a way to stake out when the question on climate change comes, yes, I have a plan and I've rolled it out just a couple of weeks ago.

They see it as something that really has the future of the planet at stake. It's not 12 years. The planet is not going to fizzle up and burn up in 12 years, but every community, look at the corn belt now which they can't plant their seed. Look at the droughts and the fires and the hurricanes in Puerto Rico, in Houston, and Florida. This is not a joking issue especially to millennials. So, he is taking this out not because of where it gives him the opportunity to speak about it in a debate, he is doing it because of what he believes in as he did back when he was a senator in the 80s. He's took --his take out ground on the climate issue before it was fashionable. And Obama and he and the White House had a very aggressive plan which frankly reduced emissions quite substantially and at the same time that the U.S. became an exporter of fossil fuels. So, you can actually have it both ways but they see this as an existential issue and I do think it will be -- it's like guns, years ago Democrats wouldn't touch the gun control issue and now they do because they see that the public has shifted a little bit.

So, you know, we are moving forward with addressing climate change through innovation which is the way we should be doing it. But the problem, you know, you are right, Richard, that the Obama administration, Obama-Biden administration did a lot and what happened was in the industrial Midwest 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost on their watch. But Donald Trump has come into office and there are half a million in manufacturing jobs have been added. So, these voters in these key swing states are looking at Biden's plan and they're thinking, do we want to go back to the war on fossil fuels? To the tax increases, to the regulations that drove our jobs away when Donald Trump has lifted all of those and all of a sudden manufacturing jobs are coming back. People without a high school education or at the lowest employment rate in history. Do we want to go back to Obama-Biden and exactly what you're describing?

He saved yours. This drops all over Normandy. Now assuming Private Ryan even survive the jump, he could be anywhere. In fact, he is probably KIA. You did a damn fine job on a tough mission last night. I wish you good luck tonight because I'd be expecting more of the same."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DYE",
      "utterance": "Well, it was a mission. I felt for a long time that Hollywood and the popular media and general television and so on and so forth, really hadn't done our American veterans of all generations very well. Sometimes they get the technical details right and that's fine and that's important and so on and so forth, but what I thought that was missing was the spirit of the warrior, the heart and the soul and the way we think and the way we relate to each other. And what our emotions are really like. I was just convinced that a flaw and most of the war movies I saw was that very thing, a lack of understanding. So being a marine I decided well, the answer of this of course is to immerse them and hurt them until all of the civilian crap all it goes away and then the next thing you know I can pour in the appropriate stuff and make them understand the concepts like service and sacrifice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That's a fascinating thing that you just said. And I think it's something that exist in acting anyway. Because you want to break down, you know, sort of the actor to get them to a point of vulnerability where they start to feel what the character is actually going through."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DYE",
      "utterance": "Well, it is much like what young men and women went through when they joined the service back in 1944. It starts with some intense physical stuff, long runs, running and formations, (Inaudible) that sort of thing. And what that does is get their mind right. It focuses them on what they need to do. And the need thing I think about it is that at that point you can begin to teach. And as you teach not only do you do the physicality, you know, how do I handle a weapon and how do I reload a weapon and how do I wear my uniform? That's fine. But what you really need to do is put them in a situation where they can perceive the emotions. They can perceive that they have to rely on the guy to the right and the guy to the left and all their lines, and how their hair looks doesn't make any difference because I'm going to put a helmet on in anyway. And when you can get them to that point and you spend time with them personally and you talk to them and you answer the actorly questions, what you find is that they have an entirely new concept, they see things in a much different fashion. What I think it is that they see things the way these young men did when they join the army or the Marine Corps or the navy or the army air corps back in the 1940s."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DYE",
      "utterance": "Well, \"No better Place to Die\" if you had to do a log line would be the prequel to \"Saving Private Ryan,\" it's actually the airborne assault that happened before the beach landings took place. And the title comes from a note that the commanding officer, Lieutenant Red Dog Dolan of the Able Company first to the 508th Parachute Infantry sent to one of his NCOs. The NCOs said the Germans are pressing us too hard, we can't hold here at La Fiere Bridge. We need to pull back. And Lieutenant Dolan sent a note back that said, \"we hold here, there is no better place to die.\" And that's Martha, I mean, how could you not use that?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DYE",
      "utterance": "Yes. But more importantly, they could keep the Germans from counterattacking and driving us out of the beach, had they not held those bridges and the vital crossings and vital crossroads. The Germans could have reinforced those beach defenses and perhaps on Omaha and Utah just driven us back into the sea."

The idea is conducting an investigation into alleged FISA abuse. So, what we could -- what could be learned from Steele's questioning? Joining us now, Kayleigh McEnany, 2020 Trump campaign national press secretary, and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and syndicated radio host. Welcome to both of you.

Everybody would like to know who his sources were, who, how he felt about the client in this case which was the Clinton campaign ultimately and what he thought that they wanted from him in terms of what he was getting paid to do. Kayleigh, what questions are in your mind about what we need to know about Christopher Steele in the FISA abuse issue and you know, the origins of all of this, I should say? KAYLEIGH MCENANY, 2020 TRUMP CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Yes. Well, there is a lot. I want to know did he lie to the FBI? It appears he did to the FBI about whether he leaked to the media this salacious and unverified dossier that would violate 18 USC 1001, same statute Michael Flynn was convicted under. I want to know why he was so nervous before Comey's testimony. That he sent frantic text to Bruce Ohr, saying are the firewalls going to hold up. There is a lot to be interested in here. And I assume Chris is interested in the same transparency I am. We have transparency from President Trump and no collusion and no obstruction, but we have to get to the bottom of the civil liberty violations and how this all began and spying on the Trump campaign which we know did occur per A.G. Barr."

And maybe sanction him at least. Look, if you are a member of the House of Representatives and you are not jealously guard your power to oversee the president and provide a check to him, I don't know what you are doing in Congress.

Rome was the first major capital to be freed from Nazi control during World War II. Members of the fifth army reaching the center of the city late at night after encountering dog and resistance from German forces on the outskirts of town. Soon after, German troops were ordered to withdraw. And the people of Rome were finally liberated.
