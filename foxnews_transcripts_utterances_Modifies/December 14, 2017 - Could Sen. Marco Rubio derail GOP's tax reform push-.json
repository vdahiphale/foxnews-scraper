Republicans plan to unveil a final merged house and Senate bill tomorrow with the aim of voting sometime early next week. Will it pass? Republican senator Marco Rubio says he's a no unless the child tax credit for the working poor is expanded. The president believes the senator will come around.",

And also, I read today that they said like it's some false deadline, but the Republicans have always said they wanted to get this to the president's desk before Christmas, at the end of the year. And so, it's been right on track, and this is before the Washington Post story came out about Roy Moore. The deadline that the Republican set was after Obamacare repeal and replace failed. So, that's not going to happen. They're not going to wait. I think the Democrats -- they're trying to find something to say. But I thought today was really interesting to watch the president. He's just so close to getting this done. I think it to be expected that you would have a couple members who really want something to press their advantage right now because there is this deadline. They do want a little bit more on the child tax credit. We can debate the merit of that. Ivanka Trump wants that as well. So, they know that they have a chance to possibly get that. I don't think that at the end of this that they will actually not vote for it. There could be a little bit of room to play with on the corporate rate because the president wanted 15, agreed to 20. Now it's at 21. Marco Rubio's point is, well, going to 22 percent isn't that big a deal. The corporations are still going to be happy and we could actually do more to help the working poor. I don't know if that will be persuasive, but it could be with the president.",

I don't love the tax cut. It's not big or bold enough, but it's gotten better in conference. They're dropping the top rate from 39 right now to 37, which is going to have a similitude effect. That's good. And 20 percent is better than 25 percent for the corporate rate reduction, which is also positive. And the Obamacare mandate, Juan, that will get repealed and that is a huge accomplishment for the Republican congress. No one thought that was even going to happen. And then, we talked about this, people who live in high tax states like New York and California will be able to deduct your state and local taxes up to 10,000. Not all of it, but up to 10,000, so that's a goof thing. So I think this train is moving towards the station and it's going to happen. I don't know if it's going to be the best Christmas present everyone is going to get because it's not as generous towards, I think, lower class and middle class Americans. It's also about $38 a week, but it's better than nothing. And it's very similitude.",

Within the last 2 minutes, Fox News has obtained a letter that was sent this afternoon to FBI director Christopher Wray from the Senate homeland security committee. But what's key about this letter is we believe it's the first time we've seen one of the original drafts of Director Comey's exoneration statement from July of last year that recommended against criminal charges in the Clinton email case. I have the five pages of that exoneration statement here. And we've been combing through it here at Fox News. And there're really two big takeaways. Number one, this term, grossly negligent, was removed from the draft at least twice and it was downgraded to extremely careless, and that was the language that Director Comey used in his public statement. And we know based on our reporting that the removal of the term grossly negligent was made by this FBI agent Peter Strzok, who sent these anti-Trump texts. The reason that term matters is because gross negligence is the legal standard under the federal statute for prosecution for the mishandling of classified information. The other key thing, and we haven't seen this in any media reports until now, is that they made a change about the likelihood that a hostile actor was able to penetrate Hillary Clinton's email server. And the original drafts said that given the combination of factors, talking about the lack of security with the server and the fact that it was a target, we assess it is reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's private email account. And in the public statement by Director Comey, that was downgraded to the term, possible, that they access the Clinton email server, and the hundreds of classified messages that it contained. So bottomline, we've got one of the original drafts of the exoneration statement. It shows a key term grossly negligent was dropped, softened at least twice, and that the original statement said that it was likely that the server had been accessed, have been hacked by foreign actors or hostile actors, and that was not included in that final public statement, Juan.",

Republicans plan to unveil a final merged house and Senate bill tomorrow with the aim of voting sometime early next week. Will it pass?

And I will say the Republican senators and congressmen and women have been incredible. So I think we will get there. It will be in a very short period of time.

      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and it's not going to happen. And also, I read today that they said like it's some false deadline, but the Republicans have always said they wanted to get this to the president's desk before Christmas, at the end of the year. And so, it's been right on track, and this is before the Washington Post story came out about Roy Moore. The deadline that the Republican set was after Obamacare repeal and replace failed. So, that's not going to happen. They're not going to wait. I think the Democrats -- they're trying to find something to say. But I thought today was really interesting to watch the president. He's just so close to getting this done. I think it to be expected that you would have a couple members who really want something to press their advantage right now because there is this deadline. They do want a little bit more on the child tax credit. We can debate the merit of that. Ivanka Trump wants that as well. So, they know that they have a chance to possibly get that. I don't think that at the end of this that they will actually not vote for it. There could be a little bit of room to play with on the corporate rate because the president wanted 15, agreed to 20. Now it's at 21. Marco Rubio's point is, well, going to 22 percent isn't that big a deal. The corporations are still going to be happy and we could actually do more to help the working poor. I don't know if that will be persuasive, but it could be with the president."

      "utterance": "Yeah. He's using his leverage, and he probably going to be effective because the deadline is fast approaching. I think this deal is much better than what we saw before. I don't love the tax cut. It's not big or bold enough, but it's gotten better in conference. They're dropping the top rate from 39 right now to 37, which is going to have a similitude effect. That's good. And 20 percent is better than 25 percent for the corporate rate reduction, which is also positive. And the Obamacare mandate, Juan, that will get repealed and that is a huge accomplishment for the Republican congress. No one thought that was even going to happen. And then, we talked about this, people who live in high tax states like New York and California will be able to deduct your state and local taxes up to 10,000. Not all of it, but up to 10,000, so that's a goof thing. So I think this train is moving towards the station and it's going to happen. I don't know if it's going to be the best Christmas present everyone is going to get because it's not as generous towards, I think, lower class and middle class Americans. It's also about $38 a week, but it's better than nothing. And it's very similitude."

It's not only -- not only do have Bob Corker, rightly, as a true conservative worried about blowing up the deficit, but you have Marco Rubio now saying, hey, what about working people? What about the working poor? What about Mike Lee? He's on the edge too. What about McCain and Corker? Both of them sick. May not be able to vote. And then, of course, Doug Jones. If Doug Jones gets in there and he's the rightly elected senator from Alabama, and it's only because Mitch McConnell wants to play parliamentary games that his sitting is being delayed, then all all of a sudden, the math shifts radically against this horrible bill."

So Trump hires a very intelligent successful black woman, and what they do is they say, oh, she's a joke. And then, when he fires an intelligent and successful black woman, they say, oh, you can't do that. Where's the diversity? So it's like no matter what Trump does he'll be criticized. I think she stuck around so long because she's so loyal and we know the president values loyalty. I don't really know what she did in the White House.

So, we'll see what happens. I think it's very clear from the tease there when she was talking about that she tried to, you know, push a book. She's going to tell her story and we'll see who she, you know, identifies and lays out in terms of people that she was unhappy with about their policies or viewpoints.

      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, thanks, Juan. Within the last 2 minutes, Fox News has obtained a letter that was sent this afternoon to FBI director Christopher Wray from the Senate homeland security committee. But what's key about this letter is we believe it's the first time we've seen one of the original drafts of Director Comey's exoneration statement from July of last year that recommended against criminal charges in the Clinton email case. I have the five pages of that exoneration statement here. And we've been combing through it here at Fox News. And there're really two big takeaways. Number one, this term, grossly negligent, was removed from the draft at least twice and it was downgraded to extremely careless, and that was the language that Director Comey used in his public statement. And we know based on our reporting that the removal of the term grossly negligent was made by this FBI agent Peter Strzok, who sent these anti-Trump texts. The reason that term matters is because gross negligence is the legal standard under the federal statute for prosecution for the mishandling of classified information. The other key thing, and we haven't seen this in any media reports until now, is that they made a change about the likelihood that a hostile actor was able to penetrate Hillary Clinton's email server. And the original drafts said that given the combination of factors, talking about the lack of security with the server and the fact that it was a target, we assess it is reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's private email account. And in the public statement by Director Comey, that was downgraded to the term, possible, that they access the Clinton email server, and the hundreds of classified messages that it contained. So bottomline, we've got one of the original drafts of the exoneration statement. It shows a key term grossly negligent was dropped, softened at least twice, and that the original statement said that it was likely that the server had been accessed, have been hacked by foreign actors or hostile actors, and that was not included in that final public statement, Juan."

Then it should be the purview of the A.G. to be able to decide, in fact, whether you should proceed forward on a charge.
