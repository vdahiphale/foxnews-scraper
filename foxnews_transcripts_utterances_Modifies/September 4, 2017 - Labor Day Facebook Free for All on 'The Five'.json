It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" It's Labor Day, the unofficial end to summer. It has been quite a busy one for us in the news business. Usually, summers are a slow season. But this one was anything but. So, as the summer winds down, we thought we would have some fun tonight and turn the show over to you, again this holiday, with another Facebook Free for All. We'll answer questions you have for us throughout the hour. You posted them on our page: facebook.com/thefivefnc.  So, where to begin? It is a simple thing, it's a question from Steve C. What was the highlight of your summer? We'll go to Miss Summery Dana Perino.",

You're exactly right. But I also thought that it was fun, you know, the problem is, I remember once reading a novel and a European woman was complaining that Americans go to too many baseball games in the summer. And it's like boring. Why do you guys go to baseball games? How ordinary, how pedestrian. But actually, my team, the nationals, is having a great season. And I've been having fun going to baseball. If I say that you people, they think, you could have a more interesting life. Anyway --"

      "utterance": "My first job, see, this is hard. Because I was an intern for Warner Brothers. When I was in college, so technically, that is media. And I did advertising for motion pictures. So, I was able to promote movies like \"Blue Velvet,\" \"The Rivers Edge,\" Evil Dead 2, that was in 1987 or '86, '87. But then when I graduated, it was that the American spectator as a staff assistant where I made $12,000 a year."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "No! I mean, I started -- I worked on a show called \"Standoff,\" which was a public television show in Colorado Springs and I was I guess a producer -- country music DJ at the same time. But \"Standoff\" was a show that you had a host, and two guest, and they would debate issues. And I helped for the show together, so I guess that would be my first one."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Okay. So, my first job in media, you know, it was kind of odd, and I was working my way through college at a paper that's now gone called the Philadelphia evening bulletin. Before that, I was the editor of my Junior High School paper, editor of my High School paper and then I was doing that. But the first job that I really kind of always think of in media was when I was at \"The Washington Post,\" they started doing obituaries."
