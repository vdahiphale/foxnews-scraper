More than 70 Democrats in the House have come out in support of it, 12 members of the U.S. Senate, four Democrats currently running for President. They all support the plan.  So depending upon what happens in this coming election, parts of this proposal could easily become law. The question is, what is in it?  On Friday, we interviewed one of Ocasio-Cortez's advisers, he was Cornell Law Professor, Robert Hockett, and we asked about a fact sheet we had read from Ocasio-Cortez's office and it called for sending tax dollars to people who are quote, \"unwilling to work.\"  So we asked Hockett about it. He said that line never appeared. It wasn't real. It was a right-wing hoax. Watch.",

Alexandria Ocasio -Cortez herself agreed on Twitter. It turns out, they were all lying. Ocasio-Cortez especially, she knew and we can prove it. More on that in just a minute. But first, President Trump will make the case for a border wall and rally at El Paso, Texas tonight. In Washington, talks to avert a second government shutdown have fallen apart tonight over immigration. The administration wants to increase ICE's capacity to hold illegal immigrants. Democrats want to place keep a cap on how many ICE can detain so that more illegal immigrants without criminal records can be released into the United States.   Mark Morgan knows a lot about this subject. He ran Customs and Border Patrol under the previous President, President Obama and he joins us now. Mr. Morgan, thank you very much for coming on. So Democrats are demanding that ICE cap bed space in the interior of the country, not the borders, in the center of the country to 16,500 a year. If that were to happen, what would it mean?",

They want to actually reduce overall bed space for ICE and then the cap interior enforcement. So basically, we already know that if you're a child, or a family unit, you're going to be allowed in this country. That's catch release 1.0. This will virtually mean catch and release 2.0. Commonsense, right? As bed space goes down, illegal immigration goes up. Border Patrol turns everybody we apprehend over to ICE. As the bed space goes down that means, they're going to have to release more individuals into the interior of the United States. That is catch and release 2.0.  The other thing real quick what that does is, from a common sense standpoint, that means that people here, that are here illegally, and have committed an additional crime and/or charge of an additional crime, ICE will be forced to release them.",

We interviewed a man called Robert Hockett. He has been advising Ocasio-Cortez on the Green New Deal. Now, Hockett is a professor who occupies an endowed chair at Cornell Law School. Even if you're not overly impressed by credentials, and we're definitely not, it seemed like a reasonable job description. He would be a legitimate person. He is an Ivy League Law Professor. He must be sort of serious. Not the kind of guy who would tell obvious lies on live television. That was our thinking anyway.   So we asked him, why is the U.S. government thinking about or why members of Congress are pushing taxpayers to send money to people who don't want to work and here is his response.",

At the age of 55, you hit a severe midlife crisis, so severe that you suddenly decide to leave your wife and four kids for another woman. Then you get so carried away with your new mistress that you text her pictures of your genitals, and then those pictures wind up in the hands of a tabloid. Whoa, nightmare. What happens next? Do the media attack you as a pathetic old creep? Maybe even a harasser? Do they #MeToo you? Or do journalists instead rally to your defense? Well, that all depends on how rich you are. Luckily for him, Jeff Bezos is very rich, the richest man in the world in fact, and when you're as rich as Jeff Bezos is, there is no such thing as bad press coverage. There is only slobbering. Bob Woodward sucked up first. Woodward is the most famous journalist in America. He once took down a President with the unsparing toughness of his reporting. According to \"Axios,\" here's what Bob Woodward wrote to Jeff Bezos after Bezos' crotch shots became public quote, \"Jeff, proud of you for stepping forward. It's such a difficult situation. Very gutsy and definitely right. This period reminds me of 1972 to 1974, perhaps, Watergate Redux. So many assaults on constitutional government common sense and privacy. Let's hope we all get it right -- aggressive, but careful and fair. Cheers and best, Bob Woodward.\" So that's the new Woodward standard. If you criticize Jeff Bezos you're like Richard Nixon during Watergate, an assaulter of constitutional government, you're un-American, in fact. Max Boot agrees with that. Boot is another of Bezos' employees at the \"Washington Post\" and of course a florid toady. Boot wrote a column defending Bezos' nude selfies. The headline was, \"Jeff Bezos stands his ground.\" Stands his ground like Joshua Chamberlain at the Battle of Little Round Top. May our grandchildren revere his memory and speak his name. But for pure anxiousness, no one went further than \"New York Times\" technology columnist, Kara Swisher. Swisher has been sucking up to billionaires since before the guys who run Uber were even born. If flattering the powerful was an Olympic event, Kara Swisher would be Mark Spitz. According to Swisher, Bezos' behavior since he left his wife and kids for his mistress has been quote, \"admirable\" a quote, \"heroic moment\" from quote, \"the most important tech visionary since Steve Jobs.\" It goes on like this pornographically for an entire column. At one point -- this is the best -- Swisher frets that Jeff Bezos' privacy has been violated by the \"National Enquirer\" which by the way is true, but tellingly, she didn't spend a lot of time worrying about whether America's privacy has been violated by Jeff Bezos. And that seemed like a worthwhile question to ask. Glenn Greenwald has been thinking about it a lot recently, and he joins us tonight. So that was the first thing -- I'm going to say clearly, I totally disapprove of what the \"National Enquirer\" did to Jeff Bezos. I do. But it does raise the question, what is Amazon doing to the rest of us?",

Some former staffer said Klobuchar forced them to perform bizarre personal duties like washing her dishes or picking up or dry cleaning. That's not in the job description. Klobuchar's reputation from mistreating staff is so widespread that at least three perspective campaign managers refuse to work for her. When ABC News confronted Klobuchar with these allegations, she essentially admitted it. She said quote, \"I am tough. I push people. That's true.\" So let's see. Here, you have a person who routinely claims to care far more than you do about other people, and yet the people she's actually in charge of, she mistreats. Sound like anyone you know? It does.

But if we're going to say that the government can only hold a certain number of illegal aliens, why don't we make the same allowance, the same liberal allowance for American citizens.",

More than 70 Democrats in the House have come out in support of it, 12 members of the U.S. Senate, four Democrats currently running for President. They all support the plan. So depending upon what happens in this coming election, parts of this proposal could easily become law. The question is, what is in it? On Friday, we interviewed one of Ocasio-Cortez's advisers, he was Cornell Law Professor, Robert Hockett, and we asked about a fact sheet we had read from Ocasio-Cortez's office and it called for sending tax dollars to people who are quote, \"unwilling to work.\" So we asked Hockett about it. He said that line never appeared. It wasn't real. It was a right-wing hoax. Watch."

Alexandria Ocasio -Cortez herself agreed on Twitter. It turns out, they were all lying. Ocasio-Cortez especially, she knew and we can prove it. More on that in just a minute. But first, President Trump will make the case for a border wall and rally at El Paso, Texas tonight. In Washington, talks to avert a second government shutdown have fallen apart tonight over immigration. The administration wants to increase ICE's capacity to hold illegal immigrants. Democrats want to place keep a cap on how many ICE can detain so that more illegal immigrants without criminal records can be released into the United States. Mark Morgan knows a lot about this subject. He ran Customs and Border Patrol under the previous President, President Obama and he joins us now. Mr. Morgan, thank you very much for coming on. So Democrats are demanding that ICE cap bed space in the interior of the country, not the borders, in the center of the country to 16,500 a year. If that were to happen, what would it mean?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK MORGAN, FORMER CHIEF OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PATROL",
      "utterance": "So what that is that is a significant step towards really abolishing ICE via the checkbook. And there's actually two elements to their plan. They want to actually reduce overall bed space for ICE and then the cap interior enforcement. So basically, we already know that if you're a child, or a family unit, you're going to be allowed in this country. That's catch release 1.0. This will virtually mean catch and release 2.0. Commonsense, right? As bed space goes down, illegal immigration goes up. Border Patrol turns everybody we apprehend over to ICE. As the bed space goes down that means, they're going to have to release more individuals into the interior of the United States. That is catch and release 2.0. The other thing real quick what that does is, from a common sense standpoint, that means that people here, that are here illegally, and have committed an additional crime and/or charge of an additional crime, ICE will be forced to release them."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN",
      "utterance": "Completely false, and that's the question. So right now, ICE alone, last year, arrested, I think the number is well in excess of 120,000 individuals that are here illegally for an additional crime. Right now, the 45,000 that ICE has detained right now, 70% to 80% of them, almost, I think about 85% of them have been convicted and/or charged with another crime besides entering illegally, so that's a complete false narrative."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I think the numbers are 88%. So that would mean, just to be completely clear, it's a math question, if you capped bed space at the threshold they're calling for, by definition, you'd be releasing criminals into the population."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN",
      "utterance": "That's correct. Right now, if you do the math, immediately if this bill pass, they would have to probably release about 8,000 individuals -- criminal aliens -- and it's not the crime of illegally entering, this is crimes in addition to that."

Illegal immigration is increased, and numbers will show that and so more people are going to be released into the interior of the United States and they are telling ICE they can't enforce that and actually go and get them. What we have created here is a sanctuary country, that's where we're headed."

Why are we letting the illegals live by a more lenient standard?"

It is not Border Patrol. It is not in charge of border enforcement. ICE's mission is to fight dangerous criminal in the U.S. like gangs -- MS-13 and many other gangs. Their job is not to go to court houses, for example, like they have been going to in New York, a 1,700%increase since 2016 to prosecute and basically go after families that are trying to legalize their stay here in the U.S. through the courts through a legal system, so that's what ICE --"

But there's a difference between supporting something and stating it clearly out loud and that was Ocasio-Cortez's sin. She said it out loud. \"Shhh\" said her superiors in the party, and Democrats immediately began pretending that in never happened. Fast forward to last Friday. We interviewed a man called Robert Hockett. He has been advising Ocasio-Cortez on the Green New Deal. Now, Hockett is a professor who occupies an endowed chair at Cornell Law School. Even if you're not overly impressed by credentials, and we're definitely not, it seemed like a reasonable job description. He would be a legitimate person. He is an Ivy League Law Professor. He must be sort of serious. Not the kind of guy who would tell obvious lies on live television. That was our thinking anyway.

Ocasio-Cortez's resolution, the official one, which is right here, guarantees economic security to quote, \"all the people of the United States,\" end quote, whether they want to work or not. It also calls for free education, and rebuilding quote, \"all existing buildings in the country,\" and a lot of other things. Now, under normal circumstances, sober people would laugh at a proposal like this. It doesn't even make sense. They would also, by the way, question Ocasio-Cortez's fitness for moral judgment of any kind. Keep in mind that she won her primary in New York with an openly racist campaign, openly racist. She attacked her opponent for the color of his skin. That's the definition of a racist campaign. But whatever. Ocasio-Cortez has three million Twitter followers now.

At the age of 55, you hit a severe midlife crisis, so severe that you suddenly decide to leave your wife and four kids for another woman. Then you get so carried away with your new mistress that you text her pictures of your genitals, and then those pictures wind up in the hands of a tabloid. Whoa, nightmare. What happens next? Do the media attack you as a pathetic old creep? Maybe even a harasser? Do they #MeToo you? Or do journalists instead rally to your defense? Well, that all depends on how rich you are. Luckily for him, Jeff Bezos is very rich, the richest man in the world in fact, and when you're as rich as Jeff Bezos is, there is no such thing as bad press coverage. There is only slobbering. Bob Woodward sucked up first. Woodward is the most famous journalist in America. He once took down a President with the unsparing toughness of his reporting. According to \"Axios,\" here's what Bob Woodward wrote to Jeff Bezos after Bezos' crotch shots became public quote, \"Jeff, proud of you for stepping forward. It's such a difficult situation. Very gutsy and definitely right. This period reminds me of 1972 to 1974, perhaps, Watergate Redux. So many assaults on constitutional government common sense and privacy. Let's hope we all get it right -- aggressive, but careful and fair. Cheers and best, Bob Woodward.\" So that's the new Woodward standard. If you criticize Jeff Bezos you're like Richard Nixon during Watergate, an assaulter of constitutional government, you're un-American, in fact. Max Boot agrees with that. Boot is another of Bezos' employees at the \"Washington Post\" and of course a florid toady. Boot wrote a column defending Bezos' nude selfies. The headline was, \"Jeff Bezos stands his ground.\" Stands his ground like Joshua Chamberlain at the Battle of Little Round Top. May our grandchildren revere his memory and speak his name. But for pure anxiousness, no one went further than \"New York Times\" technology columnist, Kara Swisher. Swisher has been sucking up to billionaires since before the guys who run Uber were even born. If flattering the powerful was an Olympic event, Kara Swisher would be Mark Spitz. According to Swisher, Bezos' behavior since he left his wife and kids for his mistress has been quote, \"admirable\" a quote, \"heroic moment\" from quote, \"the most important tech visionary since Steve Jobs.\" It goes on like this pornographically for an entire column. At one point -- this is the best -- Swisher frets that Jeff Bezos' privacy has been violated by the \"National Enquirer\" which by the way is true, but tellingly, she didn't spend a lot of time worrying about whether America's privacy has been violated by Jeff Bezos. And that seemed like a worthwhile question to ask. Glenn Greenwald has been thinking about it a lot recently, and he joins us tonight. So that was the first thing -- I'm going to say clearly, I totally disapprove of what the \"National Enquirer\" did to Jeff Bezos. I do.

It's a major source of Jeff Bezos' wealth and power. And, you know, we think of Amazon through their branding that it's a place we buy our books from, or download or Kindle from, in fact, their main business is working with the security state agencies to build huge apparatuses of the surveillance state that invade our privacy in ways far more severe than what the \"National Enquirer\" just did to Jeff Bezos.

Some former staffer said Klobuchar forced them to perform bizarre personal duties like washing her dishes or picking up or dry cleaning. That's not in the job description. Klobuchar's reputation from mistreating staff is so widespread that at least three perspective campaign managers refuse to work for her. When ABC News confronted Klobuchar with these allegations, she essentially admitted it. She said quote, \"I am tough. I push people. That's true.\" So let's see. Here, you have a person who routinely claims to care far more than you do about other people, and yet the people she's actually in charge of, she mistreats. Sound like anyone you know? It does.

So I think we actually need to pull a bit more pressure on employers to say, \"You know what? Why don't you find a way to make this work with people we have here and invest in in making Americans more productive so it's good for business and good for workers?\""

What is America supposed to look like? What do you actually want to see?\" So I said, \"I have that.\" I just -- you know, in a short essay in the middle of a campaign. I didn't put everything I know in it. So I was asked to republish the \"Flight 93 Election,\" and I said I'd be happy to do that. But I want to add some new material at the beginning to say this is what we should be fighting for. This is the America that we're at risk of losing that we need to be fighting for and why it's good. Why the older American principles are sound, and we need to return to them as part of going forward toward a better future for our people. Some of that also means we need to go back to a better way of understanding politics, common citizenship, an elite that cares about the people that you've criticized, and I completely agree with your criticism that they're mercenaries. They don't really care about what's happening to the people in the country nearly as much as they should, if at all, we need to go back to that. So some -- in some ways, the way forward is a way back and I tried to sketch that in the new material."

So that's -- why do they tell -- why do the people in charge tell us constantly that anything that happened before is wrong and we shouldn't learn from it or know about it? All we should do is be ashamed of it. Why do you think they say that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANTON",
      "utterance": "Because they don't want to change course at all, because they're benefiting from the current system. They like it. They know that a lot of people are unhappy with it. That's what the 2016 election was all about. And they want to just tamp down that justified -- some of it is anger, some of its uneasiness, whatever you want to call it, there's a lot of justified discontent and they want to tamp that down and say, illegitimate. If you disagree with or if you don't like any aspect of the current system, it just means you're bad and racist and evil, and you want to go back to, you know, segregation and so on. And so, the only way we can do it is to keep doing exactly what we're doing now. And if you disagree, you're bad."

    {
      "speaker": "ANTON",
      "utterance": "I think they think it can go on forever. I don't believe it can go on forever because one of the points that I make in the book is I believe there is nature. Nature poses limits to human beings into what we can accomplish. And what we're seeing now is this project is bumping up against natural limits, and they're starting to find that they can't do everything that they want to do. I mean, a great example which you've talked about a lot in the last couple days is the Green New Deal program. Leave aside everything else you want to say about the Green New Deal program. I just don't think it's within the realm of possibility and the laws of physics that they can find some way to get rid of all fossil fuels and not make the country dramatically --"

We're going to ask Richard Goodstein who served, as you know, as an advisor to Bill Clinton. He joins us tonight. So Richard, I tried to get the answer this from Enrique Acevedo, he wasn't honest enough to even acknowledge my question. But if we're going to say that the government can only hold a certain number of illegal aliens, why don't we make the same allowance, the same liberal allowance for American citizens."

Every expert will tell you there is no wall to finish. But there are barriers and we should reinforce them and Democrats are for beds to basically house people who are true national security threats, okay, but not moms and dads who have been in the community for 30 years, go to church, pay taxes, have kids who are Americans, those people shouldn't be in those beds."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

They're separated from their kids, but nobody cares because they're just Americans, they can just shut up and die, but why shouldn't we arrest and detain anyone who commits a crime?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right. The 88% according to the DHS. DHS numbers out today, 88% have been either convicted of or charged with and typically you detain especially if it's a non-citizen who is a flight risk, you detain people until you either convict or acquit them, right? So 88% of crimes not related to their immigration status, that's a lot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, but I think what the Democrats are trying to do and we'll see what comes out of this negotiation, was basically say, \"Let's go after national security threats,\" okay. The mom who basically engaged in some speeding violation is not that and shouldn't be taking up a bed for somebody who's -- look, if we have another shutdown, border agents aren't being paid, DEA agents. The FBI who is prosecuting MS-13. They are not getting paid."
