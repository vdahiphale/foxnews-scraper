So, I think there has a shift. If you look at the polling overall in the last six weeks, the polling clearly has now gone to the point where most Americans favor impeachment inquiry for sure, but also impeach and removal.  So, I think there's an appetite for law and order, Jesse, for Congress to do its constitutional duty which is hold the executive accountable, to say no man in this country including the president is above the law.   You know, it's still the case, every time I listen to the president's defenses I think, well, a minute ago he was saying he wants them to vote to have an inquiry on the record. So last week they voted. And now he's moving the ball now he's saying, oh, the whistleblower. Nothing the whistleblower, why doesn't he disclose who he is?

Impeachment would be great for the Democrats and the media or mad, as I like to call them. If you needed something to keep busy, but you don't. You got primaries, you got an election, and you got Trump. So the Democrats are deliberately handicapping themselves with a losing battle. It's collusion times 10. This is going to have an emotional fallout that's way worse than like the bachelor at the very end getting a no.  Because they're going to put so much on this. It's just like how the collusion thing destroyed them for months. You know, they couldn't leave their homes. He is going to get, there is going to be no Watergate and he's going to win reelection. What are you going to do then? This is the most transparent conspiracy in history, and secret phone call done in public which tells you the intent.

It's just too much impact. So, you lessen the impact by slow rolling it. But on the substance of it, I agree. Spray painting and shoplifting or getting caught with a little weed. That's not a felony. That's a misdemeanor. Although, the prison reform that Trump passed, a lot of people are a little nervous about it, because they said it was just going to be nonviolent drug offenders and they released 3100 of them.

Well, I guess so because the president is out there stirring up his base by, you know, just straight up telling lies about impeachment and process and attacking the whistle -- you just saw it. I mean, you saw the video we showed at the top of this. But the Fox poll that we had at yesterday it's 49 percent say not only do they want him impeached, they want him removed. So, I think there has a shift. If you look at the polling overall in the last six weeks, the polling clearly has now gone to the point where most Americans favor impeachment inquiry for sure, but also impeach and removal. So, I think there's an appetite for law and order, Jesse, for Congress to do its constitutional duty which is hold the executive accountable, to say no man in this country including the president is above the law. You know, it's still the case, every time I listen to the president's defenses I think, well, a minute ago he was saying he wants them to vote to have an inquiry on the record. So last week they voted. And now he's moving the ball now he's saying, oh, the whistleblower. Nothing the whistleblower, why doesn't he disclose who he is? What happened to the -- well, the fact is everything the whistleblower said has been corroborated. Now he's trying to prevent people from going to testify in impeachment."

Final point. Right now, we reach where the multiple end in a row, all three markets reaching an all-time high. And what drives markets? Consumers. Seventy percent of it is driven by consumers.

Now you have a leader who punches back. And everyone's going like, my God, did you see what he said? Yes. Because it bothers you that he's not taking it lying down. Pelosi's vote should tell you everything about the circus. It's going to fail. We know that. Not a single Republican voted for the inquiry. Despite the media and the never-Trumpers publicly dreaming and wishing it to be so. So that's going to bode well for the Senate. It's going to be DOA and it's going to be a self-destructive folly. Impeachment would be great for the Democrats and the media or mad, as I like to call them. If you needed something to keep busy, but you don't. You got primaries, you got an election, and you got Trump. So the Democrats are deliberately handicapping themselves with a losing battle. It's collusion times 10. This is going to have an emotional fallout that's way worse than like the bachelor at the very end getting a no. Because they're going to put so much on this. It's just like how the collusion thing destroyed them for months. You know, they couldn't leave their homes. He is going to get, there is going to be no Watergate and he's going to win reelection. What are you going to do then? This is the most transparent conspiracy in history, and secret phone call done in public which tells you the intent. What's the -- Trump didn't think it was illegal because it wasn't. So, it's not that he's above the law, it's that he's also not beneath the law. You can't come up after him.

And according to The New York Post, they're going to be getting some perks, \"Mayor Bill de Blasio is promising to follow-up with even more presence for the lucky accused criminals by giving them free baseball tickets, movie passes and gift cards to encourage them to return to court.\" Emily, I was just reading here, it says voters approved a state question in 2016 that made simple drug possession and low-level property crimes, misdemeanors instead of felonies in Oklahoma.

Oklahoma has the largest incarceration population in the country, including women, which is the fastest-growing population. Not anymore. Because of this, they are reducing costs by 12 million. They are having a job fair for their inmates upon release. So, Oklahoma is doing everything right. They're recognizing the converging factors and they're recognizing what the voters want. New York and de Blasio, who is an idiot with this. This is bail reform. These defendants have not been convicted. They are waiting for trial.

I would not release them all out on the same day. I would slow roll it, maybe do one at a time, one each day for a year. It's like funneling a beer. You do it that way, it goes straight to your head. All of the prisons in Oklahoma are around Oklahoma City. You release all 400 of these guys on the same day, they're probably going to ride in the same cars, go to the same bars on the same night. It's just too much impact. So, you lessen the impact by slow rolling it. But on the substance of it, I agree. Spray painting and shoplifting or getting caught with a little weed. That's not a felony. That's a misdemeanor. Although, the prison reform that Trump passed, a lot of people are a little nervous about it, because they said it was just going to be nonviolent drug offenders and they released 3100 of them. It turns out a couple hundred rape, robbery, some serious stuff, these guys are being let out. So, I think we just need to assess exactly what's going on."

And I think there's probably a lot of good people in there that got caught up in things like writing a bad check and then you write another bad check and it compounds itself. But I also think that the great way to reduce prison populations is to prevent crime. And I'm afraid in all of these discussions about reform, we're also not talking about how do you continue to keep the streets safe. And I don't know about the bail thing. I don't know enough about that in New York, but I'm pretty sure there is a lot more that needs to be done in terms of preventing crime. I've watched the local news every Saturday and Sunday, it is stunning like how much violent crime is happening all across the city and this is probably replicated in all the other cities that I've lived in, Denver, Washington, D.C., San Diego.

The reason given for this idiocy is saving fuel. But when it's been studied, it shows no energy savings at all. In fact, independent groups show the opposite. Hell, you want to conserve energy, take a nap in the afternoon. That's what Jesse does every day. People also say, it reduces traffic accidents, driving during the day is safer than at night. But research shows the day after we change the times, there is an 8 percent uptick in fatal accidents. Yet we still abide, probably because we assume the government has our best interests in mind. When in reality, they make mistakes that become permanent and make half the country feel like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh. By the way, there's also a jump in workplace accidents and heart attacks after the time changed. So, yes, here is yet more proof that the scariest sentence in the world is, I'm from the government and I'm here to help. Jesse, I know that you hate Daylight Savings Time and Epstein did not commit suicide."

And then in 12 years, when 2 PM is like 2 AM., you'll wipe the slate clean and then you start over again. It doesn't really matter. Time is a social construct."

He's at Central Park and there he is looking at the Dakota building, let's see Jasper up close. And then I just have to show you, that's him and it's Times Square because we couldn't go to the park, because of the marathon. And then this is him with his little ear stuck straight out.
