Among the more than 6,000 people who are currently listed missing, are 23 relatives of the famous actor Sidney Poitier.

So, this is one of the private airports in Nassau, where we have seen reunions happen.  People, finally, after days trapped on Abaco Island, trapped in Grand Bahama, they have made it here. Behind me, you can hear the helicopter on the other side of this bay. This bay inside here is where they have been bringing people, they come off of the helicopter on the other side. They come through this area to get medical treatment. Many are then put in ambulances and taken to hospitals in town for further treatment.  One person I met today told me it was like a nightmare when she left her home in Abaco. Another woman told me that once the water finally receded after she had spent 15 hours huddled in a corner, hoping to avoid some of the debris coming into her home, her sister said there was a dead body on their yard, they didn't know what to do, so they grabbed a bed sheet and covered it up waiting for the authorities to come and perhaps, get it.  That's what we keep hearing from people. They keep saying that there are bodies that there are so many more deaths than we know. One woman alone, I met today, Martha, told me, 32 members of her family were still missing.  She came to this airport hoping for some indication of where any of them were.

As the Cat 5 hurricane was bearing down on Great Abaco Island, hurricane chaser Josh Morgerman wrote to his 80,000 Twitter followers, \"I feel like a rocket is about to take off,\" and \"This is going to get ugly.\" He was right on both counts.  He also reported the schoolhouse where he was staying was near the hurricanes eyewall. In other words, where the winds are the highest and most destructive. He relayed to his followers how the children were being moved to a safe space and being wrapped in blankets. But then, Morgerman, social media play-by-play went dark for two days.  During which time, Dorian crushed the Bahamas with 185-mile per hour winds.  But while the winds were moving at speeds of a NASCAR vehicle, the hurricane itself was mercilessly stalled, and the islands were pummeled for days. Many feared that Josh Morgerman didn't make it. Then, on Tuesday evening, his Twitter feed came back online with this quote, \"Yep, I'm alive. By far, the most intense cyclone I've witnessed in 28 years of chasing. Thought I was playing it safe by riding it out in a solid-concrete school on a hill in Marsh Harbour. Thought wrong.\"   He then compared the storm to being in a washing machine during maximum winds, and that description, as you said, from a man who's seen the inner core of four dozen hurricanes, by choice, not smart you say, maybe, but he's also a Harvard educated historian who worked in the film industry and started his own branding and advertising company.  Apparently, generating glitz and glam, and got nothing on natural forces of nature. And if you ever find yourself evacuating a storm, Josh Morgerman is the guy coming the other way, followed by Steve Harrigan. Martha.",

Just to put that into perspective, that's not just Cat 5 that's way into Cat 5. So, Hurricane Michael, which devastated the Florida Panhandle in October was 160. So, this was a whole magnitude beyond that. What that means is when you're in solid-concrete building, you're not even safe.  We were in a school, which was a designated shelter. And the wind was so intense that actually some of the concrete was smashed, and at the height of the storm, you couldn't see anything. Everything was white, all you heard was crashing. The windows were blowing and we're holding furniture against the shutters to keep them from caving in. We barely made it to the eye, which is the calm center. And then when we came outside, the cars in the parking lot just thrown every direction mangled like they'd been in a blender. This all from the force of the wind.

After reviewing surveillance footage federal air marshal, a man with a limp getting out of a truck and accessing the 737's navigation compartment for roughly seven minutes. They quickly seized on Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani whose been a mechanic at American Airlines for 31 years. Court records say Alani told investigators that, quote, \"his intention was not to cause harm to the aircraft or its passengers. Instead, he claims he wanted the jet taken out of service so he could get over time.\" He Also admits that he's upset over stalled contract negotiations between the 12,000-employee mechanics union and the airline. And the dispute has been costing him money. It's no secret the negotiations have resulted in ugly threats and bitter legal battles, but the union said it is shocked by the allegations, quoting ere. \"If these allegations of sabotage are true, they are outrageous and indefensible and we fully condemn such action. Our mechanics are highly trained professionals who are dedicated to performing at the highest standards in the industry and we will not tolerate anything less.\" And aviation experts will tell you that even if the suspect didn't intent to harm anyone, in recent years at least two airplane crashes have resulted in part from pilots not knowing the speed or the pitch of the aircraft. Alani is expected to be indicted on a sabotage related charged by a federal grand jury.

I mean, I just cannot imagine. I cannot imagine the pain that this man is going through today and so many others. Among the more than 6,000 people who are currently listed missing, are 23 relatives of the famous actor Sidney Poitier. Another 70,000 are in urgent need at this hour of food, and shelter, and water, as you heard. Senators Marco Rubio, Rick Scott, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis went there today. They are urging the federal government to do more to aid this extraordinary humanitarian crisis. Let's go straight to correspondent Ellison Barber, who is in Nassau tonight.

So, this is one of the private airports in Nassau, where we have seen reunions happen.  People, finally, after days trapped on Abaco Island, trapped in Grand Bahama, they have made it here. Behind me, you can hear the helicopter on the other side of this bay. This bay inside here is where they have been bringing people, they come off of the helicopter on the other side. They come through this area to get medical treatment. Many are then put in ambulances and taken to hospitals in town for further treatment. One person I met today told me it was like a nightmare when she left her home in Abaco. Another woman told me that once the water finally receded after she had spent 15 hours huddled in a corner, hoping to avoid some of the debris coming into her home, her sister said there was a dead body on their yard, they didn't know what to do, so they grabbed a bed sheet and covered it up waiting for the authorities to come and perhaps, get it. That's what we keep hearing from people. They keep saying that there are bodies that there are so many more deaths than we know. One woman alone, I met today, Martha, told me, 32 members of her family were still missing.  She came to this airport hoping for some indication of where any of them were. When we spoke to her, she still was waiting to try and getting answers. Martha?"

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. As the Cat 5 hurricane was bearing down on Great Abaco Island, hurricane chaser Josh Morgerman wrote to his 80,000 Twitter followers, \"I feel like a rocket is about to take off,\" and \"This is going to get ugly.\" He was right on both counts. He also reported the schoolhouse where he was staying was near the hurricanes eyewall. In other words, where the winds are the highest and most destructive. He relayed to his followers how the children were being moved to a safe space and being wrapped in blankets. But then, Morgerman, social media play-by-play went dark for two days.  During which time, Dorian crushed the Bahamas with 185-mile per hour winds.  But while the winds were moving at speeds of a NASCAR vehicle, the hurricane itself was mercilessly stalled, and the islands were pummeled for days. Many feared that Josh Morgerman didn't make it. Then, on Tuesday evening, his Twitter feed came back online with this quote, \"Yep, I'm alive. By far, the most intense cyclone I've witnessed in 28 years of chasing. Thought I was playing it safe by riding it out in a solid-concrete school on a hill in Marsh Harbour. Thought wrong.\" He then compared the storm to being in a washing machine during maximum winds, and that description, as you said, from a man who's seen the inner core of four dozen hurricanes, by choice, not smart you say, maybe, but he's also a Harvard educated historian who worked in the film industry and started his own branding and advertising company. Apparently, generating glitz and glam, and got nothing on natural forces of nature. And if you ever find yourself evacuating a storm, Josh Morgerman is the guy coming the other way, followed by Steve Harrigan. Martha."

      "utterance": "Unbelievable. I mean, it was, yes, I've been in so many hurricanes and I get accustomed to them on occasion. But this thing had sustained winds of 185 miles an hour. Just to put that into perspective, that's not just Cat 5 that's way into Cat 5. So, Hurricane Michael, which devastated the Florida Panhandle in October was 160. So, this was a whole magnitude beyond that. What that means is when you're in solid-concrete building, you're not even safe. We were in a school, which was a designated shelter. And the wind was so intense that actually some of the concrete was smashed, and at the height of the storm, you couldn't see anything. Everything was white, all you heard was crashing. The windows were blowing and we're holding furniture against the shutters to keep them from caving in. We barely made it to the eye, which is the calm center. And then when we came outside, the cars in the parking lot just thrown every direction mangled like they'd been in a blender. This all from the force of the wind. And we had to relocate to another building before the backside came."

Because some folks who were caught out in it were killed by flying debris. So, we didn't know, and we had to take a gamble, and we drove, we all piled into three cars. One of which was mine because those are the only three that we're working. Thank God we had working cars, we managed to get a mile away to a government building we rode it out. But that was a factor, in one side we wanted to just stay put because I did not want to be caught out in that --"

      "utterance": "So, at the height of the storm when the windows started -- the boards blew off the windows, the shutter started to cave in, we're holding chairs against the windows. And I realized that those, those shutters blew in, we were going to have a 185-mile an hour, basically, the room is going to become a shooting gallery. So, I thought, OK, the kids, like, we wrapped them in blankets. I've been in so many emergencies like this, not this bad but ones like this and I've just -- I know exactly what to do. So, I said, get the kids away from windows, wrap them in blankets, and we put them under a table. So, even if like all hell broke loose inside the room, kids would probably be safe."

You know, Hurricane Michael, again, the one that hit the Florida Panhandle, we had two hours of violent winds and anything lifted out, and then, the next morning it was sunny and hot. This one, after the core of the hurricane passed, the really scary stuff, two solid days of tropical storm conditions. Meaning, heavy rain, really gusty winds.

But when the pilots were powering up the engines getting ready for taxi an error light came on and they took the jet back to the gate. Then during inspection, a mechanic found that a tube in the plane's navigation system had been deliberately obstructed with foam, which means the pilots would not have known the aircraft speed, pitch, and other critical data. After reviewing surveillance footage federal air marshal, a man with a limp getting out of a truck and accessing the 737's navigation compartment for roughly seven minutes. They quickly seized on Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani whose been a mechanic at American Airlines for 31 years. Court records say Alani told investigators that, quote, \"his intention was not to cause harm to the aircraft or its passengers. Instead, he claims he wanted the jet taken out of service so he could get over time.\" He Also admits that he's upset over stalled contract negotiations between the 12,000-employee mechanics union and the airline. And the dispute has been costing him money. It's no secret the negotiations have resulted in ugly threats and bitter legal battles, but the union said it is shocked by the allegations, quoting ere. \"If these allegations of sabotage are true, they are outrageous and indefensible and we fully condemn such action. Our mechanics are highly trained professionals who are dedicated to performing at the highest standards in the industry and we will not tolerate anything less.\" And aviation experts will tell you that even if the suspect didn't intent to harm anyone, in recent years at least two airplane crashes have resulted in part from pilots not knowing the speed or the pitch of the aircraft. Alani is expected to be indicted on a sabotage related charged by a federal grand jury.

      "utterance": "So, it has now been one year, can you believe it, since Christine Blasey Ford came forward with bombshell allegations of sexual misconduct that nearly derailed Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Now in a newly surfaced video, her attorney who became quite well known at that time, Debra Katz admitted that the fight was motivated at least in part by Roe v. Wade. Watch this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATZ",
      "utterance": "I believe that Christine's testimony brought about more good than the harm misogynist Republicans caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court. He will always have an asterisk next to his name. When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, that we know what motivates him. And that was part of what motivated Christine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And that was part of what motivated Christine. Very interesting, right? Here now for ladies' night, Gerri Willis, Lisa Boothe, and Jessica Tarlov. Because we were all told that the thing that motivate Christine was the horrible thing that happened to her when she was in high school at a party at a place that she couldn't remember and said that people were there who witnessed it, who nobody -- nobody could corroborate her story. And that was part of the reason it fell, Lisa. But obviously, there was another motive here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Deborah Katz is a resistor. She had told ABC at an anti-Trump rally we will resist. In fact, all of the attorneys that these accusers had acquired all are Democratic donors and Democrat attorneys. But I think it further undermines and erodes any credibility Christine Ford ever had. I mean, by the time the Washington Post even went to print with her original story she had already given multiple versions of the event. She lied about her fear of flying, she lied about the reason why her and her husband had a second door in their house. She also her own best friend Leland Kaiser also denied being an eyewitness and then later reportedly told the FBI that she felt pressured by Christine Ford's friends to change her story. So, I do not think Christine -- Christine Ford has never had credibility in my eyes, but this further erodes whatever she had."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, it does, you know, it also reminded me and she -- this attorney Debra Katz also said, \"we must ponder the very real possibility that Dr. Ford had she not come from the same background, the same race, the same class, the same country club as Brett Kavanaugh, basically she would not have been -- she would have been given this opportunity, which is interesting given the fact, Jessica, that Dianne Feinstein sat on this allegation for such a long time. And then decided, you know, when there was all of this sort of surfacing that it was time to bring this forward at the very last minute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, that was Christine Ford's wish, right? Dr. Ford had said from the get-go that she went to her congresswoman and then it got kicked up to Dianne Feinstein and she said I am not interested in what ended up happening to her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Because I want to just make you aware of the fact that this man who may very well turn out -- this is when the list just existed, he hadn't even been selected and a lot people thought it was going to be Amy Coney Barrett, first of all. He might be picked and I want you to know what his background information. When I saw Debra Katz do that, I was just thinking I wonder what Dr. Ford thinks about this, because I believe having watch her testimony which people on both sides of the aisle found credible. Our own Judge Napolitano said he found Dr. Ford credible and Brett Kavanaugh edible. There President of the United States of America, remember, Donald Trump even said that he thought that she gave very compelling testimony. I'm curious as to what she thinks about that because I think that she would return to her original story which is, I just wanted to put up a warning signal, that this is not a person who I believe should have one of the most important job in the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I mean, the challenge, she was co-opted by people who wanted to turn it into a political event and Dianne Feinstein push that, you know, forward as you say against her original will. So, do you think, Gerri, that she was used by people who wanted to make a statement about Roe v. Wade?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "I always thought that was a possibility. And of course, any time you say Roe v. Wade it's like yelling fire in a theater, I mean, the whole world blows up, and this whole idea that this could even been a possibility that she would have used this Roe v. Wade to bring this up? This is like the level of civility in this country has virtually disappeared, gone through the floor and that's what I find so concerning right now. We're always arguing we're never coming to consensus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's talk about Marianne Williamson who had the audacity to say that she was praying for the people who were in the path of the hurricane. She got mocked on Twitter for this. She originally said, you know, \"The Bahamas, Florida, Georgia, and Carolinas may they all be in our prayers now. Millions of us seen Dorian turn away from land, it's not a wacky idea, it's a creative use of the power of the mind.\" You know, she went on to say that she is concerned, basically, that other candidates in the Democrat Party have alienated people who believe in prayer. She said I grew up in Texas, you know, and to me this is a very -- this is a normal thing to suggest that perhaps we should all pray for these people to be safe in the path of this. Why is that so derided, Jessica?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "So, I think there are two kinds of prayer at work here. So, there is the pray for the people who have been affected, which I think that we can all get on board however that you pray or you think of people spiritually traditionally. But then I think people were taking issue with the idea that you could have by the power -- harnessing the power of our minds we could've change the course of it. The Democrat Party right now, especially with what's going on with gun violence in this country, has a very difficult time with the thoughts and prayers argument, right? That's what we feel that we get from Republicans all the time instead of meaningful change on gun control issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's like, but praying in general is considered something that is weird, --"

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "But I don't --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- I think. I mean, I don't understand it, personally. I mean, I think that the idea that -- you know, Marianne Williamson actually re- tweeted FDR's prayer the night before D-Day, and I thought would that ever happen? You know, would there ever be a president who would say to the whole nation, OK, I need to bring you altogether, we are all going to pray together. And she is saying if Democrats don't start recognizing the fact that a lot of people in this country would like that, that they are going to lose. That's what she said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIS",
      "utterance": "Look, I'm from the south. I don't understand the negative reaction against prayer. I know churches and communities all over this country have done such positive things for the people who are members, the people who are not members. My own mother who worked in hospice care for years as a volunteer told me over and over again about the power of prayer for those patients that she worked with. That the kinds of things that could happen to her were astonishing. So, to dismiss this belief is fundamentally wrong in space."

    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there's going to be a large portion of Evangelical Christians that will never vote for Democrats, primary for the reason of abortions which we talked about earlier that they view as murder. But I will say regarding the power of prayer, it is real. I mean, why do you think we often hear with in times of a hurricane, or in a mass shooting, what do people say when they are being interviewed. They said, I prayed to God to save me. I prayed for my life. I prayed to God. So, if prayer isn't powerful, then why is it such a crisis and dire situation do they turn to God? So, I do think that prayer is incredibly powerful. I also wish I could say prayer as opposed to keeping saying payer."

      "utterance": "So, speaking of the power of prayer and positivity, Gerri Willis is the embodiment of that around here. And we all prayed for you during your bout with breast cancer and you revealed in an editorial this morning that you just had a recent scare as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIS",
      "utterance": "So, it wasn't breast cancer, so that's not what I was facing. It was precancer cells on my cervix, and of course this was revealed in a routine test that I took. We took care of it, I had a biopsy, I had a surgery. In surgery we remove those cancer cells and we took a look around and there were no more cancer cells. So that is very good news indeed. But I have to tell you, all of that brought me right back to the diagnosis of breast cancer, stage three lobular, and the fear and the anxiety, and knowing this one this weekend and I would be seeing so many women who have been impacted and hear so many stories from people I work with, from guards at the at the New York Stock Exchange tell me about their mother, their sister who have died of breast cancer, it just took me right back there and I feel even more committed."

And I attach myself to you and your -- our whole group here when we started running. So, I'm going to run, my daughter is going to run, you know, my sisters will probably be there as well. It's a wonderful event that we are so proud to support, Gerri."
