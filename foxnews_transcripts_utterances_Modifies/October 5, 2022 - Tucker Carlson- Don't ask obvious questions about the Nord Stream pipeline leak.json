      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. There are few things more infuriating than being lied to by your own government, the government you pay for, the one your ancestors risked their lives to protect. Does that happen to you? Of course, it has. It enrages you. But if it happens again and again, if it happens often enough, if your government makes a habit of lying to you, then over time it becomes something else. Over time, you realize you're not really living in a democracy. You can't be because in a democracy, the government has a moral and legal obligation to tell you the truth always. Period. That makes sense because in a democracy, you are not a subject or a mere consumer, you're a citizen. You are a shareholder in the system. You are an owner of it. The people who run your government are your employees. They're like your cleaning lady. You may appreciate the work they do, \"Good job,\" but the minute you catch them stealing your cufflinks, you fire them. Those are the rules because it's your house, not theirs. But what if the rules were inverted? What if you caught an employee stealing, but instead of seeming ashamed and penitent, he whipped around and attacked you like you were the criminal? Well, that is the experience of watching White House spokesman, John Kirby talk about the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines. Anyone who imagines, who thinks for a moment the Biden administration was in any way involved with that sabotage, directly or indirectly, is not simply wrong, no. Anyone who imagines that is a bad person, a tool of Vladimir Putin. Watch.",

That's what John Kirby said. It's disinformation from quislings more loyal to Vladimir Putin than our own country. That's the kind of thing the only truly bad people say. Okay, if the White House says so, obviously we have no choice but to believe it, but you still have to wonder not everyone does believe that. Why? Where might some Americans have gotten the notion that the Biden administration might have been involved directly or through a proxy in the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines? Why would they think that? They certainly didn't watch it on Russia Today. RT has been pulled off the air. They didn't hear it from Putin or any of his ministers. You can barely find anything from the Russian government on Google and of course, any book sympathetic to Putin has been banned on Amazon. In fact, every piece of information that reflects the modern Russian point of view has been censored in the United States because this is a free country fighting for democracy. You just can't read what you want or think what you want. So actually, if you think about it, if Americans are deluded about what happened to the Nord Stream pipeline, the delusion didn't come from Moscow because there's no way for Moscow to get this disinformation to the United States because the US government has blocked it along with the tech companies. So, where did that idea come from? Why might they think that? Well, maybe they learned it from Joe Biden himself. He's the President. Here's Biden this winter on American television pledging to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines if Russia does something he doesn't want them to do. Watch.",

We will put an end to it.\" And the reporter says, \"But wait a second, it's not your pipeline. How will you be able to do that?\" So, he has a chance to reframe the question, to revise his answer, to be more precise, but he doesn't. He says flat out, \"I promise you will be able to take out Nord Stream.\" Joe Biden, President of the United States. So, there's that clue and that is as if that wasn't enough, last week, last Friday, the Secretary of State in the Biden administration, Mr. Tony Blinken, bragged about how great the sabotage of Nord Stream was and we're quoting \"It's a tremendous opportunity,\" said Tony Blinken. It's a great thing, not a tragedy, a victory, something we're in favor of. We're excited about it. Destroy the natural gas pipeline? We're for that. So, that might be another clue that the Biden administration may have had something to do with it. Oh, but no, says the White House, despite the fact that we promised we would do it, and then we crowed about how great it was after it happened, we had nothing at all to do with it. Who did it? Well, Russia did it. They blew up their own pipeline, making their own country poorer and weaker in the middle of a major war because that is how crazy, but also diabolically effective the Russians are: Suicidal, yet brilliant. And if you don't buy that story uncritically, if you have any questions about how exactly that might work, you're a disloyal American. Shut up.

It's exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. He wants you to blame the Biden administration for something he did. That's the bipartisan view in Washington. What's interesting is they don't really know that. They have no evidence that that's true. Briefers from the Intel Agencies have, as of this afternoon, told Members of Congress they have no idea who committed industrial terrorism against these pipelines. Now, that itself is a lie, of course. The CIA has no idea at all? Right, they have no idea, but as far as Members of Congress, Chris Stewart and Seth Moulton know, there is no evidence either way. They have no facts. That is a fact. They have no facts. So, again, as a factual matter, neither of those guys nor any Member of Congress, no matter what Committee they sit on, has any idea who did this, but if you suggest the obvious, Russia probably didn't do it, because why would they do it, it's against their own interest, no matter what dumb story you're trying to sell us, if you suggest that, if you apply commonsense, you're evil, and then they go farther and say things that are like completely implausible. Seth Moulton and we're quoting, \"The last thing we want is to raise gas prices in Europe.\" Really? Seth Moulton, is that true? Because isn't the Biden administration philosophically opposed to low gas prices? Aren't they opposed to all fossil fuels? Oh, right, they are. How do we know that? Is that Russian propaganda? No, because we can't read Russian propaganda because it's been banned in favor of our propaganda. We know that because Joe Biden himself has said so many times on television. Okay. So maybe there is a motive here. Maybe there's more than one motive, but don't ask because, warned the media, asking obvious questions is forbidden. Watch.",

There was a moment after it was very clear that the war in Iraq was not helping the United States in any way and in fact, hurting the core interests of the United States that the media engaged in a rare nanosecond of self-reflection. How do we get here? What role did we, for example, \"The New York Times,\" play in convincing the public that Saddam had WMD when he didn't? For that one moment you thought, \"Wow, maybe they're learning something. Maybe they won't do it again.\" But it turns out the opposite happened. Now, they're just completely doubling down on what's very obviously a lie and attacking anyone who asks to hear it explained rationally. And it's not just the media, by the way. DC think tanks, whose purpose is long in doubt, like what's the point of a DC think tank? Oh, to run interference for the ruling class, to bolster the regime, to be Pretorian Guard. The Brookings Institution filled that role for many years. They just produced this analysis: \"US podcasters spread Kremlin narratives on Nord Stream sabotage.\" What's interesting about this analysis is that nowhere in it does the august Brookings Institution rebut the evidence that the US or a proxy of the Biden administration had something to do with this. There's in fact, no evidence either way. Instead, they just attack anybody who ask questions. \"The theories pushed by these podcast hosts align with Kremlin messaging.\" Oh, align with Kremlin messaging? They used to be called guilt by association. Vladimir Putin likes dogs. What? You like dogs? What are you, a Russian sympathizer? Right. Okay, in alliance with Russian propaganda. So, the point is, it doesn't matter whether or not it's true, it aligns with Kremlin messaging. Therefore, you must be censored. But not everybody got the memo. There are tucked away in the deep recesses of American society, a few honest liberals still left. Maybe they've been, I don't know, in St. Barts for the last three years and didn't realize that you can no longer exercise free speech in this country. One of them is a Professor at Columbia called Jeffrey Sachs. So, he went to Bloomberg the other day and was asked about the Nord Stream pipelines and he decided to respond rationally and he said, well, actually, there's quite a bit of evidence of the Biden administration was involved, but rather than follow up, the anchor, realizing that forbidden topics were being broached -- oh, we're not allowed to talk about this -- just shut down the segment, but not before Jeffrey Sachs said this.",

They are the same ones who told us that Russia installed Trump in the White House and blackmailed him with a pee tape, who told us that Russia plays bounties on US troops in Afghanistan, that Russia was injuring US diplomats with supersonic microwave weapons, and that Russia invented the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop. And we're supposed to take now their claims on faith, when, by the way, at the same time, for many years, those who've been opposing the pipeline, including many of those now accusing Russia, of blowing it up, have been telling us the reason they're opposed to it is because it gives Russia leverage over Europe by controlling its energy supply. So, just think of it logically, why would Russia blow up its only form of leverage? It does not make any sense. Now, the reason why someone else would want to blow this up from the West, and as you noted, John Kirby, when he was asked by Bret Baier did not answer the question of whether it could have been a US proxy, he only said that the US was not involved, which to me is very revealing. And the reason why the US and its allies have been so opposed to Nord Stream for a long time is because as was recognized in the 2019 study, by the RAND Corporation, which is a US government-funded think tank, the Nord Stream was very profitable for Russia. And also if it goes through, bringing gas from Russia to Germany and the rest of Europe, that makes Europe and Germany more intertwined, which in turn makes it a lot harder to wage a proxy war and impose sanctions on Russia, and that's why this RAND study said, a first step to weakening Russia would be stopping Nord Stream 2. So the motive is there, and as you've noted, the intent was made very clear in public, but somehow we are supposed to not believe all logic and all facts and just believe, once again, that Russia is behind something that is so drastically against its own interests.",

So, that may seem hard to believe. A nuclear war? Really? That couldn't happen. Well, the Biden administration has just announced, sent out a press release from HHS that they're spending $290 million on emergency drugs to give Americans in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange. So, they think it's real. You should know that it is. Well, speaking of the military, Technician Second Class Zach Loesch is a US Coast Guard rescue swimmer. When Hurricane Ian hit Florida, Loesch and other service members hit the water and they saved lives. Last week, Joe Biden personally called Loesch to thank him: \"I told him how proud I was of him and I thanked him for all the work he and his Coasties are doing to save lives,\" Biden said, which was all true. What Biden didn't mention is that he is firing Zach Loesch. Loesch is set to be terminated within 30 to 60 days. What did he do wrong? Well, he didn't get the COVID-19 -- the thoroughly discredited COVID-19 vaccine. Instead, he submitted a request for religious exemption, but he was denied on the basis he was religious, can't have that. So Technician Second Class Zach Loesch is still active duty, but he has signed his intent to discharge papers. With sadness, we presume, he joins us now. Zach, thanks so much for coming on. This has got to be one of the saddest stories we've covered in a long time. Do we characterize it correctly? Are you really leaving because they want you to take this shot?",

We're not just saying that because it appeared on our air. If that was on MSNBC, we'd say the same thing. Holy smokes. So this guy was not an observer or a bystander, he was a business partner of the Biden family, and he provided mountains of evidence, documents showing that Hunter Biden defrauded him, committed felony fraud. He also provided evidence that Joe Biden was not unaware of this, he was directing his family's overseas influence peddling operation where they sold access to the US government, which is a felony. So, this is a guy who would know. This is a guy who can prove it and this is a guy who talked about it for almost an hour on television last night. So, what's the response been? Well, we checked in today, the White House didn't respond at all, neither did any major media organization. No television network in the United States of America said a word about it. The single response from anyone came on Twitter from a lone CNN anchor and he didn't address anything that Tony Bobulinski actually said about the Biden's; instead, he scolded Tony Bobulinski for not appearing on his network years ago. That was it. That was the sum total of response. We're listening to this. Last night, we even listened to the tape of an interview we'd done. We're thinking, \"Holy smokes. This is a bombshell.\" But no. If a bomb goes off in the forest and nobody hears it, did it explode? Apparently not. They're doing exactly what they did before the last election. We have an election next month. They're doing again. They know that what Tony Bobulinski is saying is it true, provably true. They are just going to suppress the story and act like it didn't happen and it may work. Well, there is a scandal brewing in the world of pro, fishing an arena that has relatively few scandals, thank God. Two competitors were caught stuffing lead weights and other fish filets into their fish. Now, the point of the contest is to have the heaviest total catch to win prize money. These guys would have won nearly 30 grand had they not been caught, but they were caught on tape. Their names are Jake Runyan And Chase Cominsky.

There are few things more infuriating than being lied to by your own government, the government you pay for, the one your ancestors risked their lives to protect. Does that happen to you? Of course, it has. It enrages you. But if it happens again and again, if it happens often enough, if your government makes a habit of lying to you, then over time it becomes something else. Over time, you realize you're not really living in a democracy. You can't be because in a democracy, the government has a moral and legal obligation to tell you the truth always. Period. That makes sense because in a democracy, you are not a subject or a mere consumer, you're a citizen. You are a shareholder in the system. You are an owner of it. The people who run your government are your employees. They're like your cleaning lady. You may appreciate the work they do, \"Good job,\" but the minute you catch them stealing your cufflinks, you fire them. Those are the rules because it's your house, not theirs. But what if the rules were inverted? What if you caught an employee stealing, but instead of seeming ashamed and penitent, he whipped around and attacked you like you were the criminal? Well, that is the experience of watching White House spokesman, John Kirby talk about the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines. Anyone who imagines, who thinks for a moment the Biden administration was in any way involved with that sabotage, directly or indirectly, is not simply wrong, no.

That's what John Kirby said. It's disinformation from quislings more loyal to Vladimir Putin than our own country. That's the kind of thing the only truly bad people say. Okay, if the White House says so, obviously we have no choice but to believe it, but you still have to wonder not everyone does believe that. Why? Where might some Americans have gotten the notion that the Biden administration might have been involved directly or through a proxy in the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines? Why would they think that? They certainly didn't watch it on Russia Today. RT has been pulled off the air. They didn't hear it from Putin or any of his ministers. You can barely find anything from the Russian government on Google and of course, any book sympathetic to Putin has been banned on Amazon. In fact, every piece of information that reflects the modern Russian point of view has been censored in the United States because this is a free country fighting for democracy. You just can't read what you want or think what you want. So actually, if you think about it, if Americans are deluded about what happened to the Nord Stream pipeline, the delusion didn't come from Moscow because there's no way for Moscow to get this disinformation to the United States because the US government has blocked it along with the tech companies. So, where did that idea come from? Why might they think that? Well, maybe they learned it from Joe Biden himself. He's the President. Here's Biden this winter on American television pledging to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines if Russia does something he doesn't want them to do. Watch."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, that's about as clear as it gets. Biden doesn't say we will shut it down. He just said, \"There will be no Nord Stream pipeline. We will put an end to it.\" And the reporter says, \"But wait a second, it's not your pipeline. How will you be able to do that?\" So, he has a chance to reframe the question, to revise his answer, to be more precise, but he doesn't. He says flat out, \"I promise you will be able to take out Nord Stream.\" Joe Biden, President of the United States. So, there's that clue and that is as if that wasn't enough, last week, last Friday, the Secretary of State in the Biden administration, Mr. Tony Blinken, bragged about how great the sabotage of Nord Stream was and we're quoting \"It's a tremendous opportunity,\" said Tony Blinken. It's a great thing, not a tragedy, a victory, something we're in favor of. We're excited about it. Destroy the natural gas pipeline? We're for that. So, that might be another clue that the Biden administration may have had something to do with it. Oh, but no, says the White House, despite the fact that we promised we would do it, and then we crowed about how great it was after it happened, we had nothing at all to do with it. Who did it? Well, Russia did it. They blew up their own pipeline, making their own country poorer and weaker in the middle of a major war because that is how crazy, but also diabolically effective the Russians are: Suicidal, yet brilliant. And if you don't buy that story uncritically, if you have any questions about how exactly that might work, you're a disloyal American. Shut up. Here's Chris Stewart, a Republican Member of Congress from Utah, making the very same point."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's just so great. I mean, it's perfectly bipartisan. Here you have a Republican from Utah, Chris Stewart, and a Democrat from Massachusetts, Seth Moulton, agreeing precisely. It's exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. He wants you to blame the Biden administration for something he did. That's the bipartisan view in Washington. What's interesting is they don't really know that. They have no evidence that that's true. Briefers from the Intel Agencies have, as of this afternoon, told Members of Congress they have no idea who committed industrial terrorism against these pipelines. Now, that itself is a lie, of course. The CIA has no idea at all? Right, they have no idea, but as far as Members of Congress, Chris Stewart and Seth Moulton know, there is no evidence either way. They have no facts. That is a fact. They have no facts. So, again, as a factual matter, neither of those guys nor any Member of Congress, no matter what Committee they sit on, has any idea who did this, but if you suggest the obvious, Russia probably didn't do it, because why would they do it, it's against their own interest, no matter what dumb story you're trying to sell us, if you suggest that, if you apply commonsense, you're evil, and then they go farther and say things that are like completely implausible. Seth Moulton and we're quoting, \"The last thing we want is to raise gas prices in Europe.\" Really? Seth Moulton, is that true? Because isn't the Biden administration philosophically opposed to low gas prices? Aren't they opposed to all fossil fuels? Oh, right, they are. How do we know that? Is that Russian propaganda? No, because we can't read Russian propaganda because it's been banned in favor of our propaganda. We know that because Joe Biden himself has said so many times on television. Okay. So maybe there is a motive here. Maybe there's more than one motive, but don't ask because, warned the media, asking obvious questions is forbidden. Watch."

So, their own government -- again the one they pay for, the one they supposedly control -- is doing things contrary to their interests and then lying about it. Maybe they think they have a right to know and ask obvious questions like, \"Are you lying? And if you're not lying, speak slowly and tell us how your story, the one you're expecting us to believe, makes sense.\" It's possible that asking questions is a patriotic duty of Americans. Shut up. That helps Putin. You're not allowed to say it. You're not allowed to quote the President of the United States promising to eliminate the Nord Stream pipelines.

How do we get here? What role did we, for example, \"The New York Times,\" play in convincing the public that Saddam had WMD when he didn't? For that one moment you thought, \"Wow, maybe they're learning something. Maybe they won't do it again.\" But it turns out the opposite happened. Now, they're just completely doubling down on what's very obviously a lie and attacking anyone who asks to hear it explained rationally. And it's not just the media, by the way.

      "utterance": "It's pretty amazing when you consider the track record of the people who are telling us that Russia did this. They are the same ones who told us that Russia installed Trump in the White House and blackmailed him with a pee tape, who told us that Russia plays bounties on US troops in Afghanistan, that Russia was injuring US diplomats with supersonic microwave weapons, and that Russia invented the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop. And we're supposed to take now their claims on faith, when, by the way, at the same time, for many years, those who've been opposing the pipeline, including many of those now accusing Russia, of blowing it up, have been telling us the reason they're opposed to it is because it gives Russia leverage over Europe by controlling its energy supply. So, just think of it logically, why would Russia blow up its only form of leverage? It does not make any sense. Now, the reason why someone else would want to blow this up from the West, and as you noted, John Kirby, when he was asked by Bret Baier did not answer the question of whether it could have been a US proxy, he only said that the US was not involved, which to me is very revealing. And the reason why the US and its allies have been so opposed to Nord Stream for a long time is because as was recognized in the 2019 study, by the RAND Corporation, which is a US government-funded think tank, the Nord Stream was very profitable for Russia. And also if it goes through, bringing gas from Russia to Germany and the rest of Europe, that makes Europe and Germany more intertwined, which in turn makes it a lot harder to wage a proxy war and impose sanctions on Russia, and that's why this RAND study said, a first step to weakening Russia would be stopping Nord Stream 2. So the motive is there, and as you've noted, the intent was made very clear in public, but somehow we are supposed to not believe all logic and all facts and just believe, once again, that Russia is behind something that is so drastically against its own interests."

So, that may seem hard to believe. A nuclear war? Really? That couldn't happen. Well, the Biden administration has just announced, sent out a press release from HHS that they're spending $290 million on emergency drugs to give Americans in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange.

We're not just saying that because it appeared on our air. If that was on MSNBC, we'd say the same thing. Holy smokes. So this guy was not an observer or a bystander, he was a business partner of the Biden family, and he provided mountains of evidence, documents showing that Hunter Biden defrauded him, committed felony fraud. He also provided evidence that Joe Biden was not unaware of this, he was directing his family's overseas influence peddling operation where they sold access to the US government, which is a felony. So, this is a guy who would know. This is a guy who can prove it and this is a guy who talked about it for almost an hour on television last night. So, what's the response been? Well, we checked in today, the White House didn't respond at all, neither did any major media organization. No television network in the United States of America said a word about it. The single response from anyone came on Twitter from a lone CNN anchor and he didn't address anything that Tony Bobulinski actually said about the Biden's; instead, he scolded Tony Bobulinski for not appearing on his network years ago. That was it. That was the sum total of response. We're listening to this. Last night, we even listened to the tape of an interview we'd done. We're thinking, \"Holy smokes. This is a bombshell.\" But no. If a bomb goes off in the forest and nobody hears it, did it explode? Apparently not. They're doing exactly what they did before the last election. We have an election next month. They're doing again. They know that what Tony Bobulinski is saying is it true, provably true. They are just going to suppress the story and act like it didn't happen and it may work. Well, there is a scandal brewing in the world of pro, fishing an arena that has relatively few scandals, thank God. Two competitors were caught stuffing lead weights and other fish filets into their fish. Now, the point of the contest is to have the heaviest total catch to win prize money. These guys would have won nearly 30 grand had they not been caught, but they were caught on tape. Their names are Jake Runyan And Chase Cominsky.
