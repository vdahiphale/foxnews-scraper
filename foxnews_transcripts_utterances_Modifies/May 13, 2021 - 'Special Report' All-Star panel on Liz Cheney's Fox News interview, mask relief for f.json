Hillary Clinton and former president Carter, one out of three House members on the Democratic side refused to go Trump's inauguration because they said he was illegitimate.   So it would have been nice, I think a lot of Republicans wish that if she really, genuinely cared about these issues, that she would have been there fighting for them over the last four years. It's also not good that she is taking part in this sort of systematic effort to shut down any conversation. You can and should say that Joe Biden is the president of the United States, and also have problems with how that election was conducted. I don't think she is really making that conversation better.
