It's ironic, Bret, because when Donald Trump came into office, at least foreign policy hawks in Washington were worried he was going to cut a deal with Vladimir Putin that would be too soft, that would give away the store to Russia. Now we have this environment where tensions are actually escalating and we may be stumbling into an unwanted confrontation with Russia, partly because I think the Trump administration is under a lot of pressure right now not to be seen to be reaching out too much. Actually I've noticed no communication that I am aware of between Rex Tillerson and his counterpart, certainly no phone call between Trump and Vladimir Putin since the infamous day in the Oval Office. And meanwhile, you're having these close calls, as I think Jennifer Griffin explained in an earlier segment, in eastern Europe, the Baltics. NATO is doing big military exercises now, essentially simulating war between NATO and Russia. Russia is going to have a major military exercise in Belarus this fall. A lot of opportunity for miscalculations, and the big question is Trump is likely to see Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit next month. What's going to happen there, that will be a potentially turning point.",

You basically -- they warned the pilot several times, do not get near our forces that are focusing on counter ISIS operations, and we're not going to tolerate that. So I think it's a very direct message, something that we saw when there was a chemical attack in the last couple months in Syria and we sent tomahawk cruise missiles into the area.

Nonetheless I think we're headed into a much more dangerous period, and the reason is that the ISIS phase of the Syrian civil war is going to end soon. In other words ISIS going to be dealt with. They are losing Mosul, they are being surrounded now in Raqqa. If and when that happens, and it could be within six months or a year, then what is left on the ground is this Iran, Russia, Hezbollah, Assad coalition on the one side and then the Saudis, the Egyptians, the Jordanians, the forces, the rebels on the ground and us on the other side. Then there is no third-party that we can hit together. It's us and them.  And the Iranians and the Russians are looking at a prize, winning Syria, keeping Syria, the Russians being the dominant great power in the region. Putin hungers to recover great power status. And I think he's willing to risk more than we think. Not now. I think it's early. You not going to go shooting down our airplanes.
