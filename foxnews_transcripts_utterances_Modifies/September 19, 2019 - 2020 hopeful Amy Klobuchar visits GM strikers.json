I think that's an untenable position. But I do share with the congresswoman a position that we need to do everything we can to avoid a war. We need to do everything we can to reestablish deterrence and ensure that we don't involve ourselves in some sort of situation that leads to further escalation and immerse ourself in a military conflict that we can't get out of.

And truth be told, because Republicans have pressed so hard over the years to ensure that we can exploit our own natural resources, our own oil and gas, we're less dependent on oil and gas resources from this region. But, with all that said, that country remains important. It's important because we have 60,000 Americans on the ground right now. So, by definition, we want to make sure those Americans are safe and secure.  But perhaps even of greater importance, as we look eight or nine years into the future, because of the JCPOA, or the so-called Iran nuclear agreement that President Obama signed onto and that so many Democrats here in Washington have been supportive of, because of that agreement, the Iranians, the largest state sponsor of international terrorism, will have official legal sanction in just a number of years to be in breakout capacity, meaning they could develop a nuclear weapon to put on top of the missile technology they continue to develop.  So that's why it's important that the president is going to be speaking to our allies, to partners, really to the world at the United Nations, asking everyone to come together and see how we can continue to apply maximum economic pressure on the Iranians to bring them to the table, which is really the endgame here. We want to bring the Iranians to the table, so that we can negotiate a peaceful settlement and get a better deal.",

Once again, this is an indication that Iran is trying to stimulate and put the United States into the position of being the aggressor, so that they can gain the support of their domestic population and put the United States out there as the one who is the aggressor. Well, so what that means is, we need to be pretty smart when we think about what our options are. And I think being smart is to continue to turn the economic screws to coerce the Iranians that they have got to change their behavior. Now, there might be some elements of military action that go along with this strategy. I would suggest that probably the most prudent way is to do it not in a very overt fashion, but in a covert fashion. One day, an Iranian oil transport all of a sudden is missing. Command-and- control facilities start operating. There's no attribution. It just happens. The Iranians will get the message.",

But the Fed chair said, this is more of the economy's doing great, yes, but this is to assuage some concerns with consumers, and especially those on Wall Street, that the trade war is creating this uncertainty. So rather than it being like the economy is in a bad place, we need to cut rates to help it, it's more of, we see these dark clouds on the horizon, why don't we cut rates by a quarter-point to potentially hold off a potential economic downturn?

Yet U.S. prosecutors in court now suggests thing that terrorism could have played a motive, and the result, bond denied. The federal magistrate ordered Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani to continue to be held behind bars. In court, prosecutors revealed that FBI agents found ISIS videos on his phone showing graphic killings, and that he forwarded one of those videos to somebody with the urging for Allah to take revenge against non-Muslims. Also, according to an American Airlines co-worker, Ahmed Alani told him that his brother was in Iraq and a member of ISIS, and that he flew to Baghdad in March to visit him, which the FBI says he lied about. In July, the Miami-to-Nassau flight with 150 passengers on board turned back before taking off after an error light appeared regarding the navigation system in the cockpit. Ahmed Alani's defense attorneys say a second navigation system still works and that the government is blowing this case out of proportion. Ahmed Alani's family flew into Miami for yesterday's bond hearing, saying nothing to the cameras; 60-year-old Ahmed Alani was born in Iraq and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He is charged with one count of willfully damaging, destroying or disabling aircraft. He says he thought if he could force that plane back to fix a mechanical problem, he being the mechanic would get more work and thus more overtime, which, in fact, actually did happen. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison.

He joined that organization in '97, so eight years before he lied on his citizenship papers and said he'd never been a member of a terrorist organization.

I think that's an untenable position. But I do share with the congresswoman a position that we need to do everything we can to avoid a war. We need to do everything we can to reestablish deterrence and ensure that we don't involve ourselves in some sort of situation that leads to further escalation and immerse ourself in a military conflict that we can't get out of. I know that's the number one priority of the president of the United States, is trying to prevent war, rather than get into war. And that's why he's been incredibly emphatic about that."

And truth be told, because Republicans have pressed so hard over the years to ensure that we can exploit our own natural resources, our own oil and gas, we're less dependent on oil and gas resources from this region. But, with all that said, that country remains important. It's important because we have 60,000 Americans on the ground right now. So, by definition, we want to make sure those Americans are safe and secure. But perhaps even of greater importance, as we look eight or nine years into the future, because of the JCPOA, or the so-called Iran nuclear agreement that President Obama signed onto and that so many Democrats here in Washington have been supportive of, because of that agreement, the Iranians, the largest state sponsor of international terrorism, will have official legal sanction in just a number of years to be in breakout capacity, meaning they could develop a nuclear weapon to put on top of the missile technology they continue to develop. So that's why it's important that the president is going to be speaking to our allies, to partners, really to the world at the United Nations, asking everyone to come together and see how we can continue to apply maximum economic pressure on the Iranians to bring them to the table, which is really the endgame here. We want to bring the Iranians to the table, so that we can negotiate a peaceful settlement and get a better deal."

Retired Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula. General, is it usual for Defense and State to be at odds on something this big? I mean, they either were or they weren't. I read from the Pentagon review at this point they're not 100 percent. Perhaps the State Department is. Are you?"

And the larger question is, look, what ultimately are the United States' objectives that are directly affected with this latest aggressive move by Iran? And so what comes into play in the discussion of the variety of different options, both the economic, as well as perhaps using elements of military force to coerce Iran to understand that it's in their best interest not to pursue the development of nuclear weapons and delivery means. So that's what this is really about. And that's why you see deliberations ongoing in State, in the Department of Defense, and across the board."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. General, the president has talked about -- and I was raising it with our White House correspondent, John Roberts -- about proportionate response to this, if indeed it is fingered to Iran. But if a proportionate response means going, let's say, after Iranian oil fields vs. Saudi oil fields, what they are alleged to have targeted, wouldn't that boomerang potentially on us? We're more energy-independent than we have ever been, of course, but for the world, it could mean higher oil -- energy prices. Other defense analysts have said the more targeted approach might be going after their drones. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEPTULA",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, once again, the question needs to be put in the context -- or the answer needs to be put in the context of an overarching strategy. First, what the president needs to be doing -- and, in fact, all indicators are that he needs to form a coalition. Once again, this is an indication that Iran is trying to stimulate and put the United States into the position of being the aggressor, so that they can gain the support of their domestic population and put the United States out there as the one who is the aggressor. Well, so what that means is, we need to be pretty smart when we think about what our options are. And I think being smart is to continue to turn the economic screws to coerce the Iranians that they have got to change their behavior. Now, there might be some elements of military action that go along with this strategy. I would suggest that probably the most prudent way is to do it not in a very overt fashion, but in a covert fashion. One day, an Iranian oil transport all of a sudden is missing. Command-and- control facilities start operating. There's no attribution. It just happens. The Iranians will get the message."

Could he be setting him up as a fall guy if the economy takes a turn? Charlie Gasparino with us, Axios reporter Alayna Treene, market watcher Erin Gibbs. The president has long been critical, Erin, as you know, of the Fed's policies, that they hiked too soon too fast, and now they're unwinding it. Even the Fed has pretty much acknowledged that. But he has said that, if they were more aggressive in the rate cuts even now, they could go a long way toward reversing this. But it doesn't look like that's in the cards. So what do you think?"

But the Fed chair said, this is more of the economy's doing great, yes, but this is to assuage some concerns with consumers, and especially those on Wall Street, that the trade war is creating this uncertainty. So rather than it being like the economy is in a bad place, we need to cut rates to help it, it's more of, we see these dark clouds on the horizon, why don't we cut rates by a quarter-point to potentially hold off a potential economic downturn? And that was what his argument was."

So that's how -- that's how you would appease them. Listen, Neil, I don't agree with what the president's doing here on a lot of issues. He's right that Jerome Powell missed the boat. He didn't see the storm clouds when they were forming in December. And he wasn't just -- he was raising the Fed Funds Rate and unloading the balance sheet on the long end. So that was a real problem. That caused the economy to slow significantly. That said, you know, listen, these sort of battles between Fed chairs and presidents happen all the time.

      "speaker": "GIBBS",

So we might have one more cut, possibly two, which might will help push up stocks and then keep the yields very low, help with mortgages. But I don't see this being a big move, unless we really see some bigger fears about the recession. So, remember, rate cuts sound great, because it sounds like it's cheaper money, but it actually means because the economy's doing worse, that there are clouds overhanging us. So I would actually like to not see rate cuts, because that means the economy is doing better. And, sometimes, we forget about these things."

In court, prosecutors revealed that FBI agents found ISIS videos on his phone showing graphic killings, and that he forwarded one of those videos to somebody with the urging for Allah to take revenge against non-Muslims. Also, according to an American Airlines co-worker, Ahmed Alani told him that his brother was in Iraq and a member of ISIS, and that he flew to Baghdad in March to visit him, which the FBI says he lied about. In July, the Miami-to-Nassau flight with 150 passengers on board turned back before taking off after an error light appeared regarding the navigation system in the cockpit. Ahmed Alani's defense attorneys say a second navigation system still works and that the government is blowing this case out of proportion. Ahmed Alani's family flew into Miami for yesterday's bond hearing, saying nothing to the cameras; 60-year-old Ahmed Alani was born in Iraq and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He is charged with one count of willfully damaging, destroying or disabling aircraft. He says he thought if he could force that plane back to fix a mechanical problem, he being the mechanic would get more work and thus more overtime, which, in fact, actually did happen. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison. He will be back in downtown Miami at the U.S. courthouse tomorrow morning for his arraignment, where he will enter a plea of either guilty or not guilty. And we will be there, Neil."

Going to the latter story first, the arrest of the Hezbollah operative here in the United States, it's not the first time that's happened. We have picked up in cases, convicted other Hezbollah operatives. And this individual happens to be a naturalized U.S. citizen. But he did that in 2005. The only problem is, in 1997, he joined Hezbollah, which has been a designated terrorist organization. It's a proxy for Iran, for the regime. And they carry out a great number of operations around the globe. He joined that organization in '97, so eight years before he lied on his citizenship papers and said he'd never been a member of a terrorist organization. He since has spent his time doing a variety of things, including getting trained in explosives of weapons by Hezbollah, and conducting surveillance on a variety of targets, primarily in the New York City area, in the event that Hezbollah wants to, or, frankly, the Iranian regime wants to, in the future, conduct terrorist attacks on our own soil."

The problem with background checks and vetting, not just with airlines, but a large number of other critical infrastructure areas, is that it's not an ongoing process. The applicant comes in, he wants the job, you do the -- or she wants the job. You do the background check. Maybe you do civil, criminal.

However, there are carve-outs since this act of 1996. So there are carve- outs that hold liability for terrorism.

So, in New York, where they're holding off on that, a stay while they wait for a hearing on this issue, and, in California, where a judge has sided with the president's request that forcing the release of his tax returns can't be done. All right, we will keep you posted on that. Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard the latest to prove that there is indeed life and indeed political oxygen even if you are sucked out of a debate, create buzz of your own.

And, look, we elected Donald Trump, who won the same kind of tactics of, how do you create a buzz, how do you draw attention to yourself, even if it is a little bit outlandish?

And so when she's out there saying that the president's not moving quickly enough, and we're the servants of Saudi Arabia, it's almost like she's taunting him to make a very quick and brash decision. And we have seen that he's not doing that. He's waiting for the facts to come in. And he's going to make an informed decision after working with our allies. So I think her -- a lot of her criticism, other than using some gross language, it's also disingenuine (sic).

Again, this is part of what the allure is of Donald Trump as a candidate to a lot of people. He says what's on his mind, whether you like it or not. He uses language that's offensive, whether you like it or not. And that does appeal to some people because it feels authentic. And I think that is what Andrew Yang is trying to do, is sort of authentically be different and own that Silicon Valley tech approach. And I was recently in the area and talking to people.

Rather than showing your passport and a ticket at the gate, you smile for a photo, and Customs and Border Protection sends that image to a cloud, where it matches it with a picture of you that they already have, typically from your passport. CBP says it deletes pictures of U.S. citizens within 12 hours, but images of some aliens can be held up to 14 days.
