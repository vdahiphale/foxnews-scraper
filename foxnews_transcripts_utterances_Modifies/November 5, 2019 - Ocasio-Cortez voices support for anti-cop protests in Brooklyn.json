      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” We got a news flash for you, a shocking development from media world, someone accidentally told the truth and was caught doing it. An anchor over at ABC News on a hot mic accuses her network of spiking her reporting on billionaire pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, that audio just minutes away.  But first I would like to open this evening with a breathless update on how some obscure diplomat you've never heard of said something forgettable to an even more obscure Ukrainian government official about a topic that has literally nothing to do with your life or the future of our country.  Then we're going to drone on about this non-story for the entire hour tonight and every night this week, hoping that by sheer volume and repetition, we can give it the illusion of relevance.  I hope you find it edifying. Just kidding. That's Jeff Zucker's channel. On this show, we're opting for actual news, things that matter. So we're beginning tonight with the brutal war that is currently raging out of control just over the border of our two most populous states. For years, the American news media, for purely ideological reasons have all but ignored the explosion of horrifying brutality in Mexico. That's getting harder to do.  Just yesterday, Mexican drug cartels murdered at least nine Americans. That would include six children in an ambush right on the highway, about 75 miles from Arizona. Among the casualties was a nine-month old reportedly shot in the chest and a four-year-old shot in the back. News reports indicate the gunman lit the bodies on fire before they fled the scene. Mark Dannels is Sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona that borders Mexico and he joins us tonight. Sheriff, thanks so much for coming on. What can you tell us about this?",

Starting Monday, about three in the morning, we had eight vehicles come into our community just south of the international border. Moments later, they shot up -- about 45 minutes of shooting, two were dead, possibly three others injured. Nine o'clock in the morning, it continued. Then last night, we had nine Americans killed. This is a Mormon Community just south of the border. Later in the evening, we had five children from the ages of eight months old all the way up to nine years old come across the border critically shot and transported to hospitals in Arizona.

      "sentences": "Well, as you just heard, northern Mexico is the epicenter of a war between the Mexican government and cartels. That war has been marked by mass executions and beheadings. Violence is getting worse and it's driven in large part by a booming market for illegal drugs. Mexico's murder rate hit an all-time high this year, it was already high. Now, it's the highest ever recorded.  When the cartels aren't killing one another, they're killing us in this country. About 50,000 Americans overdosed on opioids last year and much of those narcotics came through Mexico.  Earlier this week volunteer searching for missing relatives discovered 48 bodies decomposing in a mass grave just 42 miles from the Arizona border. There may be more there. We don't know. The group was stopped from searching the area when armed gunmen showed up and chased them off. Thousands of similar mass graves -- thousands -- have been discovered in recent years. Just this September, another group discovered more than 2,000 bones who belong to an estimated 150 people including many children at a similar mass grave, all murdered by the drug cartels. Nearly 60,000 people had been reported missing in Mexico in the last 20 years, most of them will never be found. Just this past August Mexican police found nine bodies hanging from a highway overpass outside Mexico City. Seven mutilated bodies were dumped on a nearby road, a few miles away, three more bodies, some of them women.   The cartel responsible left a banner on the overpass threatening its rivals. This is a fact of life throughout Mexico.  In the face of this brutality, the Mexican government has in effect given up. Last month, Mexican authorities released the leader of one of the nation's biggest drug cartels after the cartel launched a military style assault on the capital city of Sinaloa. In the end, the Mexican government surrendered. Mexico, in other words, is becoming a failed state, even as Congress and the courts block any effort to construct a border wall or protect this country from the violence destroying our nation to the south. How long can this go on?  Mark Morgan is the Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, he joins us tonight. Mr. Commissioner, thanks very much for coming on.",

So these two transcripts released by Intelligence Chairman, Adam Schiff today are really the first we're seeing of, you know, what people who have firsthand direct knowledge of how President Trump has been conducting foreign policy towards Ukraine and they're pretty telling, Tucker.  E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland asked about a meeting in the Oval Office with Secretary Perry and Kurt Volker says President Trump repeatedly directed him to talk to Rudy Giuliani, saying, \"He wasn't even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: Talk to Rudy. Talk to Rudy.\" But he also says he called President Trump back in September and asked him point blank, what do you want from Ukraine? To which President Trump answered, \"I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\" Now another key exchange from Ukraine Envoy Kurt Volker's testimony highlights these major policy disagreements between President Trump and the diplomatic corps over U.S. military involvement in foreign countries. Volker was asked about moves to beef up Ukraine's military defenses against Russia while he was serving as Special Envoy. The question goes, \"How do you reconcile that with the decision to freeze military assistance to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine? Why did that not strike you as highly problematic to U.S. national security or to our national security interest?\" To which Volker answers, \"It did start strike me as problematic and therefore I acted immediately to argue that this has to be reversed and we have to keep the assistance going.\" Tucker, the next big ticket item everybody here on Capitol Hill is now waiting for is testimony from John Bolton that's slated for Thursday. So far, his attorney has not said he is going to be a no show, so there is a little bit of hope that he is going to appear here today. But if the track record so far this week is anything to go by, we're getting a lot of crickets over here on Capitol Hill -- Tucker.",

The highest in the nation's gas prices and rampant power outages, they literally can't keep the lights on. The state has essentially decriminalized theft and illegal immigration and it shows. And yet in the face of all of this, the leaders of the state are completely consumed with utterly frivolous policy projects like high speed rail to nowhere and banning plastic straws and weird sexual politics nobody can even understand. Meanwhile, the state is literally on fire. By the way, they pay the highest tax rates in the nation. Put all of that together, and you shouldn't be surprised that between 2007 and 2016, California lost a million residents to domestic migration, most to Texas. The few remaining normal people in the state want to leave, 40 percent of them have seriously considered moving. We don't want to over draw the situation. But it's almost impossible to do that. It's that bad. Victor Davis Hansen has seen it happen. He is a lifelong Californian. He joins us tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on.

That meant two million people didn't have power, as if it was some third world country. I just went to San Francisco and your description is quite right on, Tucker. I mean, there's human excrement. There's needles. There's the highest property crime rate per capita in the country. We don't really prosecute shoplifting. And when you want to go from one place to another, if you don't have power, like one of my assistants didn't for five days or my daughter with a special needs child in Santa Cruz for two days, the streetlights don't work. And the also the calcified roads are overcrowded because we have the infrastructure for 20 million people, but we are 40 million people now.

An anchor over at ABC News on a hot mic accuses her network of spiking her reporting on billionaire pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, that audio just minutes away. But first I would like to open this evening with a breathless update on how some obscure diplomat you've never heard of said something forgettable to an even more obscure Ukrainian government official about a topic that has literally nothing to do with your life or the future of our country. Then we're going to drone on about this non-story for the entire hour tonight and every night this week, hoping that by sheer volume and repetition, we can give it the illusion of relevance. I hope you find it edifying. Just kidding. That's Jeff Zucker's channel. On this show, we're opting for actual news, things that matter. So we're beginning tonight with the brutal war that is currently raging out of control just over the border of our two most populous states. For years, the American news media, for purely ideological reasons have all but ignored the explosion of horrifying brutality in Mexico. That's getting harder to do. Just yesterday, Mexican drug cartels murdered at least nine Americans. That would include six children in an ambush right on the highway, about 75 miles from Arizona. Among the casualties was a nine-month old reportedly shot in the chest and a four-year-old shot in the back. News reports indicate the gunman lit the bodies on fire before they fled the scene. Mark Dannels is Sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona that borders Mexico and he joins us tonight. Sheriff, thanks so much for coming on. What can you tell us about this?"

Starting Monday, about three in the morning, we had eight vehicles come into our community just south of the international border. Moments later, they shot up -- about 45 minutes of shooting, two were dead, possibly three others injured. Nine o'clock in the morning, it continued. Then last night, we had nine Americans killed. This is a Mormon Community just south of the border. Later in the evening, we had five children from the ages of eight months old all the way up to nine years old come across the border critically shot and transported to hospitals in Arizona. It's a sad day in our international communities down here."

      "utterance": "Well, as you just heard, northern Mexico is the epicenter of a war between the Mexican government and cartels. That war has been marked by mass executions and beheadings. Violence is getting worse and it's driven in large part by a booming market for illegal drugs. Mexico's murder rate hit an all-time high this year, it was already high. Now, it's the highest ever recorded. When the cartels aren't killing one another, they're killing us in this country. About 50,000 Americans overdosed on opioids last year and much of those narcotics came through Mexico. Earlier this week volunteer searching for missing relatives discovered 48 bodies decomposing in a mass grave just 42 miles from the Arizona border. There may be more there. We don't know. The group was stopped from searching the area when armed gunmen showed up and chased them off. Thousands of similar mass graves -- thousands -- have been discovered in recent years. Just this September, another group discovered more than 2,000 bones who belong to an estimated 150 people including many children at a similar mass grave, all murdered by the drug cartels. Nearly 60,000 people had been reported missing in Mexico in the last 20 years, most of them will never be found. Just this past August Mexican police found nine bodies hanging from a highway overpass outside Mexico City. Seven mutilated bodies were dumped on a nearby road, a few miles away, three more bodies, some of them women. The cartel responsible left a banner on the overpass threatening its rivals. This is a fact of life throughout Mexico. In the face of this brutality, the Mexican government has in effect given up. Last month, Mexican authorities released the leader of one of the nation's biggest drug cartels after the cartel launched a military style assault on the capital city of Sinaloa. In the end, the Mexican government surrendered. Mexico, in other words, is becoming a failed state, even as Congress and the courts block any effort to construct a border wall or protect this country from the violence destroying our nation to the south. How long can this go on? Mark Morgan is the Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, he joins us tonight. Mr. Commissioner, thanks very much for coming on."

We talked about the narcotics that are pouring into this country.

So these two transcripts released by Intelligence Chairman, Adam Schiff today are really the first we're seeing of, you know, what people who have firsthand direct knowledge of how President Trump has been conducting foreign policy towards Ukraine and they're pretty telling, Tucker. E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland asked about a meeting in the Oval Office with Secretary Perry and Kurt Volker says President Trump repeatedly directed him to talk to Rudy Giuliani, saying, \"He wasn't even specific about what he wanted us to talk to Giuliani about. He just kept saying: Talk to Rudy. Talk to Rudy.\" But he also says he called President Trump back in September and asked him point blank, what do you want from Ukraine? To which President Trump answered, \"I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\" Now another key exchange from Ukraine Envoy Kurt Volker's testimony highlights these major policy disagreements between President Trump and the diplomatic corps over U.S. military involvement in foreign countries. Volker was asked about moves to beef up Ukraine's military defenses against Russia while he was serving as Special Envoy. The question goes, \"How do you reconcile that with the decision to freeze military assistance to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine? Why did that not strike you as highly problematic to U.S. national security or to our national security interest?\" To which Volker answers, \"It did start strike me as problematic and therefore I acted immediately to argue that this has to be reversed and we have to keep the assistance going.\" Tucker, the next big ticket item everybody here on Capitol Hill is now waiting for is testimony from John Bolton that's slated for Thursday. So far, his attorney has not said he is going to be a no show, so there is a little bit of hope that he is going to appear here today. But if the track record so far this week is anything to go by, we're getting a lot of crickets over here on Capitol Hill -- Tucker."

We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate and Will that we -- that also quashed the story. And then -- and then Alan Dershowitz was also implicated in because of the claims. She told me everything. She had pictures. She had everything. She was in hiding for 12 years, we convinced her to come out. We convinced her to talk to us. It was unbelievable what we had Clinton. We had everything. I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out and it's like these new revelations and I freaking had all of it. I'm so pissed right now.

They screamed obscenities. The Brooklyn mob was angry because the NYPD announced a crackdown on fare evasion that they might have to pay to ride the subway like everyone else. The chaos resembled the anti-police riots currently unfolding in Latin America, but more grotesque given the context. Trace Gallagher has been following since the beginning and he joins us tonight for an update. Hey, Trace."

We should note the protesters also shattered obscenities at subway riders who paid their fares. In other words, law-abiding citizens were condemned for not supporting the law breakers. But Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fully supported the protesters quoting, \"Ending mass incarceration means challenging a system that jails the poor to free the rich. Arresting people who can't afford a $2.75 fare makes no one safer and destabilizes our community. New Yorkers know that. They're not having it and they're standing up for each other.\" But while police are planning to crack down on those who jump the subway turnstiles, the point might be moot. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. and Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez are no longer prosecuting the fare beaters -- Tucker."

The cops would round up the people vandalizing public property that belongs to all of us and arrest those who are stealing subway rides. Order would be restored. Life would go on. People would pay their $2.75 to ride the subway. But this is America in 2019. So any move that almost perfectly embodies the absurdity of our current political moment, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came out in favor of the riot that Trace just described -- punch a cop. She is for that. Stairs have shifted a lot in America, so it's hard to be surprised really by anything anymore, but a lawmaker suggesting that law enforcement quote, \"destabilizes our community\" and siding with people who want to punch a cop, you wonder about that. You wonder if in the name of stabilizing her community Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez would support a full NYPD withdrawal from her congressional district, or maybe around the upscale apartment building that she lives in here in Washington. Joe Murray is a retired NYPD police officer. He is running for District Attorney in Queens and he joins us tonight. Mr. Murray, thanks so much for coming on. Punch a cop.

A majority of registered voters in that state are considering leaving, and it's easy to see why. California is now home to the country's largest population of vagrants. The highest in the nation's gas prices and rampant power outages, they literally can't keep the lights on. The state has essentially decriminalized theft and illegal immigration and it shows. And yet in the face of all of this, the leaders of the state are completely consumed with utterly frivolous policy projects like high speed rail to nowhere and banning plastic straws and weird sexual politics nobody can even understand. Meanwhile, the state is literally on fire. By the way, they pay the highest tax rates in the nation. Put all of that together, and you shouldn't be surprised that between 2007 and 2016, California lost a million residents to domestic migration, most to Texas. The few remaining normal people in the state want to leave, 40 percent of them have seriously considered moving. We don't want to over draw the situation. But it's almost impossible to do that. It's that bad. Victor Davis Hansen has seen it happen. He is a lifelong Californian. He joins us tonight. Professor, thanks so much for coming on. So among many other things, and this may be the greatest irony of all, California is experiencing an environmental crisis. The state is dirtier than ever. How did that happen in the state that constantly talks about protecting the environment?"

So the radical green agenda led to this force management problem where you have millions of trees that were supposed -- that were dead and where they are supposed to provide an ecosystem and not be harvested, which then meant the ossified power grid would light them on fire, which then meant we had to preemptively shut down the power. That meant two million people didn't have power, as if it was some third world country. I just went to San Francisco and your description is quite right on, Tucker. I mean, there's human excrement. There's needles. There's the highest property crime rate per capita in the country. We don't really prosecute shoplifting. And when you want to go from one place to another, if you don't have power, like one of my assistants didn't for five days or my daughter with a special needs child in Santa Cruz for two days, the streetlights don't work. And the also the calcified roads are overcrowded because we have the infrastructure for 20 million people, but we are 40 million people now. And so what I meant by an existential crisis, people are saying, well, who did this to us? How did this happen? And they want to blame somebody, but we have Democratic super majorities in the legislature. We don't have a single Republican statewide office. We only have seven of 53 congressional seats that are Republican. So it's making people think, is it wealthy people? Yes, it's wealthy people, but they're progressive, wealthy people."

They all take advantage of their privilege and leverage. They're very wealthy. They make -- they have the nexus between government and business. And yet, they're completely out of touch with the average person that drives on the 99 Freeway or tries to get to work on the 101 or evacuates his home because he is afraid he is going to be burned alive in it. Or he has insulin, the refrigerator and he has to shut -- the power suddenly goes off, or he is walking into a hotel and the doorman says, check your feet, you might have a needle or feces on it. It can't go on any longer. I think that's what people -- it's amazing to watch this, Tucker because people are really deer and the headlights. They think what did this?

We brought a lot of people in that have no high school diploma, no facility with English, no legality, and they were not diverse. And then at the same time, six -- four to six million people fled in the last 30 years. The old Reagan -- Deukmejian-Pete Wilson constituency, and then we became one of the coastal entertainment, high tech area and we have all these people who had so much money that they dreamed up what you talked about, you know, banning straws, and not shooting bobcats and all of that because they've dealt with these trivial problems as a way of I guess squaring the circle that they couldn't do anything about the existential problems because it was contrary to their ideology or was a result of their only ideology.

Less than 12,000 votes are making the difference. The key to watch right now, it should be noted that the Democratic challenger, Beshear is in the lead at this moment with all of these precincts being counted en route to an upset, but when you're talking about this very narrow split, the counties, the precincts that haven't been counted are in the western rural parts of the state, parts of the state that were predicted to go for the Republican incumbent Matt Bevin. The Republican incumbent who got all this support from President Trump. So it is too close to call right now. There is a recall law in the state of it comes down to something like that. The candidate would have to request the recall and the candidate would also be subject to any of the costs associated with such a recount. We can't go there yet.

Local police unions do not support Descano, but the state's top Democrats do and more importantly, so does liberal billionaire George Soros who has used his Political Action Committee to donate several hundred thousand dollars to Descano's campaign. In fact, at last check, the Soros money made up the lion's share of what Descano raised overall. Soros is also supporting other progressive prosecutors around the country so as you said the Fairfax race is a bit of a bellwether and at last check, Descano was leading Fahey with about 40 percent of the vote so far counted -- Tucker."
