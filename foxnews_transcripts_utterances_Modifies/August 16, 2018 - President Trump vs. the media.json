      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Jedediah Bila, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a pillowcase is her parachute, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" Today, 300 newspapers coordinated articles criticizing President Trump just after he had accused them of coordinating articles criticizing President Trump. And nobody read them. If jerks like me weren't talking about it, would you even know? Yes, another public display of the press exercising their right to irrelevance.  Remember when the New York Times ran an editorial saying you should vote for Hillary, and the rest of the media followed? Now, they say Trump is blocking free speech as they all scream this in unison. Trump accuses them of groupthink and they respond with groupthink. Now since the election, the media has been one malfunctioning car alarm: loud, relentless and broken. This after sleeping through Obama's terms, ignoring Iran, the DOJ, the IRS, immigration, while dreaming of Hillary. And now he's gone, their dreams are shattered and now they're wide-awake because Trump is their Red Bull. What phonies.  They gave Trump endless airtime while wringing their hands thinking it was OK because Hillary had it in the pantsuit. But the palooka you propped up wasn't the empty can you thought he was. While mocking Trump nonstop, people stop caring about what you thought. That Red Bull gored your butt. And now, all you can do is blame him for what you help do. And, they say Trump targets all news, not fake news -- which is fake news. They've ignored the clarifications that are obvious to us. No surprise. Remember when one of us would criticize Obama or Hillary, we'd be called a bigot. I remember that like it was yesterday, probably because it was.  You sought to silence opinion through fear and smear, and now you pretend you're the victim. You're not oppressed, just depressed. Get over it. All right, Jedediah, welcome back to the show.",

I think he's going to fire up the left. So, I agree with Dana. They have to turn out the vote and turn it out hard and spend a lot of money. He's going to spend 50 stops. Do you know how many stops that is? He's going to be on TV all the time. In some districts, that's really going to work because it's going to raise money for people. It's going to energize people. But at the same time, he's going to give the other side a lot of fodder. Right now, I think the congressional generic ballot on the Real Clear Politics averages only about 4.8 percent. That does not indicate a blue wave at all. So we're still in the territory of the Democrats picking up may be 15 seats. That's not enough to win back the house. But anything could happen.

And nobody read them. If jerks like me weren't talking about it, would you even know? Yes, another public display of the press exercising their right to irrelevance. Remember when the New York Times ran an editorial saying you should vote for Hillary, and the rest of the media followed? Now, they say Trump is blocking free speech as they all scream this in unison. Trump accuses them of groupthink and they respond with groupthink. Now since the election, the media has been one malfunctioning car alarm: loud, relentless and broken. This after sleeping through Obama's terms, ignoring Iran, the DOJ, the IRS, immigration, while dreaming of Hillary. And now he's gone, their dreams are shattered and now they're wide-awake because Trump is their Red Bull. What phonies. They gave Trump endless airtime while wringing their hands thinking it was OK because Hillary had it in the pantsuit. But the palooka you propped up wasn't the empty can you thought he was. While mocking Trump nonstop, people stop caring about what you thought. That Red Bull gored your butt. And now, all you can do is blame him for what you help do. And, they say Trump targets all news, not fake news -- which is fake news. They've ignored the clarifications that are obvious to us. No surprise. Remember when one of us would criticize Obama or Hillary, we'd be called a bigot. I remember that like it was yesterday, probably because it was. You sought to silence opinion through fear and smear, and now you pretend you're the victim. You're not oppressed, just depressed. Get over it. All right, Jedediah, welcome back to the show."

They'd have a lot more credibility if every administration that came around, they were this adversarial. But they don't and they're not, and that's the problem because Donald Trump has exposed them as dishonest Democrat party hacks. The media right now are extensions of the Democratic Party. They give him no credit for anything good he does and deny him all credit for anything he does. Everything is framed as something he's done is evil, is wrong, as backwards, and he's not given a fair shake. So when he says you guys are the enemy of the people, what he's saying is you guys are denying the truth to the American people. You're feeding them spin. You're feeding them dishonest propaganda to help the Democratic Party, and you're not shooting straight. And why they get that so upset is because their credibility rests upon the fact that they pretend to be independent.

It's fine. And maybe it doesn't have that much of an effect except for maybe to get us riled up. But also, he has gone after the media pretty viciously, sometimes, deservedly.

That doesn't mean that journalists aren't supposed to be watchdogs. And that doesn't mean that everyone in the press is terrible.

There will be some districts that it won't make sense for him to go to. And I don't think he'll take offense at that. I think he'll say fine. Like, send where I can be the most helpful. I also believe -- yeah, he could be right that Democrats -- or that his turnout capabilities would swamp the Democrats. However, I do think that Republicans should really make a concerted effort, if they are thinking clearly, on get out the vote efforts. Like, the television ads not as important.

I think he's going to fire up the left. So, I agree with Dana. They have to turn out the vote and turn it out hard and spend a lot of money. He's going to spend 50 stops. Do you know how many stops that is? He's going to be on TV all the time. In some districts, that's really going to work because it's going to raise money for people. It's going to energize people. But at the same time, he's going to give the other side a lot of fodder. Right now, I think the congressional generic ballot on the Real Clear Politics averages only about 4.8 percent. That does not indicate a blue wave at all. So we're still in the territory of the Democrats picking up may be 15 seats. That's not enough to win back the house. But anything could happen.

And then they turn the plane around, and that impact is brutal to you, but you're not dead. But it feels different for the airline. When they make that decision, they're still on the job. It's just no -- they're not going to lose any money. They go back to work. The flight attendant, everybody is working. It's like when we are doing \"The Five,\" and we get preempted by a hearing. We just sit. It doesn't bother us. But the viewers at home are like, \"Damn it! I wanted to watch 'The Five'! I thought I was going to get 'The Five' today, and I'm watching the stupid hearing.\" But we're sitting here saying we're still getting paid. That's exactly what happens with the airlines, is that they just -- they don't see how much this matters. They probably could have just taken a poll and said we'll take a vote.
