Okay, kill each other, but leave my guys out of it.  He prefers economic warfare to blood and guts stuff. The advantages are simple. You can still inflict damage, but you never have to leave home.

And one thing we know, the Dems and the media share the same brain. But think about how nuts this is. In order to reelect Trump, Putin got a Russian asset to join the American military, then run for Congress in Hawaii, then run for President as a Democrat, only to split off to help Trump win in 2020.

Okay, kill each other, but leave my guys out of it. He prefers economic warfare to blood and guts stuff. The advantages are simple. You can still inflict damage, but you never have to leave home. And if you win, you never have to occupy and that's good because if there's one thing we've learned, occupation creates insurgencies. Now that different thinking and it scares the Old Guard.

Well, then Trump's going to hang a corruption scandal around your deadbeat son. The fact is, you started the fight, and Trump is probably going to end it.

Here's Richard Branson, the owner modeling the space suit passengers will wear. It's made by Under Armour. It's got some shiny blue things on the shoulders, a few zippers. Aircraft -- he looks so happy -- aircraft going up and down the spine. It's very Star Trek. You've got your space booties, too. All passengers will have a suit personally tailored for them. Under Armour says the suit is made of materials that will help muscles recover from doing all those somersaults in space. I don't know. It looks okay. But my design was really snazzy and comfortable. Your loss, Branson."

I'm like there's no way that Marilyn Manson or whoever it was that actually bought the space tickets is going to be doing like, you know, double backflip handsprings in it. It was like that scene with this people and Bette Midler like what like looked in the catalog and then she saw how it actually looked on her body."
