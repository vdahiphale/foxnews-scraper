The Douglas County Sheriff's Office says it believes two people have been injured but they are still gathering information. The sheriff reportedly describing the situation as unstable and is asking the public to avoid the area.  We are monitoring that breaking news and we'll bring you the details as they come.  Meantime, hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. He's back. It's five o'clock in New York City. And this is “The Five.”  Turning now to our other top story. Tensions rising between the White House and congressional Democrats who are now threatening Trump officials with contempt. The House Judiciary Committee set to vote tomorrow on a contempt citation against Attorney General Bill Barr. Democrats are demanding that Barr hand over in unredacted version of the Mueller report and calls starting for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to be held in contempt for refusing to hand over the president's tax return.  Meanwhile, the administration is ordering former White House counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a Congressional subpoena for documents related to the Russia investigation. And all of this comes as a new report says, get this, House Democrats are threatening to withhold salaries of Trump administration officials if they block ongoing committee investigations. Despite claims of overreach from Republicans, Democrats are defending their multiple probes.",

It reminds me of growing up watching the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Generals. Right? Trump is the Harlem Globetrotters and the media and the Democrats are the Washington Generals. They can only respond helplessly against the strange phenomenon that continually wins.  And they never adjust or adapt to play against the Harlem Globetrotters because they just lose every time.

Two juvenile suspects are now in custody. The sheriff says they are both juveniles. They don't know if they're students at that school. But two are in custody. The sheriff had reported that they were looking for a possible third suspect. They no longer believe there was a third suspect. The school administrators reported shots fired. Officers arrived within minutes. They're still going door-to-door at the school. So, it's somewhat of an active scene. But they believe at least that the danger to students has passed.

And this is “The Five.” Turning now to our other top story. Tensions rising between the White House and congressional Democrats who are now threatening Trump officials with contempt. The House Judiciary Committee set to vote tomorrow on a contempt citation against Attorney General Bill Barr. Democrats are demanding that Barr hand over in unredacted version of the Mueller report and calls starting for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to be held in contempt for refusing to hand over the president's tax return. Meanwhile, the administration is ordering former White House counsel Don McGahn not to comply with a Congressional subpoena for documents related to the Russia investigation. And all of this comes as a new report says, get this, House Democrats are threatening to withhold salaries of Trump administration officials if they block ongoing committee investigations. Despite claims of overreach from Republicans, Democrats are defending their multiple probes."

It's really hard to call it a cover-up when something is publicly available. You morons. You what this reminds me of? It reminds me of growing up watching the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Generals. Right? Trump is the Harlem Globetrotters and the media and the Democrats are the Washington Generals. They can only respond helplessly against the strange phenomenon that continually wins. And they never adjust or adapt to play against the Harlem Globetrotters because they just lose every time. Imagine a group of people cultists who demanded you adhere to their delusions or they will punish you. That's what's going on right now. They are demanding. You, the media, The View, all this morning what's his face, are basically belonging to a pagan religion in which they adhere to some kind of emotional belief that goes against all the facts, low unemployment among minorities, among women.

We now know that there are at least seven victims, possibly eight, and that the school shooting happened at the middle school section of this STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. For those of you who weren't with us earlier, about 1:50 local time, Mountain Time in Denver, reports of shots fired at STEM School in Highlands Ranch. That is South of Denver, past Littleton, Colorado, where Columbine High School is, and then the next community is Highlands Ranch. The Sheriff's department just gives us an update. They originally said two victims. Now we know there were seven and possibly eight. It happened in the middle school section of the school. It's a K-12 place, but it was in the middle school building. Two juvenile suspects are now in custody. The sheriff says they are both juveniles. They don't know if they're students at that school. But two are in custody. The sheriff had reported that they were looking for a possible third suspect. They no longer believe there was a third suspect. The school administrators reported shots fired. Officers arrived within minutes. They're still going door-to-door at the school. So, it's somewhat of an active scene. But they believe at least that the danger to students has passed. Again an active scene Highlands Ranch, Colorado; two suspects are in custody. THE FIVE will continue after this."
