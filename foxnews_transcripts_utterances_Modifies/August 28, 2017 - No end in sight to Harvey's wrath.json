City officials now saying they will not be able to help people in certain of these neighborhoods. It's simply too tough to get around. And you can see many of the roads being flooded behind me actually. We've been watching a giant sinkhole grow. That is because so much water has been dumped in this area. There are a real questions about the structural soundness of small bridges.  The shelters are filling up. You have the coal ahead of time. They're even turning furniture stores into shelters. People are arriving wet and cold. When you see people around, they just look stunned, looking for something to eat, looking for clothing.

Because the rain has died down really for the first time in several hours. I mean, it was an absolute deluge here all day long. We had flooding, we saw homes under water. There were cars under water, parking lots.   They shut down one of the main interstates that runs from out here in the Woodlands, one of the suburbs of Houston into downtown Houston. It is going to be very hard for people to try to get anywhere near the city. We should point out, they're trying to avoid exactly what is going on down there in Houston and the suburbs below there by doing the opposite. They are evacuating a number of neighborhoods up here about 20 miles north of us because they're very concerned about one of the rivers which is overflowing its banks. They're trying to let as much water as they possibly can out, but they're already at record levels out. They can only let so much. They're getting people out of there in case the river overflows the banks. West of Houston, very much the same story. Getting people out of their homes now before any chance of flooding. We should note, the rescue totals have now gone up. As of right now, they have rescued some 3,050 or so people. That's about 1,000 up from the number we were given just early this morning. So about 1,000 rescues today alone. They have mobilized 3,000 Texas national guardsmen for this effort. But they have every single national guard, 12,000 of them, will be involved in this effort. And now we're being told the border patrol is also being mobilized.  They are pulling them away from the border to come up to Houston and help out in this massive effort. They keep telling us, the rain is going to slow down and eventually go away. But today we saw very little sign of that -- Kimberly.",

They have been plucking folks off of roofs. People who can't get to those high water vehicles. People who are passed the point where they can be rescued by boats. They've had the helicopters, they put them down. We had some video earlier of one of the helicopters. We have seen Red Cross helicopters, National Guard helicopters, other military helicopters come in. They touchdown and you see the people run off of there clutching their belongings.  Clothing, anything they could get ahold of. Then they go to the buses and the buses can get them here to the convention center. Fifty five hundred people have already gone here into the convention center. That is above capacity. Five thousand is what the max was, they said, but they're not closing these doors. Any buses that come, any people who come on foot. Here in the Convention Center, they're taking you in. Even by helicopter now. Kimberly, back to you.  All right.

Because the president does not want his security needs to overwhelm first responders on the ground. Their time of course better spent on search and rescue efforts that are painfully are still going on. This is all hands on deck for the administration. Vice President Mike Pence today traveled to FEMA Headquarters for briefings. He also did a series of radio interviews where he estimated a shocking number, about half a million Americans the Vice President said will get some kind of federal assistance after the clean-up from the storm. That's consistent with what the President said at a news conference at the White House where he said the administration will do -- will stop at nothing to help.",

It does not appear to have injured anyone or done any damage to Japanese assets. But a sign that this whole situation is far from over. Meanwhile, NBC News reporting tonight that Robert Mueller, the special counsel of course is now looking at whether or not President Trump was involved in a knowingly false statement when he helped craft the initial response to his son, Donald Trump, Jr.'s statement about that meeting last summer at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer. I'm getting strong push back tonight from people in the President's inner circle trying to shoot down this report saying that the President did not commit any kind of crime. That he had a very small amount of time spent in crafting that statement about his son's meeting at Trump Tower and they think in the end, the special counsel will find nothing -- Kimberly.",

I don't think you need it from a religious leader. I think if you look around you and you look at the people there, Americans can handle massive catastrophes pretty damn good without inspiration. They're not inspired to do that. They are just naturally doing that. You couple that with the nature of our system, the United States, if you compare catastrophes of a similar kind, country by country, thousands upon thousands are killed, millions are injured. But for some reason in a system like ours, which is so resilient, which is a decentralized free market system that makes it easier for rescues, for housing to be found, for supplies to be delivered, for evacuations to be made quickly, it's because of a system that is decentralized and people can come from all over and do things.

Because he knows that the people who are in power get really upset because they can't do anything about it. So what he just do is he did something that you can't do anything about. What he -- when he brought up those examples, what he was doing was, he's highlights a contrast between two types of thinking. I'm going to talk about it, my monologue. Everything that Trump does is through the law and order prism. And oftentimes it can be flawed. But most of the time, the big picture, it's okay. So what he ends up doing is he pardons a law and order-type guy. A sheriff who might have some problems but a sheriff. President Obama operates from the oppressor versus oppressed mindset. So, when he wants to pardon somebody, it's usually a radical, it's somebody who might have been involved in a cause. Could have been a terrorist but it was a cause. And he thinks it's a noble cause. So accepts it because it's oppressor versus oppress. So, through that prism, President Obama always tends to favor people that we go, what are you talking about? And then meanwhile, liberals look at Trump and go Arpaio? What are you talking about? I have a solution for this. No more damn pardons. Nobody likes them. Nobody likes pardon. There's really one good pardon ever. Only one good pardon. And that was when President Obama pardoned Willie McCovey on tax evasion. Willie McCovey, number 44. One of the greatest San Francisco -- I'm showing you how personal the pardon is. I liked it. Because I like Willie McCovey. That's how bias and personal the decision is, is that I thought it was okay. Because he was one of my favorite players.",

But its only goal was to prevent violence by presenting overwhelming strength: speak softly, big stick -- it's highly persuasive. It's like the rhetoric that Trump uses with immigration: A forceful position becomes the wall reducing illegal crossing. Police armed with the best gear is similar, stopping violence without causing any. They become the wall between order and anarchy. What happens when the wall is missing? You get Charlottesville, you get Berkeley in April and Berkeley now. Where there's no order, there will be blood. President Obama saw the gear as intimidating. But who does it intimidate? I'd say the people about to do bad things. But President Obama has always viewed the world through the prism of radical politics, so he sees the world through that prism. Trump is the reverse. Everything is seen through the prism of law and order which explains the wall, militarization, boosting defense, pardoning Arpaio. A singular vision can be flawed, but the bigger picture can excuse the smaller mistakes. Trump won because of three words: law and order. Ignore that, Democrats and he'll win again. In this case, hindsight isn't 20/20. It will win 2020.",

They were exposed again when they portrayed this violent mob as no different as heroes storming Normandy after Charlottesville. Because they conflated Antifa with other protesters. They are violent group of people, but they are more than violent, they're cowards. They're like juveniles dressed up as batman in front of a mirror. They wear mask, because they done want to even own their own activities. If you think -- you have to ask one of these folks, if you ever get the chance, if you're doing is so good, why do you have to wear a mask? You're obviously an immoral creep. I think the media looks really foolish because we predicted this on \"The Five.\" we said - it had to be three months ago, we said Antifa removes the bait from the conversation so you have emotion which goes straight to violence. A thing in between called the debate. Antifa has no debate. They pulled it out. We said this would happen months ago. Nobody would listen. We're right here, we said it.",

Because the rain has died down really for the first time in several hours. I mean, it was an absolute deluge here all day long. We had flooding, we saw homes under water. There were cars under water, parking lots. They shut down one of the main interstates that runs from out here in the Woodlands, one of the suburbs of Houston into downtown Houston. It is going to be very hard for people to try to get anywhere near the city. We should point out, they're trying to avoid exactly what is going on down there in Houston and the suburbs below there by doing the opposite. They are evacuating a number of neighborhoods up here about 20 miles north of us because they're very concerned about one of the rivers which is overflowing its banks. They're trying to let as much water as they possibly can out, but they're already at record levels out. They can only let so much. They're getting people out of there in case the river overflows the banks. West of Houston, very much the same story. Getting people out of their homes now before any chance of flooding. We should note, the rescue totals have now gone up. As of right now, they have rescued some 3,050 or so people. That's about 1,000 up from the number we were given just early this morning. So about 1,000 rescues today alone. They have mobilized 3,000 Texas national guardsmen for this effort. But they have every single national guard, 12,000 of them, will be involved in this effort. And now we're being told the border patrol is also being mobilized. They are pulling them away from the border to come up to Houston and help out in this massive effort. They keep telling us, the rain is going to slow down and eventually go away. But today we saw very little sign of that -- Kimberly."

They've had the helicopters, they put them down. We had some video earlier of one of the helicopters. We have seen Red Cross helicopters, National Guard helicopters, other military helicopters come in. They touchdown and you see the people run off of there clutching their belongings.

Because the president does not want his security needs to overwhelm first responders on the ground. Their time of course better spent on search and rescue efforts that are painfully are still going on. This is all hands on deck for the administration. Vice President Mike Pence today traveled to FEMA Headquarters for briefings. He also did a series of radio interviews where he estimated a shocking number, about half a million Americans the Vice President said will get some kind of federal assistance after the clean-up from the storm.

It does not appear to have injured anyone or done any damage to Japanese assets. But a sign that this whole situation is far from over. Meanwhile, NBC News reporting tonight that Robert Mueller, the special counsel of course is now looking at whether or not President Trump was involved in a knowingly false statement when he helped craft the initial response to his son, Donald Trump, Jr.'s statement about that meeting last summer at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer. I'm getting strong push back tonight from people in the President's inner circle trying to shoot down this report saying that the President did not commit any kind of crime.

I don't think you need it from a religious leader. I think if you look around you and you look at the people there, Americans can handle massive catastrophes pretty damn good without inspiration. They're not inspired to do that. They are just naturally doing that. You couple that with the nature of our system, the United States, if you compare catastrophes of a similar kind, country by country, thousands upon thousands are killed, millions are injured. But for some reason in a system like ours, which is so resilient, which is a decentralized free market system that makes it easier for rescues, for housing to be found, for supplies to be delivered, for evacuations to be made quickly, it's because of a system that is decentralized and people can come from all over and do things.

He was pardoned after his wife donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clintons. Then you have dangerous criminals. President Clinton pardoned Susan Rosenberg, a member of the Weather Underground. Charged as part of a bank robbery that led to a guard and two police officers being killed. Drug dealers. President Clinton commuted the sentence of Carlos Vignali, a central player in a cocaine ring that stretched from California to Minnesota. Criminal leaker. You've heard the word \"leaker.\" President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to Wikileaks, perhaps and others.

I understand there are other issues surrounding this. But you look at the details of what he was accused of. He didn't get a trial by a jury of his peers. This was a decision made by a judge. If you look at the circumstances surrounding his re-election, George Soros dumped $2 million in his re-election bid. You had the leftists coming in and organizing against Joe Arpaio. You had one six terms by 65, 70 percent each time. This was a witch-hunt. And the administration, the Obama administration, did not like the fact that Joe Arpaio was working with the federal government to turn over criminal aliens that had committed crimes against local communities including immigrant populations and that's why they went after him."

He is a -- President Obama by the way, did similar things. He liked to poke people who are not in power. Because he knows that the people who are in power get really upset because they can't do anything about it. So what he just do is he did something that you can't do anything about. What he -- when he brought up those examples, what he was doing was, he's highlights a contrast between two types of thinking. I'm going to talk about it, my monologue. Everything that Trump does is through the law and order prism. And oftentimes it can be flawed. But most of the time, the big picture, it's okay. So what he ends up doing is he pardons a law and order-type guy. A sheriff who might have some problems but a sheriff. President Obama operates from the oppressor versus oppressed mindset. So, when he wants to pardon somebody, it's usually a radical, it's somebody who might have been involved in a cause. Could have been a terrorist but it was a cause. And he thinks it's a noble cause. So accepts it because it's oppressor versus oppress. So, through that prism, President Obama always tends to favor people that we go, what are you talking about? And then meanwhile, liberals look at Trump and go Arpaio? What are you talking about? I have a solution for this. No more damn pardons. Nobody likes them. Nobody likes pardon. There's really one good pardon ever. Only one good pardon. And that was when President Obama pardoned Willie McCovey on tax evasion. Willie McCovey, number 44. One of the greatest San Francisco -- I'm showing you how personal the pardon is. I liked it. Because I like Willie McCovey. That's how bias and personal the decision is, is that I thought it was okay. Because he was one of my favorite players."

Remember when the media made militarization the big bad wolf? Their misguided emotion portrayed enhanced security is somehow threatening. But its only goal was to prevent violence by presenting overwhelming strength: speak softly, big stick -- it's highly persuasive. It's like the rhetoric that Trump uses with immigration: A forceful position becomes the wall reducing illegal crossing. Police armed with the best gear is similar, stopping violence without causing any. They become the wall between order and anarchy. What happens when the wall is missing? You get Charlottesville, you get Berkeley in April and Berkeley now. Where there's no order, there will be blood. President Obama saw the gear as intimidating. But who does it intimidate? I'd say the people about to do bad things. But President Obama has always viewed the world through the prism of radical politics, so he sees the world through that prism. Trump is the reverse. Everything is seen through the prism of law and order which explains the wall, militarization, boosting defense, pardoning Arpaio. A singular vision can be flawed, but the bigger picture can excuse the smaller mistakes. Trump won because of three words: law and order. Ignore that, Democrats and he'll win again. In this case, hindsight isn't 20/20. It will win 2020."

Some of these vehicles and the things that are armored, all-terrain that can go through flooded areas to help in times of natural disasters like this and really provide relief to a community. So why would we want to take that away from them? Because we want to say the police are bad? We don't want them to have any of the things they need? They're not going to have uniforms next?

Military grade bullet-proof vests, armored vehicles, tactical helmets and tactical shields. A lot of these things that are happening in the streets increased gang activity, violent crime rising under the last administration. Antifa is running wild. So I think some Democrats think for instance we're going to use these weapons against them while they protest the RNC? No. These things are used with explosive detonations, active shooter situations, large scale riots, terrorism situations, drug raids, gang raids. These things are not your run-of-the-mill squaring off against one lonely protester. They came in handy. You said it. The armored vehicle they used during the floods. One of the guys on the police side had a military grade helmet and saved his life in the Orlando nightclub shooting.

But they've been accused by the Obama administration of being overly militarized and hurting equipment and hurting the feelings of criminals that want the room to destroy as the Baltimore mayor suggested. I think we need to point out, this is something that the Obama administration allowed to go on for seven years throughout his term and rescinded in 2015.

Some people say that was righteous, I am sure some people want to punch a Nazi in the face. I get that, I understand that, but that is the only time that I saw them do that. I've seen them attack women. I've seen Antifa attack members of the press."

They only rove in packs and isolate one or two people and beat them up. They can't square up on anybody. They're a bunch of losers. Who brings sticks and shields -- what is this?

We've been asked to condemn everybody on the planet."

Only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that. There's a growth of white supremacy and there is a growth of neo-Nazism and the KKK with the new world card the alt-right and that is the problem. But Antifa isn't the answer to that problem. How we drive out the KKK, who has blood on their hands since 1865 is with love and understanding. How we drive out the KKK and neo-Nazis is people coming together like what we see taking place in Houston where neighbors are helping neighbors. That is how we defeat, people like David Duke, people like Richard Spencer and people that believe in their views."

They're not soldiers of the first amendment on free speech. They are cowards. They don't want you to see who they are because they don't want to be criminally prosecuted. They don't have a right to commit crimes and do violent protests the way they're doing. I think the left should condemn them. The police department should come prepared to shut it down.

At this point across the gulf coast, stretching to portions of New Orleans. All areas where we're seeing heavy rain this evening. Where will this head next? Even though the rain is spreading across the Gulf of Mexico, we can see the circulation just off the Texas coast, this is the past of motion. I'm taking you to Wednesday morning. You're beginning to see this left past Houston, likely still catching rain on the back end. By Thursday, this is out of here and continues to track further and further to the north. Eventually turning into a low pressure system passing through Shreveport. I say by the end of the week, the weekend, folks in the middle of the country, even towards Atlanta just beginning to see tropical rain. Finally folks across the gulf coast will be drying out a little bit. How does that look? Here's the satellite and radar. This is taking you, a future cast, into Tuesday. Still the rain lingering around. I think by late Tuesday into Wednesday, Houston, the area hardest hit gets on the back side of this. We're still tracking plenty of rain. This is an opportunity for them to get out of it. How much rain will be get? In some cases 30, 40 inches. Houston looks as though another 10 inches, that is additional than what we've seen. There's still some spots out there, Richard, we'll see a good 15, 20 more inches of rain before it's said and done."

Friday night when the story broke and when it was happening, seeing Steve Harrigan and the others in the field trying to report on it. Could barely stand getting pummeled by the winds and the onslaught of the downpour. One of the biggest things we've had to deal with is the devastation of water and the rain that comes after. The winds are bad enough. When you see what happened in Katrina and what happened here, it's just -- can't help us feel for these families."
