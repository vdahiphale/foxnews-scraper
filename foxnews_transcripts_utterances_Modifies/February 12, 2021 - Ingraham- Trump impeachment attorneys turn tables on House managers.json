      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, this is The Ingraham Angle. And of course, a very busy Friday night, Trump's team turns the tables and in a devastating fashion. Hemingway, Fleischer, and Dhillon are here in moments. Also, as the anti-Trump Lincoln Project crumbles, we expose those who facilitated their rise with Glenn Greenwald.   And Joe Biden says, we'll wear masks for the next year, even if vaccinated. What's the science say? And we told you they were going to do that. Dr. Scott Atlas reacts to all that. Plus, Jill and Joe's Garden of Love. What is that? Pray tell. And Auntie Maxine's upside-down hearing goes, upside down. Raymond Arroyo all reveals that in Friday Follies.  But first, former President Trump's legal team turned the tables, laying out their arguments against impeachment. And forget the brevity and a few concrete ways, they dismantled key pieces of the Democrat's rather incoherent constitutional arguments. I'm going to break down a few pieces tonight for you. The most important ones.  Number one, the core claim of Democrats impeachment article is that Trump's speech incited the January 6th riot, his speech on January 6th. But here's Trump counsel Michael Van Der Veen.",

And so, the hot rhetoric, easy to show. I'm glad they did. But, Laura, there's a more complicated issue that still has me hung up here. And this is why I won't defend the president when it comes to impeachment or conviction. He should have had the wisdom never to have called the crowd to Washington on that day that the vote was taking place. That was like assembling nitro and glycerin.  And whether or not it was incitement, I don't know. That's a legal term. But just common sense says don't bring the crowd to Washington on that day. It is too risky.

I thought it was really interesting, too, that they weren't just defending their client, Donald Trump, but really defending the whole notion of free speech. You showed a little bit of those clips from their video montages. Those were utterly devastating. They went on at length showing how senators in that chamber had used the exact same rhetoric that they were complaining about President Trump using or in some cases far, far, far worse, like actually violent rhetoric, sometimes from really prominent people like Kamala Harris joking about murdering Donald Trump or Mike Pence, or Joe Biden with the lesser thing of just constantly talking about wanting to beat up President Trump. Or other people talking about being violent with Trump voters. And then at the end of it, though, the attorneys talked about how even speech like that is constitutionally protected. So, it wasn't just about what's happening in impeachment, but talking about why we have freedom of speech and why we want to protect that so that people can use their words to talk against each other so that worse things don't happen harm.",

And so today, the standard has shifted dramatically to the point where even people in the room who use that type of violent language, like Mollie just mentioned themselves, you know, irony in convicting somebody else for using the same language. And Laura, if we're throwing the Constitution out the window and the laws out the window, you're throwing the language of the very impeachment standard out the window, which requires high crimes and misdemeanors.

Well, masks are really the radioactive issue of this whole pandemic, and it's really something that is a real case study and how people have just simply ignored all the data that's contrary to what they want to believe and want everybody else to believe. The CDC study in May 2020, and all the randomized studies of mask showed that mask on the general population for influenza pandemics do not stop the transmission nor receiving the infection. That's what they say in two or three different ways. In that article that's never reported. It's also never reported, as Alexander and his colleagues pointed out, the abundant empirical evidence from Europe, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the UK, Spain, as well as many states, there are 37 or 38 states in the U.S. and including the other states have had city mandates on masks, yet the cases were not controlled by mask mandates. And then there's, the other data from Denmark, the one large, randomized study of general population use of mass that showed not a significant reduction in the spread of cases. All of this evidence you'll never hear about in the news, you'll never see it in the newspaper.",

I will tell you, the vaccine had nothing to do with this. The proof of that is in Israel and the UAE, which are two very different countries. But they vaccinated more people than anywhere else in the world per capita, especially Israel, which is using the Pfizer vaccine, which is one of the two vaccines we use here, and MR&A vaccine. And Israel has had - it's actually an outlier in the wrong direction in the last six weeks.

As a reminder, Weaver has been accused of making lewd sexual overtures with promises of employment to dozens of young men and at least one minor. Girdusky told us that the worst allegations against Weaver haven't even been published yet, but that they are criminal in nature, criminal allegations. The news apparently sent the Lincoln Project into an absolute tailspin last night. This group, the group posted private Twitter messages between their cofounder Jennifer Horn and a journalist. We don't know exactly how they accessed the conversation, but since neither Horn nor the journalist consented to it, it actually could be illegal, even if it's not against Twitter's rules, whatever those are. As shocking as this behavior was last night, the rot among the founders of this vicious anti-Trump group founded by corporate America and really rich people, a lot of them in Hollywood, was as clear is day to us for the past year. But again, that did not stop powerful forces from aiding them every step of the way, because they were just obsessed with taking out Trump by any means necessary. So the Lincoln Project's biggest funder was Chuck Schumer Senate Majority PAC which forked over, I almost fell over when I read this, $1.9 million. The group got half-a-million from Hollywood heavyweight David Geffen -- haven't had any comment from him, have we -- and another $326,000 from Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's old firm. So are they going to apologize for what they ended up seeding, even, of course, they didn't know about it, but do they want their money back? And where did that $90 million really go that they raised? Much of the money was paid to firms, big shock, run by the Lincoln Project's cofounders, so it's all an inside deal, including nearly $25 million to Summit Strategic Communications, that's a firm run by Reed Galan, Reed Galan, of course, with the Lincoln Project. More than $20 million was paid to TUSK Digital run by another founder, Ron Steslow. Here now is independent journalist Glenn Greenwald. Glenn, I've been dying to talk you about this.

But people on other networks and in liberal outlets chose to ignore that even though they knew it was true, and venerate them, herald them, and in the process convince their audience. It's true that they got funding from a lot of rich people, but they got a ton of funding from ordinary people as well in the middle of a pandemic and unemployment crisis who forked over huge amounts of their money assuming it was going to ads against Donald Trump when in reality the bulk of the money went to firms controlled by founders of this organization.",

Hemingway, Fleischer, and Dhillon are here in moments. Also, as the anti-Trump Lincoln Project crumbles, we expose those who facilitated their rise with Glenn Greenwald. And Joe Biden says, we'll wear masks for the next year, even if vaccinated. What's the science say? And we told you they were going to do that. Dr. Scott Atlas reacts to all that. Plus, Jill and Joe's Garden of Love. What is that? Pray tell. And Auntie Maxine's upside-down hearing goes, upside down. Raymond Arroyo all reveals that in Friday Follies. But first, former President Trump's legal team turned the tables, laying out their arguments against impeachment. And forget the brevity and a few concrete ways, they dismantled key pieces of the Democrat's rather incoherent constitutional arguments. I'm going to break down a few pieces tonight for you. The most important ones. Number one, the core claim of Democrats impeachment article is that Trump's speech incited the January 6th riot, his speech on January 6th.

So, by the Democrats own standard, all of those soundbites, all those comments in some way constitute altogether something approaching sedition, the traitors, of course, that's what they want you to believe. That's the bogus threshold for incitement that they offered against President Trump. But when they use that same language, they openly question the legitimacy of a presidential election. They add the whole Russia collusion on to it with zero evidence. It's totally innocuous and in fact, it's constitutionally protected speech.

And so, the hot rhetoric, easy to show. I'm glad they did. But, Laura, there's a more complicated issue that still has me hung up here. And this is why I won't defend the president when it comes to impeachment or conviction. He should have had the wisdom never to have called the crowd to Washington on that day that the vote was taking place. That was like assembling nitro and glycerin. And whether or not it was incitement, I don't know. That's a legal term. But just common sense says don't bring the crowd to Washington on that day. It is too risky. I wish the president had the wisdom not to have done that. He ought to have not done."

Brandenburg versus Ohio, 1969 Supreme Court case. The language has to have an imminent effect, Mollie, to indicate that we would have violence likely to be spawned from those words. It's a tough standard to meet. They didn't even come close to meeting that standard, Mollie. And then we'll go to Harmeet."

      "utterance": "I thought President Trump's attorneys did a very good job of talking about the standard and how the House Democrat managers had failed to even meet the first test of the Brandenburg test. I thought it was really interesting, too, that they weren't just defending their client, Donald Trump, but really defending the whole notion of free speech. You showed a little bit of those clips from their video montages. Those were utterly devastating. They went on at length showing how senators in that chamber had used the exact same rhetoric that they were complaining about President Trump using or in some cases far, far, far worse, like actually violent rhetoric, sometimes from really prominent people like Kamala Harris joking about murdering Donald Trump or Mike Pence, or Joe Biden with the lesser thing of just constantly talking about wanting to beat up President Trump. Or other people talking about being violent with Trump voters. And then at the end of it, though, the attorneys talked about how even speech like that is constitutionally protected. So, it wasn't just about what's happening in impeachment, but talking about why we have freedom of speech and why we want to protect that so that people can use their words to talk against each other so that worse things don't happen harm."

And so today, the standard has shifted dramatically to the point where even people in the room who use that type of violent language, like Mollie just mentioned themselves, you know, irony in convicting somebody else for using the same language. And Laura, if we're throwing the Constitution out the window and the laws out the window, you're throwing the language of the very impeachment standard out the window, which requires high crimes and misdemeanors. And clearly, the standard is not met here. I'm glad that the defense team kept it tight today and it was very effective.

The resistance was the group that fought the Nazis in France. They said, not my president. They boycotted his inaugural. They tried to overturn his election in the Electoral College and there was violence at his inauguration if you remember ANTIFA. And then they leaked and weaponized classified information against Donald Trump. And of course, there was the whole collusion narrative to get him out of office, not to mention the 25th Amendment. So, this has been the Democratic game plan since the day he was elected in 2016. And if you want legitimacy, if you want norms in Washington, you have to act by them yourself. You cannot hold this type of hatred against somebody else and not expect somebody to get mad at you one day. And this is where Washington is just descended into a terrible pit of partisanship."

She needs to be smarter when she's dealing with the media to avoid those kinds of traps that are set up that way. But I think people actually - a lot of people are pretty unified. They're pretty excited about having made some really much needed policy updates. And then also more people needing to know whether that's having more restrained foreign policy, an economic policy that focuses on the middle class and an understanding that the Left is actually going to war against the founding of this country and that that needs to be defended against.

Now and perhaps the most comprehensive review of the evidence on mask to-date. Dr. Paul Alexander and his co-authors write, it is not unreasonable at this time to conclude that surgical and cloth masks have absolutely no impact on controlling the transmission of COVID- 19. And current evidence implies face masks can be actually harmful. Well, shocking, but not entirely surprising, if true. Now you see it. Back in May of last year, the CDC released its own study on masks. The focus there was the influenza virus saying that evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials did not support a substantial effect on transmission of lab confirmed influenza. All right. Well, joining me now is Dr. Scott Atlas, former White House COVID adviser and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Dr. Atlas, why has this study from May by the CDC been completely memory hold?"

Well, masks are really the radioactive issue of this whole pandemic, and it's really something that is a real case study and how people have just simply ignored all the data that's contrary to what they want to believe and want everybody else to believe. The CDC study in May 2020, and all the randomized studies of mask showed that mask on the general population for influenza pandemics do not stop the transmission nor receiving the infection. That's what they say in two or three different ways. In that article that's never reported. It's also never reported, as Alexander and his colleagues pointed out, the abundant empirical evidence from Europe, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Italy, the UK, Spain, as well as many states, there are 37 or 38 states in the U.S. and including the other states have had city mandates on masks, yet the cases were not controlled by mask mandates. And then there's, the other data from Denmark, the one large, randomized study of general population use of mass that showed not a significant reduction in the spread of cases.

It's possible we're getting close in some places to herd immunity, although I hate to even say that out loud, because the virus has made fools of people who've said that before the vaccine. I will tell you, the vaccine had nothing to do with this. The proof of that is in Israel and the UAE, which are two very different countries. But they vaccinated more people than anywhere else in the world per capita, especially Israel, which is using the Pfizer vaccine, which is one of the two vaccines we use here, and MR&A vaccine. And Israel has had - it's actually an outlier in the wrong direction in the last six weeks.

As a reminder, Weaver has been accused of making lewd sexual overtures with promises of employment to dozens of young men and at least one minor. Girdusky told us that the worst allegations against Weaver haven't even been published yet, but that they are criminal in nature, criminal allegations. The news apparently sent the Lincoln Project into an absolute tailspin last night. This group, the group posted private Twitter messages between their cofounder Jennifer Horn and a journalist. We don't know exactly how they accessed the conversation, but since neither Horn nor the journalist consented to it, it actually could be illegal, even if it's not against Twitter's rules, whatever those are. As shocking as this behavior was last night, the rot among the founders of this vicious anti-Trump group founded by corporate America and really rich people, a lot of them in Hollywood, was as clear is day to us for the past year. But again, that did not stop powerful forces from aiding them every step of the way, because they were just obsessed with taking out Trump by any means necessary. So the Lincoln Project's biggest funder was Chuck Schumer Senate Majority PAC which forked over, I almost fell over when I read this, $1.9 million. The group got half-a-million from Hollywood heavyweight David Geffen -- haven't had any comment from him, have we -- and another $326,000 from Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's old firm. So are they going to apologize for what they ended up seeding, even, of course, they didn't know about it, but do they want their money back? And where did that $90 million really go that they raised? Much of the money was paid to firms, big shock, run by the Lincoln Project's cofounders, so it's all an inside deal, including nearly $25 million to Summit Strategic Communications, that's a firm run by Reed Galan, Reed Galan, of course, with the Lincoln Project. More than $20 million was paid to TUSK Digital run by another founder, Ron Steslow. Here now is independent journalist Glenn Greenwald. Glenn, I've been dying to talk you about this.

They say whatever they need to say in order to fleece people out of their money. That's what the swamp in D.C. has done. It's not like any of this is new. But people on other networks and in liberal outlets chose to ignore that even though they knew it was true, and venerate them, herald them, and in the process convince their audience. It's true that they got funding from a lot of rich people, but they got a ton of funding from ordinary people as well in the middle of a pandemic and unemployment crisis who forked over huge amounts of their money assuming it was going to ads against Donald Trump when in reality the bulk of the money went to firms controlled by founders of this organization."
