      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. I'm Tammy Bruce, in for Laura Ingraham, and this is a special edition of The Ingraham Angle. We are less than 24 hours away from Donald Trump's first rally in more than three months. Thousands have already been lined up for days in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the President looks to kick off his campaign for a second time. We will have a live report on the ground in moments. And speaking of the rally, Dr. Fauci reportedly advised against it, but have his warnings diminished after so many missed targets? We'll discuss that. Plus, despite thousands dying in nursing homes under Governor Cuomo's watch. He's getting the star treatment from the Left of course, the worst in media is back. And it's Friday, so we couldn't leave. Follies out of it of course. Laura and Raymond will be here later in the hour with the latest Biden stumbles and which classic movies does the PC mob really want sanitized? That's all ahead.  But first, President Trump issued a stern warning to anyone planning to stir up trouble at his rally in Tulsa tomorrow. Tweeting today, any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters, or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma, please understand, you will not be treated like you've been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene. That tweet came after concerns that violent demonstrations would blanket the city.  Originally, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum declared a civil emergency and instituted a 10 PM curfew around the rally venue. But late this afternoon, that was apparently rescinded. So, Trump fans could continue to wait in line. Either way, the next 24 hours and beyond are going to be rather eventful.  My next guest has consulted with college campuses on how to deal with anarchist groups. That sounds like fun. He says the mayor is absolutely right to prepare for potential chaos. Chris Swecker is former Assistant FBI Director joins me now. Chris, welcome aboard. How are you?",

They are living under the effects of a lie. All of them are being painted as racist, systemically racist. The reality is we don't have a policing problem in this country. We have a crime problem. The police are in the neighborhoods that they are because that's where people are being victimized. That's where the drive-by shootings are occurring. That's where the children are being shot in their homes, in their backyards.  The police don't wish that reality. It's forced upon them. The rest of the country turns its eyes away from them. The cops are understandably and incredibly demoralized. No other profession lives under the burden of this hatred. And what they're experiencing the streets now, when they try to make an arrest, people are interfering. They're throwing things at them. They're cursing at them.

They don't have money for private security. They don't have gated communities if you will. And so that concerns me a little. But it really is an attack. And you noted New York, New York, it's a single party city like Los Angeles has been. Certainly, Chicago is a disaster because it has been a single party city, I think, for 140 years. Isn't this really about leadership and the messaging it sends to the community about the police? And if leadership doesn't respect the police, why should the people respect them?",

So, what it's going to take I don't know, Tammy, and it is a dilemma, but as I say, what are the cops supposed to do? Because they are terrified that they're going to face another rush to justice.

They worry now about more shootings. I'm terrified myself that we're going to see a lot more attacks on cops.",

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, I think it's a little bit more than that, actually, Tammy, because it's just further evidence that the president has no problem surrounding himself with people that he doesn't agree with. In fact, he seeks it out. He likes to have people that he doesn't necessarily agree with so that he can get an alternate opinion. And when somebody wanders off the reservation and gives an alternate opinion on something they have no business offering an opinion on whatsoever, obviously, the president isn't afraid to use powerful language to go after him in a memorable way.

We are less than 24 hours away from Donald Trump's first rally in more than three months. Thousands have already been lined up for days in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the President looks to kick off his campaign for a second time. We will have a live report on the ground in moments. And speaking of the rally, Dr. Fauci reportedly advised against it, but have his warnings diminished after so many missed targets? We'll discuss that. Plus, despite thousands dying in nursing homes under Governor Cuomo's watch. He's getting the star treatment from the Left of course, the worst in media is back. And it's Friday, so we couldn't leave. Follies out of it of course. Laura and Raymond will be here later in the hour with the latest Biden stumbles and which classic movies does the PC mob really want sanitized? That's all ahead. But first, President Trump issued a stern warning to anyone planning to stir up trouble at his rally in Tulsa tomorrow. Tweeting today, any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters, or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma, please understand, you will not be treated like you've been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene. That tweet came after concerns that violent demonstrations would blanket the city. Originally, Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum declared a civil emergency and instituted a 10 PM curfew around the rally venue. But late this afternoon, that was apparently rescinded. So, Trump fans could continue to wait in line. Either way, the next 24 hours and beyond are going to be rather eventful. My next guest has consulted with college campuses on how to deal with anarchist groups. That sounds like fun. He says the mayor is absolutely right to prepare for potential chaos. Chris Swecker is former Assistant FBI Director joins me now. Chris, welcome aboard. How are you?"

And I would guess you might agree that regardless of your position on the President or the rally, the fact is it's important for Americans to see that government in this country, city governments, state governments, the federal government can take control of an environment. And that's what they're going to see, aren't they?"

They arise when a lying president takes every opportunity not to heal our nation's divisions, but to stoke them.

That's why that perimeter you described is key and we aren't used to it. But we've seen with Donald Trump rallies before the seriousness of this when it comes to the security. Is there, again, at least certainly a linkage. Do you find that local police? Do they mind the federal government being there? Do they mind having to deal with the Secret Service or these days, is there more of a brother and a sisterhood coming together in dealing with keeping people safe?"

And would you even believe that some have been camped out here, actually camped out in front of the BOK Center for a couple of days, rain, and shine, because we've had some pretty nasty downpours today. The BOK Center can hold about 19,000 people. And we understand that there will be overflows space of some kind for thousands more.

They don't have a band or any hit records. One man standing there wanted to articulate his vision and his ideals for this country. The enthusiasm is off the chain.

The people, they are optimistic. It's almost a love fest and they're enthusiastic and ready to hear from their President about moving this country in the right direction, getting back on track, getting the unemployment levels back down, getting the economy back up and getting America back going and we're looking forward to it and I'm excited about it."

In other words, a walkout. And NYPD officers are being encouraged, apparently, to call in sick on the Fourth of July. That would be known as the blue flu. And it is spreading to other cities as well. Police in Philadelphia, Louisville, and Tallahassee are also considering walking out. And joining me now is a woman who has perhaps the best perspective of what the police are facing and have been facing.

What is it going to take for Democrat mayors and city officials? Because I think in general, Democrats do care about their cities. They care about the lives of people. We heard that in that leaked call from Chicago. What is it going to take for the people to stand up for the police officers, which provide social cohesion in every city, whether it be blue or red?"

It took about three decades of increasing crime in New York City for voters to throw out the existing Democratic political structure there and bring in a mayor that actually did care about the lives, the thousands of lives that were being lost in the black communities. Turns out ideology is a lot more powerful than even a mayor is interested in being reelected. What's happening to the police in this country, Tammy, is tragic and outrageous. They are living under the effects of a lie. All of them are being painted as racist, systemically racist. The reality is we don't have a policing problem in this country. We have a crime problem. The police are in the neighborhoods that they are because that's where people are being victimized. That's where the drive-by shootings are occurring. That's where the children are being shot in their homes, in their backyards. The police don't wish that reality. It's forced upon them. The rest of the country turns its eyes away from them. The cops are understandably and incredibly demoralized. No other profession lives under the burden of this hatred. And what they're experiencing the streets now, when they try to make an arrest, people are interfering. They're throwing things at them. They're cursing at them. It is completely understandable that they're backing off because they're being told that it is racist to try to protect lives in minority communities."

But when you do retreat, of course, the communities that are hurt first are minority communities. You've got you know; they are calling the police as much as anyone else's. They're reliant. They don't have money for private security. They don't have gated communities if you will. And so that concerns me a little. But it really is an attack. And you noted New York, New York, it's a single party city like Los Angeles has been. Certainly, Chicago is a disaster because it has been a single party city, I think, for 140 years. Isn't this really about leadership and the messaging it sends to the community about the police? And if leadership doesn't respect the police, why should the people respect them?"

We need the police. Our communities need the police. Instead, the leaders are pandering to the most radical elements in their cities and they are selling out those thousands of law-abiding residents of minority communities. So, what it's going to take I don't know, Tammy, and it is a dilemma, but as I say, what are the cops supposed to do? Because they are terrified that they're going to face another rush to justice. Like we've seen in Atlanta, completely unjustified murder charges. They - again, they're experiencing from a small segment of the community extraordinarily contempt. They worry now about more shootings. I'm terrified myself that we're going to see a lot more attacks on cops."

Heather, thank you very much for joining me tonight. I appreciate it. All right. Now, coming up, the First Amendment came under attack this week. Of course, it's under attack every week, right. From the Left, as usual. We will document those cases. Plus, conservatives were relentlessly mocked when they suggested the tearing down of statues was a slippery slope.

Earlier this week, Google tried to deplatform the Federalist after NBC News teamed up with a foreign activist group to get the conservative site censored. After some initial confusion, Google eventually admitted its attempt to cancel the Federalist wasn't based on any of their articles, but on the site's comments section. This troubling incident should be a wakeup call for conservatives. The Left is obviously trying to silence you, trying to silence all of us, but we cannot let them.

The attacks we're seeing now, Sara, we know are not new and we've been dealing with this kind of - its intimidation for years.

I could tell you this center for Countering Digital Hate is what you talked about in the opening, which is the group out of England that basically teamed up with NBC. Imran Ahmed.

First of all, of the idea of throwing all dissenters to the prevailing progressive orthodoxy in the digital gulag and of course, preventing from their perspective the catastrophe of Donald Trump. God forbid, getting re- elected, something they can't allow to happen again. But second of all, it's of a piece. It's part and parcel of this broader sort of Maoist slash French anti-cultural revolution that we're witnessing right now. We see it in big tech. We see it in the streets. We see it in corporate boardrooms. We see it even in our families. And it's all about ultimately stifling dissent, not allowing anti-progressives to have any voice in this country shunning us. And they want to chill us and stop us from speaking freely and openly and honestly. But that's the most essential American freedom that there is.

However, if they don't stand for our National Anthem and our great national American flag, I won't be watching!\" Joining me now is Charlie Hurt, \"Washington Times\" opinion editor and FOX News contributor. Charlie, welcome aboard. I see the president's tweets. I know his sense of humor. He also was saying what many Americans are thinking like right out of the gate. So he must be having enough with Tony Fauci being a wet blanket most of the time. Would you agree? What are your thoughts on this? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, I think it's a little bit more than that, actually, Tammy, because it's just further evidence that the president has no problem surrounding himself with people that he doesn't agree with. In fact, he seeks it out. He likes to have people that he doesn't necessarily agree with so that he can get an alternate opinion. And when somebody wanders off the reservation and gives an alternate opinion on something they have no business offering an opinion on whatsoever, obviously, the president isn't afraid to use powerful language to go after him in a memorable way. But it is amazing when you think about how badly Dr. Fauci and a lot of these other health experts have gotten a lot of these things wrong. And it's not a left/right thing or Democrat/Republican thing or Biden/Trump thing. It's a B.S. thing. And at some point, regular voters realize that, OK, you have to wear a mask all the time unless you are rioting in the streets, in which case you don't need to wear a mask. But if you are going to do a rally, you do have to wear. People see through this, and they realize it is a bunch of B.S."

It politicizes great films. A couple of quick examples, and I did some research. \"Forrest Gump\" is derided by \"Variety\" because, quote, \"It's hostile to protesters, activists, and the counterculture.\" And it points out a bit of trivia that I doubt anyone who has ever seen this movie even knew. \"Forrest Gump\" was named after his grandfather, the article says, who was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
