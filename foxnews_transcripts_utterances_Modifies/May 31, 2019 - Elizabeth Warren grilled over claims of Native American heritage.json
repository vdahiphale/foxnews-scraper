The files also shows Smollett denied to police that the brothers linked to the case were his attackers citing their dark skin color because he said that his attackers were white. And texts revealed that Smollett asked the brothers if they have contacts at one point. There's -- this text messages between them looking for ecstasy or cocaine months before the allege attacks, so clearly he was very familiar with both of them at that point. So, you know, this is not going away. And this is very bad news for Kim Foxx who was the prosecutor who dropped this case to everyone's shock.

The files also shows Smollett denied to police that the brothers linked to the case were his attackers citing their dark skin color because he said that his attackers were white. And texts revealed that Smollett asked the brothers if they have contacts at one point. There's -- this text messages between them looking for ecstasy or cocaine months before the allege attacks, so clearly he was very familiar with both of them at that point. So, you know, this is not going away. And this is very bad news for Kim Foxx who was the prosecutor who dropped this case to everyone's shock.

I'm so glad to hear Meryl Streep talking about this and I do think that we're starting to see a little bit of a shift in the way that we talk about this and it started with something that - we brought up on my show for the past several years, which is this the idea of due process. And when you look at a situation between two people you have to judge them equally in terms of who the offender was and who was the perpetrator, whether you're just talking about behavior like toxic masculinity. This is such a bad message to boys. They're not raised thinking that they're toxic and thinking that they're bad. I think that - I mean, I know I raised my boys to be gentlemen, to be good to each other, whether it's other boys or on this field or young women. And I do think that this this whole thing about toxic masculinity and branding all boys has been a very dark moment in this country. Bad behavior is bad behavior. We need to call it out. Whether it comes from a young man or it calls from a young woman, both should be dealt with equally."

And right now - and I'm glad that, she did this she's starting to put it back where it belongs in the in the far corners of a classroom taught by some crazy woman. To label men as more toxic than women is dangerous, we're equally toxic. There's bad people on both sides. I'll admit you can be a real jerk sometimes if you're a guy.

But then I realized - wait, well, nothing stopping guys from starting a minute mentoring for young men too, though there has to be a counterbalance.

Women may account for half of the people who work in the workplace, but men are 10 times more likely to die at work, because of their physicality they take the deadliest occupations, they have more muscle mass, they have different hormonal differences.

And within that behavior you incur risk, which is why men are more likely to die in risky behavior. And they die - like 5 to 7 percent earlier than women. It's like 72 to 77 something like that. So - but the point is, this is a terrible argument, because we complement each other. Men and women are different and we are different and we complement each other. It's a Yin and Yang. And I think that we - I think women's magazines caught on to this from the campus. It started in the campus and magazine editors needed to fill up pages, right? They needed the psychology articles to go with the - here's starve yourself to death, but now we're going to empower you with this stuff. First lose all your weights and then we're going to make you hate men, and so that's where it came from.

And there are so many people that I met and talked to over the last several months, we had them on the show once a week. Many are in the 90s and some will be going back for the first time since they were 18 or 19 years old. For example, Jack Gutmann (ph) who was a navy corps man, a medic. We interviewed him on the show a week or so ago. He was so moving. He had PTSD for 66 years and just starting talking about the war - when he started going through therapy a few years ago. And he now is very emotive about his experiences when he tended to the wounded and the dying in cases. He said - in many cases he was the last face they ever saw. And I knew that, that made me important because I was important exit for that person. And it's incredibly moving. Jack - here he is, talking about what it's going to be like to go back."
