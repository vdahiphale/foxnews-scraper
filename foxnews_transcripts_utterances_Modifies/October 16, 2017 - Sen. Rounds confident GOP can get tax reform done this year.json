We have made promises of about 5.5 trillion in tax reductions. But we have only got room within the budget that we're going to be voting on for about $1.5 trillion in actual reductions in revenue coming in. So we have to have revenue enhancements of about $4 trillion in order to meet the difference. So, that means that the overall joy of having $5.5 trillion in tax decreases is going to be slowed down a little bit with the fact that we will see revenue increases, which means some changes in deductions and so forth totalling $4 trillion for a $1.5 trillion net loss in terms of revenue.   That is what within the budget that we're voting on. That's the reason why several members have expressed concern about whether or not the pain that goes along with that $4 trillion in revenue enhancements is going to be too tough for some of our members to swallow, and makes it more difficult to get 50 votes plus the vice president and the chair to pass it out.",
