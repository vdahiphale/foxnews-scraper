Is this a Trump supporter actually being punched in the face? What could be a politically motivated hate crime? The person involved will tell their story in a few minutes.  First, we begin in Chicago once again and today after posting $100,000 bond, Jussie Smollett sprinted away from the media. The \"Empire\" actor spent the entire day in jail, a Cook County circuit court after he was arrested on felony charges for filing a false police report.  Now, according to prosecutors, Smollett organized an elaborate, poorly executed hate crime hoax, leaving a massive trail of evidence. Take a look.",

Defendant Smollett further detailed that he wanted able to attack him, but not hurt him too badly, and to give him a chance to appear to fight back. Defendant Smollett also included that he wanted Ola to place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell, \"This is MAGA country.\" Smollett provided Abel with a $100 bill to purchase the rope, gasoline, ski mask, gloves, and the red baseball caps that resemble the ones that say, \"Make America Great Again\".",

Pretty brilliant. Now, phone records show the actor called them before and immediately after the incident. Another brilliant move. And texts show the trio coordinating the alleged hoax. Other texts revealing that one of the brothers even sold designer drugs to Smollett. And police are now saying Smollett likely scratched his own face to make the attack more believable. By the way, that kind of takes hating Trump psychosis to a whole new level. All occurring, of course, after Smollett allegedly sent himself a threatening racist letter containing a white powdery substance. Another genius move. We have forensics.   Now, if this is all true, if this turns out to be true, nothing funny about it. Smollett wasted precious law enforcement resources in a city that has been wracked with real violent crimes for many, many years now. A city where young people and even women and children are shot. People are murdered every single week in Chicago, lots of them. It also appears that he used his celebrity status and race to smear and slander the people of Chicago, Trump supporters everywhere. And according to police, he did it for attention, sympathy, and because he was unhappy with his seven-figure salary? The judge called these alleged actions despicable. The Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson is his name, rightly outraged. This was one of the single most powerful press conferences I have ever watched. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Jussie Smollett is no longer speaking with the media, although there are reports tonight that he is back on the set of \"Empire.\" His lawyers stated they are planning a, quote, \"aggressive defense\" and they ask that their client be given the presumptions of innocence. Even Smollett didn't afford the same noble principle to Justice Kavanaugh a few a months ago. He tweeted out, #ibelievedrChristineford and much worse.  Still on this show, in spite of these unfolding events, we recognize that being innocent, presumed innocent until proven guilty and is inalienable right even afforded to those with no principles. And in this particular case, the evidence is beginning to look overwhelming and incontrovertible. None of it good for Mr. Smollett. Now, remember back a while ago, I said the same thing about Michael Avenatti. I'm sure he doesn't agree with much of what I have to say. Remember his case? That was a he said-she said. In the end, I kept saying, I will give him the due process and presumption of innocence that he never gave Judge Kavanaugh. There were three separate investigations, and he got cleared. In other words, they cleared him of any wrongdoing.   Now, despite the massive amount of evidence against the \"Empire\" actor, you have to assume he's an innocent man until convicted in a court of law. So that is standard for anybody. But tonight, this is about so much more than an overpaid, attention seeking, wanting a raise, Trump-hating actor. The Smollett case represents another example of what I have been saying since '07 and '08. Journalism in this country is dead. In case after case after case, the mainstream media, they devour, you know, any story that just fits their radical, extreme extension of the Democratic socialist party agenda. If it advances the narrative that Donald Trump is evil and his supporters are bad and America is scary and racist and sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, the media mob will shift into full gear without performing any due diligence, without even picking up the telephone, without any kind of investigation, not even 5 minutes worth.  Look at what they did to the 16-year-old Covington high school student. And off a 15-second blurb, they accused him of being a racist, they went out, they harassed him, he accused of assaulting a 65-year-old activist and getting in his face. They tried to ruin this kid's life -- slander, smearing, besmirching, character assassination.  They accused Justice Kavanaugh of gang rape, every other weekend, he and his friends were drugging teenage girls and literally, you know, lining up in the hall for gang rapes that nobody ever reported and, of course, they tried to ruin his life, tried to call him an alcoholic. We know how that ended. He is now a Supreme Court justice. Remember, they falsely accused UVA students of rape. Remember the Duke Lacrosse players? They accused them of rape. Eighty-some-odd professors at Duke bought the story hook, line, and sinker without any evidence. And it turns out -- I actually went to meet some of the family members, some of the kids, doing my own due diligence. Now, they falsely accused Darren Wilson. Remember, he used to be a police officer. His career is over.   George Zimmerman, everybody saying he was guilty but there was an eyewitness that showed up. Several police in Baltimore, everybody was assured they were going to get guilty pleas. None of them dead.  And guess what? As we speak, they're falsely accusing President Trump of Russia collusion. That, too, is a hoax, while simultaneously ignoring what is now a mountain of evidence of the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in history where they tried to rig an election, and then undo an election of duly elected president of the United States. In the era of Trump, far left hoaxes, way too common. The media, way too complicit. But they buy these stories again and again, hook, line, sinker, vilifying innocent people in the process over and over again. When the stories are exposed, when the lies are revealed, so-called journalists and so-called news organizations, they move on. They just pretend like it never happened.  Well, like NBC News, they were talking all about this until this started happening. They were all over the Jussie Smollett story. With \"The Hill's\" Joe Concha, monitored all of MSNBC conspiracy TV's prime time shows. They totally ignore the charges against Smollett now, after they were pushing the hate crime narrative for weeks and weeks, they just backed down like it never happened.  NBC News, prominent Democrats, they employ the same tactic. Far left presidential front-runner Kamala Harris, just like Cory Booker, called the Smollett incident a modern lynching. Today after a meeting with the Reverend Al Sharpton, she totally ignored any questions about Smollett. Take a listen.",

As hordes of media, myself included, cameras, descended on him in a media scrum that I personally have never seen before. We shouted questions at him, he took no questions, then he got into the back of a black SUV, shielded by his bodyguards, and then went to the set of \"Empire\" where he was expected earlier in the day today before I got arrested. But that courtroom, when he was in their posting bond, it was so dramatic. The tension you could cut with a knife, as he as the assistant state attorney was reading these charges, a mountain of evidence. You can see Smollett staring daggers at her.

Is this a Trump supporter actually being punched in the face? What could be a politically motivated hate crime? The person involved will tell their story in a few minutes. First, we begin in Chicago once again and today after posting $100,000 bond, Jussie Smollett sprinted away from the media. The \"Empire\" actor spent the entire day in jail, a Cook County circuit court after he was arrested on felony charges for filing a false police report. Now, according to prosecutors, Smollett organized an elaborate, poorly executed hate crime hoax, leaving a massive trail of evidence. Take a look."

Defendant Smollett also included that he wanted Ola to place a rope around his neck, pour gasoline on him and yell, \"This is MAGA country.\" Smollett provided Abel with a $100 bill to purchase the rope, gasoline, ski mask, gloves, and the red baseball caps that resemble the ones that say, \"Make America Great Again\"."

Pretty brilliant. Now, phone records show the actor called them before and immediately after the incident. Another brilliant move. And texts show the trio coordinating the alleged hoax. Other texts revealing that one of the brothers even sold designer drugs to Smollett. And police are now saying Smollett likely scratched his own face to make the attack more believable. By the way, that kind of takes hating Trump psychosis to a whole new level. All occurring, of course, after Smollett allegedly sent himself a threatening racist letter containing a white powdery substance. Another genius move. We have forensics. Now, if this is all true, if this turns out to be true, nothing funny about it. Smollett wasted precious law enforcement resources in a city that has been wracked with real violent crimes for many, many years now. A city where young people and even women and children are shot. People are murdered every single week in Chicago, lots of them. It also appears that he used his celebrity status and race to smear and slander the people of Chicago, Trump supporters everywhere. And according to police, he did it for attention, sympathy, and because he was unhappy with his seven-figure salary? The judge called these alleged actions despicable. The Chicago police superintendent, Eddie Johnson is his name, rightly outraged. This was one of the single most powerful press conferences I have ever watched. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Jussie Smollett is no longer speaking with the media, although there are reports tonight that he is back on the set of \"Empire.\" His lawyers stated they are planning a, quote, \"aggressive defense\" and they ask that their client be given the presumptions of innocence. Even Smollett didn't afford the same noble principle to Justice Kavanaugh a few a months ago. He tweeted out, #ibelievedrChristineford and much worse. Still on this show, in spite of these unfolding events, we recognize that being innocent, presumed innocent until proven guilty and is inalienable right even afforded to those with no principles. And in this particular case, the evidence is beginning to look overwhelming and incontrovertible. None of it good for Mr. Smollett. Now, remember back a while ago, I said the same thing about Michael Avenatti. I'm sure he doesn't agree with much of what I have to say. Remember his case? That was a he said-she said. In the end, I kept saying, I will give him the due process and presumption of innocence that he never gave Judge Kavanaugh. There were three separate investigations, and he got cleared. In other words, they cleared him of any wrongdoing. Now, despite the massive amount of evidence against the \"Empire\" actor, you have to assume he's an innocent man until convicted in a court of law. So that is standard for anybody. But tonight, this is about so much more than an overpaid, attention seeking, wanting a raise, Trump-hating actor. The Smollett case represents another example of what I have been saying since '07 and '08. Journalism in this country is dead. In case after case after case, the mainstream media, they devour, you know, any story that just fits their radical, extreme extension of the Democratic socialist party agenda. If it advances the narrative that Donald Trump is evil and his supporters are bad and America is scary and racist and sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, the media mob will shift into full gear without performing any due diligence, without even picking up the telephone, without any kind of investigation, not even 5 minutes worth. Look at what they did to the 16-year-old Covington high school student. And off a 15-second blurb, they accused him of being a racist, they went out, they harassed him, he accused of assaulting a 65-year-old activist and getting in his face. They tried to ruin this kid's life -- slander, smearing, besmirching, character assassination. They accused Justice Kavanaugh of gang rape, every other weekend, he and his friends were drugging teenage girls and literally, you know, lining up in the hall for gang rapes that nobody ever reported and, of course, they tried to ruin his life, tried to call him an alcoholic. We know how that ended. He is now a Supreme Court justice. Remember, they falsely accused UVA students of rape. Remember the Duke Lacrosse players? They accused them of rape. Eighty-some-odd professors at Duke bought the story hook, line, and sinker without any evidence. And it turns out -- I actually went to meet some of the family members, some of the kids, doing my own due diligence. Now, they falsely accused Darren Wilson. Remember, he used to be a police officer. His career is over. George Zimmerman, everybody saying he was guilty but there was an eyewitness that showed up. Several police in Baltimore, everybody was assured they were going to get guilty pleas. None of them dead. And guess what? As we speak, they're falsely accusing President Trump of Russia collusion. That, too, is a hoax, while simultaneously ignoring what is now a mountain of evidence of the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in history where they tried to rig an election, and then undo an election of duly elected president of the United States. In the era of Trump, far left hoaxes, way too common. The media, way too complicit. But they buy these stories again and again, hook, line, sinker, vilifying innocent people in the process over and over again. When the stories are exposed, when the lies are revealed, so-called journalists and so-called news organizations, they move on. They just pretend like it never happened. Well, like NBC News, they were talking all about this until this started happening. They were all over the Jussie Smollett story. With \"The Hill's\" Joe Concha, monitored all of MSNBC conspiracy TV's prime time shows. They totally ignore the charges against Smollett now, after they were pushing the hate crime narrative for weeks and weeks, they just backed down like it never happened. NBC News, prominent Democrats, they employ the same tactic. Far left presidential front-runner Kamala Harris, just like Cory Booker, called the Smollett incident a modern lynching. Today after a meeting with the Reverend Al Sharpton, she totally ignored any questions about Smollett. Take a listen."

As hordes of media, myself included, cameras, descended on him in a media scrum that I personally have never seen before. We shouted questions at him, he took no questions, then he got into the back of a black SUV, shielded by his bodyguards, and then went to the set of \"Empire\" where he was expected earlier in the day today before I got arrested. But that courtroom, when he was in their posting bond, it was so dramatic. The tension you could cut with a knife, as he as the assistant state attorney was reading these charges, a mountain of evidence. You can see Smollett staring daggers at her. The evidence was so detailed, down to the fact that this man, Abel, one of the two alleged attackers, was his former drug dealer, and even down to what Jesse Smollett wanted them to do and say in the attack. Take a listen."

Who gives their brother's name and throws them under the bus? But secondly, what kind of criminal think they'll get it away when the police arrest you, fingerprint you and photograph you, and they know which body committed the crime? I guess the answer to that is the same kind of criminal who writes a check to pay for the crime. The fact that they expended so much money, the police expended 24 detectives assigned to this case in a city that has 56 shootings in a weekend, and as reported like 30 percent chance of rain."

These are the kinds of things that judges take into consideration. On top of the fact that when it started falling apart, when the whole thing started falling part, instead of just remaining silent like any good, non- check-writing criminal would do, he goes on the offensive and starts saying, I can't believe that my friends would have been the ones who assaulted me.

According to multiple eyewitnesses, an unidentified individual confronted the Turning Point table before physically assaulting Hayden Williams, The Leadership Institute field representative who was helping Turning Point. The actual punch was caught on camera, but not what led up to it. Take a look."

That sort of behaviors reprehensible, it's intolerable. A message was sent by our police force to the campus community with a picture of the suspect and request that anyone with information about the incident come forward and report what they know in support of our Police Department's ongoing investigation. We intend to identify and bring the perpetrators to justice\". A photo of the suspect has been released, as you can see on your screen, as a search for him now is ongoing at this hour. Joining us now with reaction, the student at the center of this controversy, Hayden Williams is with us, Fox News Contributor, Campus Reform Editor-in-Chief our own Lawrence Jones is here. All right. Let me - obviously, there's a lot going on here. Is that black eye by the way from this incident?"

And on Tuesday, I was invited to UC Berkeley's campus to help a conservative group Turning Point recruit new members. And while I was there some students took offense to our sign that we had that said, \"Hate crime hoaxes hurt real victims\". And this person who claimed we were promoting violence on campus and proceeded to take his aggression out on us."

So I pulled out my phone to start recording and his friend - one of the gentleman that approached our table smacked my phone out of my hand and--"

This is a school that's been burned down almost because they don't like the conservative point of view on the college campus. And so it's not just an isolated event here. The conservative view is under attack and you have professors that are on that campus that don't want the conservative view and students there. So it's something we've got to take seriously, Sean."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

They followed the evidence. Didn't listen to the mainstream media. Great job, CPD and I agree and their superintendent's amazing. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura's next.
