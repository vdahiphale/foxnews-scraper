Just wait for it. Well, on Sunday, the report delivered that truth. There was no collusion. Now, the left is telling us that that verdict itself is part of a larger conspiracy. More on that just ahead. But first tonight, just hours ago, prosecutors in Chicago dropped all charges against actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett, you'll remember was facing 16 felony counts for faking an elaborate hate crime against himself back in January. Police say Smollett hired two Nigerian body builders to hang a noose on his neck, pour bleach on him and screamed, \"This is MAGA country.\" Because that kind of thing happens a lot in downtown Chicago during the winter months. Smollett then told credulous reporters he had been assaulted by two white racist Trump supporters.  Well, as of tonight, police still believe that Smollett was lying all of that, so do prosecutors. They think he concocted the hoax and they said so, yet again today. And yet the state of Illinois is somehow for some reason, dumping the case anyway. In exchange for the $100,000.00 he has already paid in bond, Smollett will walk free. His record will be expunged. Everything will be return to normal like it never happened.  Smollett described his decision as a victory, not just for him but for the broader cause of Civil Rights.",

Have they formed a union? Will they hold a convention? There are enough of them, they could. And how exactly has Smollett who last we checked was an actor on a TV show, fought for the quote, \"justice, equality and betterment of marginalized people everywhere?\" Was pouring bleach on himself part of that fight? How did the noose and the Nigerian body builders figure into Smollett's struggle for justice and equality? And by the way, why aren't the rest of us laughing at this? It is just too absurd.   CNN doesn't think it is funny. They are taking Jussie Smollett very seriously as they always have.

      "sentences": "\"We may never really know.\" So it looks like we are just going to have to agree to disagree on this whole Jussie Smollett thing. But wait, does anyone know any news reporters? They should have some free time these days, post-Russia hysteria. Maybe they could find out more about this. For example, why isn't Jussie Smollett concerned about the two white racists he says attacked him? Shouldn't you be leading the charge to lock these villains up? According to Smollett, they are still on the loose.  They are free to assault other hapless biracial TV actors who are just looking to get a Subway sandwich at 2:00 a.m. in the morning on the streets of Chicago, and we need to stop them before they do.  What about the Chicago Police Department? It is led by an African-American Chief, but that doesn't mean it is not part of the wider racist conspiracy.  It must be. Chicago cops just framed Jussie Smollett as a liar and destroyed his reputation. And yet, for some reason, Smollett does not seem to care about that. He says he just wants to quote, \"move on.\" That's odd. And what about the Nigerian brothers?   Last month, both CNN and the \"Chicago Tribune\" reported the man had told police they had rehearsed the attack on Jussie Smollett. Was that a lie?  Will Smollett sue them now for defamation? Other news outlets reported that police discovered rope, bleach and masks in the brother's apartment.  Apparently, Smollett's records show he was talking to the brothers immediately before and immediately after the attack he alleged. What was that all about? Well, we could go on and on. But why bother? You know exactly what is happening here. Smollett isn't getting off because he is innocent. He is not an innocent.  He is something better than innocent. He is famous. The charges against him were dropped because someone in power called someone else in power and said, \"Let him go.\" None of this had anything to do with justice, it's the opposite of justice.  Even in famously corrupt Chicago, what was happening was just too obvious.  The mayor and the Chief of Police pretended to be very shocked by it.",

Well, she issued a statement explaining that the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped in part because of his quote, \"volunteer service in the community.\" Okay, what was that service?   Well, according to a news account tonight, Smollett spent a total of 18 hours over two days at Jesse Jackson's lobbying organization, the Rainbow Push Coalition. While he was there, Smollett spent his time and this is a direct quote, \"stuffing membership envelopes, working in the group's bookstore to sell merchandise and critiquing its Saturday broadcast.\" He also quote, \"Worked with the music director on a plan to build the choir.\"  Apparently the community was greatly enriched by all of this. We should note that Jesse Jackson who runs it, is one of the most politically powerful people in the City of Chicago. It helps to have friends like that, and if you don't believe it, just go ahead and try it yourself. Go ahead and stage a fake hate crime in which you slander an entire group of people on the basis of their skin color and political beliefs, then head over to \"Good Morning, America\" and conduct a tearful interview with the sympathetic Robin Roberts. Describe yourself as a victim of systemic racism in this country and then get caught doing it. Tell us how you do? Then let us know when the visiting hours are. We will come see you in prison.  Smollett is not going to prison. He was smarter than that. He knew he would never be punished. He knows Jesse Jackson. He is friends with Kamala Harris and Barack and Michelle Obama. Don Lemon at CNN text Jussie all the time on his cellphone and brags about it.  Jussie Smollett may claim to fight for marginalized people, but he is not one of them. In fact, he occupies the highest rank a privilege and our society. He is above the law. Increasingly, there seem to be quite a few people like that and this country. You will recognize them because they are the ones always lecturing you about help bigoted and unfair America is.  What they don't understand is that they are proving that point.

And then we realized that not only did Smollett grow up in a communist household with ties to the Black Panthers, but he also works with Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris was one of the first Democrats to jump on this hoax, this obvious hoax to use it to advance their own political agenda. And then also on the other side of the political spectrum, you have Kim Foxx, so you have Kim Foxx, who Kamala Harris was her mentor, Kim Foxx's his campaign was funded by George Soros, we know this now. And all it takes was a phone call from the Obama's, for her to drop this prosecution.   This is the reason why President Trump won. And this is the reason why President Trump will win again.

Court record show Daniels' former attorney presented his client Gregory Barela with a phony documents saying that a $1.6 million settlement check would arrive in March of last year when it actually arrived in January of last year. Prosecutors say he had the money transferred from a client trust account into his own account to pay his personal expenses. Then there's the allegation by a former Financial Officer for Stormys' attorneys Tully's Coffee Shops. The employee says even though he directed her not to pay the company's payroll taxes, he was funneling coffee shop money into license fees and sponsorships for his car racing team and separately when the IRS contacted him about unpaid taxes for his coffee company, prosecutors say he changed the company's name shifted bank accounts, sold off assets and pocketed the money. Prosecutors also say Daniels' former attorney used phony tax returns to gain millions of dollars in bank loans and now the Feds say not only did he receive nearly $4 million in loans, he never actually filed those tax returns and never actually paid any taxes, but they say he was spending money for example, he paid nearly a million dollars to an ex-wife for child support and alimony, $176,000.00 to a private vacation club. $69,000.00 on luxury watches $82,000.00 on a Porsche and he also shelled out millions for homes in Laguna Beach and Newport Beach which are right next to each other, you think he'd just pick one -- Tucker.",

When I was 16, did I pay taxes? Yes, I worked. I paid taxes.  I paid payroll taxes, maybe not income taxes.

Just wait for it. Well, on Sunday, the report delivered that truth. There was no collusion. Now, the left is telling us that that verdict itself is part of a larger conspiracy. More on that just ahead. But first tonight, just hours ago, prosecutors in Chicago dropped all charges against actor Jussie Smollett. Smollett, you'll remember was facing 16 felony counts for faking an elaborate hate crime against himself back in January. Police say Smollett hired two Nigerian body builders to hang a noose on his neck, pour bleach on him and screamed, \"This is MAGA country.\" Because that kind of thing happens a lot in downtown Chicago during the winter months. Smollett then told credulous reporters he had been assaulted by two white racist Trump supporters. Well, as of tonight, police still believe that Smollett was lying all of that, so do prosecutors. They think he concocted the hoax and they said so, yet again today. And yet the state of Illinois is somehow for some reason, dumping the case anyway. In exchange for the $100,000.00 he has already paid in bond, Smollett will walk free. His record will be expunged. Everything will be return to normal like it never happened. Smollett described his decision as a victory, not just for him but for the broader cause of Civil Rights."

And how exactly has Smollett who last we checked was an actor on a TV show, fought for the quote, \"justice, equality and betterment of marginalized people everywhere?\" Was pouring bleach on himself part of that fight? How did the noose and the Nigerian body builders figure into Smollett's struggle for justice and equality? And by the way, why aren't the rest of us laughing at this? It is just too absurd. CNN doesn't think it is funny. They are taking Jussie Smollett very seriously as they always have.

They should have some free time these days, post-Russia hysteria. Maybe they could find out more about this. For example, why isn't Jussie Smollett concerned about the two white racists he says attacked him? Shouldn't you be leading the charge to lock these villains up? According to Smollett, they are still on the loose.  They are free to assault other hapless biracial TV actors who are just looking to get a Subway sandwich at 2:00 a.m. in the morning on the streets of Chicago, and we need to stop them before they do. What about the Chicago Police Department? It is led by an African-American Chief, but that doesn't mean it is not part of the wider racist conspiracy.  It must be. Chicago cops just framed Jussie Smollett as a liar and destroyed his reputation. And yet, for some reason, Smollett does not seem to care about that. He says he just wants to quote, \"move on.\" That's odd. And what about the Nigerian brothers? Last month, both CNN and the \"Chicago Tribune\" reported the man had told police they had rehearsed the attack on Jussie Smollett. Was that a lie?  Will Smollett sue them now for defamation? Other news outlets reported that police discovered rope, bleach and masks in the brother's apartment.  Apparently, Smollett's records show he was talking to the brothers immediately before and immediately after the attack he alleged. What was that all about? Well, we could go on and on. But why bother? You know exactly what is happening here. Smollett isn't getting off because he is innocent. He is not an innocent.  He is something better than innocent. He is famous. The charges against him were dropped because someone in power called someone else in power and said, \"Let him go.\" None of this had anything to do with justice, it's the opposite of justice. Even in famously corrupt Chicago, what was happening was just too obvious.  The mayor and the Chief of Police pretended to be very shocked by it."

      "utterance": "A whitewash of justice. So did the State's Attorney who dropped these charges answer that? Well, she issued a statement explaining that the charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped in part because of his quote, \"volunteer service in the community.\" Okay, what was that service? Well, according to a news account tonight, Smollett spent a total of 18 hours over two days at Jesse Jackson's lobbying organization, the Rainbow Push Coalition. While he was there, Smollett spent his time and this is a direct quote, \"stuffing membership envelopes, working in the group's bookstore to sell merchandise and critiquing its Saturday broadcast.\" He also quote, \"Worked with the music director on a plan to build the choir.\"  Apparently the community was greatly enriched by all of this. We should note that Jesse Jackson who runs it, is one of the most politically powerful people in the City of Chicago. It helps to have friends like that, and if you don't believe it, just go ahead and try it yourself. Go ahead and stage a fake hate crime in which you slander an entire group of people on the basis of their skin color and political beliefs, then head over to \"Good Morning, America\" and conduct a tearful interview with the sympathetic Robin Roberts. Describe yourself as a victim of systemic racism in this country and then get caught doing it. Tell us how you do? Then let us know when the visiting hours are. We will come see you in prison. Smollett is not going to prison. He was smarter than that. He knew he would never be punished. He knows Jesse Jackson. He is friends with Kamala Harris and Barack and Michelle Obama. Don Lemon at CNN text Jussie all the time on his cellphone and brags about it. Jussie Smollett may claim to fight for marginalized people, but he is not one of them. In fact, he occupies the highest rank a privilege and our society. He is above the law. Increasingly, there seem to be quite a few people like that and this country. You will recognize them because they are the ones always lecturing you about help bigoted and unfair America is.  What they don't understand is that they are proving that point.

It's getting people out on bond who should be sitting in jail. It is people that should have been sitting in jail and unfortunately, shooting up a car over the weekend costing the life of a fine person. One of our members who was killed in a sitting car by a person that should have been sitting in jail. Instead, they decided to give them a little bond and he was out. This is a travesty of justice all the way around. Our detectives are mad.  Our members are angry and they want justice. And I hope that the Attorney General for the Northern District of Illinois responds to this because there were still letters that Jussie Smollett claimed that were sent to him and if that's proved to be also a hoax, then Federal charges can be brought."

And here we have the perfect stitch up of the Democratic Party, the entertainment industry and the media all in one. So what does Jussie Smollett do, as soon as it begins to be clear that his lie is unfolding, he hires Harvey Weinstein's crisis control people and then he hires Mark Geragos, whatever his name is, the attorney who works for CNN, who was Michael Jackson's attorney, who is Chris Brown's attorney, a man who makes a career getting pedophiles and wife beaters off the hook. And then we realized that not only did Smollett grow up in a communist household with ties to the Black Panthers, but he also works with Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris was one of the first Democrats to jump on this hoax, this obvious hoax to use it to advance their own political agenda. And then also on the other side of the political spectrum, you have Kim Foxx, so you have Kim Foxx, who Kamala Harris was her mentor, Kim Foxx's his campaign was funded by George Soros, we know this now. And all it takes was a phone call from the Obama's, for her to drop this prosecution. This is the reason why President Trump won. And this is the reason why President Trump will win again. It's not because Russians are, you know, hiding in your cereal bowl, and it's not because there's Nazis running around and white supremacists, it's this level of corruption. It's this evil level of corruption on the Democratic Party that everyone sees. And you know, people may be dismayed by this. But I don't think there will be dismayed on November -- in November 2020."

And then on Sunday, Muller dashed their dreams. After conducting the most thorough investigation in recent American history, he concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the government of Russia. For the left, this was disastrous news. It was the political equivalent of a stock market crash, literally. Ratings on CNN and MSNBC plummeted immediately, in some cases by more than 50%. They promised her audience a conspiracy, when the conspiracy evaporated so did their viewers. Democratic office holders faced a similar problem. What do you say to the mob on Twitter that secretly believes that Trump speaks Russian? Tough questions. They decided to say nothing, just pretend that nothing has changed.

Prosecutors say he had the money transferred from a client trust account into his own account to pay his personal expenses. Then there's the allegation by a former Financial Officer for Stormys' attorneys Tully's Coffee Shops. The employee says even though he directed her not to pay the company's payroll taxes, he was funneling coffee shop money into license fees and sponsorships for his car racing team and separately when the IRS contacted him about unpaid taxes for his coffee company, prosecutors say he changed the company's name shifted bank accounts, sold off assets and pocketed the money. Prosecutors also say Daniels' former attorney used phony tax returns to gain millions of dollars in bank loans and now the Feds say not only did he receive nearly $4 million in loans, he never actually filed those tax returns and never actually paid any taxes, but they say he was spending money for example, he paid nearly a million dollars to an ex-wife for child support and alimony, $176,000.00 to a private vacation club. $69,000.00 on luxury watches $82,000.00 on a Porsche and he also shelled out millions for homes in Laguna Beach and Newport Beach which are right next to each other, you think he'd just pick one -- Tucker."

He's got some time. Look, what I really enjoyed and what was very important about your initial coverage of this fool, was the fact that he appeared to be exploiting one of his clients, Stormy Daniels, right, is that he was making money from her and she was reduced to doing tours of strip clubs in the process of him representing her, and that's what it spoke to. It spoke to issue of his character."

I'm not embarrassed to say that right. And I feel bad for her. And I said that to him and he said that her stripping in some sad club in Richmond, Virginia was an act of female empowerment. He actually said that."

You know, when you're seven years old, yes, when you show me a seven-year-old who says, \"When I grow up, I want to be stripping at some club on a rural road and in Virginia.\" No girl says that. That's not what we aspire to. Miss Daniels has an opportunity to remake herself. She's had problems with him as well. And look, if all of the charges against him are true, this guy is like the Zelig of criminals. I mean, he's like trying -- he is trying to adjust or would seem to be involved in so many different kinds of behaviors and crime, but it could be explained by a comment he made to \"The View\" that they asked him inexplicably somehow moved into what his sexual fantasies were and he said they all involved handcuffs. So now it looks like he's gotten one part of his dream fulfilled."

A group of Democrats in Congress has led a campaign to lower the voting age nationwide to 16, Nancy Pelosi endorsed it. One republican who's not crazy, by the way conservative, Republican Michael Burgess of Texas has joined them to support lowering the voting age to 16 years old and he was brave enough and gracious enough to come on our show tonight and explain it and we're grateful for that.

So let's not frighten people that this is a structural change in our society. However, I'm on the Rules Committee, and part of my job on the Rules Committee is to evaluate ideas that come before the Rules Committee as amendments and when this representative from Massachusetts came forward and said, here's my idea and I want it consider by the Rules Committee, and my first thought was, \"Oh, no, that's not a good idea.\" But as I thought about it, you see things through the lens of your own experience. When I was 16, did I pay taxes? Yes, I worked. I paid taxes.  I paid payroll taxes, maybe not income taxes. And then here's the other thing that really after the sort of the 24 hours between the Rules Committee and the time the amendment came on the floor, what about this structural debt we are leaving to 16 year olds? The national debt? This generation of adolescents is going to inherit more debt than any other generation. And I think I've heard you talk on this, not just the structural debt, there is the acquired debt, there's the student loan debt that they are picking up."

The charges were dropped in exchange for community service and forfeiting that $10,000.00 bond.

How dare he?\" Just want to make that clear before we proceed. Okay, joining us now is Jason Nichols. He's a professor of African- American Studies in the University of Maryland. And we're always happy to have him. So this seems to me Professor, I mean, really, nobody disputes the guilt of -- nobody disputes that this was made up -- the police, the mayor, the prosecutors, even the State's Attorney, who let him off isn't saying it didn't happen.

I think if there's anyone who owes the city and apology, it should be Rahm Emanuel himself. It should be the Superintendent of Police, you know that they solve 5% of nonfatal shootings in Chicago.
