It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" We are awaiting a decision from Attorney General Jeff Sessions on whether he will fire Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe before his retirement on Sunday. It's a decision that will be consequential for McCabe's financial future with his lifetime pension at stake. Will Sessions carry through on the recommendation of the FBI's internal investigation to fire McCabe or overrule it?  The controversy is based on allegations McCabe authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter about the Clinton Foundation investigation and then lied about it. The White House says it's up to the Justice Department to make the call.",

And what we're really talking about here is something I have a lot of familiarity, which is leaks to reporters.  So, people like McCabe, it's not the case that he leaked the story, but that he was trying to, let's say, shape the story, so it would be beneficial for the FBI and not make the FBI look as if it was incompetent or had done something wrong. And then, when he was asked about it in terms of the investigation by the DOJ inspector general, it's not so much that he lied as he was kind of, you know, fudging, people describe it as not forthcoming, Dana.   And so, that is what has put him at risk here, and what is at risk for is that instead of getting his pension right now, he's going to turn 50 on Sunday, he'd have to wait until he's like 57 and it would be for a smaller amount of money. But the key point, I think, is that if this is not at all related to the investigation itself. It's not that he was found to have mismanaged, or lied, or been biased in terms of an investigation either for or against Mrs. Clinton. It's that he was leaking something apparently to the Wall Street Journal --",

So they have used the power of the president's rhetorical, you know, persuasion as an argument to say that it has deprived somebody of, you know, a fair trial or, in this case, saying there's vindictive prosecution going forward. I don't think that it will prevail, but thank you for the question.",

Remember when they held the press conference after the acquittal and they started blaming President Trump and started to nationalize the story. This is just a local story. The guy should have been locked up. And now, call it vindictive or not, he broke federal law. You cannot be in the possession of a firearm if you're an illegal immigrant. That's a 10 year mandatory. That's what they're trying to hit him with. And good, I hope they -- I hope he's punished. He deserves to be punished. The guy was -- I think it was a meth head. He'd been in across the border five or six times, convicted of multiple felonies.

And this guy was a symbol of what Donald Trump was talking about, which is that a system that does not follow the law allows for the pain and suffering of lawful citizens. And, you know, this -- it illustrated it to such a degree that I think it actually -- it helped elect him. I really think this helped elect him.  But the bigger point is -- there're four things that have happened in the last couple of years that kind of all have something in common. There's this case, there's Parkland. There was a killing in Boston where a mad man had stabbed a woman to death in a library. That was a couple weeks ago. There was a teenager that just murdered his friend at a slumber party after preaching to ISIS. All these things have in common are that they -- people knew about them beforehand. They were known as dangerous or problems by law enforcement, meaning all four of these horrible things, including this guy, could have been prevented if people had followed the law. If they had followed the law, this guy wouldn't have been in San Francisco, even if it was an accident and he was shooting at the ground and the bullet ricocheted. Yeah, he didn't mean to kill her.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" We are awaiting a decision from Attorney General Jeff Sessions on whether he will fire Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe before his retirement on Sunday. It's a decision that will be consequential for McCabe's financial future with his lifetime pension at stake. Will Sessions carry through on the recommendation of the FBI's internal investigation to fire McCabe or overrule it? The controversy is based on allegations McCabe authorized the disclosure of sensitive information to a reporter about the Clinton Foundation investigation and then lied about it. The White House says it's up to the Justice Department to make the call."

But we do think that it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior, and by most accounts, a bad actor and should have some cause for concern, but that would be a determination that DOJ would have to make."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Now, Juan, I think something that's gotten a little bit lost in this story as it's developed, because the president has weighed in. They weighed from White House about him. But this recommendation is actually coming from the FBI's Office of Personnel Responsibility. So, in some ways, I think you could probably expect the attorney general to accept the recommendation. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, so there's two schools of thought on this. One is Andy McCabe is widely liked within the FBI. Jim Comey, his former boss, said he was a stand-up guy. And what we're really talking about here is something I have a lot of familiarity, which is leaks to reporters. So, people like McCabe, it's not the case that he leaked the story, but that he was trying to, let's say, shape the story, so it would be beneficial for the FBI and not make the FBI look as if it was incompetent or had done something wrong. And then, when he was asked about it in terms of the investigation by the DOJ inspector general, it's not so much that he lied as he was kind of, you know, fudging, people describe it as not forthcoming, Dana. And so, that is what has put him at risk here, and what is at risk for is that instead of getting his pension right now, he's going to turn 50 on Sunday, he'd have to wait until he's like 57 and it would be for a smaller amount of money. But the key point, I think, is that if this is not at all related to the investigation itself. It's not that he was found to have mismanaged, or lied, or been biased in terms of an investigation either for or against Mrs. Clinton. It's that he was leaking something apparently to the Wall Street Journal --"

      "utterance": "Well, that -- we've talked a lot about leaks in the last couple of years, Kimberly, and how they can be damaging, and we know that people use leaks to their advantage as they try to shape a story. But one of the things that the FBI has been saying is that this is actually about other agents in the field all the way across, that you have to set an example, and just because you make it up to the 7th floor of the FBI doesn't mean you get a pass on something like this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, and if they make a determination of wrongdoing then they have to, you know, act on that. But this is well within the purview of the attorney general to make that decision, again, not the president. So I believe that Jeff Sessions will make an honest and fair determination and will not seek to just have -- seek favor with the president, thinking that this is something that the president wants. So he's got to be, you know, follow the law, and uphold justice here, and make that finding. And I think that he will. And he'll be confident in the decision that he makes."

      "utterance": "The real strange thing about all of this is that McCabe, so far, has been worried more about pensions than prison. That's not the choice that was given to Michael Flynn. Michael Flynn, if you'll recall, was charged with false statements, even though Comey's investigators reportedly believed that Flynn didn't intend to mislead them. That's not apparently the conclusion of the inspector general with regard to McCabe."

And the more information we find out about Flynn, the less guilty he looks because now a judge is reviewing the plea. And the more we know about McCabe, the more guilty he looks. I mean, look at the insurance policy conversation between the two love birds, Strzok and Page --"

And, he didn't disclose, in a timely fashion, the donations to his wife's campaign from a Clinton connected group. I think it's a little harsh, to be honest with you, to fire a guy the day before he collects his pension. He's working for the federal government for the American people for two decades. I do find that harsh. At the same time, if you're going to go by the book, and this is something that's recommended, as you said, by the investigators at the inspector general's office, or whoever, the ethics --"

Now, Zarate's attorneys are accusing U.S. government of acting, quote, \"with vindictive prosecution,\" end quote, after getting hit with a second set of charges. They're arguing, quote, \"this case was highly publicized both locally and nationally almost immediately after the death of Ms. Steinle, then presidential candidate Donald Trump began to use Mr. Garcia Zarate as the symbol of the dangerous illegal immigrant constitute and the need for a wall between the United States and Mexico,\" end quote.

This is the type of stuff that he likes to take on, this novel. He's using, like, vindictive prosecution in trying to bring in President Trump. I've seen a lot of that lately, when they try to bring in the president and say, oh, the president has, you know, polluted this atmosphere and the environment and made it unfair to get a fair trial because of the comments that he has made or his activity on Twitter, et cetera. So they have used the power of the president's rhetorical, you know, persuasion as an argument to say that it has deprived somebody of, you know, a fair trial or, in this case, saying there's vindictive prosecution going forward. I don't think that it will prevail, but thank you for the question."

They should have gone with the manslaughter instead of the murder one. But it's a show boat type of deal. I mean, this is a Hail Mary, it's not going to work. Remember when they held the press conference after the acquittal and they started blaming President Trump and started to nationalize the story. This is just a local story. The guy should have been locked up. And now, call it vindictive or not, he broke federal law. You cannot be in the possession of a firearm if you're an illegal immigrant. That's a 10 year mandatory. That's what they're trying to hit him with. And good, I hope they -- I hope he's punished. He deserves to be punished. The guy was -- I think it was a meth head. He'd been in across the border five or six times, convicted of multiple felonies. And whether it was an accidental shooting or it was a purposeful shooting, he cost Kate Steinle her life and he should pay the price for it.

And we know where that all started and for good reason because it was outrageous that she lost her life and that the family is going to have to spend their life missing her, and being so heartbroken about it. So, he was acquitted the first time. In some ways, I feel like they should just be thankful for that. And I guess we'll see what happens in this next case. The -- they've tried to use President Trump's tweets before like in the travel ban case, and it wasn't successful because they said it wasn't material to the things. So I don't know what will happen in this case. I doubt it will be something you can specifically pin on President Trump because everyone was talking about it and it didn't start with Trump."

That's been the liberal strategy with every crisis, never left a scandal or crisis go to waste. They always know where to find a poster boy and run with it. And this guy was a symbol of what Donald Trump was talking about, which is that a system that does not follow the law allows for the pain and suffering of lawful citizens. And, you know, this -- it illustrated it to such a degree that I think it actually -- it helped elect him. I really think this helped elect him. But the bigger point is -- there're four things that have happened in the last couple of years that kind of all have something in common. There's this case, there's Parkland. There was a killing in Boston where a mad man had stabbed a woman to death in a library. That was a couple weeks ago. There was a teenager that just murdered his friend at a slumber party after preaching to ISIS. All these things have in common are that they -- people knew about them beforehand. They were known as dangerous or problems by law enforcement, meaning all four of these horrible things, including this guy, could have been prevented if people had followed the law. If they had followed the law, this guy wouldn't have been in San Francisco, even if it was an accident and he was shooting at the ground and the bullet ricocheted. Yeah, he didn't mean to kill her. But he never would have been there if they followed the law. Donald Trump was elected because he was talking about a return to law. That's why this was such a symbol and why it worked."
