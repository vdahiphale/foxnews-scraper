Over the weekend the owner of a Lexington, Virginia eatery, you probably heard of that, it's called the Red Hen did something incredible. She asked White House spokeswoman, press secretary Sarah Sanders and her family to leave the restaurant, simple because she works for Trump. Well the owner of the Red Hen Stephanie Wilkinson told the Washington Post, \"I have a business and I want the business to thrive. This feels like the moment in our democracy where people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals\". So Ms Morality walked Sarah Huckabee outside and told her the Red Hen has, \"Certain standards that I fell it has to uphold such as honesty, compassion and cooperation\". And she invited Huckabee to leave, which the White House press secretary did.  Now Huckabee returned home with her husband but the rest of the family went to another restaurant across the street. Well that didn't stop Wilkinson or her crusade to drive Conservatives apparently from establishments, even ones she doesn't run, in the same town. Governor Mike Huckabee was on my radio show today.",

The left has created a political culture where demonization of opponents and boycotts are routine. Hey, if you can't debate them and beat them in a debate, try to shut them down altogether. Organized chaos is their favourite tool, yes, it's very Alinskyite.   But the idea is not to come to some common understanding, or even win an argument of course, but to destroy political opponents and you bet, attempt to silence them. When Democrats are urging uprisings online to deny Republican women safe havens, peace, just having a dinner in private, in a public place? A moment of enjoyment for her family, they won't allow that? Something is deeply wrong. Now is the moment for all people, right and left, to condemn this uncivil disobedience and those advocating for it. Threatening, yelling and haranguing officials in public? That's not going to create positive outcomes or a better policy, even Chuck Schumer said that today, good for him. It will only harden the political divide in this country and perhaps, lead to violence. And any blood spilt, remember what happed a year ago with Steve Scalise, any blood spilled will be on the hands of Maxine Waters and any Democrats or never-Trumpers condoning tacitly or explicitly these ANTIFA style tactics of vicious intimidation.

There would be called for the National Guard to step in, but since Conservatives are being targeted, all bets are off, all standards are out the window. This is all evolving into a type of domestic terrorism and it's only going to get worse. Homeland security chief, remember Kirstin Nielson, was driven out of a restaurant in DC last week by angry protesters. White House senior advisor Steven Miller was also reportedly heckled at a DC eatery. And tonight protesters are reportedly staked outside his apartment building. They even staged a protest outside of Nielson's home, blaring audio of this child separation at a border facility. These are anarchic, organized spectacles, they're no accident. Each flash protest is planned out and choreographed. It's planned online first, again, and it's meant to shame the political opponent to stoke violence and hatred, and maybe even intimidate people in the future from getting involved in the Trump administration at all.

She seems to be using her office to foment, or at least justify, acts of harassment, intimidation, that could very well lead to violence. Now reactions of outrage from the White House to Nancy Pelosi forced Waters to the microphone today.

They've cheapened everything from the music to fashion but Trump is to blame for the vulgarity of the culture? Nice try. Our politics are now devoid of conversation, debate, ideas. The left has created a political culture where demonization of opponents and boycotts are routine. Hey, if you can't debate them and beat them in a debate, try to shut them down altogether. Organized chaos is their favourite tool, yes, it's very Alinskyite. But the idea is not to come to some common understanding, or even win an argument of course, but to destroy political opponents and you bet, attempt to silence them. When Democrats are urging uprisings online to deny Republican women safe havens, peace, just having a dinner in private, in a public place? A moment of enjoyment for her family, they won't allow that? Something is deeply wrong. Now is the moment for all people, right and left, to condemn this uncivil disobedience and those advocating for it. Threatening, yelling and haranguing officials in public? That's not going to create positive outcomes or a better policy, even Chuck Schumer said that today, good for him. It will only harden the political divide in this country and perhaps, lead to violence. And any blood spilt, remember what happed a year ago with Steve Scalise, any blood spilled will be on the hands of Maxine Waters and any Democrats or never-Trumpers condoning tacitly or explicitly these ANTIFA style tactics of vicious intimidation. And we will not stand for that, and that's the Angle. All right, let's discuss with my first guest, Monica Crowley, senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research, Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee and Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein is a former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jason I got to start with you, former member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters comment, a non-apology apology this morning at 9am on radio.

I think that is very appropriate. Make members of the House of Representatives vote on whether on not they think it's acceptable what she's doing, what she's trying to do. Because this is the face of the resistance movement, it is violent, it is vulgar, it is a scorcher philosophy and it is going to lead to violence unless the rest of the body stands up and says, \"This is not acceptable\""

We saw that video of somebody walking up the steps and getting punched in the face. Somebody got knocked over, driven over and murdered in Charlottesville because they were racist protesting or taking issue with the protesters in Charlottesville. So people have gotten hurt from uncivil behaviour and I think for people who are Trump defenders to stand up on behalf of somebody who mocks a disabled, you know go down the list, derided a gold start family, the list goes on, for them to call out somebody else for being uncivil is a bit much. Look, Maxine Waters is not the face, much as you or others would want them of the Democratic Party.

I think part of what he's trying to determine, when this investigation really began because they were saying that this investigation into the Trump possible collusion began into the end of July of 2016. But indications are that it began in the spring of 2016. State department very well involved, the Christopher Steele and that Dossier, in and out of the halls of justice and perhaps the state department so I think that's what they're worried about. That who was really running this investigation and who gave it the impetus Judge, from the very beginning?"

And to the extent that there was, I mean I'm interested in example, in knowing how this informant who started out as a CIA asset suddenly became an FBI informant. You know, those two organizations don't really play with each other's toys. And I don't understand how that happened, who brought it about, who paid him, what he was told about his responsibility in going into the Trump campaign, and when that happened. That is something that I think we ought to know, and if there were any others obviously we ought to know that as well."

And again, it looks like one of them, Mr. Clinesmith, was writing unbelievable text messages that he was so depressed after the election, he was stressed and depressed, and basically saying the resistance lives on. He's involved at the heart of this investigation along with Strzok and of course Moyer. But we're not revealing whose these people are? Why? They're not undercover agents."

And I think that Ad even more significant, at least to me, is not just the statements about the resistance but rather a set of messages that pass between Strzok and his friend the night that Donald Trump got the nomination where she wrote to him this is unbelievable that Trump has gotten the nomination. His response was, yes, this increases the pressure to terminate MYE, which was the code name, midyear exam, for the Clinton investigation. That's not just an expression of opinion, that is a statement about how we ought to do our jobs. And that on my reading was not in the I.G. report, I don't recall seeing it.

I've never worked at DOJ, but if that's the way business is done at the DOJ at these high levels, we are in big trouble in this country. Big trouble."

We discussed the dangers of the left lurch from political dialogue towards physical confrontations in tonight's Angle. But other questions linger. Did the Red Hen restaurant violate the rights of White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders when it kicked her out? And did Congresswoman Maxine Water illegally incite leftists to commit violence? Here to debate both of these issues, attorney and former Georgia state rep LaDawn Jones and political analyst and Washington attorney Gayle Trotter. OK Gayle, you have the floor. What possible cause of action could Sanders have against this restaurant?"

      "speaker": "LADAWN JONES, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "I agree. I also don't applaud the action but I don't think there's a cause of action there. Our legislatures in Virginia or anywhere else have to make it very clear that they do not allow discrimination based on political beliefs. They would have to prove int his cause of action to be successful that this location, the Red Hen, they always stop people with these particular personal beliefs or political beliefs rather than just Sarah Sanders herself. And because this was targeted directly at her and for her participation with the Trump organization, I don't think that they could win here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "I disagree. The comments that the restaurant owner made specifically said they were denying that service based on her personal beliefs. And when you look at those particular statements they would be entered into evidence as completely exonerating Sarah Sanders and making sure that the restaurant had discriminated against her. And even if you go to the point saying that Virginia statute only allows places not to discriminate based on religion, certainly in immigration religion has come into this over and over again. People on both sides have been citing Bible statutes talking about this and saying definitely this is a religious issue as well."

We've seen these laws come through several states where there were direct things that our laws have prohibited based on race, religion, sexual orientation that conservatives have fought very hard to say it's OK for someone to express their personal beliefs for religious freedoms.

That followed Attorney General Jeff Sessions quoting the Bible to justify that policy. So all of this has sparked a really big debate. It's really interesting among Christian leaders on immigration. So let's discuss that now with a pair of very distinguished religious leaders, I'm delighted they are both with us, Dr. Darrell Scott of the president's Faith Advisory Council, and Dr. Kent Ingle, president of Southeastern University. Great to see you both. Dr. Ingle, let's start with you. You're actually, I think, a supporter of the president but you disagree with his policy that it initially, at least, separated families, child in one area, parents more in a formal immigration detention. Why?"

      "utterance": "Sure. I appreciate President Trump's leadership, and he is trying to do the right thing. He wants to uphold the laws of the land, there's no doubt about that. I think the issue there was to not only provide protection which is what he wants to do as it relates to borders, but I think also you have to look at compassion. How do you bring the human element into this situation so that you can provide human dignity and respect and care and compassion and provide an element that gives both. And I think that's the thing that a lot of Americans are hoping that our president will step up in a way, along with the congress, the House, the Senate, our leaders will do the right thing and provide that protective and compassionate pieces to this legislation."

      "utterance": "For our Christians to quote Romans 13 over Jesus of Nazareth, as if Jesus of Nazareth doesn't exist, that it seems to me is highly problematic. And it's just flat out wrong. It's unbiblical, it's un-Christian, and it's un- American."

      "speaker": "PASTOR DARRELL SCOTT, TRUMP FAITH ADVISORY COUNCIL",
      "utterance": "It's not unreasonable to refer to the scripture, especially if you are a Bible believer. It's not unusual to refer to scripture as a basis to validate any actions that you engage in. Once again, if you are a Bible believer, we oftentimes use scripture to confirm or validate actions or activities that we engage in. I don't see anything wrong with Jeff Sessions utilizing that scripture because that scripture simply says to obey the civil authorities. Notice something. Jesus nor the Apostle Paul never endorsed sedition or rebellion or violent uprising against Rome, and in using that scripture he was saying that in order to advance our cause, violence is not the way. Obey the laws of the land so they won't have a reason to accuse us of any wrongdoing. Obey the laws of the land and put other matters into the hands of God and he will work it out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Pastor Ingle, the Bible calls on us to welcome the stranger, and it's very powerful. Welcome into your table, invite a stranger to your home for meals and so forth. But the Catholic bishop seemed to take that to mean open borders. They have a really big wall around the Vatican, it's a beautiful wall, a really nice wall. But that means anyone who steps foot over the border has to be processed into the country and released. How is that welcoming the stranger according to Biblical text? That does not mean to be devoid of all laws of the land, does it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And I go back to that passage the attorney general referred to in Romans 13 talking about obey the laws of the land. When you talk about the context of God's law, God's law always for protection, it's always for peace, it's always for harmony. And so that's why when you look at the issues that we are facing with immigration reform, all the issues and challenges that we have seen over the last couple of weeks, you have to have a come together approach that covers all the issues of -- well, you have to look at the issues of collaborating on providing security at the wall. You have to look at issues of compassion as it relates to bringing families together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What about compassion for Americans. We all do what we can to donate to organizations that help people on the ground in their home countries. So many Christian organizations, faith-based groups in Guatemala, Central America, South America, Africa and around the world, that's where we as individuals can make a difference through our faith, through our churches and our organizations. It doesn't mean that we have to completely smash our own rule of law and say OK, you have a really sad life, I understand it's horrible, so we have to allow you to come into the country no matter how you come in. I want to get Pastor Scott on that. This is a very liberal priest known as Father James Martin. He's not a big fan of Trump to put it lightly. That is what he said."

They have lots of guts to do it, and I think it's up to us to welcome them. I think the problem with a lot of these Christians who are saying they are reading the Bible is I don't know what bible they are reading because the Bible I read has Jesus always reaching out to those on the margins, including and most especially migrants and refugees."

      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "There is a difference between migrants, refugees, and illegal immigrants. The parents of these children know that they are committing a crime when they endeavor to sneak into this country. This country has a zero-tolerance policy. They know that our president is hardline in regards to that, but they try to sneak in anyways. Now, anyone, an American citizen regardless of race, creed or color, if you are engaged in the commission of a crime and you are caught in the commission of this crime and you are apprehended, and you have a child in your custody, that child is going to be removed from your custody and placed into child services until either somebody comes and gets them or they are remanded over or whatever. And so I don't understand why we are taking any culpability toward this crime that is being committed away from the parents and making it as if we're just grabbing kids and putting them into concentration camps, because that is not the case at all. There is a crime being committed, the children are in the custody of the criminals."

It looks like you will beat John Warren tomorrow although you want everyone to go out and vote for sure. But it's changed a lot demographically, and we see the resistance ramping up across the United States, including what Maxine Waters said over the weekend.

And the debate about whether it's a violation of this law and inciting a riot, and it probably is a violation of a lot of laws, but even worse than that is it's just plain bad manners. I just don't know what these people are thinking. People look at them for guidance, look at them for leadership, and they are talking and acting totally responsibly. It is hard to believe, but we don't have much of that in South Carolina. That crowd tonight was about the same as the others. They were delirious with joy to see Donald Trump in South Carolina, and when I campaigned for him in the primary, the presidential primary, it was the same thing. I have seen such enthusiasm close to what I have seen with President Trump and then candidate Trump one time, and that's when I saw a Beatles concert years ago. People were just going wild and they do that every time they see Donald Trump. They love Donald Trump, can't get enough of him."

Remember he wanted to run for governor of New York, and before that he was involved with people running the Reform Party. But he is a student of politics and history. He was a world figure before he became president. And he and I are doing the same things, cutting taxes and regulations, getting rid of sanctuary cities, protecting the children, no tax money to Planned Parenthood. And we've got a robust economy here. We are just booming in South Carolina, $6 billion in investment, $20,000 -- it's the same thing that President Trump is doing, and we love him."
