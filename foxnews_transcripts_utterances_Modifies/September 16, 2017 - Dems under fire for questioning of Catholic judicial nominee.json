President Trump angering many of his supporters this week with work he's entering a deal with Democrats that would protect hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants from deportation while postponing talk of a border wall. Wednesdays sit-down with Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, follows an agreement last week to increase the debt limit and finance the government until mid-December. So is either deal good for Republicans and will the bipartisanship extended tax reform create. Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, editorial page writer, Jillian Melchior, and columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley.  Jason, what do make of this bipartisan --  JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: How long will the kumbaya last week. We will see. Who knows? Even with the deal on the immigrants, on the DACA, the so-called Dreamers, we are getting different messages depending on who you are talking to who is involved in the deal.

I think this will be a very popular thing for the president to do. And it would also give them a chance to do something that neither George W. Bush, nor Barack Obama was able to accomplish.

I think these are the people who are actually out there on thin ice. Trump is doing these deals for one reason, I would say, and that was the failure of the health care reform bill. To help their reform bill failed in the House because the Freedom Caucus opposed it and would not let it go through. Many members of the Freedom Caucus are anti-immigrant restrictionists.

Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, editorial page writer, Jillian Melchior, and columnist and Manhattan Institute senior fellow, Jason Riley. Jason, what do make of this bipartisan -- JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST & SENIOR FELLOW, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: How long will the kumbaya last week. We will see. Who knows?

I think these are the people who are actually out there on thin ice. Trump is doing these deals for one reason, I would say, and that was the failure of the health care reform bill.

I think, by and large, the government's response has been excellent and I think we learned a lot here. There is all of this talk about evacuation. They're not necessarily being evacuating up to New Yorkers. They meant get out of your house, go into an elementary school or a hotel, buildings that can withstand almost any hurricane.

DeVos spends months not only meeting with assault survivors and college administrators but also students who say they were wrongly accused and punished under the Obama administration's enforcement of Title IX, the federal law that covers such cases. Robert Shibley is the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, and author of the book, \"Twisting Title IX.\" So welcome. Good to have you here.

      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the old system made a trade-off that we think didn't need to be made. They tried to trade the rights of people who are accused in order to try to create a system that it was felt would be more comfortable for victims and survivors to use in order to come forward. Unfortunately, what it did was, would everyone have predicted who knows something about due process, when you reduce due process, when you reduce the protections for the accusers, you start to get better decisions and you start to get less careful versions of justice. And that is what we saw happen."

    {
      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "That's right. For the first time, the federal government said, all schools who get federal funding, which virtually is all of the public or private schools, have to use the preponderance of evidence standard, which is a 50.01 percent, sort of 50 percent-plus a better standard of certainty. School before they had been free to use various standards. Another thing that they did was discourage the use of cross-examination."

      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "I think it does, indeed, need to be rescinded. I think consideration of due process is long overdue here. There is no reason we cannot both have due process, the procedural protections that you and I would expect if we went even into traffic court for these much more serious offenses on college campuses. There is no reason we can't do that and also serve the needs of the victims and survivors."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    {
      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "That's right. One of the real problems with implementing the April 4, 2011, letter we are talking about is because it sort of -- it was sprung on universities and certainly on civil liberties like us. Nobody had a chance to comment on it. If we had, maybe things could have gone differently for the last six and a half years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "This is one of the things I wanted to ask you about. If you are a college administrator, you get the letter -- I mean, I have heard from many of them. They said, look, we had to go this direction and towards the preponderance of evidence standard to limiting due process, because if we didn't, there was an explicit threat that they would take away college funding. Are these administrators going to be free now to change that standard and restore due process?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "That seems likely. The question will be whether or not they are going to go ahead and actually restore the due process. Obviously, there will still be under a lot of political pressure from folks that do not want the due process protections. But at least the government will have gotten out of the way. It is not sufficient step but it is a necessary step to restore due process on campus."

What is your response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, we obviously disagree with the vice president. We think it is very important that victims of sexual assault have protections but a \"Dear Colleague\" letter which, as you said, did not even go through comments, certainly doesn't have the force of law, it is not fundamental to the operation of Title IX. We can make sure that people do not suffer sex discrimination on campus, including sexual assault, without this rule by letter that Secretary DeVos can justifiably say is over."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Other than Secretary Biden -- I mean, Vice President Biden and some of the other -- a few other comments, one of the things that I have been cheered by this week is that there has been a relatively modest counter reaction to this. It has not been as loud and critical as I might have thought. I wonder if you think -- you look at the American university, the culture. Is there some recognition even on the part of the left that this effort in the Obama administrations went too far and was unfair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIBLEY",
      "utterance": "I think there is a recognition of that. These are very traditional values that are honestly not a partisan issue. People on the left and the right think it is important, for instance, to have a presumption of innocence. They put out a recent survey where we found out the top 50 schools, nearly 75 percent of them do not presume students are innocent when they are accused of things like this."

At least nine people were arrested and an estimated $600,000 spent on security for the event. This week's protests follow an attack by Antifa activists on right-wing demonstrators in a Berkeley park last month. And a speech by controversial blogger, Milo Yiannopoulos, was canceled in February when black clad anarchists stormed the campus, smashing windows and setting fires. We are back with Dan Henninger, Jillian Melchior and Jason Riley. Jillian, it looks like it was not as bad as people feared at Berkeley. What happened?"

You didn't see outside activists showing up. There were nine arrests. I think we've seen that if colleges are going to protect free speech, it will be expensive."

      "speaker": "MELCHIOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. I loved her comments on free speech. I think she was also profound when she said the best form of safe space is inner resilience. She was noting what she is hearing from students is that what she's hearing is that speech that offends us, that hurts our feelings is the equivalence of violence. And unfortunately, that is an idea that a lot of young college activists are embracing. I think what we are seeing at Berkeley is that you have a generation coming out that does t appreciate free speech. Berkeley, obviously, symbolic here."

Often when professors have no idea of how they have offended them. But these groups will simply refuse to allow the teachers to teach. And often they're trying to drive them up campuses. I think people like the chancellor at Berkeley, and there is a growing understanding across academia that this has become a threat to their very existence, their ability to do what they do as professors."

This is part of their base, the core of the resistance for Donald Trump. We saw how minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, came out. She took her time coming out and denouncing, but she did, announcing Antifa by name. But we have not seen a whole lot of that. And I think we should.
