      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Watters' World,\" I'm Jesse Watters. The line left, that is the subject of tonight's \"Watters' Words.\" What happened this week was a refresher for how dishonest the left is and their lap dogs in the media. To recap, the Obama policy on the border was catch and release, you got caught crossing, the Feds release you and tells you to show up at a court at a later date, but the illegals just skip the hearings and went unchecked into the country.  This policy actually encouraged illegal immigration. So, Trump was elected to secure the border. That's what the voters wanted. So, he enacted a zero-tolerance policy at the border. And when you get caught crossing, the Feds detain you, process you and deport you back to your home country.  If you bring a minor, you are briefly separated for a day or two, and then reunited, and then deported, but if you bring a minor and can't prove you're related, the Feds will separate and investigate if you are a trialed trafficker or a human smuggler. And if you bring a minor and claim asylum, the law says the Feds can't hold the minor longer than 20 days. At which point, they must send the child to a family member, a sponsor or a foster family in the interior of the country until the asylum claims are adjudicated and that can take forever.  And that was a Clinton era arrangement that was upheld by the liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Obama did the same thing. Trump just did it at a higher rate because all border crossers now are being prosecuted. CNN asked Senator Baldwin about the hypocrisy.",

The line left, that is the subject of tonight's \"Watters' Words.\" What happened this week was a refresher for how dishonest the left is and their lap dogs in the media. To recap, the Obama policy on the border was catch and release, you got caught crossing, the Feds release you and tells you to show up at a court at a later date, but the illegals just skip the hearings and went unchecked into the country. This policy actually encouraged illegal immigration. So, Trump was elected to secure the border. That's what the voters wanted. So, he enacted a zero-tolerance policy at the border. And when you get caught crossing, the Feds detain you, process you and deport you back to your home country. If you bring a minor, you are briefly separated for a day or two, and then reunited, and then deported, but if you bring a minor and can't prove you're related, the Feds will separate and investigate if you are a trialed trafficker or a human smuggler. And if you bring a minor and claim asylum, the law says the Feds can't hold the minor longer than 20 days. At which point, they must send the child to a family member, a sponsor or a foster family in the interior of the country until the asylum claims are adjudicated and that can take forever. And that was a Clinton era arrangement that was upheld by the liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Obama did the same thing. Trump just did it at a higher rate because all border crossers now are being prosecuted. CNN asked Senator Baldwin about the hypocrisy."

Senator Ted Cruz released a standalone bill that would keep families together during detention and Chuck Schumer and the Democrats wouldn't vote on it because they wanted to \"Keep the focus on Trump.\" It makes you wonder if Democrats care at all about kids. And Jimmy Kimmel led the charge on late night. JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE\": Just when you thought we couldn't go any lower as a nation, we have. I am sure you have seen the heartbreaking and horrific images of families being literally torn apart thanks to the Trump administration and their zero-tolerance immigration policy."

Why does \"Time\" magazine where I will agree with you contrary to a moment ago, \"Time\" magazine puts on the cover this crying child with the President standing over her and in fact, this kid was never separated from her mom.

The mother was not claiming asylum, she was going there for a better economic opportunity, and the mother took the child away from the father, left the other kids in Central America.
