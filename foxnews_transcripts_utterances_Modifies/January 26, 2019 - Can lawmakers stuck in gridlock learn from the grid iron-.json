Now, we have a big show on deck with former governor Mike Huckabee, David Bossie, Dan Bongino, legendary football coach Lou Holtz and Dr. Sebastian Gorka all standing by live. Plus my take on the Roger Stone indictment that you need to see, but first my open.  Whether you like the President or not, what separates him from every other President is that he's not one to hold his finger to the political winds before he makes a decision. He tries to make decisions that are right, decision that are best for you and me. They're not always popular and of course, the most difficult ones will always be questioned. Yesterday's decision was one of them.  The deal was to reopen the government through February 15th creating a bipartisan bicameral committee tasked with negotiating an agreement on border security. The President made clear though, he's sticking to building a barrier.",

Airports closed preventing people from business trips, visiting family members as well as the attendant economic hardships and unlike the obstructionists and the Trump haters who don't give a damn about ordinary Americans, he simply couldn't let it go on.   He did not cave. He made a tactical decision, a strategy decision to pick the ground to fight on. He chose to stop the fight today to fight another day and that day will be February 15th.

He couldn't tolerate airport shutdown and you want to compare him to Reagan when Reagan fired the striking air traffic controllers. Here's the difference, Ann. A President does not have the right to fire non-essential employees during a government shutdown. OPM regulations under 5CFR Part 752. Reagan firing the air traffic controllers in 1981 because they were in violation of the law. That situation, Ann, is totally different and not analogous. Public Safety workers have no right to strike. It was the same approach Calvin Coolidge took when the Boston police went on strike.  These people, they don't understand Donald Trump. They just want to criticize him like they did with other non-popular decisions like meeting with Kim Jong-un who hasn't by the way launched a ballistic missile since the meeting, like the tariffs which were unpopular but seem now to be working.   Folks, the war isn't over yet. Remember, Donald Trump is a man willing to take the shots to change the norm in order to do what he thinks is best for the country. Very often, he's dead on. Closing the government torrid him. Opening it, whether it's a popular move is irrelevant in his mind and remember, this war is not over. It's nothing but a hollow victory for the Democrats. On February 15th that the Committee does not come back with a workable solution, which would be a shock to me because Congress is certainly not about getting the job done, they've kicked the can down the road with the approval of Presidents like Obama and Clinton and Bush with no one looking to actually get something done.  This President could do the same thing. I believe, he will not, because another continuing resolution is not his style. I believe the President will call for emergency funding for the wall. He's tried everything else.  The only thing I would ask is that he makes sure it doesn't get to the Ninth Circuit aka the Ninth Circus. The idea of Congress going on yet another vacation the day after February 15th with all of this unsettled, without any kind of resolution is just another reminder to the American people of what Congress cares about - themselves, their vacations and the lobbyists who fund those vacations. But I'm here to tell you, never underestimate this President. This President lives to fight another day.   And that's my open. My first open, but tonight stay tuned for my very important must-see second open on Roger Stone. And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and all the developing news today, former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. Good evening, Governor.",

It looks like Nancy Pelosi has won, but this game isn't over.

I wish Nancy Pelosi had cared very much at all about the 800,000 workers. I wish the Democrats had some interest in what happens to the dreamers, but they really don't. They're just political pawns to them. So the President has an opportunity and if the court rules against him, Judge, I think he's got to defy the court on this and say one single Federal judge does not have the power to overrule an elected President and change the entire country's agenda and force that to the Supreme Court where I believe he will win if it goes there and it needs to go there quickly.",

Protestors gathering in Paris and other cities, more than 80,000 police officers were deployed to patrol the events. The movement is protesting what they say are Macron's pro-business and pro-rich policies and they say the concessions he has offered thus far do not go far enough. And France isn't the only country in Europe facing protests. Thousands also gathering in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Protesters marched by the state TV building and then to the government headquarters.

So the Mueller team gets an indictment against Roger Stone who is represented by an attorney, but instead of notifying the attorney and requesting he bring his client in for arraignment - standard protocol in cases like Stone's - the Muller team decides instead on Gestapo tactics. While still dark and well before dawn, 29 armed FBI agents and a SWAT team donning large shoulder weapons, body armor, fatigues and tactical vests arrived at Stone's home. Seventeen vehicles including armored trucks, lights flashing, a bullhorn, they begin banging on Stone's home yelling \"FBI, open the door.\" The only people home were Stone, his wife and their dogs. And lo and behold, CNN is there. Cameras in tow, waiting with the FBI an hour for it all to start. Now why would they be there? Especially when the FBI considers this dangerous enough to have SWAT teams and guns drawn?",

You're not kidding anybody and it's a crime for whomever alerted you to alert you, although I suspect, Mueller won't give a damn. Now a lot of people have commented on Mueller's request for an early morning takedown. Let me be clear. I'm not one of those commentators. I did this for a living. For 30 years, my police squad worked with the FBI, DEA, State Police and local law enforcement when we needed help in arresting or seizing evidence in a potentially dangerous situation where the individual was dangerous or a flight risk. What the Mueller team did here was not only laughable, it was embarrassing to everyone in law enforcement. Waking a couple up pre-dawn is chaotic enough, but when the wife is deaf, a directive to her by someone with a gun drawn when she cannot hear the directive is a catastrophe waiting to happen.  This show was put on to embarrass and intimidate Stone. He wasn't a flight risk and he had no guns. His passport was expired are just about to expire. Mueller's intent was to poison the jury pool to make Stone seem like public enemy number one and his indictment is not even for a violent crime. It has nothing to do with Russia or collusion. It's a process crime. You keep asking the same questions over and over and over, hoping there will be a mistake and when there is, you indict. The President is right. Stone lying to Congress, Jim Comey lied to Congress, John Brennan lied to Congress, Clapper and dear Hillary - that woman lied every time she opened her mouth. Need I go on? Roger Stone is charged with crimes after the fact that involved procedure. The only reason Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Bryan Pagliano and the whole gang surrounding and protecting Hillary are not charged with processed crimes is because Jim Comey who himself should be indicted never bothered to investigate. God help America. And that's my second open. Tell me what you think about it on Twitter and Facebook #JudgeJeanine.

And if the Democrats don't do it after all this, I think the public would change against them even though the media will try to defend them et cetera, but you have to reach a point and you say, enough is enough. How much longer you're going to fool me? It's like Lucy with the football with Charlie Brown. Every time, she'd fall the ball down. How many times you're going to fool somebody?

Now, we have a big show on deck with former governor Mike Huckabee, David Bossie, Dan Bongino, legendary football coach Lou Holtz and Dr. Sebastian Gorka all standing by live. Plus my take on the Roger Stone indictment that you need to see, but first my open. Whether you like the President or not, what separates him from every other President is that he's not one to hold his finger to the political winds before he makes a decision. He tries to make decisions that are right, decision that are best for you and me. They're not always popular and of course, the most difficult ones will always be questioned. Yesterday's decision was one of them. The deal was to reopen the government through February 15th creating a bipartisan bicameral committee tasked with negotiating an agreement on border security. The President made clear though, he's sticking to building a barrier."

Instead of people saying, \"Thank goodness someone in Washington recognizes the need to compromise, someone who actually understands the purpose of government is to serve the people.\" He sees people who live paycheck to paycheck having a difficult time buying groceries and paying their bills. Airports closed preventing people from business trips, visiting family members as well as the attendant economic hardships and unlike the obstructionists and the Trump haters who don't give a damn about ordinary Americans, he simply couldn't let it go on. He did not cave. He made a tactical decision, a strategy decision to pick the ground to fight on. He chose to stop the fight today to fight another day and that day will be February 15th.

      "utterance": "And he still doesn't care what the elites think, he cared about the people who unlike you don't have enough money to take care of their families. He couldn't tolerate airport shutdown and you want to compare him to Reagan when Reagan fired the striking air traffic controllers. Here's the difference, Ann. A President does not have the right to fire non-essential employees during a government shutdown. OPM regulations under 5CFR Part 752. Reagan firing the air traffic controllers in 1981 because they were in violation of the law. That situation, Ann, is totally different and not analogous. Public Safety workers have no right to strike. It was the same approach Calvin Coolidge took when the Boston police went on strike. These people, they don't understand Donald Trump. They just want to criticize him like they did with other non-popular decisions like meeting with Kim Jong-un who hasn't by the way launched a ballistic missile since the meeting, like the tariffs which were unpopular but seem now to be working. Folks, the war isn't over yet. Remember, Donald Trump is a man willing to take the shots to change the norm in order to do what he thinks is best for the country. Very often, he's dead on. Closing the government torrid him. Opening it, whether it's a popular move is irrelevant in his mind and remember, this war is not over. It's nothing but a hollow victory for the Democrats. On February 15th that the Committee does not come back with a workable solution, which would be a shock to me because Congress is certainly not about getting the job done, they've kicked the can down the road with the approval of Presidents like Obama and Clinton and Bush with no one looking to actually get something done. This President could do the same thing. I believe, he will not, because another continuing resolution is not his style. I believe the President will call for emergency funding for the wall. He's tried everything else. The only thing I would ask is that he makes sure it doesn't get to the Ninth Circuit aka the Ninth Circus. The idea of Congress going on yet another vacation the day after February 15th with all of this unsettled, without any kind of resolution is just another reminder to the American people of what Congress cares about - themselves, their vacations and the lobbyists who fund those vacations. But I'm here to tell you, never underestimate this President. This President lives to fight another day. And that's my open. My first open, but tonight stay tuned for my very important must-see second open on Roger Stone. And joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and all the developing news today, former Arkansas governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. Good evening, Governor."

I think what we're looking at is that the President is actually going into the locker room at halftime and let's be fair, I think that from the public perception, maybe he's a touchdown behind right now. It looks like Nancy Pelosi has won, but this game isn't over. This is halftime at the Super Bowl and it looks like the Democrats are going to overplay their hand and when they do and he comes to play the second half, he's got a chance to really put this one and take it home."

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",

I wish Nancy Pelosi had cared very much at all about the 800,000 workers. I wish the Democrats had some interest in what happens to the dreamers, but they really don't. They're just political pawns to them. So the President has an opportunity and if the court rules against him, Judge, I think he's got to defy the court on this and say one single Federal judge does not have the power to overrule an elected President and change the entire country's agenda and force that to the Supreme Court where I believe he will win if it goes there and it needs to go there quickly."

But it doesn't always have to go to the Ninth Circuit, I mean you know the Ninth Circuit is a circus and it's a waste of time and it goes on and on and on. Let's see what happens in the end with that. But if there is a continuing resolution, kicking the can down the road separate and apart from the wall, the President will use his emergency powers, do you agree with that?"

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I think he will. I think he will immediately be challenged in court, but too many constitutional scholars believe he does have the power to do it and that's why I say, he cannot let the judiciary run over the executive branch. These are three equal branches and there's nothing equal if a single Federal judge sitting in Albuquerque our Los Angeles or anywhere can singularly overrule the President of the United States. That's an act of judicial supremacy, not an act of three equal branches; and I hope the President will do what Andrew Jackson did and just say \"To heck with you. I'm not going to abide with it and if you think I should, then you come and enforce it.\""

Democrats going on vacation, by - you know with lobbyists. She was in Hawaii. They're going on vacation on the 16th. The American people - what is happening? Are they buying this feeling that you know, it's all Donald Trump's fault when he's the guy who is holding strong to his promise and yet he's getting criticized by everyone?"

They think with their emotions. They're incapable of making a change of view about this President. But there are a lot of Americans who maybe didn't vote for the President, maybe they don't even like him, but they can look at this objectively and they're not stupid and they can see that Nancy Pelosi cares nothing about DREAMers, about government employees and she's not willing to say anything in way of compromise to bring about some solution. she just wants to make political points. And the fact that she said not one dime for the wall, there's not going to be a wall and then the idiotic statement that it's immoral, when if it is, then get rid of all the walls around the Capitol, the White House and every single place in America including Fort Knox and I'll be the first in line to go over there and check that place out."

Its scares the daylights out of people and it was utterly pointless to do that and I would love to see a very thoughtful discussion going forward that you don't use force when it's unnecessary and it was well beyond unnecessary to go breaking into a man's home who is sixty-six years old, doesn't even have a passport, poses no threat to anybody and to do that kind of just police state action, every American ought to be appalled by it."

At the end of the day, there's going to be a wall and that's what the President knows. He is trying to force Congress to do their jobs. They've abdicated the responsibility and by the way, Judge, you and I both blame Paul Ryan over the last two years that he failed and we're only in this position.

Protestors gathering in Paris and other cities, more than 80,000 police officers were deployed to patrol the events. The movement is protesting what they say are Macron's pro-business and pro-rich policies and they say the concessions he has offered thus far do not go far enough. And France isn't the only country in Europe facing protests. Thousands also gathering in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Protesters marched by the state TV building and then to the government headquarters. They're protesting the populist government of President Aleksandar Vucic accusing him of stifling democratic freedoms and keeping a tight grip on Serbian media.

      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Justice.\" Tonight's panel is standing by, but first not a great weekend for Roger Stone who's over the top arrest yesterday morning is the subject of my second opening statement tonight. So the Mueller team gets an indictment against Roger Stone who is represented by an attorney, but instead of notifying the attorney and requesting he bring his client in for arraignment - standard protocol in cases like Stone's - the Muller team decides instead on Gestapo tactics. While still dark and well before dawn, 29 armed FBI agents and a SWAT team donning large shoulder weapons, body armor, fatigues and tactical vests arrived at Stone's home. Seventeen vehicles including armored trucks, lights flashing, a bullhorn, they begin banging on Stone's home yelling \"FBI, open the door.\" The only people home were Stone, his wife and their dogs. And lo and behold, CNN is there. Cameras in tow, waiting with the FBI an hour for it all to start. Now why would they be there? Especially when the FBI considers this dangerous enough to have SWAT teams and guns drawn?"

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Unusual grand jury activity - hey, grand juries meet in secret. What do you know about the activity of the grand jury? What do you know about when they meet or if their schedules change? Does all unusual grand jury activities suggest indictments are being handed up? Admit it, you got a call from them. You're not kidding anybody and it's a crime for whomever alerted you to alert you, although I suspect, Mueller won't give a damn. Now a lot of people have commented on Mueller's request for an early morning takedown. Let me be clear. I'm not one of those commentators. I did this for a living. For 30 years, my police squad worked with the FBI, DEA, State Police and local law enforcement when we needed help in arresting or seizing evidence in a potentially dangerous situation where the individual was dangerous or a flight risk. What the Mueller team did here was not only laughable, it was embarrassing to everyone in law enforcement. Waking a couple up pre-dawn is chaotic enough, but when the wife is deaf, a directive to her by someone with a gun drawn when she cannot hear the directive is a catastrophe waiting to happen. This show was put on to embarrass and intimidate Stone. He wasn't a flight risk and he had no guns. His passport was expired are just about to expire. Mueller's intent was to poison the jury pool to make Stone seem like public enemy number one and his indictment is not even for a violent crime. It has nothing to do with Russia or collusion. It's a process crime. You keep asking the same questions over and over and over, hoping there will be a mistake and when there is, you indict. The President is right. Stone lying to Congress, Jim Comey lied to Congress, John Brennan lied to Congress, Clapper and dear Hillary - that woman lied every time she opened her mouth. Need I go on? Roger Stone is charged with crimes after the fact that involved procedure. The only reason Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Bryan Pagliano and the whole gang surrounding and protecting Hillary are not charged with processed crimes is because Jim Comey who himself should be indicted never bothered to investigate. God help America. And that's my second open. Tell me what you think about it on Twitter and Facebook #JudgeJeanine. Here with reaction to my second opening statement, the host of \"Dan Bongino Podcast,\" Dan Bongino and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, talk show host Chris Hahn. Let's go to you, Dan. You have law-enforcement experience. Have you ever seen a takedown like this for this kind of crime?"

I mean, early morning raids as you know are not unusual, but early morning raids for let's get this straight, a non-violent process crime who is of zero flight risk, who's an easily recognizable public figure, who's already cooperated by offering up proffers and statements to Congress is utterly absurd. This is so ridiculous and, Judge, one more thing on this, don't you find the timing of this convenient? Remember, the Manafort raid which was equally unnecessary happened the same week we found out about the Peter Strzok text messages. What happened last week? We found out that Andy Weissman, Mueller's chief pitbull in the case knew about the political oranges of the dossier and all of a sudden we have this unbelievably unnecessary raid on a house, just incredible."

Thirty years ago, we had the same objective - keep the people safe and let them be successful. Now, today the Democrats have a different objective. Obviously, they don't care about the people, they don't care about safety and why do I say that? Because if they did, they would build the wall. They say, \"Well, we have drones.\" Well drones does nothing but say we catch and release, and here's the other thing. I am at my wit's ends because the referee which is really the media has joined the other side. It's just like what happened in New Orleans and the Saints. If they don't make fair calls and the media certainly had done that in the last couple years, that's why I say we have a serious problem. But I think, we also have to blame the voters. Make some better choices. How many Democrats did I hear \"Oh you left me out, reach across the aisle. Oh, I won't go with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.\" Where are they? And because we have two different objectives and we have to get back to saying, \"Let's keep the people safe and make them successful.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, so the President yesterday makes a decision to reopen the government for the partial government shutdown. It gives them three weeks. He creates a bipartisan bicameral committee and says, \"Look, work on this. You wanted the government open for three weeks, you've got it. Let's do something.\" Do you think the Democrats who were crowing all they know not - he now knows not to fight with Nancy. I mean, to them it's a game."

      "utterance": "Well, a lot of people go and say, \"Well, President Trump caved.\" He cared about the people. He cared about the 800,000 people. He didn't go to Hawaii. He didn't go over to the Bahamas. What he did, he stayed there and there will be absolutely no negotiation. He is doing what he thinks in the best interest. He ain't worried about being elected et cetera. He is there to help serve the people. Unfortunately, you can't trust certain people. I look at three things. Can I trust them? If they say something, do they meant it? Number two, are they committed to doing this, and number three, do they care about me? Do they care about me? Why about walls? Why did Barack Obama build a wall around his house? That's one of the first things he did and I say President Trump summed up best when he said, \"You build a wall not because you don't like the people on the outside because you love the people on the inside and you want to keep them safe and secure.\""

      "speaker": "HOLTZ",
      "utterance": "Well what happened is the official blew it. There's no way to go back and change it. The NFL tried to appease the Saints by suing the guy or by fining him $27,000.00 and it just can't do it that way. It was a mistake, unfortunately, the Saints, for the penalties called, as it should have been would have fell on the ball three different times and then lo and behold, kick the field goal in the last play of the game, but you can't come back, you can't change it. That's why it's so important to have referees make good choices and that's why I say about the media, they're supposed to be the referees. They are supposed to say what's right and what's wrong instead of joining the other side completely."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

Let's assume there's not going to be any agreement and you know they're supposed to -- Congress is supposed to go on vacation the next day, you know, Trump has this all worked out, never underestimate the man. He knows they are going on vacation the next day and if there's a shutdown, they're going on vacation again. That's not going to look good for them. You think he's going to use the emergency funding to build the wall?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOLTZ",

President Trump did this because he cared about the people, there's no doubt about it. We have to have a bill - build a wall. We have to have security. And if the Democrats don't do it after all this, I think the public would change against them even though the media will try to defend them et cetera, but you have to reach a point and you say, enough is enough. How much longer you're going to fool me? It's like Lucy with the football with Charlie Brown. Every time, she'd fall the ball down. How many times you're going to fool somebody? The voters have to take note of this and remember, the government is to keep us safe and help us be successful. There's no guarantee you'll be successful, but you should have the opportunity to be successful."

The idea that you've got a man who's a senior citizen, who's charged with what? Perjury and you sent 29 agents wearing body armor and carrying ar-15s to bang down his door. Sorry, you know Judge better than anybody. Before a warrant is served, before somebody is arrested in their home, there is a commander of the operation, a threat assessment is made and in a white-collar crime this is not how you do it.

I mean, this is like a dictatorship and he's the dictator. The amazing thing is, the day before he was special prosecutor, he was begging Donald Trump to be head of the FBI. Why did he want to be head of the FBI? So that he could cover up for all the mistakes that he and his pals had made, you know, in the previous ten years. But let's move on to this shutdown and the fact that the President made a decision to end the shutdown when he saw what was going on at the airports and the concomitant economic injury to the country. The left is dancing, you know, you should be afraid of Nancy Pelosi. But people on the right, too, are being critical, \"Oh we caved on the wall.\" He didn't cave on the wall, did he?"

It means a national emergency and the wall getting built. What the President has done is a masterstroke. Not only does he get to court to give the State of the Union if he wants, what he has done, he has demonstrated to the whole world that there is one side in this discussion that has acted like an adult and has been reasonable and in 15 days' time, he gets to say, \"Look, I gave them every opportunity to act reasonably and they haven't and now, we're going to build the wall.\" So that this is the masterstroke.
