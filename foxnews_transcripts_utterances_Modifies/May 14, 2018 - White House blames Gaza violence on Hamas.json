It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We begin with a Fox News alert, first lady Melania Trump in the hospital after undergoing a benign kidney procedure. The first lady's spokesperson saying she's doing OK, but will remain hospitalized for the rest of the week. The news breaking just a short time ago, so we bring in chief White House correspondent John Roberts who has more details. John.",

      "sentences": "Dana, good afternoon to you. We learned about a little more than an hour ago that the first lady traveled up to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center this morning to undergo what's called an embolization procedure for a benign kidney condition. She said, or at least her spokeswoman said that the procedure went well, that the first lady is feeling fine, but that she would likely have to remain in the hospital for the remainder of the week. One of the reasons is when you undergo this sort of surgery, you want to stay quiet for a little while to make sure that the surgery takes in the way that it should. Also want to make sure that there's no bleeding or anything like that. So, she'll likely remain there through Thursday, maybe even Friday.  While we have not been told what the precise condition is, embolization therapy in the kidney is typically used to treat a tumor. Sometimes it's used to treat cancerous tumors to try to shrink them down so that it's much easier to remove than surgically when you do go into do surgery. In this case, we know that the first lady's condition is said to be benign. That might speak to a different type of problem in a kidney called an angiomyolipoma. This is a tumor that's made up of epithelia vascular cells, that's the material that's made of -- bigger artery is made out of. It's also muscle cells and fat cells. Kind of all together in a little sack if you will.  Now, it's a benign condition. In effect, we don't know that the first lady has that. But, again, typically, embolization therapy used to treat these angiomyolipomas. While they're benign, they can grow, and if they do grow to a certain point they can begin to damage the kidneys. There's also a risk of bleeding. So, what doctors do is they thread a catheter up through the femoral artery, which is the main artery in your leg down by the groin, then they go up through the abdominal aorta and they turn either left or right depending on which kidney they're going to. And then deposit, for lack of more of specificity, little, tiny, tiny balls of -- a plastic type of material which then blocks up an artery, reduces the blood flow to the particular structure in the kidney that they're looking to get rid of, and that's structure, eventually, shrinks and go away. So, you know, it's a complex procedure but it's fairly routine. It's kind of like cardiac catheterization where they go in your heart and they'll open up an artery and put in a stamp. In this case, what they're to do, Dana, is block an artery, so whatever is in her kidney shrinks and goes away.",

And he's better than that because he's a pretty decent reporter, so I don't have much to say about that. But, I think what's making Trump so successful is how he became successful as a businessman, and he's translating it into how he's been a politician. He's a man of his word and he's a man of action. And that's why he's racking up all these tangible victories. You know, I think in 1995, the congress passed this Relocation Act for Jerusalem, and it took three presidents who did nothing. And stood by now, Ivanka and Jared are in there today for the opening, and this coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel.  So, of course, you're going to have a little clash, and you're going to have some blowups at the border and that's to be expected because Jerusalem, I believe, is the third most holy city for Islam. And, that will blow over and you'll get the peace process back on track. I think Jared is doing a pretty nice job. You're going to have the Kushner Accords. And hopefully, we can get that done. Maybe another Nobel Peace Prize that Juan can be envious of. And, I think the president, when he does these things, it's because he doesn't care about offending the status quo. I mean, if you look what happened with him defeating the caliphate, or them -- NATO countries ponying up their fair share, or tearing up NAFTA or renegotiating NAFTA. These kinds of things, he doesn't really care about the blow back.  And he also does the obvious. I mean, Jerusalem is obviously the capital of Israel. And it's obvious we need a border with Mexico. It's obvious China is stealing jobs. It's obvious that North Korea needs to be dealt with, and now he's doing that through the maximum campaign of pressure, diplomatically, militarily, even through twitter. He's brought them to the table. They're going to end the Korean War. They're now, I think, totally imploding their underground nuclear testing facility. They're sealing off all the entrances, that's a huge step. Releasing the hostages is a huge step. So now, you have this summit in Singapore, and it looks positive. We're going to go in there with clear and open eyes. I think The Five should maybe go to Singapore and broadcast it since it's so historic. And we could all make the trip.",

If you say you're going to do something and you make a promise, you honor it. I'm very happy that there wasn't a tremendous amount of violence that people were worried about, that things would happen if this were to occur. I think it's definitely a step in the right direction in terms of the relationship, not only with Israel, but the United States, with the Saudis being on board.

This is an expression of people who feel that they are being run over and run out of land and property that was once theirs, and that there's no longer hope for a two-state solution. Netanyahu has made it very clear. And, President Trump, it looks like by making this highly provocative move doesn't care that the United States has a role here, potentially, as a -- you know, we love Israel, but we were going to be the force that negotiated some kind of peace. That brought, finally, some peace to the Middle East. Instead, we have, obviously, Israel firing at Iran. In Syria, Syria up in flames now. We have unsettled situation here between Israel and the Palestinians. So, what have we done? We're no longer seeking peace. Netanyahu, apparently, can do anything he wants.

So, you have to look at what his own personal motivations when they showed up there at a press, out of court appearance that they didn't need to be at. There's nothing calendar as it related to them, but they showed up, they stormed to the mic, and then went forward talking about this. Again, further promulgating his own personal appearances and desire to, you know, improve his financial situation. So now, what he wants to do is kind of bully people.

The No. 1 threat to New York City and America was and still is terrorism. Not whether Trump exaggerates about Mexico paying for the wall. Point is, for Bloomy to express his own gripes like climate change, or smoking, or gun control, first he had to keep the city safe so he could have the luxury of griping. So now, in a speech, when he reorders our concerns just to jab Donald Trump, he's committing the very sin he derives: He's falsifying facts.

One of the reasons is when you undergo this sort of surgery, you want to stay quiet for a little while to make sure that the surgery takes in the way that it should. Also want to make sure that there's no bleeding or anything like that. So, she'll likely remain there through Thursday, maybe even Friday. While we have not been told what the precise condition is, embolization therapy in the kidney is typically used to treat a tumor. Sometimes it's used to treat cancerous tumors to try to shrink them down so that it's much easier to remove than surgically when you do go into do surgery. In this case, we know that the first lady's condition is said to be benign. That might speak to a different type of problem in a kidney called an angiomyolipoma. This is a tumor that's made up of epithelia vascular cells, that's the material that's made of -- bigger artery is made out of. It's also muscle cells and fat cells. Kind of all together in a little sack if you will. Now, it's a benign condition. In effect, we don't know that the first lady has that. But, again, typically, embolization therapy used to treat these angiomyolipomas. While they're benign, they can grow, and if they do grow to a certain point they can begin to damage the kidneys. There's also a risk of bleeding. So, what doctors do is they thread a catheter up through the femoral artery, which is the main artery in your leg down by the groin, then they go up through the abdominal aorta and they turn either left or right depending on which kidney they're going to. And then deposit, for lack of more of specificity, little, tiny, tiny balls of -- a plastic type of material which then blocks up an artery, reduces the blood flow to the particular structure in the kidney that they're looking to get rid of, and that's structure, eventually, shrinks and go away. So, you know, it's a complex procedure but it's fairly routine. It's kind of like cardiac catheterization where they go in your heart and they'll open up an artery and put in a stamp. In this case, what they're to do, Dana, is block an artery, so whatever is in her kidney shrinks and goes away."

And he's better than that because he's a pretty decent reporter, so I don't have much to say about that. But, I think what's making Trump so successful is how he became successful as a businessman, and he's translating it into how he's been a politician. He's a man of his word and he's a man of action. And that's why he's racking up all these tangible victories. You know, I think in 1995, the congress passed this Relocation Act for Jerusalem, and it took three presidents who did nothing. And stood by now, Ivanka and Jared are in there today for the opening, and this coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel. So, of course, you're going to have a little clash, and you're going to have some blowups at the border and that's to be expected because Jerusalem, I believe, is the third most holy city for Islam. And, that will blow over and you'll get the peace process back on track. I think Jared is doing a pretty nice job. You're going to have the Kushner Accords. And hopefully, we can get that done. Maybe another Nobel Peace Prize that Juan can be envious of. And, I think the president, when he does these things, it's because he doesn't care about offending the status quo. I mean, if you look what happened with him defeating the caliphate, or them -- NATO countries ponying up their fair share, or tearing up NAFTA or renegotiating NAFTA. These kinds of things, he doesn't really care about the blow back. And he also does the obvious. I mean, Jerusalem is obviously the capital of Israel. And it's obvious we need a border with Mexico. It's obvious China is stealing jobs. It's obvious that North Korea needs to be dealt with, and now he's doing that through the maximum campaign of pressure, diplomatically, militarily, even through twitter. He's brought them to the table. They're going to end the Korean War. They're now, I think, totally imploding their underground nuclear testing facility. They're sealing off all the entrances, that's a huge step. Releasing the hostages is a huge step. So now, you have this summit in Singapore, and it looks positive. We're going to go in there with clear and open eyes. I think The Five should maybe go to Singapore and broadcast it since it's so historic. And we could all make the trip."

President Trump has the moral and political courage to be able to do this with the promise that he made to the people and he fulfilled it. I think that's important as well to be a person of your work, even as you relates to diplomatic relations with other country. If you say you're going to do something and you make a promise, you honor it. I'm very happy that there wasn't a tremendous amount of violence that people were worried about, that things would happen if this were to occur. I think it's definitely a step in the right direction in terms of the relationship, not only with Israel, but the United States, with the Saudis being on board.

This is an expression of people who feel that they are being run over and run out of land and property that was once theirs, and that there's no longer hope for a two-state solution. Netanyahu has made it very clear. And, President Trump, it looks like by making this highly provocative move doesn't care that the United States has a role here, potentially, as a -- you know, we love Israel, but we were going to be the force that negotiated some kind of peace. That brought, finally, some peace to the Middle East. Instead, we have, obviously, Israel firing at Iran. In Syria, Syria up in flames now. We have unsettled situation here between Israel and the Palestinians. So, what have we done? We're no longer seeking peace. Netanyahu, apparently, can do anything he wants.

This entire issue is a prison of two sides. Either Israel has a right to exist or Palestinians are victims of violence. There's no other side. And the intensity of media coverage on this issue is the exact opposite of the level of understanding and interest of the public. The public is not as interested in this issue as the media makes it out to be. This is why we don't have any Middle East experts. We have more middle earth experts than Middle East experts. And so, you know that when this is going to happen, they're going to create programming potential with retaliation. You know that if you send up these balloons filled with bombs, you're going to get it on camera, people are going to die and that's what happens. The question is, does this display of violence and the suffering that occurs have any effect in the land were four decades of violence has been happening anyway. Clashes erupt after -- this embassy clashes erupt every single day. Every single day. We are jaded and confused about this area. And so, I resisted this idea that this is a two-sided thing. The next solution in the peace process has to admit that the current way of dealing with this is going nowhere. It's going nowhere.

Last week I wrote a column and I said, you know, when you look at what went on in terms of the decision to pull the United States away from the Iran deal, the president with his boastfulness, however you want to describe it, I think it's persuasive to a lot of people. They say, \"Oh, the Iran deal has been violated. It was a weak deal, it was a terrible deal.\" And yet the fact is that the deal was never violated. The fact is that people say this was keeping Iran from having nukes. But now suddenly they say, \"Well, maybe it was a bad deal. Maybe it's just a partisan fight. Maybe he doesn't like Obama.

Anyone should be happy that there are more jobs here in America and that minorities are feeling better about what's happening in this country. There's so many accomplishments and things. And as it relates to national security and foreign policy, he has completely, completely changed the dynamic. This is a new style of politics and engaging to create effective results. Why not? If you keep doing the same thing and you end up with the end result, why not try a different way or a different path to be able to achieve these ends? Also, President Trump is using social media and Twitter to be able to communicate, so there is transparency there versus someone regurgitating, going through it and then putting something out.
