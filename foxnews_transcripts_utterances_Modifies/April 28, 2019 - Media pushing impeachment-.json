JASON RILEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: This not about more transparency or a search for the truth. This is about keeping this political narrative alive for the 2020 campaign.  Mollie, when the liberal commentators were pushing for impeachment as a way of removing President Trump from office, at least you can understand their goal. Now it seems to be seems to be, well, we can't kick him out of office this way, but we have a moral duty to punish him. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, SENIOR JOURNALISM FELLOW AT HILLSDALE COLLEGE: Well, I mean, the real problem here actually is that the media have no credibility to talk about this issue at all. They spent the last couple of years falling into this Russia conspiracy theory. There are thousands of stories. The liberal commentary also participated in this delusional thinking.  And then it came out that the Mueller report ended with not a single indictment for obstruction, not a single indictment for collusion, and they're continuing with this narrative. So, yes, it doesn't make sense because there's no actual -- there will be no conviction in the Senate, but also it is just part of a bigger problem which is a lack of credibility in the media and the liberal commentary.",

You should always try to have -- if you are in the media, your coverage reflect the truth and facts. We saw that emphasized last night at the White House correspondents' dinner, for instance. But the Mueller report actually gave people who believe that there was obstruction of justice a lot to work with. Bob Mueller was explicit that he wasn't going to be laying out, he wasn't making a decision, and there were 10 things that he was looking at that he thought amounted potentially to obstruction of justice. It was Bill Barr that made that decision.  We've heard from a number of legal commentators including our own Judge Andrew Napolitano who think that there is a case for obstruction of justice there. So while Nancy Pelosi wants to make sure that we fair well electorally in 2020, you can see actually even more of a pathway toward impeachment then you could before we got the Mueller report. KURTZ: For clarification, as you know, Bill Barr made the decision not to pursue obstruction because Mueller decided not to make a recommendation either way. So The New York Times' op-ed page has been full of these arguments. Here's one example from columnist Charles Blow. \"There's no such thing as a failed impeachment. Once a president is impeached, he is forever marked.\" I call this just giving him the scarlet \"I\".",

He feels like there's been too much bias against him. And if they toned it down a little bit, I think they can bridge the impasse. I think you get them to come back to the White House Correspondents' dinner. Although he's never gone to one as president, I was there with there with him three or four years ago at one of the Fox tables. But you know if they calm down, they can rebuild that relationship with the president. And I think will be a good thing for the president as he is going to 2020.",

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, SENIOR JOURNALISM FELLOW AT HILLSDALE COLLEGE",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, the real problem here actually is that the media have no credibility to talk about this issue at all. They spent the last couple of years falling into this Russia conspiracy theory. There are thousands of stories. The liberal commentary also participated in this delusional thinking. And then it came out that the Mueller report ended with not a single indictment for obstruction, not a single indictment for collusion, and they're continuing with this narrative. So, yes, it doesn't make sense because there's no actual -- there will be no conviction in the Senate, but also it is just part of a bigger problem which is a lack of credibility in the media and the liberal commentary."

      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

You should always try to have -- if you are in the media, your coverage reflect the truth and facts. We saw that emphasized last night at the White House correspondents' dinner, for instance. But the Mueller report actually gave people who believe that there was obstruction of justice a lot to work with. Bob Mueller was explicit that he wasn't going to be laying out, he wasn't making a decision, and there were 10 things that he was looking at that he thought amounted potentially to obstruction of justice. It was Bill Barr that made that decision. We've heard from a number of legal commentators including our own Judge Andrew Napolitano who think that there is a case for obstruction of justice there. So while Nancy Pelosi wants to make sure that we fair well electorally in 2020, you can see actually even more of a pathway toward impeachment then you could before we got the Mueller report. KURTZ: For clarification, as you know, Bill Barr made the decision not to pursue obstruction because Mueller decided not to make a recommendation either way. So The New York Times' op-ed page has been full of these arguments. Here's one example from columnist Charles Blow. \"There's no such thing as a failed impeachment. Once a president is impeached, he is forever marked.\" I call this just giving him the scarlet \"I\"."

I mean, look, at the end of the day, the members of Congress want to get more facts and they are not doing these necessarily to -- maybe it is the scarlet letter but they have to protect their 2020 chances as well. The media does not have 2020 chances to protect. They just have to tell the truth. And so when you see a plethora of opinion columns that are kind of coming out this way, you just want to make sure that quite frankly you're being balanced on the other side as well."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

You're right that no one in the press is running for office but maybe they want a certain outcome in 2020. FISCHER: That's right.

It has become a huge story, Mollie, we saw some of the clips at the top of the segment, the president saying he will defy all the congressional subpoenas, not just saying I don't like this one, I don't want that one, and there are legitimate arguments here about executive privilege and so forth. The media are kind of portraying this as a major constitutional crisis. I would point out these battles are not unusual. We've seen these in previous administrations.

You didn't see the media carrying that much about it. But now that the fight is moved to Donald Trump, now everyone says this is a constitutional crisis. I tend to think that Congress should have the right to see what it wants to see. I'm kind of Article One imperialist myself."

They should just cover it accurately including how much transparency there was in the Mueller probe. Remember this was such a wide far-reaching investigation and Donald Trump did not assert executive privilege. He gave up million plus documents. He let everyone testify. Actually there is a lot of information that people have already. Congress has been running probes as well. So even though they have the right to go for it, there is a lot that has been out there."

TARLOV: I don't think that there's a problem with the media in embracing the fact that Bob Mueller was complete in his investigation. The issue is with Bill Barr making the final decision and those 10 claims of obstruction of justice. HEMINGWAY: Robert Mueller was the one who made the decision not to indict a single American. In this country, when you don't indict someone, that means that they are not guilty of anything."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

You had people actually try to push a 25th Amendment approach where you have cabinet members oust the sitting president. KURTZ: Some of them if the reports are correct were Trump's own appointees."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "But the point isn't about whether it's Republican or Democrats but rather there is a resistance that is engaged in a coup-like behavior. Running informants against a political campaign, spying on a political campaign, making criminal leaks to set a false narrative that many people in the media and other partisans fell for, these are all coup -like behavior. We still don't even understand how these investigation started, who all was involved with it. It is a serious language but because it it's a very serious thing to happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

It obviously resonated with the people that wanted to resonate with so he is going to continue to use it. It is dangerous language. It is inappropriate. The United States of America is not a country in which a coup would go on hopefully. I meant, that certainly not what happened here. And if you read the Mueller report and if you've been following the coverage of it as well, you would see that this was not a coup. There were many members of the Trump administration that were speaking to Russians then lied about it. Bob Mueller was clear that --"

Just briefly, Rod Rosenstein became sort of a media hero, Sara. Defense the investigation and recently criticized the media saying they make attacks, unrestricted by truth or morality, they make threats, spread fake stories and attacking relatives. Back to that coup language, is the president playing to his base and pushing the media's buttons?"

I mean, if there is one thing that Donald Trump knows how to do, it's he's an effective communicator and what he does is he picks one word that will resonate that can go viral.

But I think there is also something else that is really important going on here and that is a lot of mea culpas (ph) for the 2016 coverage and even during the Democratic primary where reporters really didn't push Bernie Sanders as hard as they pushed Hillary Clinton, of course. And even when he got to the general, that Hillary got a different level of coverage than Donald Trump did. I think that reporters want to make sure that they're digging as deep as possible on each of these candidates. Bernie is getting it a lot worse than he certainly did in 2016, if you even look at the \"She the People\" summit from last week."

But I don't think that's a bad thing. The focus on who can invite the hottest celebrities got way out of control. Now the dinner is returning to its roots as another self-congratulatory industry convention. This one though meant to raise money for journalism scholarships, this time without screwing people. New York Times ran an unbelievably anti-Semitic cartoon in its international edition, showing President Trump with a yarmulke leading a dog whose face is that of Bibi Netanyahu complete with a star of David collar. Unbelievable! But Times now says the image was offensive and it was an error of judgment to publish it. No apology, a colossal error. Where on God's good earth were the editors? By the way, President Trump told the CEO Jack Dorsey that Twitter has unfairly removed some of his followers, blaming bias. Dorsey explained that lots of people have lost followers including him as Twitter purges fake accounts and bots. Hey, it's happened to me, too!

I mean, the Mueller report, some of the stuff inside, it is actually sour, but the top- line headline is very good for the president. And most of the American people have moved on.

And so, I think he is doubling down on that strategy for 2020. I don't like elements of it. There's no question about that. When he's calling people names like that, you know -- you know, he must like it. He gets sore at me for saying that I don't like it publicly, but I don't like it, because I think at the end of the day, he has to win the suburban woman voters. He had 52 percent the white women vote in 2016. He has got to get back to those levels again in 2020 to win. They don't like that kind of bullying. So, he -- he gets mad at people like me for calling them out on that. But the truth of the matter is, Howie, I want to see the guy win. He's had a very successful strategy for the American people.

And you can see it in your primetime ratings and it is obviously reflected in the morning ratings. And so, I do think from a ratings point of view it helps them. But I want to go back to what were talking earlier.

If you go back to the foundation principles of the Republic, the press is there to keep, you know, people away from Tierney. The press is there to guard us from people in power and frankly to hold them accountable. In addition to that, the free press makes our younger people very creative, Howie.

You've got the nerd from -- nerd to the 26th power, a lot of vacant seats, and he's got a packed house in Green Bay, Wisconsin. And so, the president is winning. You know, I would argue with the press, to change strategies a little bit on the president. They're not going to apologize to them, but the president is an old-fashioned guy. He feels like there's been too much bias against him. And if they toned it down a little bit, I think they can bridge the impasse. I think you get them to come back to the White House Correspondents' dinner. Although he's never gone to one as president, I was there with there with him three or four years ago at one of the Fox tables.

      "utterance": "It would not be framed as opening a conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I've got 20 seconds. It happened on CNN. MSNBC barely covered it. So, when these controversies come up with Democratic candidates, will they just downplay or avoid it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I think every network has the responsibility to cover these types of things. And I think what you saw from Chris Cuomo in that particular clip was him saying, are you really saying this to the American people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But it was not a big story everywhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "I think -- I think what we saw from Bernie was out of mainstream for the Democratic Party. As Emily said, where we -- where we sit as a party is, if you do your crime and pay the society, you should have the right to vote."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Richard Fowler and Emily Jashinsky, thanks so much for coming in. Still to come, Brian Lamb taking some parting shots at the media and Washington politics as the C-SPAN founder steps down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Brian Lamb launched C-SPAN with donations from cable companies 40 years ago to show people how the House, and later the Senate, actually functioned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIAN LAMB, C-SPAN FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "It seems like this building is old and they're going to be rebuilding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Today, the Senate goes on television, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "I'm going to hold my breath for a while. I have -- I have mixed feelings about it. Let's go right to those phones. We have a caller standing by, I believe, in Memphis, Tennessee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He built a morning show based on ordinary folks calling in Lamb told me because CBS, NBC, and ABC talked at us, and the public wasn't able to talk back. As he prepares to stop down, I had a little chat with the founder of C-SPAN."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Brian Lamb, welcome."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Howie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You launched this franchise 40 years ago so people can see their elected lawmakers at work. But in the media culture, this has become more angry, more opinionated, more polarized, do viewers still want to see members of Congress giving speeches?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know if they ever wanted to see them giving speeches. They wanted to be in a process in some way and not everybody. We never appeal to everybody."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But they say, they can communicate with YouTube, and Facebook, and Twitter, and Snapchat and do Podcast. Has technology to some degree marginalized C-SPAN?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "It is marginalized so much it has given those people in politics and the public tremendous opportunities to play in the game. You know, look at how many candidates we've had for president in the last couple of elections. That rarely happened in the past because they can play in the game without asking our permission or your permission. And I think that is a positive for the country overall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "C-SPAN is scrupulously down the middle. The hosts don't offer opinions, nobody knows your politics. What do you think of all of the emotion and conflict that seems to be built into cable news today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "First of all, nobody -- you're the first person to ever care what I had to say about that. I'm not so sure you really care because they're businesses. And they've all figured out including Fox, how to make lots of money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Their businesses but don't they also have some responsibility to good journalism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "It is not written anywhere. I mean, journalism is whatever you want to say it is. For years and years and years, I thought people in journalism had biases. Now, I know what their biases are. And I'm a lot more comfortable knowing that than trying to listen to them telling me they are not on a side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You've said that Washington is sort of built on a culture of lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "I came to town in the middle of Vietnam War. I sat in the Pentagon as a public affairs officer in the United States Navy. And I was told to lie. I mean, I was given facts and figures that we're not accurate. I heard the Secretary of Defense say we're winning the war when we knew we couldn't win the war. That's where it all started for me. It just got worse and worse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We've never had a president like Donald Trump. Has C-SPAN changed its approach at all to deal with the very unorthodox way that he conducts his presidency?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "Donald Trump is not terribly interested in us. We have not really gotten interviews with him. We cover him like we have covered every president. We have noticed that publicly our most active president in history was Bill Clinton and then George W. Bush. They were the most apt to deal with us and talk to us. Barack Obama on -- there has not been much attention to C-SPAN."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You hosted for years, Booknotes. And I was on in the early 90s for my first book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "Why are some conservatives that think the media is biased?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I was stunned by -- first of all, 60 Minutes and no breaks. But you were so prepared. You said you wrote on page 246. And I don't remember whatever 246. Will you miss doing the television show?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "I will. I'm not giving up totally. I'm giving up my Sunday night show that I've done for 30 years. I'm going to do a little stuff around the edges. Yeah, you'll miss it. This is the greatest business in the world for someone like me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You gave up the CEO duties about seven years ago. So why step down now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "I'm 77."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You've earned it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not really that anxious to step down. I just want to get out of anything regular, and spend a little less time coming to the office, that's my favorite part of the day. I would give up sleeping if I could. I do not even like sleeping."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Or take vacations apparently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAMB",
      "utterance": "I don't. I've never been a big vacationer, but my wife deserves me trying to learn to go on vacation. So we're going to give it a shot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "At the age of 77, you can learn a new skill. Brian Lamb, thanks very much for joining us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Doesn't even like to sleep, a terrific guy. That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. I hope you'll check out my new Podcast, Media Buzz Meter.
