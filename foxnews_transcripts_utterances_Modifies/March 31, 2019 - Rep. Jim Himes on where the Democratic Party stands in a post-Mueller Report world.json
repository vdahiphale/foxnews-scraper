Far more evidentiary information and videos and we saw one Brett Kavanaugh's nomination was trying to be derailed and him as an individual and his family being destroyed by folks who had no evidence of what had allegedly happened 34 years earlier. And I think Joe Biden has a big problem here because he calls it affection and handshakes. His party because it completely inappropriate.

So, Julie, some folks, especially Democrats, say that the president is jumping the gun going on this victory tour declaring complete victory on the Mueller report and that when it finally comes out there will be a bunch of stuff in there that he's not going to like and that they're going to have to explain. What's the feeling in the White House, let's just take the good news and if there's bad news later we'll deal with it later? JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Pretty much. I mean I think there have always been legal questions and political questions when it comes to the -- to the Mueller investigation. And from the legal perspective, this is indisputably good news for the president. You know, we always believed that Mueller was never going to be able to charge him because of Justice Department guidelines about a sitting president, but there were real questions that surrounded other people in the president's orbit, including his son, Donald Trump Junior. And the Mueller investigation ended with no additional criminal charges. That is good news for the White House. There is no other way to spin that. On the political question, I think we don't completely know yet how this will cut. I think that if you look at the totality of the investigation, it certainly hasn't been good for the president. His national security advisor had to plead guilty. His campaign chairman is going to be in jail for several years.

GUY BENSON, CO-HOST, \"BENSON AND HARF\": Of course it's a huge victory for him. I'd also say it's a victory for the American people that the president and his team did not collude with a hostile foreign government to steal an election. That is something we should all be celebrating. There's some glum faces around Washington, which I think is telling. But, yes, the president has been not only accused of being a criminal for the last two years, but in a lot of precincts of being some sort of a traitor. And now we see from Bob Mueller, who was determined to be the gold standard, and I actually have always agreed with that, no conspiracy and no coordination. I think a lot of Democrats are focusing on the word \"conspiracy,\" look we heard from your last guest, well, this isn't a crime necessarily. The word \"coordination\" was also ruled out by the special counsel. To me that is very significant. I think we should wait for the entire report to come forward.

For each of the relevant actions investigated, the reports they found evidence on both sides of the question, the special counsel states that, quote, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime of obstruction, it also does not exonerate him.

That's ridiculous and always was. We wasted a lot of money and a lot of time in people's anxiety over it. But the president is also saying, look, people were out there as recently as a week or days before the Barr memo characterizing the Mueller report was released by saying that the evidence of collusion was in plain sight, that the president had committed a crime, that Elizabeth Warren said we don't even know if you will be a free man."

We have never seen a surge like this coming from the Northern Triangle company (ph). Some of these kids are already separated by their parents from their parents before they even arrive here.

Congressman, let's start with what you told your local newspaper in Connecticut this week about whether the Mueller report clears the president on the issue of collusion with the Russians. Here's what you told them. I'm not sure I would break out a lot of champagne. They try to make the case that the Mueller report says there's no evidence of collusion. There's plenty of evidence.

But here's the big picture -- we are accepting that, and Adam Schiff and his famous speech of last week said, we are accepting the conclusion of Bob Mueller -- something. of course, that the Republicans did not do on Benghazi, on Uranium One, on Clinton emails. We are accepting that and we want to see the report and this is why I say I wouldn't break out the champagne just yet, for two reasons. One, the conclusion, despite what Kellyanne Conway just told you, is not clear on obstruction, and number two, again, at 400 pages, we are all speculating about what's in there, but we know about Don Jr.'s meeting in Trump Tower."

      "utterance": "OK, let's move onto another subject, and that is that House Democrats are demanding that Attorney General Barr turnover the entire Mueller report by this Tuesday, two days from now. Here is basically Barr's response to that. Barr says that you're going to get it by mid-April, which is two weeks from now, if not sooner. He says he's going to redact grand jury testimony and intelligence material but he says the White House won't get to review it for executive privilege. No White House review for executive of which, which I know it's a big concern of yours. Isn't that a reasonable plan, Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll say a couple things. Number one, it is absolutely reasonable that they remove all classified information from a report. My guess is it contains a lot of classified information because it pertains to Russia. Absolutely reasonable. Grand jury information, a little more ambiguous. Congress theoretically has the right to that. And then there's that third category, which you didn't mention of information that may be potentially embarrassing to third parties. And then -- but remember, we're talking about a difference of ten days here or so, and so my guess is that this is going to be something that can be negotiated away so that we wind up, as everybody agrees we should, with the Mueller report."

      "speaker": "HIMES",

I think -- my guess is that Jerry Nadler and others are probably actually in communication with Barr and with the Department of Justice on the nature of what is slowing them down. Now, remember, Congress can and does see classified information, so it's also possible that the Department of Justice can convey the report just to Congress in a closed environment. But by the way, just to come back to the executive privilege thing, remember, what Barr said was that the president has publicly indicated that he wants the report released and therefore we don't anticipate executive privilege claims. But, look, this could get reversed tomorrow morning if the president decides that he wants to change his mind on that. This is a president who has changed his mind in the past. So, we are sensitive to that possibility."

Something the Republicans could never find it in their hearts or minds to do with respect to Benghazi, the Clinton e-mails, Uranium One, I could go on and on. He said we accept the findings. We're not going to do ten investigations the way they did on Benghazi. Second, he said, I do not believe it is appropriate for people to lie about contacts with Russians. When the report comes out, what the American people will learn was that there was plenty of reason to be concerned about the nature of those contacts and the possibility of what those contacts might have meant."

Now, when -- when Adam Schiff says that there is a possibility that the president might be indicted after his presidency, remember, Chris, as we sit here today, any number of U.S. attorneys in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere continue their investigations of the president."

      "utterance": "Well, President Trump, in his own way, telling a rally in Michigan this week Democrats owe the country an apology for pushing the Russia investigation for more than two years. And it's time now for our Sunday group. The co-host of \"Benson and Harf\" on Fox News Radio, Guy Benson, Charles Lane from \"The Washington Post,\" author of the new book \"Freedom's Detective,\" Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for \"The Associated Press,\" and Josh Holmes, Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff. So, Julie, some folks, especially Democrats, say that the president is jumping the gun going on this victory tour declaring complete victory on the Mueller report and that when it finally comes out there will be a bunch of stuff in there that he's not going to like and that they're going to have to explain. What's the feeling in the White House, let's just take the good news and if there's bad news later we'll deal with it later? JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Pretty much. I mean I think there have always been legal questions and political questions when it comes to the -- to the Mueller investigation. And from the legal perspective, this is indisputably good news for the president. You know, we always believed that Mueller was never going to be able to charge him because of Justice Department guidelines about a sitting president, but there were real questions that surrounded other people in the president's orbit, including his son, Donald Trump Junior. And the Mueller investigation ended with no additional criminal charges. That is good news for the White House. There is no other way to spin that. On the political question, I think we don't completely know yet how this will cut. I think that if you look at the totality of the investigation, it certainly hasn't been good for the president. His national security advisor had to plead guilty. His campaign chairman is going to be in jail for several years. But I do think that the president sees this as a way to rally his base heading into his reelection, to cast this investigation as politically motivated and to get some of his voters really energized heading into 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Guy, whatever we end up reading, and they're probably -- I mean you can tell from the summary of the Mueller report from Barr, there's evidence on both sides on obstruction, not on collusion. Whatever we end up reading in the report, isn't this a big victory for Donald Trump, both politically and legally in the sense he was being -- he was investigated for more than two years by federal authorities and they end up finding no evidence apparently of collusion and apparently no criminal evidence, nothing prosecutable, when it comes to obstruction. GUY BENSON, CO-HOST, \"BENSON AND HARF\": Of course it's a huge victory for him. I'd also say it's a victory for the American people that the president and his team did not collude with a hostile foreign government to steal an election. That is something we should all be celebrating. There's some glum faces around Washington, which I think is telling. But, yes, the president has been not only accused of being a criminal for the last two years, but in a lot of precincts of being some sort of a traitor. And now we see from Bob Mueller, who was determined to be the gold standard, and I actually have always agreed with that, no conspiracy and no coordination. I think a lot of Democrats are focusing on the word \"conspiracy,\" look we heard from your last guest, well, this isn't a crime necessarily. The word \"coordination\" was also ruled out by the special counsel. To me that is very significant. I think we should wait for the entire report to come forward. I think the full football spiking might be premature. There's going to be some embarrassing stuff in there, no question. But the bottom line on the central thrust of what Mueller was investigated for two years, it's a vindication broadly for the president."

The practical problem is, unless you believe that Speaker Pelosi is going to work hand in glove with the Trump administration and Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to repeal Obamacare and come up with a replacement, we're talking about an exercise in futility. The second piece of this, which I think is more broadly concerning, is the fact that the issue selection is not exactly where it needs to be here. They're fighting a battle that has been waged for eight years and largely decided in August of 2017. Where we're at now is Democrats full-throated embrace of a Medicare for all policy. And I've got to tell you, the one biggest political liability that you can accrue in politics is separating families from coverage that they have, despite the efforts of their federal government, be able to navigate and provide for their families. That's where Democrats are right now and that's really where the Trump administration and all Republicans out to focus."

It's very important to understand that the Republicans actually -- they may not have a whole repeal and replace plan for Obamacare, but they have plans for health care, which include things like work requirements for Medicaid, which are not super popular around the country. That it's -- there's a good case to be made that the 2018 election went overwhelmingly in the House for the Democrats because they harped on pre-existing conditions. It republicans are threatening your pre-existing conditions. And that's what Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer see coming -- coming back. It's just fallen right back into their laps. Here comes the Republican administration threatening that again. And, you know, they're going to -- I think if they're smart, the White House will backpedal quickly and this will be a passing thing."

They thought at least they had gotten the president and a lot of their vulnerable lawmakers to the place where they could accept pre-existing conditions, where they could accept the provisions of Obamacare that let people stay on their parent's health insurance until they're 26. Those are broadly popular. There's very little appetite anywhere in -- in either party to do away with those right now.

But, Josh, Biden had a tough week this week, even without this latest allegation from Lucy Flores in Nevada. First, his comments about Anita Hill and the hearing in which he seemed to apologize for being a white guy and that all the members of the committee at that time were white guys, and then to say that he apologized for not giving her the hearing she deserved.

What he's talking about now is basically a world apology tour. And that's not going to work. That's not going to sell in Iowa, New Hampshire or anywhere else.

It's -- it's part of what people have -- have called kind of the Uncle Joe persona. I think the challenge for Joe Biden is, you know, due those moments look different in 2019 when we are in a place where we've gone through the Me Too movement, which has really, I think, cause people to take a fresh look at the -- at the behavior of men in powerful positions.
