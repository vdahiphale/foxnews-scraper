The simple fact is this election is far from over.\" The race was much closer than the media expected. But Biden ceased upon the network calls last night to claim victory.",

Mollie, president of the United States says the media are helping Joe Biden claim a victory he hasn't yet won.  Now, of course, the votes have to be certified by the states.

And they are doing that in part by how they make calls about different states. So even though Pennsylvania has,, like a 100,000 provisional ballots, outstanding and a bunch of mail- in ballots outstanding, far more outstanding ballots than there in North Carolina. The media are not calling North Carolina because that's a state Trump is ahead in, but they do call Pennsylvania even before the counting is done.  The thing is that the media used to have a position of trust where they could say this is going to happen and people would generally trust it. The media because of how they've behaved for the last four years where every single thing they've done more or less has been done to hurt Donald Trump and his supporters. To lie about Donald Trump and his supporters, to create false narratives about who is going to win an election or whether there's Russia collusion or whether Bret Kavanaugh is a serial gang rapist. Pretty much everything that 71 million Trump supporters have seen four the last four years has been fraudulent, false, or corrupt.  So even though the media would like to be able to say that if they say someone has won the election that it's over, that doesn't actually mean the votes are no longer being counted or that there aren't legitimate legal challenges or that this is over. So that's just the problem that the media have. And they've made that decision to lose all credibility through their own behavior.",

That can really rile people up. I haven't seen any evidence of that as of yet. Now, of course, these things are in litigations. Some of them have been thrown out.

There is this this issue where the standard that we need to meet for voter confidence in elections is that they have trust that these results are accurate. And so the more that people say, oh, there's no evidence of any problem. That actually leads to people having less trust in the media when they themselves know that mail-in balloting leads to fraud. There's a reason why France banned mail-in balloting in 1975. Why the New York Times used to say that mail-in balloting was ripe for fraud, why Jerry Nadler, a Democratic leader, used to say mail-in balloting is really bad if you care about election integrity.  And so when you have some states that don't even require signature requirements that have sudden and suspicious changes in voting where people are not allowed oversight, where you have credible allegations of dead people voting or people voting illegally or fraudulently in different elections, and the media respond by saying we have no interest in investigating this.  We are just going to assert that it's not true. That actually further corrodes people's confidence in the media if it's even possible at this point. And it's inappropriate, because the standard that needs to be met is that every American needs to have confidence. And a lot of Republican voters, 71 million Republican voters feel that the media are helping a political party basically take any election it wants with no oversight. And the more the media claim that that's what they -- that there's no -- you know, you can't have any problem with this, the more that people are -- the more that confirms peoples suspicions that this is fraudulent.",

I mean, that is an extremely risky precedent to set. I want to see if they're going to follow through on that. And of course, you know, you have the issue here, which is that some of the things that the president is saying, they are untrue, but politicians do that. He's not the first politician to ever come out and say untrue things.  So you really have selective interjection by the media in certain cases and not others, and that's kind of what bothers me. If they had let him finish his piece and then come in at the end and fact-checked it and had, you know, nonpartisan people come in and say, well, listen. This is what we know as of now. It doesn't match up to what he's saying and here is why. I have no issue with that.

We had three million people watch this program last week, but it's also been exhausting. How will the change at the White House affect how people like you and me do our jobs?",

He's also older now. He's, you know, it's going to be -- there's going to be snoozier parts of covering the White House every day. However, I will say this, Howie. There's going to be major policy implications in this new president. You know, how far does he push the left-wing agenda that he ran on? How much does -- did the Republicans keep the Senate, which it looks like they will if you talk to a lot of GOP pollsters and people in the party. How much they push back against his agenda?

The simple fact is this election is far from over.\" The race was much closer than the media expected. But Biden ceased upon the network calls last night to claim victory."

      "utterance": "Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway senior editor at f The Federalist and a Fox News contributor, in New York, Jedediah Bila, co-host of Fox and Friends Weekend, and Ray Suarez, Washington correspondent for EuroNews and host of KQED's WorldAffairs. Mollie, president of the United States says the media are helping Joe Biden claim a victory he hasn't yet won. Now, of course, the votes have to be certified by the states. The networks did their mathematical calculations and said Biden will win Pennsylvania in the end. Do you think the president's efforts to cast this as fake news are working?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the media clearly are doing everything in their power to help their candidate, who is Joe Biden, be able to claim that he won this election. And they are doing that in part by how they make calls about different states. So even though Pennsylvania has,, like a 100,000 provisional ballots, outstanding and a bunch of mail- in ballots outstanding, far more outstanding ballots than there in North Carolina. The media are not calling North Carolina because that's a state Trump is ahead in, but they do call Pennsylvania even before the counting is done. The thing is that the media used to have a position of trust where they could say this is going to happen and people would generally trust it. The media because of how they've behaved for the last four years where every single thing they've done more or less has been done to hurt Donald Trump and his supporters. To lie about Donald Trump and his supporters, to create false narratives about who is going to win an election or whether there's Russia collusion or whether Bret Kavanaugh is a serial gang rapist. Pretty much everything that 71 million Trump supporters have seen four the last four years has been fraudulent, false, or corrupt. So even though the media would like to be able to say that if they say someone has won the election that it's over, that doesn't actually mean the votes are no longer being counted or that there aren't legitimate legal challenges or that this is over. So that's just the problem that the media have. And they've made that decision to lose all credibility through their own behavior."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I don't question your point on credibility. I would note that Fox obviously has made these calls as well. You know, just a quick point here, people -- critics like to say Fox is partisan. MSNBC yesterday, all day was all liberal anchors and Democratic (Inaudible) celebrating what they see as the Biden victory. Fox and CNN had news anchors in charge. In fact, Karl Rove last night on Fox praised Biden's speech as pitch perfect. Jedediah, it was four years ago that Fox and the other networks projected that Donald Trump have won the election. That's how this works. The president tweeting this morning. It's already been flagged by Twitter. This was a stolen election. And you pressed Newt Gingrich this morning about is there's evidence for these claims of widespread fraud."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEDEDIAH BILA, FOX AND FRIENDS WEEKEND HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And you know, I just don't think that these decision desks are on some kind of mission to declare certain states versus others for partisan regions. I don't believe that about our decision desk. I don't believe that about the other decision desks. They have a job to do. And they're looking at the returns coming in. And I think they have done their job quite well, particularly at Fox News. I was really impressed by a lot of the work they did, not just this year but every year. And I did press that issue, because I think that to come out and say that there is voter fraud, of course, there is a certain degree of voter fraud in every election. We know that. That's an unfortunate reality. I wish it didn't exist but it happens. But to (AUDIO GAP) about an election being stolen or an election rigged, that can be a dangerous statement. That can really rile people up. I haven't seen any evidence of that as of yet. Now, of course, these things are in litigations. Some of them have been thrown out. Some of them are still being considered. Who knows? Maybe it will come up that there is widespread voter fraud, but it would have to be enough voter fraud to change the outcome of the election. I'm not seeing as of yet. And you don't want an electorate that doesn't have faith in the system. You have to have faith in the democratic process. You have to --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Ray, does it seem a little odd that a handful of network decision desks and the AP are able to make this declaration and the entire world now recognizes Joe Biden as the president-elect, and the Biden himself whose campaign was pressing CNN and others to make this call, wouldn't give his victory speech until he had that media certification?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RAY SUAREZ, WORLDAFFAIRS PODCAST HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, look, the media certification is not based on nothing. It's not media certification. It's the media taking information that they get from governmental bodies that are counting the votes and projecting based on that. If they were in the tank for Joe Biden, why they didn't call the election Tuesday night or Wednesday night or Thursday Friday night. This idea that they are going to embarrass themselves by saying that election went one way when they clearly went another is ludicrous. And when it doesn't turn out this way, all the people making that accusation will not head to their outlets and say I was wrong. It's ridiculous. And the idea that Biden would expose himself in that way is just as ridiculous. The decision desks have standards and metrics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Sorry, Ray. Mollie, what did you make of the four networks breaking away from the president's speech at the White House. MSNBC cutting after one minute and said no, no, no, no. He's not telling the truth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It's unconscionable as is so much of what the media have done, not just this week but weeks prior and years prior. There is this this issue where the standard that we need to meet for voter confidence in elections is that they have trust that these results are accurate. And so the more that people say, oh, there's no evidence of any problem. That actually leads to people having less trust in the media when they themselves know that mail-in balloting leads to fraud. There's a reason why France banned mail-in balloting in 1975. Why the New York Times used to say that mail-in balloting was ripe for fraud, why Jerry Nadler, a Democratic leader, used to say mail-in balloting is really bad if you care about election integrity. And so when you have some states that don't even require signature requirements that have sudden and suspicious changes in voting where people are not allowed oversight, where you have credible allegations of dead people voting or people voting illegally or fraudulently in different elections, and the media respond by saying we have no interest in investigating this. We are just going to assert that it's not true. That actually further corrodes people's confidence in the media if it's even possible at this point. And it's inappropriate, because the standard that needs to be met is that every American needs to have confidence. And a lot of Republican voters, 71 million Republican voters feel that the media are helping a political party basically take any election it wants with no oversight. And the more the media claim that that's what they -- that there's no -- you know, you can't have any problem with this, the more that people are -- the more that confirms peoples suspicions that this is fraudulent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me jump in here. Jedediah, I don't have any problem with people on networks challenging the president on widespread fraud and that sort of thing. but to just say we are pulling away now, don't listen to that guy, and then pulling the plug on the president, that strikes me as reinforcing the view that the media are not being fair here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILA",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, that's not a producer decision I would have made. I would have let him continue because it sets a precedent, right? So now, every time, you know, if Joe Biden is in fact the next president, every time he does a press conference and he says something that's inaccurate, are the media going to pull away from that and fact-check him? I mean, that is an extremely risky precedent to set. I want to see if they're going to follow through on that. And of course, you know, you have the issue here, which is that some of the things that the president is saying, they are untrue, but politicians do that. He's not the first politician to ever come out and say untrue things. So you really have selective interjection by the media in certain cases and not others, and that's kind of what bothers me. If they had let him finish his piece and then come in at the end and fact-checked it and had, you know, nonpartisan people come in and say, well, listen. This is what we know as of now. It doesn't match up to what he's saying and here is why. I have no issue with that. I do have an issue with a cutaway that wouldn't necessarily happen with one candidate but does happen with another politician. That seems arbitrary if not intentional in some way, and that's not good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "CNN and Fox did not cutaway from the president. Ray, we have a lot leaks yet again from the White House in the campaign. Wall Street Journal saying one adviser described President Trump's mood as black, advisers urging him to prepare for the eventuality of losing. Washington Post, some in Trump's orbit have worked to calm him and push him toward likely outcome. These are unnamed sources, but are they undercutting the president's message that he continues to argue this election is being stolen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUAREZ",
      "utterance": "Given the way the news business works, it's inevitable that these stories are going to appear when there's not much coming out of the White House. I read this morning two different stories, one saying Jared Kushner was pushing the president to concede, another one saying that he was leading the forces telling them to stay and fight. Obviously, both stories can't be true. It would be better if the White House was giving more regular statements but they aren't, and in that vacuum start to come un-sourced stories. They're a problem. But when people won't go on the record, you know, what are you going to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Mollie, in the New York Post, we can put the cover up for a moment. The conservative editorial page is urging the president to stop the stolen election and conspiracy talk among other conservative in the media. Rick Santorum said on CNN that Trump's comments about widespread fraud were dangerous. Ben Shapiro, very popular podcaster called the comments deeply irresponsible. Sean Spicer has been critical. So it's not just the liberal media which are saying the president is going too far with his rhetoric."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Actually, I'm not sure if I agree with that. I think that tens of millions of American voters are deeply concerned about election integrity. They are worried about the fraud that can result, reasonably, from lack of oversight of elections. And this is a great example of how corrupt the media can be. They only put on conservative voices if they are going to tear down the president that 71 million Americans support. And they're only going to put on people who criticize him. They're only going to have anonymous sources who criticize him. And people are rightfully very concerned about that. You have more unity in the Republican Party than you've ever had in modern history with 95 percent of people supporting this president that with -- you would not believe how many people are concerned about election integrity. And the more that you have people saying that this is not a real issue, the more concerned people are that there is no way to fix this problem, which is a very legitimate problem no matter how much the media shouts that it's not."

The president had said there wouldn't be much COVID coverage after November 3rd. But obviously it's a story that will not go away and will plague the next president. When we come back, how election night stunned many of the pundits who expected a blowout loss for President Trump. And later, Frank Luntz on a national polling debacle."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Right. When it comes to the media and conservative voters and their politicians, the media lie. They lie. They lie, and then they lie. They were shocked by what happened because they spent the last four years lying about the success of the Donald Trump administration. They thought they had done enough to cover up all of the corruption of the Biden -- of a potential Biden administration through how they covered that campaign. They created false narratives such as the Russia collusion hoax, Anonymous, the Kavanaugh situation, the Covington kid. And they lied through -- intentionally false polling which said that this is was going to be a blowout for Democrats. The Democrats were going take the Senate. They were going to have gains in the House and that Joe Biden would win easily in a landslide. The voters had a say, and that's not what happened. Donald Trump gained votes unlike Barack Obama when he ran for reelection and lost four million votes. Donald Trump gained seven million votes. The House, which the Fox News decision desk predicted would gain five Democratic seats actually gained Republican seats, quite a few of them. The Senate is not at this point unless you can have similar things that are happening in other states happen in Georgia and Pennsylvania go to -- go to Democrats. And you had more minority voters supporting Donald Trump than any Republican in history. And so all of these things that the media said about Donald Trump were not true. And so yes, they were surprised when the voters had a say."

There's just been, you know, watching those clips, there's been so much nastiness that has come out during the Trump administration from the media, and it's really unfortunate. And I see that Anderson Cooper apologized for that and good for him. He should. But that's the unfortunate reality that now you're in a time where you have Joe Biden coming out and calling for unity. And that is a great concept. And I would love to be on that page. I would love to have a country that, you know, can sit down and have a conversation again about politics without being at each others throats. The problem is that conservatives feel like they're disparaged all the time. Trump voters have felt, like, for years, no matter what they do they are labeled as racists, They are labeled as this, that, or the other thing. And they are tired of it, and they feel that the media and the Democrat establishment is always working against them. So they are on edge. They are on defense all of the time. That's an unfortunate reality. So I don't know how you fix that until the media owns up. Takes some responsibility and begins to objectively, again, look at Democrats and Republicans and really give fair assessments of what's going on and instill confidence again in the electorate that they can at least trust who is disseminating the information. And that includes everyone. And it's a big problem, Howie."

And along with those excesses and those overreaches that you saw, and I'm glad Anderson Cooper apologized as well. There were countless handicaps of the coming counting that said here is what the look for. If the president is doing well, you will see this and this and this. If Joe Biden is doing well, you will see this and this and this. Careful, measured, not slam-dunking, and not predicting, along with excerpts like you just showed. Both thing happened.

Contrary to a Vanity Fair report, however, President Trump did not call Rupert Murdoch who told the Washington Post if the president had called I would not have interfered or change our call.

And charlie, the nonstop tweets and battles and controversies have been a huge gift to the news businesses. Clicks are up. Ratings are up.

You know, it was The Apprentice in many ways often with a lot of policy implications as well. Listen, it's obviously going to be less exciting with Joe Biden. Joe Biden is a much more laid back guy. He's also older now. He's, you know, it's going to be -- there's going to be snoozier parts of covering the White House every day. However, I will say this, Howie. There's going to be major policy implications in this new president. You know, how far does he push the left-wing agenda that he ran on? How much does -- did the Republicans keep the Senate, which it looks like they will if you talk to a lot of GOP pollsters and people in the party. How much they push back against his agenda?

Every -- I come from the business side of the media side often merges acquisitions. I talk to a lot of the media suits. They are worried about Trump leaving and, you know, TV ratings going down. People are less engaged in newspapers. Remember, newspapers were dying. But all the online traffic on stories was off the charts. The Times had record subscriptions online. TV ratings have been off the charts. Will that continue?

Jeff Zucker essentially put Donald Trump on the map as, you know, producing (ph) when he was running NBC, with The Apprentice. And clearly helped him in his -- in the first time he ran and then turned on him and he admitted. That was a business model decision, by the way. You're trying to get an audience that's different than ours, because this is a business. You know, this is the sad part about it. I'm a reporter and you're a reporter.

But he has got to look at himself right now, look at himself in the mirror and say, is it my fault, is it the things I said, is it the presentations I gave. What we now know is it was a close election. Those pollsters who said it was going to be a blowout, they shouldn't be working anymore.

You actually have to listen to what voters have to say. You have to understand why they feel the way that they do, to explain it to give a richer, fuller description of what is actually going on. And too many pollsters and too many journalists just look at the numbers and they look -- don't look at what's behind the numbers. And until they fix that, they're going to continue to get it wrong."

The focus groups that I did for a major newspaper, the people in the newsroom tried to kill it again and again and again. They did not want to have this as part of their coverage. They wanted to control the narrative and they did not want to give it to the voters themselves. But they felt uncomfortable about me. Howie, the stuff that we did in that very first -- the first session we did that aired on Fox News in the first debate, Donald Trump did not win that debate. He did badly. That is exactly what the focus group showed. But these people in the newsroom don't want accountability. They don't want to hear this voice. And so that's why they get it wrong."

I invited them to ask questions. I was completely transparent. That's what the news media needs right now, particularly in the newsrooms of newspapers. Genuine accountability. Genuine transparency.

The amount of fraud being reported in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Georgia, and Wisconsin is unreal. Kat, Twitter is at it again this morning, flagging tweets by the president himself when he talks about thieves in places like Philadelphia, stolen election.

Because if you start looking at Twitter and saying I expect this to all be completely factually true, they are not going to catch everything, and that is going to go wrong.

      "utterance": "Oh, yeah, it shines a spotlight on him. Mara, maybe there's an argument about flagging tweets that claim widespread fraud or whatever. It is maybe. But I don't understand the president says I won this election or I won Pennsylvania, says it prematurely. I mean, people get it. It is political speech or spin. They can figure it out. Why would you suppress that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, you know, Twitter is a private company that has been given tremendous protections by Congress about what it can do and what it can't do and what it is responsible for and what is not responsible for. And unless Congress wants to regulate Twitter in the way that forces them to let anything be said, that's one alternative. There could be conservative Twitter just like there are now conservative capable networks where there didn't used to be. I am not sure what the solution to this is. I will tell you, though, that on social media, when conservatives compete, they generally come out on top. What's the fastest, biggest trending post on Facebook right now? The ones you just read by Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, naturally. Kat, some Democratic lawmakers are calling on Twitter to suspend the president's account. That's not going to happen. But isn't that a pretty blatant attempt, to use Silicon Valley, to silence the opposition?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. There were pieces -- I mean, sure Independent, Guardian, but also even in USA Today kind of pointing out that Twitter always said he has special treatment because he is considered news worthy individual because he's the president of the United States --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "And that he will no longer have that when he's not the president of the United States. So I think we are going to hear those calls get louder."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. He will still be a newsworthy individual and he has got the - -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "He will make sure of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Mara, I've got half a minute. I want to get you in on the question about whether one sees in the White House Joe Biden will feel the need to engage with reporters more, to hold news conference, to give more interviews. Quick thought."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Certainly more than he's done during the campaign. I don't think he will ever be as accessible as Donald Trump, but yes, I think so, because he really engaged at a very, very minimal level during the campaign and I expect that to change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, he was playing it safe. By the way, you know, for all the critics of President Trump from the media, nobody in journalism can argue that the president didn't deliver incredible access to the point where we got used to talking to him five times a day. That's done and we are done. Mara Liasson, Kat Timpf, thanks for joining us. That's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I am Howard Kurtz.
