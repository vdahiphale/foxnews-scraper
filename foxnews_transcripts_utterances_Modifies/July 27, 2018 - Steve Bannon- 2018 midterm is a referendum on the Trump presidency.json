      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Great news for the United States of America. In other words, our economy is moving at its fastest pace in four years. In moments we will explain what this means for you.  Also, we are going to highlight the President's historic economic track record that the rest of the media, that Democrats are ignoring. And the days of Obama's pathetic economic stagnation are now official over.  Now today on my radio show, I did interview the President about the roaring economy and so much more. We will play the highlights.  Plus, the countdown to the mid-terms is on. We are going to show you how the less new low, he is hitting lower and lower and lower. Good news for the country, that's bad news for them. Also tonight, more progress to report on North Korea. Today, dictator Kim Jong-un, he kept one of his promises. He actually returned dozens of cases containing the remains of U.S. servicemen that were killed abroad during the Korean War. A serious breakthrough, a promise kept.  Sit tight. Stay tune. It is time for tonight's breaking news, Friday edition opening monologue. All right. As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump long promised to spur the American economy and get growth rates back to four percent, many on the left, many in the media, many so-called experts and economists, they mocked him. They said it could not happen. They said a growth rate around two percent was the new normal in America.  The haters, left wingers and the Democrats are all proven wrong. Today, the commerce department officially announced that the second quarter GDP grew at a whopping space of 4.1 percent. That's more than double the average yearly growth under Obama. In fact, under President Obama they nearly even made three percent. The first U.S. president in U.S. history not to have a year of three percent GDP growth.   Now, this is just the key piece of an American economy that is now booming everywhere you turn. The overall unemployment rate now is four percent, a 17 year low. To put it in perspective, the average unemployment rate under Obama, 7.4 percent. Under President Trump African-American unemployment is at its now lowest rate ever at 6.5 percent. A record low Hispanic unemployment rate in America, their lowest reported at 4.6 percent. Women in the workforce even lower at four percent. And by the way, 14 states have record low unemployment. Consumer confidence at a 17 year high. Homeownership rate is up significantly. The amount of Americans on food stamps is down by millions. And there are now literally more jobs available in America than there are people on unemployment. Basically, an economic miracle turnaround. Yes, and we are negotiating better trade deals all over the world. No trade wars including this week when President Trump and the head of the European Union agreed to push for zero tariffs barriers and subsidies between the two trading partners.   So just take - just a short time ago, under Obama, he gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more Americans in poverty. The lowest labor participation rate since the '70s. The worst homeownership rate in 51 years. The worst recovery since the '40s. And on top of this, yes, he took on more debt than ever other President before him combined. Earlier today, on my radio show, President Trump has this to say about America's record setting economy. Take a listen.",

I look so forward to seeing the next quarter because this is so sustainable. This is going to go for a long time.   For the economy, we can go a lot higher. And you know, people, don't talk. We have $21 trillion in debt. When this really kicks in we will start paying off that debt like it is water. We will start paying that debt down. We are $21 trillion dollars, a number that is, you know, unthinkable. But that will go down very quickly because the numbers with growth and the kind of growth that we produced, the 4.1 can actually go higher. I look forward to seeing next quarter because I think that the 4.1 is just a steppingstone. But when we make good trade deals, Sean, is going to have a huge impact on GDP growth. And the numbers will be so big that you will actually start paying down debt in very large chunks. It will go quickly.",

But it is also clear evidence that the President is keeping his promises. Something that is rare in Washington to you, the American people.  It is important to keep in mind. We are now approaching the most important midterm elections in our country's history as far as I am concerned. Aby the way, Steve Bannon will talk about that later. But without a doubt, Democrats will be up to the same old predictable dirty tricks and tactics. It doesn't matter what the economy is doing. Instead, they want you to believe the Republicans are monsters, that they are racists and sexists and misogynic and xenophobic and homophobic, Islamophobic, that they want dirty air and water, even thought they drink it and breath it and they want literally throw granny over a cliff and they want to kill children.

You want to preserve the disaster of Obamacare where every American did not keep their doctor and didn't keep their plan and they are not paying less. They want to eliminate ICE. They want open borders. They want to stop the investigations into what was the biggest abuse of power by the deep state in American history.  So with 101 days to go as this midterms gets close, the less rhetoric, their conduct is only going to get worse and worse and worse.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Great news for the United States of America. In other words, our economy is moving at its fastest pace in four years. In moments we will explain what this means for you. Also, we are going to highlight the President's historic economic track record that the rest of the media, that Democrats are ignoring. And the days of Obama's pathetic economic stagnation are now official over. Now today on my radio show, I did interview the President about the roaring economy and so much more. We will play the highlights. Plus, the countdown to the mid-terms is on. We are going to show you how the less new low, he is hitting lower and lower and lower. Good news for the country, that's bad news for them. Also tonight, more progress to report on North Korea. Today, dictator Kim Jong-un, he kept one of his promises. He actually returned dozens of cases containing the remains of U.S. servicemen that were killed abroad during the Korean War. A serious breakthrough, a promise kept. Sit tight. Stay tune. It is time for tonight's breaking news, Friday edition opening monologue. All right. As a candidate and as president, Donald Trump long promised to spur the American economy and get growth rates back to four percent, many on the left, many in the media, many so-called experts and economists, they mocked him. They said it could not happen. They said a growth rate around two percent was the new normal in America. The haters, left wingers and the Democrats are all proven wrong. Today, the commerce department officially announced that the second quarter GDP grew at a whopping space of 4.1 percent. That's more than double the average yearly growth under Obama. In fact, under President Obama they nearly even made three percent. The first U.S. president in U.S. history not to have a year of three percent GDP growth. Now, this is just the key piece of an American economy that is now booming everywhere you turn. The overall unemployment rate now is four percent, a 17 year low. To put it in perspective, the average unemployment rate under Obama, 7.4 percent. Under President Trump African-American unemployment is at its now lowest rate ever at 6.5 percent. A record low Hispanic unemployment rate in America, their lowest reported at 4.6 percent. Women in the workforce even lower at four percent. And by the way, 14 states have record low unemployment. Consumer confidence at a 17 year high. Homeownership rate is up significantly. The amount of Americans on food stamps is down by millions. And there are now literally more jobs available in America than there are people on unemployment. Basically, an economic miracle turnaround. Yes, and we are negotiating better trade deals all over the world. No trade wars including this week when President Trump and the head of the European Union agreed to push for zero tariffs barriers and subsidies between the two trading partners. So just take - just a short time ago, under Obama, he gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more Americans in poverty. The lowest labor participation rate since the '70s. The worst homeownership rate in 51 years. The worst recovery since the '40s. And on top of this, yes, he took on more debt than ever other President before him combined. Earlier today, on my radio show, President Trump has this to say about America's record setting economy. Take a listen."

      "utterance": "A big factor, though, Sean, was regulation. And obviously, a big factor was the taxes. But a lot of this - really, the taxes are going to help in the future. I look so forward to seeing the next quarter because this is so sustainable. This is going to go for a long time. For the economy, we can go a lot higher. And you know, people, don't talk. We have $21 trillion in debt. When this really kicks in we will start paying off that debt like it is water. We will start paying that debt down. We are $21 trillion dollars, a number that is, you know, unthinkable. But that will go down very quickly because the numbers with growth and the kind of growth that we produced, the 4.1 can actually go higher. I look forward to seeing next quarter because I think that the 4.1 is just a steppingstone. But when we make good trade deals, Sean, is going to have a huge impact on GDP growth. And the numbers will be so big that you will actually start paying down debt in very large chunks. It will go quickly."

Now, this huge quarterly GDP growth is great news for every American. Not only does this prove that tax cuts have actually worked and always work. But it is also clear evidence that the President is keeping his promises. Something that is rare in Washington to you, the American people. It is important to keep in mind. We are now approaching the most important midterm elections in our country's history as far as I am concerned. Aby the way, Steve Bannon will talk about that later. But without a doubt, Democrats will be up to the same old predictable dirty tricks and tactics. It doesn't matter what the economy is doing. Instead, they want you to believe the Republicans are monsters, that they are racists and sexists and misogynic and xenophobic and homophobic, Islamophobic, that they want dirty air and water, even thought they drink it and breath it and they want literally throw granny over a cliff and they want to kill children. Earlier today, I asked the President about that is so much more. Here's his answer."

      "utterance": "All right. The president is right. And ahead of the mid-terms, it is very clear that the left, they really have no plan to improve the lives of, oh, the forgotten men and women. We live eight years on the economic failures, stagnation. What? You want to take it back? You want the problems back? Really, you want to impeach Trump? Is that what you wanted to do? You want to preserve the disaster of Obamacare where every American did not keep their doctor and didn't keep their plan and they are not paying less. They want to eliminate ICE. They want open borders. They want to stop the investigations into what was the biggest abuse of power by the deep state in American history. So with 101 days to go as this midterms gets close, the less rhetoric, their conduct is only going to get worse and worse and worse. And of course, they are willing accomplices in the media that just echo each other. Now President Trump successful presidency is literally driving them insane. By the way, this week they were in rare form. Total insanity. They wake up every day. How can I hate Trump today? Take a look."

And finally tonight, we end with some positive developments at the Korean peninsula.

We are talking about 50, 60, 100 million people could have been wiped out and lost. We had a great meeting, historic, and among other things where the remains are starting to come back. Missiles have been stopped. We don't have rockets and missiles shot over Japan. The hostages we got them back even before I left we got them back. Nuclear testing, no more. Rocket testing no more. So many things have changed. And you know, one thing all of their propaganda material and the propaganda which has been up for years, propaganda, the signs, the music, it's all stopped. It's all been taken down. So many positive things have happened. And you know, we have time. There is no rush. I told my people don't rush. We have not taken any sanctions off.

It really is -- one reason politics has such a foul stench. But I think that the President could help himself more. You started the program with these great economic numbers. The thing about these economic numbers, a rising tide is that (INAUDIBLE), Americans are doing better than ever. Wages are going up. There are more jobs than people seeking jobs.

We now have unemployment and I won't repeat all of the good things that have been said. But here is the truth. You know, Geraldo Rivera says the president should talk more about, you know, the civil rights issue helping the people who have been forgotten. But the truth is Geraldo, he could talk about it from the highest mountains and the press would not report it. What the American people instinctively understood that this was a man, this Donald Trump who had never run for any office in his life, instinctively understands the plight of the hard working American men and woman.

You remember the huge demonstrations the day after the inauguration by women wearing pink hats everywhere. Their problem was the fear that the President would curtail the rights under Roe v. Wade.

This is now battlefield 2018 because they want to impeach the president. They want their crumbs back. They want to get rid of ICE open borders. They want to keep ObamaCare. And then want to cover up the corruption that we have been exposing at the highest levels of government to stealing an election. A lot the stake."

      "utterance": "Sean, you said something that is the most important Midterm. I would just like to rephrase that. And I think is President Trump's first reelect. This is going to be up or down vote. It's a referendum on the Trump presidency. They are very focused. The opposition is going to be very focused on try to win the House of representatives, try to win Congress in order to impeach President Trump and stop the entire progress, right, whether it's the economic growth or this then new reorientation of the world's commercial system through trade deals, whether it is his America first national security, whether southern border security. You pick it. They are going to try to unwind it. So this is really, I mean, the Democrats got one thing. They got a do- over. In this November, and it is 100 days and a wake up, 100 days and a wake up, we are going to have essentially, a national election. And that is going to determine the second half of the first term of President Trump and I think 2020. (INAUDIBLE) 2020. Right now, we are going to have a referendum. It is going to be I think very focused on President Trump's record. And I would tell everybody that the way to win this is exactly like we won in 2010. That great tea party sweep. You are going to have to go at door-to-door, right doorbells and do voter registrations drives and get people out. I mean, President Trump has delivered on the action. Now it's time for the populous movement, the nationalist movement, the Republicans, American Republicans, conservative movement. Everybody that turned out in 2016, you have to do it all over again. Or the first action they are going to take under Nancy Pelosi or whoever the democratic speaker is try to impeach President Trump."

But you have 86 of those are Republican seats. And you talking about the Republicans have to win 61 of the 86. So that's a lot. And historically, and I asked the president about this earlier today on my radio show, historically seats are lost in the Midterm election for the party in the White House. How do people save these 61 seats-plus? Because I would like a little comfort margin there."

It's about ideas and it is about- it is about getting out and turning out votes. President Trump has delivered. He said he will take action. He took action with the destruction of ISIS. He took action -- look at these economic numbers today. They are just unbelievable. Look what he is doing on the - and the trade deals, what he is doing is reorienting the world's supply chain away from China. He is fully engaging in going back on China on economic where they are head on us. President Trump has delivered on judges. Everything he said he was going to do, he has either done or in the process of doing. And it is combat upon everybody that is supporting him in 2016. This is going to be the old-fashioned way, OK. This is not going to on that commercial. It's not how much money you raise. This is going to be very simple. It's going to be muscle. The opposition is very different than in '16. In '16 Hillary Clinton's arrogance, their cockiness, you know, they really missed what we were doing in the upper Midwest, OK, to really break that blue wall. This time the Time's Up movement and the resistance are very focused. And they are going door-to-door. It is incumbent everybody that supports President Trump to understand this is going to be the old-fashioned way. You're going to have to go door-to- door, you're going to have pamphlets get voter registration and knock on doors and get your neighbors to come out. This is all that turn out on November 6."

      "speaker": "BANNON",
      "utterance": "No. This cuts to the heart of it. This is a national referendum. Whether it's a rhino whether it's an establishment figure whether somebody either congressman or a senator that you don't fully support. That is not the question now. The question is that the Trump agenda, their questions is about President Trump and his agenda. And you are going to have to just put -- you know, you're going to sometimes vote for people that you're not totally comfortable with. OK. And this means some establishment figures and some rhinos. It doesn't matter. This is a national referendum. It's an up or down vote on the Trump presidency. If we take and force everything to November 6th, we're going to win this. There's not going to be a blue wave. And here's the benefit of not having a blue wave. When they don't get the blue wave that they've been selling their grassroots people they're going to have, they're going to turn themselves on a civil war on the Democratic Party. And I got a take it will make 2018 and 2020 much, much easier."

But more importantly, we now have record low unemployment in this country of 14 states for women in the workforce, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian-Americans and the military that have been out of work. And millions now have been taken off the food stamp rolls with more jobs available than people on unemployment. This didn't happen as fast when Reagan was president who, you know, I'm a Reagan conservative."

      "speaker": "BANNON",

Donald Trump is a historic president. Donald Trump is a transformational president. If you want to keep that transformation going, that's why this November is not a midterm election. This midterm is the first re-elect of Donald J. Trump. And everybody is going to have to put their shoulder to the wheel. It's exactly, Sean, as you remember what we did in August of 2016. We brought the Republican establishment together and the Trump movement together, grassroots conservatives together, we put our heads down and against tremendous opposition and of the media, the opposition party media, and all of the money the Clintons raised, it didn't make a difference. We won and we won big in a historic landslide. That can happen again and it will happen again if people start to focus on what November 6th is which is a national referendum under the presidency of Donald Trump."

Even though in 2014 they gave us the Senate to say go change things. And even though in 2016 they gave us the White House to go change things. There are still this reluctance. And the president feels this every stinking day. Because he is bound and determined to do what he told the American people he was going to do what he ran out the mandate we got from that election and the House needs to do the same.

What did you tell them you're going to do, go do that and be willing to stand up and have the debate?

And over the weekend the American people said you are crazy! So, on Monday, he says, I'm going to open the government back up. Because he was losing in the political and the public relations world. So he opens the government back up. A few weeks later, we had a chance on that big spending bill to treat our troops the way they deserve to be treated for defending our country and hold the line on everything else. And what do we do? What the swamp always does. We said, no, we won't even have the debate. Even though we got a guy in the White House who was great at debating, great at taking the message to the people.
