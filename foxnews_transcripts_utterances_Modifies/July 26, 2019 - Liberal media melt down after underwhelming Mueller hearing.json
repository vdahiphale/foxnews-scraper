The conspiracy theorists and the Democratic Party are humiliated. The witch hunt is over. And despite their best efforts, the partisan probe came up totally empty.  Robert Mueller's testimony was an utter disaster. And now, Operation Boomerang is in full effect. John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe is well underway. And according to a FOX News report, Durham could have smoking gun evidence of serious misconduct at the highest levels of our government.  Meanwhile, Democrats could not care less about the government accountability. Instead, they are on the mission to read personal e-mail and text of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Joining us now with more is Catherine Herridge -- Catherine.",

Their conversation about Russia sitting on damaging Clinton e-mails was passed to the FBI through unconventional channels, kickstarting the FBI probe.

And author of \"Why We Fight,\" radio host Sebastian Gorka. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us tonight.  Sebastian, I want to start with you, because this boomerang that is now in place with the Mueller report coming up empty, that thing is going to come right back in to the face of the Democrats based on what we can tell that the Department of Justice is pursuing. That is the origins of this case.  SEBASTIAN GORKA, AUTHOR, \"WHY WE FIGHT\": Exactly right, Jason. It's clear from this disastrous testimony by Bob Mueller who disgraced himself and the FBI that there are ongoing investigations that are looking into the real genesis of Operation Crossfire Hurricane, and how this illegal surveillance against the Trump campaign actually occurred and who was behind it. It's exactly like I have a good friend Chris Platte who has a morning show here in D.C. He says it's like the last scene from \"The Hunt for the Red October.\" I don't know if you remember that great movie, Jason, where the bad sub captain shoots the torpedoes against Sean Connery's submarine and he makes a mistake and they circle back to sink his own sub.  The Russian collusion hoax which Gregg documented amazingly is now going to sink the DNC and A.G Barr is like a honey badger who is never going to give up. He is going to get to the bottom of who spied on us in the campaign and in the White House illegally, Jason.",

Now, we need to remember, the first calls by the Democrats for the Trump impeachment came within days after his election in 2016. The very day after the 2018 election made Jerry Nadler judiciary chairman, he was overheard by a reporter on a train already plotting out their impeachment strategy. The only problem they have is there is no \"there\" there. And but that is not going to stop them from doing everything they can from now until the 2020 election to perpetuate this monstrous lie that has been now so thoroughly debunked.",

But it's not going to stay encouraging unless the Democrats talk about what the American people care about. Not what the main stream media is doing or the left wing politicians?",

And author of \"Why We Fight,\" radio host Sebastian Gorka. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us tonight. Sebastian, I want to start with you, because this boomerang that is now in place with the Mueller report coming up empty, that thing is going to come right back in to the face of the Democrats based on what we can tell that the Department of Justice is pursuing. That is the origins of this case. SEBASTIAN GORKA, AUTHOR, \"WHY WE FIGHT\": Exactly right, Jason. It's clear from this disastrous testimony by Bob Mueller who disgraced himself and the FBI that there are ongoing investigations that are looking into the real genesis of Operation Crossfire Hurricane, and how this illegal surveillance against the Trump campaign actually occurred and who was behind it. It's exactly like I have a good friend Chris Platte who has a morning show here in D.C. He says it's like the last scene from \"The Hunt for the Red October.\" I don't know if you remember that great movie, Jason, where the bad sub captain shoots the torpedoes against Sean Connery's submarine and he makes a mistake and they circle back to sink his own sub. The Russian collusion hoax which Gregg documented amazingly is now going to sink the DNC and A.G Barr is like a honey badger who is never going to give up.

They didn't do that in this particular case. I suspect the information is a tape-recorded conversation between Papadopoulos and either the confidential informant, Stephan Halper, or the Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, because both of them it appeared to Papadopoulos were tape-recording the conversation, when they meet Papadopoulos, they have the cell phone in hand and they are playing around with it here. And then they put it down next to Papadopoulos, obviously recording. And the information contained therein is likely exculpatory. The government didn't turn it over to Papadopoulos' lawyer. And Papadopoulos' mention in the FISA warrant application to spy on Carter Page. If that is exculpatory, they had a duty to tell the FISA court and they didn't do it."

Remember, Christopher Steele said, I have very good ties in Moscow. He served in Moscow as an intelligence officer and this man admitted in a British court, Jason, I hate Donald Trump. His propaganda information from his Russian contacts was used in that falsified dossier to acquire the warrant. And the FBI, Obama's FBI hid the exculpatory evidence that this was opposition research. That is a crime. Gregg nailed it. It's an absolute crime. It's abuse of power.

And that is this idea that they are going to issue a subpoena on Don McGahn to compel testimony in front of his committee. Now, I've got to tell you, having been a chairman, if I issued a subpoena on Neil Eggleston, then Obama's general counsel, the media would have laughed me off the planet. There would have been editorials about that. You don't have the ability to compel testimony from a general counsel to a president to appear before Congress."

But the other -- I mean, their argument seems to be oh the privilege was waived because McGahn talked to the special counsel. That is ludicrous and here is why. He is talking to a member in the same branch of government, the executive branch, the special counsel. This is Congress, where the executive privilege is not waived but it attaches."

Our founders designed a democracy governed by the people, not a monarchy. Now, I've got to tell you, having served in Congress, the trading of funds within accounts happens by the billions of dollars and it does every year and Nancy Pelosi has been complicit in that for decades. For her to put out the tweet is totally irresponsible and it's not right, because she knows and she has been complicit trading funds herself. Here with more reaction are some congressmen who I served with in previous life when I was in Congress, Congressman Andy Biggs of Arizona, Congressman Tom McClintock of California, and Congressman Michael Waltz who I didn't serve with but a great guy from Florida and I appreciate all three of the congressmen here are joining us tonight. I want to talk about the Supreme Court ruling, because it really will have an impact; particularly, on your state, all of your states. But really let's start with you, Congressman Biggs. Arizona needs this wall. The president has been fighting for it. I think you have been supportive and fighting for it. Tell us what the ruling means in Arizona."

What that means since you have the vast majority of illegal drugs that are coming across are coming across our border, that's going to help slow that down and that's good for the entire country. So, I was so pleased with that. I did get a hoot from Nancy Pelosi, when basically it's her allies and circus that took this up and sued the president in the first place to prevent this. Then when he appeals to the court and wins, all of a sudden, you have a judicial monarchy, you know? That is kind of humorous."

And now, it means we can actually use the funds to defend our own border. I was with the president when he was explicit in his instructions to the commander of the Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for the project. He wants 400 miles of new or replaced fencing by the end of next year. I think now, he's going to get it."

It's perfectly reasonable. It's perfectly legal what, you know, befuddles me is that Democrats have said now for months if not years this is not a crisis. We shouldn't be shifting funds. Congress after Congress has kicked the can. I don't like that we have to use defense funding to do this but nobody else is solving the problem. And so, for the president to shift funds, which the Supreme Court now upheld, when we have over 1 million people -- we are on track to have over 1 million people flood over the border from 60 different countries, it's a humanitarian crisis, a national security crisis. We know terrorist groups, any pathway that will move drugs and people will also move weapons and individuals. And I think this is absolutely appropriate and within his authority as commander-in-chief, which we have now upheld despite what Speaker Pelosi may tweet by the Supreme Court, and their interpretation of the law."

In fact, I think it is now proving the point more and more what Donald Trump always said there was no collusion and there was no obstruction. But they are just so focused on impeachment. They are essentially doing impeachment, aren't they?"

That is where the Democrats all are. They are in the cul-de-sac. The rest of the country has gone forward. As soon as Mueller let out the report the rest of the country went forward and said so what? That is what happened this week with the Mueller hearing. We're on a track with the president and his policies, the economy is growing and doing well. We've got to take care of the immigration stuff. But the Democrats are over there in the cul-de-sac; particularly, Nadler, Schiff and Cummings and the various groups that want to just keep investigating the committees in Congress that want to keep investigating. It's a problem. Yes."

The Air Force calls it target fixation. That's when a pilot gets so fixated on the target, he forgets to fly his airplane and ends up crashing into a mountain. Now, we need to remember, the first calls by the Democrats for the Trump impeachment came within days after his election in 2016. The very day after the 2018 election made Jerry Nadler judiciary chairman, he was overheard by a reporter on a train already plotting out their impeachment strategy. The only problem they have is there is no \"there\" there. And but that is not going to stop them from doing everything they can from now until the 2020 election to perpetuate this monstrous lie that has been now so thoroughly debunked."

This is going to surprise Austan and perhaps you. I've got a lot of respect for Nancy Pelosi. I may not agree with her, hope she is not the speaker next time, but she is a very capable, experienced and a very able legislator. She likes to say that herself but it is true.

Those people challenging in the primaries, the incumbents or the moderates you end up putting in extremists in totally red states like Missouri, Indiana, now Alabama, West Virginia, the Democrats start winning and the Republican Party as a whole suffered because they had ideologically pure component.

Why it took seven months? I don't get that but nevertheless. Let me move to a slightly different part of this topic here, Governor. On the one hand, Nancy Pelosi will routinely say she believes that Donald Trump is essentially under the control of the Russians. But she is not in favor of impeachment.

I really think the media was \"A,\" disappointed and just so frustrated they didn't get what they wanted.

And as far as disappointment, you are right about that because this has been the fuel for the media over the last two and a half years. Let me give you some stats 8,500 stories on the Russia probe just by \"The New York Times,\" \"Washington Post,\" CNN and MSNBC. 530,000 web articles on Russia, Trump, and Mueller. 245 million interactions including likes and comments shares on the social media giant such as Twitter and Facebook.

You know when I got in to the news business 20, 25 years ago, I got into it because I believed in the truth and I believed in exposing people who are doing things that were wrong. There is something going on here where you have an alarming number of reporters in the national political media who have no interest whatsoever in exposing the truth. They are willing to take the direction of Democrats, they are so blinded by the hatred of Donald Trump, they will take -- they will take any bogus story hook, line and sinker and they will absolutely run with it to the ends of earth in order to destroy this President. And even a few years ago, you know, places like \"The Washington Post,\" and \"The New York Times,\" you know, you know you knew that they leaned left.

      "utterance": "Yes. At this point they seem to be in a meltdown, the Democrats. They don't know to which direction they are going in and what they are going to do? And the media also can't figure out what direction to take this story because they had invested so heavily over the last two and a half years?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Right. Yesterday, you follow boxing? That was a TKO that we saw on this story. The problem that Democrats have is that most polls show that 80-85% of Democrats want impeachment now but independents, which Doug knows is very important, when it comes to elections--"

      "utterance": "--right, exactly. And obviously, the Republicans are not on board if you don't have the bipartisan buy-in, and you can't do it. But they don't know how to tell that to the base, to the AOC's, \"The Squads\" and everybody who watches MSNBC and CNN that this thing is over because it can't be done."

    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "I don't think it matters, quite frankly. I think that this whole impeachment thing has become sort of like a zombie that Nancy Pelosi can't kill. It's going to haunt all of them. You watch. People like Jerry Nadler are going to get opponents, Democratic primary opponents from the left accusing them of not pushing hard enough for impeachment. It's going to be a slow, ongoing disaster."

      "utterance": "Charlie, Joe, Doug, thank you for joining us tonight. Coming up, police officers in New York City are under assault. And almost nothing is being done about it. Trace Gallagher has the latest. And then we'll get reaction from Larry Elder and Manny Gomez. Stay with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to this “Hannity” special. The left's day of reckoning. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio is polling at just1% in his ridiculous bid the Democratic Presidential nomination. Maybe that is because he is completely lost control of his city. The latest example is a slew of water dousing assaults against the police taking place across New York a number of videos showing flagrantly disrespectful of views putting officers in danger. Joining us now is Chief Breaking News Correspondent Trace Gallagher who has the latest on these disturbing attacks. Trace?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "And Jason, there are now four videos of the New York police officers being doused with water. And critics say you can expect to see a lot more because people apparently believe its fine to soak the cops. President Trump calls it tragic and says when he first saw an officer get hit in the head with a bucket he had to watch it again because he didn't believe it. The President then went after New York Democratic Mayor Bill De Blasio watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Probably the worst Mayor in the history of New York City. The policemen and women cannot stand him. They don't respect him. They don't like him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "We should note Mayor De Blasio also called the dousing of cops unacceptable and said it wouldn't be tolerated. Meantime in the wake of the fourth video the union representing New York police sergeants says the dousing could become dangerous and is now demanding that the New York Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill step down. O'Neill has not yet responded. Finally, our corporate in \"The New York Post\" is reporting that the suspects arrested for attacking police with the water buckets are already out of jail and back on the streets. And that includes a well-known member of the Krispy Streetgang. Jason."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Great. Trace, thank you very much. Joining us now for reactions Salem Nationally Syndicated Radio Host Larry Elder and Former FBI Special Agent Manny Gomez who I also would report is also a Former NYPD. I appreciate the service that you have given our country. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us here tonight. Manny, I want to go to you when I see these videos, it is disgusting. It makes me so mad that these punks are allowed to get away with this, they are cheered on within the community, and the Mayor has lost control of them. The police chief is not doing enough. These police officers, I mean, they should not have to put up with this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANNY GOMEZ, FORMER FBI SPECIAL AGENT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, unequivocally, the Police Department is the first line and the last line of defense. If they don't feel confident enough that they could defend themselves how could they feel confident enough to defend the rest of us? So this is appalling. As somebody who has served in the NYPD for many years, years ago, this was not an action that would have been condoned. It would absolutely, unequivocally never have escalated to where it did. So we need to really revisit the progressive views of City Hall and other administrations. Not only in this city but throughout the country and try to curtail the violence that is going on against police officers which obviously if it's going on against law enforcement, it is going to happen to the citizens we in home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Now Larry, obviously, this is a result of the Mayor's position and his progressive views as Manny was saying. When you watch this, what should happen? What should be the reaction from police?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONALLY SYNDICATED HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I tell you, Jason, when I watch this, my reaction is young men who are raised with fathers in the home do not act like this. This is about the breakdown of the nuclear family the fact that the welfare state has incentivized women to marry the government and so many of our kids, especially people of color are raised without fathers. You're raised with a responsible father and responsible mother in the home, you don't engage in that kind of behavior. The other part of course is the anti-cop rhetoric on the people on the left. Obama said that the Cambridge police acted stupidly. They did not. He accused the Ferguson Police Department being institutionally racist, it is not. The NYPD for crying out loud, majority of the officers are people of color. So knock it off. These are people that are trying to keep us safe and you treat them like this. This is outrageous it's all starts in the home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Manny, I have got to tell you, I watched these videos and I can't believe these police officers actually have the discipline to just sit there and take it. We don't pay them enough. They shouldn't have to put up with this humiliation. They got to be able to do their job and to protect themselves. Who knows what they could be dousing them with? It may be water today may be something else later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOMEZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Today is water. Then it's exacerbated perhaps, explosive devices, Pneumonia, Clorox, Firearm. We had numerous police officers assassinated in their own vehicles and cold blood in the last couple of years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "That's right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOMEZ",
      "utterance": "Why does this stop from this violence against police officers to happen? They were doing nothing but their jobs, protecting the citizenry of New York City. Yet, they were disrespected and assaulted accordingly. Like the way -- like the way they were. This needs to stop and we need to protect our police officers and our citizens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Larry, I hear your message about making sure that there is responsibility and respect within the home. But from a Police Department, Police Chief a Mayor, what should be that message?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "Well, the message is we are here to help you. We are not the villain we're not the enemy for crying out loud. There was just a study published in the official journal of The National Academy of Sciences, researcher looked at every single police shooting that took place in 2015 and the race of the officer had nothing whatever to do with the shooting. Everything had to do with the criminal behavior of the suspect. Knock it off. We are here to help and we are the thin line between you and the bad guys. Give us little respect over here. We are not asking for too much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, these police officers do work. Thank you, Manny, for your service. Larry, Manny, thank you. We'll be right back with some final thoughts on this special edition of “Hannity.”"

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of “Hannity.” the left's day of reckoning. Unfortunately that's all the time we have left this evening.
