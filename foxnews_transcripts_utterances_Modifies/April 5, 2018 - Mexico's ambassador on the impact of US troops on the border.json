So, breaking tonight, President Trump calling up to 4,000 members of our national guard to the border to help keep the peace along that southern line. He is also extending a bit of an olive branch to Mexican leaders offering some concessions on NAFTA, but a fierce ultimatum is delivered with it. If Mexico wants to keep that lucrative trade deal intact, the United States will build the wall with some help from our military, he said, and he would like the help of Mexico as well. As you know, the president also hearkens back to his first campaign statement today and basically doubled down. He's now facing the threat of losing NAFTA. They are in Mexico -- from the leaders of Mexico and Canada. They once threatened to walk out of NAFTA negotiations, but the whole thing is starting to sound a bit different this evening. So, joining me now is Geronimo Gutierrez, Mexico's Ambassador to the United States. Ambassador, thank you very much for being here. It's good to have you with us tonight.",

In the case of the caravan, I think it's important to point out that the Mexican authorities have proceeded according with our own immigration policies. The so-called 'caravan', which is not a new event has pretty much concluded or will be concluding any time now. Some of its members by their own will have decided to finish the caravan and again, Mexican authorities have been in contact with the U.S. for this purpose. I think that the caravan does call the attention to an important point which is that we must work better together to coordinate our migration and our asylum policies.

There are clearly some tough issues to tackle, but the latest reports do show progress. We have made ground on NAFTA. A deal needs to be a deal for all the parties in order to work, and that's what we're precisely trying to accomplish. That is precisely the message that President Pena Nieto has made very clear today.

In this letter to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Congressman Mark Meadows and Congressman Jim Jordan who sit on the House Government Oversight Committee have more information about an exchange between FBI employees about who and what gets redacted before records are sent to the Hill. FBI employee one, 'Are you sure you want me to keep you redacted for the congressional production?' FBI employee two responds, 'Is that an option?' FBI employee one adds, 'Smiley face emoji, you will be redacted.' In a separate development, text messages between FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI Lawyer Lisa Page indicate that Strzok traveled to London, England in early August 2016 to interview a key witness just days after the FBI opened an investigation into alleged contact between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The two FBI officials appeared to debate amongst themselves about what they will share with their superiors of the Justice Department when Strzok returns to Washington, D.C. Strzok writes, \"I think we need to consider the lines of what we disclosed to DOJ. For example, the land stipulation notes, we will not disclose.\"   We also learned today more information about the firing last month of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. An investigative source tells Fox News that there were three violations of the FBI's ethics code first uncovered by the Justice Department inspector general, and then backed up by the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility. They include 'lack of candor under oath', 'lack of candor not under oath', as well as the 'improper disclosure of nonpublic information to the media' -- in this case, it was about the existence of the FBI Clinton Foundation investigation. In a statement to Fox News late today: McCain's attorney accused lawmakers on the Hill of selective leaks designed to discredit his client and pit McCabe against his old boss, Director James Comey.",

And if you look at the seven states, including Oklahoma, around our state, we are now -- we've gone for being seventh to now second in the region in the highest teacher pay. Plus, we've had really good benefits for health care and retirement, and our retirement system is in great shape for our teachers, which can't be said in other states. And then, we allocated an extra $50 million, $33 million for new textbooks, and $17 million on top of that for whatever the schools want to use it for that are going to our state funding formula. The complaint has been, it's not enough, we want more. It was $480 million. And as the teacher just said, we're pushing all our teachers -- we don't mind them coming to the capital. I think it's important that they come to capital and talk to their legislators. I wish they'd been there a lot earlier over the last three years I've tried to get a pay raise.

And, the gentleman mentioned, the teacher mentioned that we finally got some revenue increases to be able to pay for this. We have a law in Oklahoma that is actually constitutional amendment that says we have to have 75 percent of all of our legislative voters -- legislative members, excuse me, to vote on increasing any type of revenue. So, it's been a hard lift. And, you know, my comment was, look, we know it's not enough, but it's a giant step forward. It's a $6,100 average increase in teacher pay. For our teachers it's $50 million new dollars going into textbooks and also into the state. Is it everything that they wanted? No. We know they want more, but it's what we can do for right now, and I think it's a giant step forward.",

He is also extending a bit of an olive branch to Mexican leaders offering some concessions on NAFTA, but a fierce ultimatum is delivered with it. If Mexico wants to keep that lucrative trade deal intact, the United States will build the wall with some help from our military, he said, and he would like the help of Mexico as well. As you know, the president also hearkens back to his first campaign statement today and basically doubled down. He's now facing the threat of losing NAFTA. They are in Mexico -- from the leaders of Mexico and Canada. They once threatened to walk out of NAFTA negotiations, but the whole thing is starting to sound a bit different this evening.

The central point, Martha, is that we do believe that it is in the interest of both nations to have secure borders. We don't always agree on how to achieve that objective, but we do believe that our cooperation is valuable and we want to keep it going so long as it is respectful and it works for both sides."

      "speaker": "GUTIERREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, this is not the first time that the National Guard has been at the border. It's not something that we welcome. We understand the president's objective of securing borders and we are and favors of securing borders, but we believe that we can achieve a lot through cooperation. And in fact, we kept very good cooperation with the different security agencies on the U.S., both on immigration and trafficking drugs, and basically all of organized crime."

They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. We need a wall. And I know today he said that he was appreciative that the caravans have been disbanded. So, it looks like that rhetoric has cooled a little bit. Can you explain to us what you did to disband that caravan and where exactly those people went?"

      "speaker": "GUTIERREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I would like to differ from the president's position in the sense that Mexico does do a lot to have a secure, legal, safe, and orderly migration. We're all for that. If you look at some of the numbers of people from Central American countries that we have repatriated, you will get a completely different story. In the case of the caravan, I think it's important to point out that the Mexican authorities have proceeded according with our own immigration policies. The so-called 'caravan', which is not a new event has pretty much concluded or will be concluding any time now. Some of its members by their own will have decided to finish the caravan and again, Mexican authorities have been in contact with the U.S. for this purpose. I think that the caravan does call the attention to an important point which is that we must work better together to coordinate our migration and our asylum policies. And just last week or a few weeks ago, Secretary Nielsen visited Mexico and we worked precisely on those sorts of issues."

Are you saying that, that -- is that policy going to change?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTIERREZ",
      "utterance": "That is clearly not the case. Mexico does not advocate nor promote undocumented immigration by our nationals or from any other country. We do believe that migration policies should be humane and that's what we're doing. And at the same time, as it happens with any demonstration in Mexico, public officials provide security for the people that are involved and for both parties, and that's precisely what we need in this occasion."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

There's also an indication tonight, it looked like an agreement was coming together and that it might be announced next week in Peru. But now, the president seems to be backing off of that as well saying, basically, well, we'll see and we're going to give the time it needs. What's your understanding on that, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTIERREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, both sides, Martha, are attacking difficult issues. NAFTA is 25-years-old. We do agree that it can be improved, updated, modernized, but we believe that it has been very beneficial for the two countries. Mexico is interested in having North America remain a very competitive region. We are certainly -- share the view that we must do better to bring more jobs into North America, and that's the intent of the teams that are negotiating. There are clearly some tough issues to tackle, but the latest reports do show progress. We have made ground on NAFTA. A deal needs to be a deal for all the parties in order to work, and that's what we're precisely trying to accomplish. That is precisely the message that President Pena Nieto has made very clear today. And I hope we do get a chance to prove that because that would be in the interest of the United States as much as in Mexico. A successful Mexico is as much in the interest of the United States as a successful United States is in the interest of Mexico and that is precisely what we're trying to accomplish with NAFTA."

FBI employee one, 'Are you sure you want me to keep you redacted for the congressional production?' FBI employee two responds, 'Is that an option?' FBI employee one adds, 'Smiley face emoji, you will be redacted.' In a separate development, text messages between FBI Agent Peter Strzok and FBI Lawyer Lisa Page indicate that Strzok traveled to London, England in early August 2016 to interview a key witness just days after the FBI opened an investigation into alleged contact between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The two FBI officials appeared to debate amongst themselves about what they will share with their superiors of the Justice Department when Strzok returns to Washington, D.C.

      "utterance": "So, you know, let's unravel this a bit. So, it appears according to your book that John Brennan contacted Harry Reid. And then, Harry Reid, wrote a letter in August of 2016 after the DNC convention, saying evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government and Donald Trump's presidential campaign continues to mount. And you also say that Reid had the impression that Brennan had ulterior motive. He concluded the CIA believed that the public needed to know about the Russian operation including the information about the possible links to the Trump campaign."

    {
      "speaker": "ISIKOFF",

People on all sides find material that supports their case or that they didn't know and they think is relevant, and this is probably an example. But yes, Harry Reid wrote a letter to James Comey -- he was trying to get Comey to investigate what he believed where these connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians. He, at this point, has been briefed by Brennan. Now, that briefing by Brennan was not just for Harry Reid, he was briefing all the congressional leaders at that point. The gang of eight, the intelligence community, the intelligence committee chiefs and the leaders of the Senate and the house. Their Reid briefing was significant because Reid acts on it and he believes that Brennan is trying to get him to prod Comey to investigate. Now, you can look at that as anti-Trump bias, there's no question that Harry Reid is a fierce partisan and was a supporter of Hillary Clinton. But there's also - - there were legitimate concerns within the CIA, the FBI, and anybody who's getting these briefings about the prospect that Kremlin cutouts were trying to influence and insinuate themselves in a major American presidential campaign. And that's a legitimate counterintelligence concern."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "OK. But all that circles back to the question of what the evidence was and what they were basing that on, and whether or not John Brennan had any sort of political motivation to say to Harry Reid, hey, I think you better go over there and bug Jim Comey about this because we really want this to be lit up. We want stories to be written about it, we want congressional members to be fired up about it. On October 30th, Reid writes to Comey, it has 'become clear that you possessed explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government'. I mean, what is that explosive information? I mean, what we know about the Carter Page thing that led nowhere and now we know that there's, you know, after a year of investigating this, Robert Mueller himself said there's no criminal target for President Trump. So, what explosive information was Harry Reid talking about, Michael?"

In the other hands, Republicans say -- thinks this is, you know, this is a liberal group. And I have to tell you, I think it is a liberal group. I think it tilts to the left. But, there are a lot of people there who know they tilt to the left, and they're trying to, you know, adjust on that. At least, take (INAUDIBLE). But, look, we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. This is technology that can be used for great social good. A little bit like the invention of fire here. It is used, it is consequential. I hope it's a serious hearing. And I have a feeling that he is going to accept responsibility. I've found him to be a humble guy who actually listens. He's got two ears and one mouth and uses them in those proportions. He listened, I thought, very carefully to me and other people, and I was impressed by it.

      "utterance": "Well, look, we passed the largest increase in educational funding ever in Oklahoma's history, a 19 percent increase in the total budget for educational loans, which is over 50 percent of the state budget, and we gave our teachers a 15 to 18 percent pay increase. And if you look at the seven states, including Oklahoma, around our state, we are now -- we've gone for being seventh to now second in the region in the highest teacher pay. Plus, we've had really good benefits for health care and retirement, and our retirement system is in great shape for our teachers, which can't be said in other states. And then, we allocated an extra $50 million, $33 million for new textbooks, and $17 million on top of that for whatever the schools want to use it for that are going to our state funding formula. The complaint has been, it's not enough, we want more. It was $480 million. And as the teacher just said, we're pushing all our teachers -- we don't mind them coming to the capital. I think it's important that they come to capital and talk to their legislators. I wish they'd been there a lot earlier over the last three years I've tried to get a pay raise. But, the fact of the matter is, this has been going on for a long period of time. Decades upon decades upon decades that we've had trouble with underfunding of our teacher's salaries. And, frankly, our economy has grown so much we have 50,000 more students in our school system over the last ten years because new jobs were re-created. So, yes, we do need some more funding for classrooms, but that's also an abhor property tax issue with the local school board, to the local voters who decide those things. It's a priority decision upon what you've paid for."

      "utterance": "$26 a barrel. It's been a tough go. But now we're slowly, but surely, climbing out of that. And so, we've did see a great need. We've tried to get this hurdle past. And, the gentleman mentioned, the teacher mentioned that we finally got some revenue increases to be able to pay for this. We have a law in Oklahoma that is actually constitutional amendment that says we have to have 75 percent of all of our legislative voters -- legislative members, excuse me, to vote on increasing any type of revenue. So, it's been a hard lift. And, you know, my comment was, look, we know it's not enough, but it's a giant step forward. It's a $6,100 average increase in teacher pay. For our teachers it's $50 million new dollars going into textbooks and also into the state. Is it everything that they wanted? No. We know they want more, but it's what we can do for right now, and I think it's a giant step forward."

So, it sounds like you're trying to get it there, and I hope you guys can, you know, work this out because I'm sure you want the kids to go back to school and I'm sure the parents want them to go back to school."

But I think teachers do want to go back to classrooms. I've met with a lot of teachers this week.

So, they may have gone to Washington with hopes of, you know, Mr. Smith and draining the swamp, but some of these brand-new congressmen who let some cameras follow them around say, wow, this is not what we signed up for. REP. ROD BLUM, R—IOWA: You said it's only $7 billion, can we move on? Where I come from, Iowa, we ran our entire state budget to $7 million in a year. I said that's a lot of money.

There is an incentive to get to yes, to be on the team. Now, why do you want to be on the team while you're here? Well, because that's going to help you do what? Win reelection. It's going to help you run for governor. It's going to help you run for the United States senate. It's going to help you be the next speaker of the house. Those to me are not the correct incentives, because nowhere in what I just said is out of the word, the people. The incentive should be all about the people we represent.
