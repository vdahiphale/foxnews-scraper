      "utterance": " All right.  Welcome to Hannity.  Busy night tonight.  We are tracking several big breaking stories, including new information on the FISA abuse report.  Fallout surrounding another massive lie from oh, the president calls her Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren as she's now almost as bad at lying as your corrupt media mob and even the congenital liar, yeah, the corrupt compromised Adam Schiff.  We're going to tell you all about a new investigation also into creepy sleepy quid pro quo Joe and a lot of details. But first, in tonight's monologue, we start with a closer look at the mainstream media mob, and they are a mob, and their allies in the Democratic Party, because over the past week we have witnessed more of the same.  Madness now consumes pretty much 99 percent of media in this country.  Now, to be a Democrat, or part of the mob, there's no objective truth in your, \"rage Trump every second of every day,\" world.  You have to be a member.  You have to have zero intellectual honesty, selective moral outrage only, no common sense, no reason, and breathtaking hypocrisy. Now, the mob's nonstop coverage of the congenital liar, Schiff, and his impeachment charade -- it wasn't just maddening, it was also full of lies and outright propaganda, misinformation.  They spent an entire week digging for evidence that doesn't just exist and, predictably, breathlessly [sound effect] hyping up testimony filled with, let's see, conflicting, confusing statements, almost all of it on hearsay conjecture.  And what are people's opinions about a transcript?  We don't need their interpretation, because we actually get to read it ourselves and decide for ourselves.  None of it would be admissible or ever count in evidence in a real court of law.  Here is a small sample of how sick, ugly, twisted, and despicable they really are.  Take a look."

Now, you're not getting a billion dollars unless you fire the prosecutor who've investigating my zero-experience son.  \"Wow, you're not getting the billion unless you fire that guy, because you're investigating him.\"  There's no experience, and he's making millions and millions of dollars. Now, stop for a second.  How can the same people all last week, and the mob, and the media -- how can the same people in the news industry -- they're journalists -- be so outraged at President Trump for doing nothing, zip, yet totally, completely ignore the biggest slam-dunk case of what they say that they are so outraged about?  You have to ignore the indisputable fact that Hunter Biden -- he was making millions and millions of dollars, saving on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian oil and gas company.  You have to ignore the fact that Hunter had zero experience in oil, gas, energy, or Ukraine.  You'd have to ignore the fact that Hunter Biden was hired just weeks after his father was appointed to lead the White House policy in Ukraine.  You have to ignore the fact that Vice President Joe Biden leveraged a billion tax dollars, and bragging about it, to force out a Ukrainian prosecutor, the same one investigating his son.  That is all -- that -- none of that is in dispute.  But the mob and the media said, \"This is one big -- this is only a conspiracy theory.  Nobody has ever really proven it.  Nobody's investigated it.\"  We are, and we're going to get to the bottom of it.  Take a look."

Now, I say, \"mob and the media,\" for a reason.  They are a mob with a mob mentality and a mob mindset.  They don't care about their breathtaking hypocrisy, obviously.  Their hatred of Trump -- all that is superior to everything else.  They don't care about the lies that they're telling, the propaganda they're spreading, the conspiracy theories they're spinning, the hoaxes that they continue to perpetrate: one right after another, after another, after another, because they're in their little bubble, little echo chamber.  There's the whole rest of the country that doesn't live in D.C., New York, L.A., and San Francisco.  And their bubble is filled with every second, minute, hour, of every 24-hour day Trump rage, psychosis, venom. And that has resulted in this endless stream of fake hysteria, lying, propaganda, misinformation, smearing, slander, distortion, and everything in between.  They have been crying wolf for three long years.  And, by the way, they've not done a thing for you.  We, the American people, not one thing have these people done except bring us to the brink of impeachment.  Wow, take a look."

And, if it wasn't so sick, it’s actually pretty funny.  It’s very entertaining to me.  In order to deflect from their own constant lying and their own conspiracies and their own hoaxes, well -- and, of course, their anti-Trump bias every second of the day -- they just lie, and more and more they claim others are guilty of what they do every day, all day.  So, we’ve got a real crisis of information in the country, make no mistake.  Fake-news CNN; Area 51 -- yes, Roswell Rachel Maddow’s conspiracy network -- MSDNC, a whole channel that tries to duplicate what she does.  They have zero fidelity to truth, zero fidelity to truth and nothing but the truth, to the rule of law; equal justice under the law; equal application of the laws; equal application of standards -- Joe and Hunter.  That’s why it is up to us, I guess. Fine, they’ll leave it to us, the number-one show on cable news, thanks to all of you.  We will remind them that Ukrainian interference in the 2016 elections actually happened.  That’s why we will vet quid pro quo Joe and Hunter and the rest of the radical extreme socialist Democratic field.  They’ll never do it.  That’s why it’ll be up to us to call out, yes, the compromised, the corrupt, the congenital liar Schiff and the Schiff show for what it really is: just another effort to smear President Trump, undo a duly elected president, and, by the way, we’ll kick it all off with either hearsay or opinion witnesses and a hearsay non-whistleblower whistleblower who was communicating, apparently, with Schiff’s office early on. Look at this report.  January 2017, Washington Times.  This individual might have actually benefited from one of President Obama’s final directives.  Wow.  Doing to the next president that which you didn’t want in your administration, giving whistleblowers new protections against the executive branch.  This came in the final weeks of the Obama presidency, and as a Washington Times columnist put it, quote, “This is in stark contrast to when he entered office in 2009.”  And Obama waged a war against this community, and his administration prosecuted nine whistleblowers under the 1917 Espionage Act, more than double that of all other previous administrations combined. But the mob -- “Well, President Trump is bad, and, well, Obama is a saint.”  Again, it’s crystal-clear.  They have an agenda, zero fidelity to truth, an unwavering allegiance to their own far, extreme, leftwing socialist agenda.  And now, he’s a congressman vowing to take the Daily Beast and fake-news CNN to court, House Intel Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes.  I’ve got to be honest, I know more about this than maybe you want me to reveal, so I will let you say it in your own words.  I saw the report about you; I happen to know a lot of it is outright lies.  Now, what are you planning to do?"

So, we put out a very clear statement after the story came out on Friday night saying it’s demonstrably false, total fake news, and I will tell you, Sean, for all of the last three years, including the Russia hoax to the Ukraine hoax, this is the mother of all fake news stories.  There is not one bigger than this.  And so, next week we are going to take them to court.  They will have an opportunity to come to court so that they’re -- we can subpoena each other; we can get discovery; we can sit people down for depositions.  And I have a bet for you, Sean, CNN and the Daily Beast are going to run for cover.  They’re going to fight this.  They’re not going to show up in court.  They’re not going to accept service.  So, look, it’s -- but at the end of the day, I’m going to track them down, and I’m going to hold them accountable, because this is --"

Also, tonight support for impeachment is plummeting, especially among independents.  that's why one Washington Post reporter is actually claiming Democrats on the Hill -- they're starting to get cold feet about this whole impeachment vote.  Told you last week was a disaster.  While Republican support for the president has solidified, Democrats are running scared.  Here with more, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy.  I will say this, and I've been hard on your Republicans when they're weak, and they were weak -- 65 show votes on repeal and replace, Congressman.  But last week was a week that I actually said, “Wow, they’re -- they did amazing.”  You should be very proud as their leader."
