Russian tensions spiking, the Pentagon defending the timing of its aid to Ukraine that's still coming, all of it as Russian invasion could be nearing.  Hello, and welcome, everyone. I'm Sandra Smith, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" President Biden holding a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. So what are we learning about that? And what did come from it?  Let's talk to Mark Meredith. He's live in Washington. He's got the latest details from that call. Hi, Mark.",

Moments ago, Ukraine's president tweeted out his thoughts on the call he had today with President Biden, President Zelensky saying he thanked the U.S. for its ongoing military assistance, and that the two leaders also discussed the potential for more financial support. We're still waiting for the official readout that will come from the White House. But earlier today, we also heard from the Russians, who said that there is -- quote -- \"little ground for optimism,\" despite all of the continued diplomatic efforts from everyone involved. The Pentagon says, in the last few hours, it has seen a continued buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine. That's after U.S. officials sent Russia a formal response rejecting its request to ban Ukraine from joining NATO.   Russian officials say they are still, though, reviewing the full U.S. response. Also today, U.S. officials say they remain convinced an invasion into Ukraine could still come at any time. At least 8,500 U.S. troops remain on alert to potentially deploy to Eastern Europe. They would be assisting NATO. This afternoon, our Pentagon correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, pressed officials, though, if the U.S. was waiting too long to provide much needed support to Ukraine.",

Because, look, the NATO charter itself, on extension, says that you have to have resolved all your internal disputes from ethnic groups or religious groups and all border disputes, neither of which Ukraine has done. And so it would be not in our interests to bring Ukraine in. And that is the primary issue that's driving Russia.

A procession of NYPD vehicles led the way for his casket to arrive here at the cathedral from the Bronx earlier this morning. He was well-greeted by bagpipes and honored by 200 NYPD officers, who saluted him as his casket was brought into the cathedral flag-draped, but with the NYPD logo. Rivera and his 27-year-old partner, Wilbert Mora, were ambushed, shot and killed responding to a domestic dispute. Since 1:00 p.m., hundreds of fellow officers and New Yorkers have been lined up. In fact, reportedly, up to 1,800 mourners per hour were let inside the cathedral to pay their respects to the 22-year-old officer and his family. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain himself, arrived this afternoon just after 3:00 p.m. And he delivered this message before he arrived at the cathedral. Listen.",

I think the other thing, the reports today, GDP reports today, sort of confirmed all this. To be fair, the president finally met one of his quarterly economic projections. It's the first since he took over the White House. And the numbers have been dumbed down, but he met them. So that's some improvement.

They're watching this crisis go and a president who won't do a thing about it, not acknowledge it, will jump on his plane to fly 3,000 miles to a climate change conference in Europe, but won't turn that plane south to come to the border to see the real crisis that's happening. And it is just so frustrating. And those border agents will tell you there is no end in sight. So, I'm with the governor on this and whole lot of the Texans who are just fed up with this denial of a real crisis.",

Of them so far, we have got the chief justice, Roberts, saying: \"Breyer's an energetic jurist and a dear friend. He has rendered nearly half-a- century of distinguished public service to our country, including 42 years as a federal judge, 27 as a member of this court. His pragmatism, encyclopedic knowledge and varied government experience have enriched the court's deliberations. And his fanciful hypotheticals during oral argument had befuddled counsel and colleagues alike.\" That does go on, but we want to get a couple more in here, with Neil Gorsuch also issuing a state statement, saying: \"For more than 40 years, Justice Breyer served the judiciary with integrity and grace. His deep knowledge of our law, its history, and our government is profound. His good humor is legendary. I will very much miss his wisdom and his wit at our conference table. \"He and Joanna had been fast friends to Louise and me, and we hope to see them often as friends for many years to come. We wish them and their wonderful family every happiness.\" And there are other statements as well, obviously, from Kagan, Sotomayor, Alito, Kavanaugh, and others. And the justices weigh in on his retirement that was just today made official with his -- him speaking at the White House with the president. And the White House today saying being a judge is not a prerequisite for the president's Supreme Court pick. So how will that affect things? Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy joins us now.

We're still waiting for the official readout that will come from the White House. But earlier today, we also heard from the Russians, who said that there is -- quote -- \"little ground for optimism,\" despite all of the continued diplomatic efforts from everyone involved. The Pentagon says, in the last few hours, it has seen a continued buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine. That's after U.S. officials sent Russia a formal response rejecting its request to ban Ukraine from joining NATO. Russian officials say they are still, though, reviewing the full U.S. response. Also today, U.S. officials say they remain convinced an invasion into Ukraine could still come at any time. At least 8,500 U.S. troops remain on alert to potentially deploy to Eastern Europe.

Because, look, the NATO charter itself, on extension, says that you have to have resolved all your internal disputes from ethnic groups or religious groups and all border disputes, neither of which Ukraine has done. And so it would be not in our interests to bring Ukraine in. And that is the primary issue that's driving Russia.

It was in February 2020 that the president, or, at the time, candidate Joe Biden made the commitment that, if given the opportunity, he would nominate the first African-American woman to serve on the Supreme Court. I think that one of the real blights on the history of this great country is the fact that, of all the years, there's never been a black woman even considered for the United States Supreme Court. Here we are, having had five women, two retired, one has passed away, one retired, and three sitting there now, but nobody has even ever talked about putting an African-American woman there. So, when I talked with the president, now-president, then-nominee, candidate, I asked him to take a look at that, and to pledge to do something about that. He took a look. He pledged to do something.

I do know this, that, before she was a district -- a federal district judge, she was a South Carolina circuit judge, before that, a workers comp judge. The state -- she was the deputy director of a state agency. And she has incredible credentials. As a federal district judge, she's president of the Federal Judges Association. And when she was a circuit judge, the state chief justice of the Supreme Court often went to her to sit as a special judge and -- on the Supreme Court. So, she has had tremendous leadership wherever she's been. She was born up there in Detroit, father died when she was 13 years old.

And they are free to travel around the country, wherever they would like to go. And then take a look at this piece of video from Brownsville we shot yesterday. Again, we witnessed more ICE releases of more single adult men. You can see him walking going across the street there. They're being led to a bus terminal by an NGO. Many of them had ankle monitors on. Some of them wanted to shield their faces from our cameras by holding their folders up, as you will see. And a source within ICE tells me these mass releases have discreetly been happening since last year for months now. And he told me that some of the migrants they release have criminal records with misdemeanors, crimes like assault, DUI. Back out here live. I did reach out to ICE this morning to ask them about that. Have they been releasing migrants with misdemeanor records? They didn't deny it.

But, look, this is what it looks like when you have an open border policy, when you don't enforce the law, when you have record number of illegal apprehensions every single month.

They don't talk about it. They don't visit it. They want it to go away. They don't want to explain what they're doing, because I think most reasonable Americans would say, this is crazy. How can you not enforce the law? What the Biden administration will lead you to believe, that this is the only solution is to release these individuals in places like New York and elsewhere. And it's simply not the case. There's other ways to secure that border. We showed the way that you can do it under the Trump administration. And, again, they're choosing not to do that.

And the secretary can no longer lead the men and women of DHS, at least the Border Patrol, in that capacity, because they know they have been in this crisis for now almost 12 months, and there is no end in sight. And there are no policy changes being made. And so DHS leadership can go down to the border and talk to them. But Border Patrol officers and law enforcement, they want action. They don't like words. They will listen to the words, but they want action. And this administration is not delivering any actionable, different policies to secure that border. And Border Patrol knows that.

So it doesn't stay there. And local officials are having to deal with that, and local communities are having to deal with it. So, when we talk about border security, it's not just for those communities along those borders. It's for all Americans. And what we know is that the cartels are using the crisis that we see today to smuggle more and more individuals, some with very criminal records, bad individuals, national security threats, and others, across that border. And so when we talk about operational control of the border, which is what DHS is by law required to have, but yet you see 170,000 illegal apprehensions in one month alone, it's anything but that. And so the department, because of political leadership and decisions that are being made, are not enforcing the law not adhering to the responsibilities that Congress gave them.

And so you have got, I think, a recipe for more inflation, including, by the way, Build Back Better, which is still out there somewhere in the Senate, has over a trillion dollars of tax hikes on businesses that really create disincentives for investing in new plants, new equipment, new technologies that could help us work through this. I think the other thing, the reports today, GDP reports today, sort of confirmed all this. To be fair, the president finally met one of his quarterly economic projections. It's the first since he took over the White House. And the numbers have been dumbed down, but he met them. So that's some improvement. But there are red flags in this report today, as you said, really raising inflation. You have got a massive drop in real disposable income for families. That's another red flag. And then, of course, you have got really just buildup of inventories in this report that, you take that out -- those are temporary and very volatile. Take that out, the economy grew by less than 2 percent. Those -- there's a lot more work that needs to be done to get this economy moving."

I think driving trillions of new government spending as we were already coming out of really the worst part of the pandemic, economically, at least, policies that incentivized people to stay home, I think, was a major problem. I think everything he did to deny inflation was there and to continue to try to pump more money into the economy, which he's continuing to do in this Build Back Better, all of it drives inflation in a big way. What I worry about Sandra, is that, between President Biden and the Fed acting too slowly and to weakly, I really worry that, at some point this year, you and I will be talking about a wage-price spiral that is going to be very, very hard to end.

Many of them grew up there. These are their communities and their neighborhoods. And they're watching. They're watching this crisis go and a president who won't do a thing about it, not acknowledge it, will jump on his plane to fly 3,000 miles to a climate change conference in Europe, but won't turn that plane south to come to the border to see the real crisis that's happening.

      "speaker": "Of them so far, we have got the chief justice, Roberts, saying",
      "utterance": "\"Breyer's an energetic jurist and a dear friend. He has rendered nearly half-a- century of distinguished public service to our country, including 42 years as a federal judge, 27 as a member of this court. His pragmatism, encyclopedic knowledge and varied government experience have enriched the court's deliberations. And his fanciful hypotheticals during oral argument had befuddled counsel and colleagues alike.\""

    {
      "speaker": "That does go on, but we want to get a couple more in here, with Neil Gorsuch also issuing a state statement, saying",
      "utterance": "\"For more than 40 years, Justice Breyer served the judiciary with integrity and grace. His deep knowledge of our law, its history, and our government is profound. His good humor is legendary. I will very much miss his wisdom and his wit at our conference table. \"He and Joanna had been fast friends to Louise and me, and we hope to see them often as friends for many years to come. We wish them and their wonderful family every happiness.\" And there are other statements as well, obviously, from Kagan, Sotomayor, Alito, Kavanaugh, and others. And the justices weigh in on his retirement that was just today made official with his -- him speaking at the White House with the president. And the White House today saying being a judge is not a prerequisite for the president's Supreme Court pick. So how will that affect things? Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy joins us now. Andy, great to see you. You joined us yesterday on the breaking news. So how does that affect things?"

      "speaker": "ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think he's going to obviously pick a judge. I think it's clear that what the president wants to get done here is a confirmation before the midterms. I believe it'll be a confirmation of somebody who's already been confirmed, because that makes it a stronger case. So a judge who's already been confirmed to the court of appeals in recent times, for example, would help to get this done. You're -- it's correct that you don't have to be a judge. You don't even have to be a lawyer. But I think it helps."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "It is remarkable that -- and, by the way, Childs was the prediction and seemed to be the wish of James Clyburn when he joined us at the top of the hour. It appears there are some front-runners, but it appears there are some that are wishing that the person to fill Breyer's seat will be able to obviously garner more bipartisan support. Have you given that some thought, Andy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "I really think -- I hear all kinds of stuff, Sandra, all the time. Every time we get an opening, people talk about there's precedent that's involved, and there are rules that are involved. And we need to get a moderate. We need to get -- they need to get to 51. That's what they need. And I think whoever gets picked is going to be pretty much a replica of Justice Breyer. I don't think in 20 however many years it was that he was on the bench, I don't think he surprised us many, if any times with how he voted. The progressive judges, because they have a different philosophy of what the point of the court is, and that is to advance progressive pieties, they're pretty predictable in how they're going to vote. And as long as they're reasonably satisfied that who they put on the bench will vote that way, then I think what they're going to go for is youth and credentials."

      "speaker": "SMITH",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "They have a lot of political crises. And I imagine that it might be in the back of Justice Breyer's mind that if he waited much longer, there'd be a Republican majority in the Senate after this November because of rising inflation and rising crime and weakness abroad and general dissatisfaction with Joe Biden's presidency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "OK, so what about that, Andy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the timing of this, Sandra, is pretty obvious. I'm sure that Justice Breyer was influenced by the precedent of his friend Justice Kennedy, who left at around the same age that Breyer is. I think Kennedy was 82. Breyer's 83. But he had a president of his party in the White House, the Senate was in the control of his party, and they had a window of opportunity to get somebody who he could look at as somebody who would continue his legacy on the court. And I think that's the main thing. Now, how it got leaked, or the timing of the leak, it seems to me that the White House has eminent reason that they would want to put this out there, so that they could turn the page from some of the other things going on in the country. I just hope that Justice Breyer was on board with that. I hate the idea that, after all these years of service on the court, that he didn't get to choreograph his exit the way he wanted to."

      "speaker": "SMITH",

A particular concern, loads of Russian jet fighters arriving in Belarus for a -- quote, unquote -- \"exercise.\" Belarus is about 60 miles from where we are right now. Experts have told us one possible strategy of Russia could be airstrikes on key infrastructure targets in and around this city of Kyiv. And, so, authorities have identified 5,000 possible bomb shelters in the city of three million. And, yes, some of them are just dusted-off Cold War relics. Take a look."

If a bombing strike looms, sirens will warn building residents to go down there and stay for the duration. It does have electricity, but not much more than that. We're told the place will soon be stocked up with food, water, medical supplies, and could be key to the locals' survival. Take a listen."

The Houston police have put out an official statement saying that the three officers were shot and the suspect has fled the scene in a white Mercedes. They were shot today near Midtown. The officers, as an update, have been taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital. Their condition is unknown at this time, but they are currently looking for the suspect, who, again, fled the scene. Fraternal Order of Police National Vice President Joe Gamaldi. Just horrific that we are reporting on another scene like this, and we pray for those officers."

      "utterance": "It's absolutely terrible, Sandra. We have had 30 -- 346 police officers shot in this country last year, which is the highest number since we started tracking this. The FBI just released data that last year was the highest number of intentional homicides of police officers in the last 20 years. And now we just had three Houston police officers shot. That is the department I work for. It's happening literally 10 miles from where I'm sitting right now. And enough is enough. And we need the community to support police officers right now, because we are in a historic time of violence against us. And what we need is the leaders in all communities and leaders of this country to step up right now. The White House has been suspiciously quiet about violence against law enforcement for entirely too long. The president needs to have a strong rebuke of violence against law enforcement in this country. And the community needs to stand with us. Call your congressman right now and demand that they pass the Protect and Serve Act that will make it a federal crime for people to assault police officers, because we can't continue to go on like this. And if you are a community member and your politicians are continually denigrating and demonizing law enforcement, demand that they stop, because it's costing us our lives."
