Dana Perino. “The Five.” We are 18 months away and the Republicans already have their guy. The Dems they're narrowing their choices down from what a Republican operative called one big socialist organism with 22 heads. Which you assume some of these people actually have heads.  The Democratic Party responds, every time we try to help the underdog, you call it socialism when actually socialism is all about creating underdogs. The Dems have the ends and none of the means promising lots of toys from Santa with they're trying to build a workshop. Which is why at the end of every false promise it's always soaks the rich until there are no rich people left except their rich friends of course.  And it never works because even in a free market you can't bankroll a left- wing money pit. Venezuela was rich once upon a time. But will this next election be another clash between the R's and the D's or not.  Panic hasn't hit the Dems yet because they haven't learned a damn thing from 2016. The lessons are clear. The healthiest whitest swath of America hates politicians and the media who selects them. It's healthy perspective for it opens the door to candidates who don't fit into boxes or change their accent or fake, phony cadences. The Dems when you think about it could use one of these.",

The Dems they're narrowing their choices down from what a Republican operative called one big socialist organism with 22 heads. Which you assume some of these people actually have heads. The Democratic Party responds, every time we try to help the underdog, you call it socialism when actually socialism is all about creating underdogs. The Dems have the ends and none of the means promising lots of toys from Santa with they're trying to build a workshop. Which is why at the end of every false promise it's always soaks the rich until there are no rich people left except their rich friends of course. And it never works because even in a free market you can't bankroll a left- wing money pit. Venezuela was rich once upon a time. But will this next election be another clash between the R's and the D's or not. Panic hasn't hit the Dems yet because they haven't learned a damn thing from 2016. The lessons are clear. The healthiest whitest swath of America hates politicians and the media who selects them. It's healthy perspective for it opens the door to candidates who don't fit into boxes or change their accent or fake, phony cadences. The Dems when you think about it could use one of these."

Instead of just being inauthentic and not changing her position. She used to be for ICE, she's now against ICE. She is to be pro-NRA, she's now anti- NRA.

This guy, Durham uncovered that and the FBI ended up having to pay $100 million to settle that.

While at the time accepting the fact that there was no collusion to change votes between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. And I find it quite rich that people like James Clapper and John Brennan now don't want any further investigation, and they don't want to get hauled up to testify because they got caught with what they were doing. And they don't want to explain to the American people why they were doing what they were doing with their security clearances. Why they claimed that they had evidence of Russian collusion. And the fact is if you don't have accountability for government bureaucrats who are political players, that leads to corruption, and that's exactly what we've seen which is why the CIA is now looking into this with DNI and the FBI.

They aren't living in a way that's completely environmental like some of the people in Oregon do, for example. They are living in three homes, as Bernie Sanders does. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is living in a very nice apartment building that is fueled by fossil fuels and energy. She goes to speaking gigs where she has to use the energy we have now to talk to people. So, when she says that she's not interested in a middle ground, that's where she is now. And if she's not willing to just talk about some things that are reasonable, where exactly does she think we want to be. And it comes down to what she wrote in the Green New Deal, which is getting rid of cows and planes and cars--"

That means you're not actually and this is not an excuse. You're not in control of what you're doing. That is basically a compulsion, the brain chemicals are taking over, and I think that's what's happened - like why else would you do this.
