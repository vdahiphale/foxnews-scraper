Breaking tonight, Michigan state legislators are purportedly set to head to the White House to meet with the President and his team about the tortured certification process that has been going on in their state. It's a big story is what we are going to watch tonight. And tomorrow as that meeting gets underway. Now the President's Attorney Rudy Giuliani spoke about Michigan today and made these claims.",

Now when you think of election fraud, many think of boxes of ballots that arrive out of nowhere or cemetery logs that turn into the dead of night tiebreakers but the more we are learning about what happened on November 3rd, the more it looks like something more subtle, some manipulation that would favor in this case Democrats. Through a series of state rule changes that kicked in the weeks prior to the election, these changes made it easier to open up the spigot on what is an acceptable ballot. It got easier in the closing weeks in other words to have a ballot to make it through, than it had in the past. That's what we are exploring tonight primarily in Michigan and also in Georgia.  Now \"The New York Times\" back in September raised concerns about the mail- in ballots that were coming in enormous numbers for the first time ever, setting analysis that found that \"in 24 primary elections this year more than 500,000 mail-in ballots were rejected or 2 percent of those returned by voters, there's a growing concern they wrote, that the number of ballots rejected could surpass 1 million in November. So, then the Democrat lawyer Marc Elias went to work. He spent a good part of the past year working on these election law changes. Proudly tweeting images of the lawsuits throughout the months for his side, he did a very good job on all of this. And remember this, when Stacey Abrams lost her gubernatorial election back in 2018, there was outcry. Even though there was a record turnout in that election year, her side said there was voter suppression and claimed that she was the rightful Governor of Georgia.",

There's a consent decree were signed by the sectors, state did not go through the legislature, it was based on lawsuits from Stacy Abrams Democratic Party in Georgia. It did in our opinion weaken the standard on which signature verification is made on absentee ballots.  Now remember in Georgia if you vote on day or early in person voting, you have to actually show a physical ballot photo ID. But with these signature ballots, you did not. And in the way the consent decree now is worried, it was signed in March of this year, is they can compare it to any signature.   So in essence there were some places did not go back to the registered voter card, they went back to just comparing it to the application for the voter - for the absentee ballot with the ballot itself which opens itself up for fraud. But also you might have something without Marc and then coming down here in Georgia and issue a (inaudible), let me just be real clear. There is not voter suppression. The only voter suppression is coming from Stacey Abrams complaining about this when she got beat. Let me let you have the list, from 2014 to 2020 - to 2018, the issue of minority participation voting in Georgia has doubled we've had 10 to 12 to a 15 percent increase, is high as 20 percent increases in African-American and Hispanic male and female voting.  So the only issue of voter suppression here is the Democrat Party suppressing the vote and then trying to make work the system where they can have signatures not in check. The issue is very plain, you don't go from 3 percent rejection rate to less than 0.03 percent in an election which you have substantial amount of absentee ballots over what you had in 2018, it's just wrong.",

You might have meet her earlier, I want to go back to this, you talked about fraud being found, ballots being found, if we had not asked for this recount then in Georgia, and recount, Martha you realize that there would've been over 3,000 votes for the President about 8,000, 10,000 votes in total that were never counted down here. Did two weeks after the fact in the last 48 hours, they found these ballots that were never counted. This is the problem we are finding in Georgia. Is in addition to these procedural issues and in addition to thank the enroll court (ph) we are actually finding places that were not even counted and then on top of that, talking about this legal issues with Secretary of State, we are finding out with the local election boards, we're talking about the scanning machines for the votes and sales they were never given instructions on what to set those machines to, to look for extraneous marks, over votes, under votes, preferred riding candidates or non-riding candidate, they never got instructions from the Secretary of State on what to set it at.

We're still talking about a pretty limited timeline here to have an audit. So I think the story that we lead with here in the segment about these lawmakers, these leaders from Michigan, the Republican Party who will lead the state legislature being summoned to Washington by the president. I don't think it's totally out-of-bounds by any stretch for people to wonder OK, you look at the context. You look at the timing, why is this happening. Why is the president asking these lawmakers to come to Washington and is he going to try to apply some pressure on them.

If the Clinton campaign said we don't think this is fair or legitimate, let's wait or let's maybe see with what the legislators might be able to do to put different electors in there and maybe put us in the White House and Barack Obama is going to summon some Democrats from this states to say, \"Hey guys what are you doing in your states\", let's see what we might be able to do here.  I think conservatives would rightly have been in the streets screaming their heads off and I would have right there with them because that's not what we do in this country.

      "utterance": "One of the reasons why the two Republicans did not certify in Wayne County, Michigan, is because the over vote was so high. In fact, we have precincts in which two times the number of people who live there including children voted. That's absurd."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So those claims are being investigated. Now when you think of election fraud, many think of boxes of ballots that arrive out of nowhere or cemetery logs that turn into the dead of night tiebreakers but the more we are learning about what happened on November 3rd, the more it looks like something more subtle, some manipulation that would favor in this case Democrats. Through a series of state rule changes that kicked in the weeks prior to the election, these changes made it easier to open up the spigot on what is an acceptable ballot. It got easier in the closing weeks in other words to have a ballot to make it through, than it had in the past. That's what we are exploring tonight primarily in Michigan and also in Georgia. Now \"The New York Times\" back in September raised concerns about the mail- in ballots that were coming in enormous numbers for the first time ever, setting analysis that found that \"in 24 primary elections this year more than 500,000 mail-in ballots were rejected or 2 percent of those returned by voters, there's a growing concern they wrote, that the number of ballots rejected could surpass 1 million in November. So, then the Democrat lawyer Marc Elias went to work. He spent a good part of the past year working on these election law changes. Proudly tweeting images of the lawsuits throughout the months for his side, he did a very good job on all of this. And remember this, when Stacey Abrams lost her gubernatorial election back in 2018, there was outcry. Even though there was a record turnout in that election year, her side said there was voter suppression and claimed that she was the rightful Governor of Georgia."

And I just want to remind everybody that Marc Elias who was working on all this lawsuits is the same lawyer who was in connection to the Steele dossier in terms of getting that rolling and he's been hard at work on this project but is there anything illegal about what he did?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I understand Martha. Well, look - let's be honest, this didn't go through the legislature number one. There's a consent decree were signed by the sectors, state did not go through the legislature, it was based on lawsuits from Stacy Abrams Democratic Party in Georgia. It did in our opinion weaken the standard on which signature verification is made on absentee ballots. Now remember in Georgia if you vote on day or early in person voting, you have to actually show a physical ballot photo ID. But with these signature ballots, you did not. And in the way the consent decree now is worried, it was signed in March of this year, is they can compare it to any signature. So in essence there were some places did not go back to the registered voter card, they went back to just comparing it to the application for the voter - for the absentee ballot with the ballot itself which opens itself up for fraud. But also you might have something without Marc and then coming down here in Georgia and issue a (inaudible), let me just be real clear. There is not voter suppression. The only voter suppression is coming from Stacey Abrams complaining about this when she got beat. Let me let you have the list, from 2014 to 2020 - to 2018, the issue of minority participation voting in Georgia has doubled we've had 10 to 12 to a 15 percent increase, is high as 20 percent increases in African-American and Hispanic male and female voting. So the only issue of voter suppression here is the Democrat Party suppressing the vote and then trying to make work the system where they can have signatures not in check. The issue is very plain, you don't go from 3 percent rejection rate to less than 0.03 percent in an election which you have substantial amount of absentee ballots over what you had in 2018, it's just wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think we made that point that the turnout was actually higher in Stacey Abrams election even though she claimed that there was voter suppression in that election. So I guess, the question becomes when you look at the variance there, so the ballots that we are able to get through and we know in some cases and you tell me if this was the case in Georgia, did they change the sensitivity level on what it matches on a signature so that some of these machines - you can turn it up or turn it down I guess to some extent in terms of how close, what percentage close that signature needs to be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "That if I use it that would change - the voter match here and especially in the county's here we deal with this, was actually physically looking at to hit the ballots and so. So I think, this is an issue of, are supposed to be checking when they are actually are not and I think that's has become the issue that we are trying to deal with the Secretary of State who refuses to say that there are problems. You might have meet her earlier, I want to go back to this, you talked about fraud being found, ballots being found, if we had not asked for this recount then in Georgia, and recount, Martha you realize that there would've been over 3,000 votes for the President about 8,000, 10,000 votes in total that were never counted down here. Did two weeks after the fact in the last 48 hours, they found these ballots that were never counted. This is the problem we are finding in Georgia. Is in addition to these procedural issues and in addition to thank the enroll court (ph) we are actually finding places that were not even counted and then on top of that, talking about this legal issues with Secretary of State, we are finding out with the local election boards, we're talking about the scanning machines for the votes and sales they were never given instructions on what to set those machines to, to look for extraneous marks, over votes, under votes, preferred riding candidates or non-riding candidate, they never got instructions from the Secretary of State on what to set it at. You had 159 counties left to their own decision on how to actually set their machines."

And I mean, all of this is so eye-opening in kind of a gut wrenching way for Americans all across the country when you learn how willy-nilly some of this processes are across the country, they are different in every single state. There isn't a federal standard by which we vote in this country. And no matter what happens, I think it's a huge eye- opener in terms of how all of this works behind the scenes. You said back on November 9th, we are confident that we will find evidence of improperly harvested ballots and other irregularities that will prove that President Trump won Georgia. Do you still stand by that today on November 19th? Are you going to prove that?"

But what we have found is what you just talked about. We have found issues that we can't get into as far as the absentee ballot signature issue, the issues of asking the Secretary of State to open this up so what we know exactly where these ballots came from. If we continue this process, there should be enough interest here in Georgia and across the country to say what actually happened and I can't feel confident knowing that the processes were followed in Georgia, knowing that we just found these, all of these ballots that were never counted and they are still trying to work to get through the issues of matching verification that we have not had an answer to it."

Look, they have - though we have seen this coming up to - we have seen them trying to move the election - everything that remotely resembles a question, a legitimate question about this election is being tagged with some kind of a statement at the bottom, look they don't like the president, they never like the president, they did not want him to be reelected. We had proof of that from Google and Facebook and others all throughout that we been trying to expose it and most media never would touch. And so it doesn't surprise me that they are going to try and spin a narrative that everything was fine, it's just like the Secretary State in Georgia everything was find we were told, until all of a sudden we started finding ballots and then it becomes a problem. So we've got to continue this fight, Martha, you've been asking the right questions, we've just got to continue to make sure that this is open and transparent so that Americans can have trust in their voting system, because down here in Georgia, we have got another election on January 5th."

      "utterance": "Well, my hope is that by shining the light on this it lights - sunlight is a great disinfectant and what we got to have is put pressure on these counties to make sure that they are actually taking the proper precautions with their absentee ballots, there are other issues we have, but we've also frankly, we've got to have people turn out. They've got to actually be a part of this process. And our Secretary of State has got to give clear instructions to these counties on how they are to count the votes either to accept their machine. So that people can trust that their vote is being counted."

He's always been a supporter of these candidates. And he also understands the real nature of what is at stake here. This is a chamber majority in the senate, if these Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are not reelected. I support them. They need to be reelected because look, we've got a real choice down here. You got David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler who represent a conservative majority in Georgia and this country, or you've got Ossoff and Warnock. Warnock who actually said that you couldn't start guarding the military, there's a problem in this election down here. People have got to see through it.

Just hours before the news broke, the Trump campaign dropped its federal lawsuit in Michigan challenging the states vote tallies, now it seems that they are headed in a different direction here. So joining me now is Guy Benson, Host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" and Fox News Contributor. Guy, good to have you with us this evening. GUY BENSON, HOST, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\": Hi, Martha."

Now they say they don't want to certify - tonight, I just want to get everybody up to speed on some news that just broke a few moments ago which is that one of the two Republican members of the four member Michigan canvassing board, the state canvassing board, Norman Shinkle says that he is leaning towards asking for a delay in certification and calling for an audit of the state. He says there are concerns to people have across the state, then we're going to delay the certification pass Monday. Your thoughts on what's going on there?"

    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the Trump campaign in that press conference today claimed that they dropped their Michigan suit because they got their desired remedy which was a delay in the certification in Wayne County which isn't what happened. They did certify in Wayne County, now you're asking for like take back's from the Republicans but I'm not really sure that's - how that works legally speaking. What you just described would be a significant update should the other Republican go along with it and there are some sort of, stalemate in the State of Michigan on the deadline for certification whether there is some sort of a follow-up investigation or whatever word they want to use to describe it for that to take place. We're still talking about a pretty limited timeline here to have an audit. So I think the story that we lead with here in the segment about these lawmakers, these leaders from Michigan, the Republican Party who will lead the state legislature being summoned to Washington by the president. I don't think it's totally out-of-bounds by any stretch for people to wonder OK, you look at the context. You look at the timing, why is this happening. Why is the president asking these lawmakers to come to Washington and is he going to try to apply some pressure on them. To perhaps - I don't know, put in a different slate of electors through the state legislature, doing an end run around the voters of Michigan. That is at least part of the speculation. I think we should wait and keep our powder dry and see what actually happens. But I think people asking those questions and may be drawing those conclusions. It is not completely baseless, right. You can connect a few dots here, it is possible."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It is possible. And we have seen in 2016, there were a few electors whose states voted for President Trump who became what is called a faithless elector and then they did not put their electors towards President Trump in the end. Now we're just going through what Michigan law is, it says Michigan law does not include a provision for the legislature to directly select electors or to award electors to anyone other than the person who received the most votes. And we know that Joe Biden is ahead by 150,000 votes in Michigan. So this route does seem like a long shot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "It's an extreme long shot and both of the Republican leaders that are coming to Washington for this meeting tomorrow are on the record saying \"We're not going to do anything like that\". And I think that's the right thing for them to say. And I know the tensions are high and frustration is high and suspicion is high among many people in this country, particularly Trump supporters. But I think just in a counterfactual or a hypothetical, if four years ago we saw exactly this type of machination from Democrats where President Trump had won a state or two and then Hillary Clinton and her campaign said \"Well, the people have spoken but we're not really sure because Russia, maybe have - maybe they were involved in a lot of Democrats believed that, still believe that even though there is no basis that they changed any votes, that's a popular belief on the left. If the Clinton campaign said we don't think this is fair or legitimate, let's wait or let's maybe see with what the legislators might be able to do to put different electors in there and maybe put us in the White House and Barack Obama is going to summon some Democrats from this states to say, \"Hey guys what are you doing in your states\", let's see what we might be able to do here. I think conservatives would rightly have been in the streets screaming their heads off and I would have right there with them because that's not what we do in this country. That would be a shocking departure from our system of governance and the transfer of power in this country. And so I think this is a very dangerous path to even consider let alone go down. I am very suspicious or skeptical I should say that we're going to get even close to it, but the fact that we are talking about it frankly is unsettling."

There are some that say that the seeds of distrust in the election are sort of, paving the way for the president to say that it was illegitimate over the course of the next few years if he decides he wants to run again. And we know that on Hillary Clinton side, she told Joe Biden not to concede under any circumstances in this election, so it's been fraught on both sides from day one.

But Joe Biden has to deal with simple fact, he invited all the socialists to his little dinner party and made Kamala Harris, that she's the most liberal senator in the senate, made her his VP pick. She is a Signatory of Medicare for all, takes away your private insurance, Signatory of Green New Deal, Green New Deal is consider a crucial framework for climate change policy according to Joe Biden's campaign web site. So, he invited all of these socialists to this little party and he can't be surprised when they got a little drunk on power and now they have a very loud voice which is exactly what's happening. They are not incorrect when they say that they're winning within the Democratic Party. Now I don't think they're winning over America, because we need to remember something, Republicans took back almost a dozen seats in the House and we should be pretty happy about that.

So, yes, he'll say that he's going to protect your private insurance but let's not forget he was part of the Obama administration who lied to us about keeping your doctor, you think they are telling the truth about keeping your private insurance? The public option is simply a slow roll to Medicare for all, if you look at the economics of it, there's really no other way out of it. It does eventually get rid of your private insurance by undercutting all private insurance. They named the Green New Deal in their campaign web site and they can attack our energy industry and they want to transition away from oil and gas and fossil fuels, that's what makes us energy independent. It's actually what is -- our fracking is what has decreased U.S. emissions back to 1990 levels.

And Operation Warp Speed has -- it's really incredible. We have two vaccines that are 95 percent efficacious that are safe, and that appeared to work in elderly. We are going to have tens of millions of doses by the end of the year and the distribution process is sound. General Perna, the top logistician in the U.S. military with dozens of people working every day, it is timed not to the hour, but to the minute. This is going to be effectively distributed, there is a tiered plan, healthcare workers, elderly, vulnerable, this is going to be done and President -- President Trump has assembled this team, the vice president has worked on it, we've all worked on it and this is really the light at the end of the tunnel, it will be done, it will be done effectively. If we do need to transition, the first thing I would tell the Biden administration is this plan is sound, it's going to work and you need to let it work."

And you got hospitalizations increasing, you got the case numbers at the highest levels that we've seen. So, would you say, I mean, how would you characterize the virus right now in the United States? Is it under control?"

It's only weeks away, but we are at the most dangerous and critical time of the pandemic that we've been in through the entire year that we've been battling this. The cases are rising, hospitalizations are going up. Your chances of living are far greater than they were a few months ago, but the deaths are going up because of the numbers of cases and this is why we are so concerned and really urge Americans across the country as Dr. Birx did today to please physically distance, to wear a mask when you can't. Unfortunately, we are going to have to avoid indoor crowded spaces like bars and restaurants and you are going to have to be very careful even with the family gatherings and that's what Dr. Redfield was talking about today."

The United Kingdom and France has turned it around with these simple measures and keeping schools and businesses open, not a lock down -- we've done it in Arizona, Florida, Texas, across the deep south. Really, this is what we need to do, this will turn it around. We only have a few more weeks to do this, if we do this, we will flatten it, the vaccine will be here and we will protect the vulnerable.

What we've learned and frankly the New York City experience is really important -- what we've learned is that when you actually do the testing and when you have the safeguards that New York City put in place -- I remember you and I kind of riffed about this, you know, when it first started and I kept pushing for those safeguards -- but when you put them in place, you see that schools are not super spreading events and that's really, really good.
