So when you tell me about some anonymous source within the administration, probably who is failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons, now -- and The New York Times is failing.

Sarah Sanders saying this is pathetic and reckless, selfish, and, quote, this coward should do the right thing and resign. Just in the past few minutes, Senator Bob Corker from Tennessee, who is not running for reelection, said this. This is what all of us had understood to be the situation from day one. I understand this is the case. That's why I think all of us encourage the good people around the president to stay. I thank General Mattis whenever I see him.  Let's bring in our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent of the Washington Examiner; A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at Real Clear Politics, and Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen. OK, Marc, obviously this is anonymous. This comes, however, after the Woodward book, and the president is reacting, not just once, twice, he just tweeted out \"treason?\"",

We don't know who this person is, but many of the stories, the activity he describes, tracks with what's in Bob Woodward's book, and with named people, too. In Bob Woodward's book, Gary Cohn apparently admits to having taken decision memos off the president's desk and bragged that he didn't even notice they were missing. There is a story in there about how after Assad gassed his own people, Trump called up Mattis and said he wanted a plan to eliminate Assad, which is a legitimate military target, and Mattis reportedly put down the phone and said we're not doing that.  Who elected these people commander in chief? When you have unelected appointees undermining and refusing to carry out lawful orders by the elected commander in chief, that is not defending democracy.
