      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Look, I've been calling all along for this report to be made public. There is not much that I can say. We'll be looking through that report. I would like to highlight an issue that really speaks to the vulnerabilities within our election system that unfortunately has not been addressed by Congress and really hasn't been talked about often enough even though we have incredible vulnerabilities in our elections infrastructure that must be addressed before we head into the next 2020 election. I've introduced legislation called the Securing America's Elections Act that would require paper ballots or a voter verified paper backup to make sure that if anyone whether it's a bad actor, an individual or a country comes in and tries to manipulate our votes, change our vote count and therefore manipulate the outcome of our election we will have an auditable paper trail to make sure that our voices and our votes are counted accurately and represented. Otherwise if there is any question at all in 2020 about any kind of shenanigans or manipulation or anyone messing with this election it could undermine -- it could undermine everything."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "-- on that. I apologize for the delay in the satellite. You said on March 28 that it was time to put aside partisan interests. And that now that the President is not guilty of conspiring with a foreign power, now must be the time to stand together and move beyond this divisive issue that has taken up enough of the national conversation. Did your party not get that message?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look -- this is a message for the country and it is unfortunate for those who are continuing to put partisan politics ahead of the interests of the people of this country. To know that the President of the United States did not collude with another country's government, with a foreign government to interfere in our elections is a good thing for all of us. It's a good thing for our country. We've got to come together and work towards solving the very real challenges that people here in communities like this at Fort Madison, Iowa and communities all across the country are struggling with and dealing with. And we can only do that when we come together and put people ahead of politics."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I want to ask you a specific question. In 2017 you visited Syria. You met with Bashar al-Assad. Recently you were asked if he was a war criminal and you couldn't really say. Can you say it tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Look, like I said earlier, we have to be willing to meet with people who may be adversaries or potential adversaries or dictators or others in the pursuit of peace and security. What is more important than the question that you're asking right now is to focus on the cost of this regime change war on our country, the trillions of dollars that we've spent on waging a regime change war that has undermined our national security. Strengthening terrorist groups like SIIS and al Qaeda. Al Qaeda being stronger today in Syria than ever before. But to speak of the death and destruction that has been caused."

      "utterance": "You served two tours of duty in the Middle East. You're a major in the Army National Guard. But there are people inside the U.S. military, many of them and inside the U.S. intelligence agencies that believe that Assad was behind the gassing of his own people. You just don't buy that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "No. What I have said and I've said this numerous times is that the Assad government, the Syrian government, there have been other actors, terrorist groups like al Qaeda and others -- other jihadist groups in Syria have unfortunately used these chemical weapons in this war that's currently being waged. My point is -- and I will keep saying this over and over and over again -- because these destructive regime change war policies in our country have cost us so much. We must bring about an end to them."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Ok."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "And many people in Washington who are part of the military industrial complex and the foreign policy establishment don't want to debate this issue. They don't want to talk about how costly and destructive these policies have been and so they end up bringing up other issues that distract away from our urgent need to bring about an end to these regime change wars."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Sure. All right. I want to turn to politics. You are in a race where there could be more than 20 other candidates. In 2016 you endorsed, wholeheartedly Bernie Sanders. Why are you running against him now?"

      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "I'm not running against him or anyone else. I'm running to serve the American people. To serve them as president and commander-in-chief. Bringing the experience that I have serving for 16 years now in the Army National Guard as a solder, deploying twice to the Middle East, serving in Congress for over six years on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, bringing this experience to this most important job that the President has as commander-in-chief and change the priorities in our country to bring about an end to these regime-change wars. This new Cold War that we are in with ever-escalating tensions --"

Bring it back to invest in serving the very real needs that we have in this country."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "GABBARD",

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Last thing, are you satisfied with the new leadership at the DNC? Last time you quit the race because you said the DNC was putting the finger on the scale against Bernie Sanders specifically. But are you convinced someone like you can operate in this DNC environment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "Two things. To be clear, I stepped down as vice chair of the DNC at that time in 2016 because I saw some very stark differences between the two major candidates in that race at that time. Secretary Clinton, who had a very hawkish, interventionist foreign policy, and Bernie Sanders who was largely the opposite of that, more non-interventionist foreign policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Like you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GABBARD",
      "utterance": "And as a veteran and someone who has seen the cost of war, I felt it was important to be able to step down and make that endorsement, to be able to bring these issues to the forefront. Obviously now there has been a lot that we have learned about what went on in the DNC at that time. I think there is a lot more transparency and some important changes that have been made. But there are many of us who are going to continue to keep watching to make sure that this process is fair and transparent, and that the wishes of the voters are what are carried through and will decide this election."
