Our economic plan got us back to an extraordinary reopening for the economy and the president wanted us to move forward with $3 trillion of spending. That's what we did. It's helped an enormous amount of American businesses and American workers. And the answer is, the president constantly has -- not only his economic team in the Oval Office, but now Mark Meadows and I have been on the phone with Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans every single day. Mark and I obviously speak to Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans in the House.   But let me be clear: any legislation requires bipartisan support.

We've had some polls there showing some tightening. In other states, not as much. But if you look overall, if you take an average of Biden's lead in the top six battleground states in this election, it is at 3.0 percent. That is exactly where Hillary Clinton's lead was four years ago.

So it's very clear that the Biden campaign is reading the tea leaves that Tom just laid out for us there. They know exactly where they need to go and they also are working really hard to protect a number of different routes to 270 electoral votes. With the Fox News poll in Arizona, for instance, that's looking better than anyone expected and really great for Mark Kelly, I should say, running against Martha McSally there.

He's historically had quite a lot of it in terms of all of his past runs. And I do think that, to Jessica's point, one of the reasons that the campaign is kind about on the trail earlier than maybe expected is because that they saw some of these law and order messages having significant impact, potentially, in the states. When you look at these polls generally, it's kind of interesting situation though because I wouldn't say that the Biden campaign is acting like they have the lead that these national polls indicate that they do. They're behaving as if it's much closer, as if it is, to Tom's point, you know, something that is just a couple of points separating him from the president.

We have about seven and a half million jobs that we need to get back until we're back to where we were up.

And, Bret, as you know, we put $3 trillion into the economy when the economy was completely shut down. We've now reopened the economy. Well, let's -- let's do a more targeted bill now. If we need to do more in 30 days, we'll continue to do more. But let's not hold up the American workers and American businesses that need more support."

We'll do this separately from the CARES Act negotiations. We're having the Appropriations staff, the four corners meet and go through some specific details on it. But the good news is we've agreed on a clean CR, and I hope by the end of the week, we can begin moving forward with that, because that's important to the American people."

So, for now, the most important thing is to make sure at the end of the month, we don't shutdown the government and we get something past the election."

The president's joked that he doesn't know whether you're a Democrat or Republican. Here's \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board: Republicans in the age of Donald Trump don't know what they stand for on economics. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is a Keynesian whose idea of compromise is half of whatever Mrs. Pelosi wants -- saying it's a down payment on her election agenda. Your reaction to that criticism, and would it be better to bring the president in, have him, get everybody in the Oval Office and try to hammer out a deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",

As I've said before, I don't agree to anything that I don't review with the president. I speak to the president daily. Our economic plan got us back to an extraordinary reopening for the economy and the president wanted us to move forward with $3 trillion of spending. That's what we did. It's helped an enormous amount of American businesses and American workers. And the answer is, the president constantly has -- not only his economic team in the Oval Office, but now Mark Meadows and I have been on the phone with Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans every single day. Mark and I obviously speak to Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans in the House."

      "speaker": "JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE",
      "utterance": "The report reinforces the worst fears and painful truths -- the economic inequities that began before the downturn have only worsened under this failed presidency. When a crisis started, we all hoped for a few months of the shutdown would be followed by rapid economic turnaround. No one thought they'd lose their job for good."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",

Under President Trump, we had the lowest unemployment we've had. We had the best economy we've ever had. And to no fault of any American businesses, the president made a very difficult decision to shut down the entire U.S. economy because of this terrible COVID disease. Now, the good news is we've reopened it. So, again, let me just say -- people thought we have 30 million, 40 million people unemployed. We never did that because of the bipartisan support putting money into the economy. We're now down to 8.4 percent, and the president is going to get it back down to 3 percent or 4 percent where it was before all of that in the beginning of next year when he's reelected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "I think you're going to see it continue to go down. We're going to have one more employment number this month that you're going to see. I think you're going to see another good number. You're going to see a phenomenal third quarter GDP. Some people think it's going to be in the neighborhood of 30 percent, 35 percent. Whether it's 25 percent, 30 percent, 35 percent, you're going to see this is the American economy rebounding. This is American business. People know when the government gets out of the way and we let American business work, and with a little support from industries that are the hardest hit -- and that's why we don't (ph) want more legislation -- this economy will fully recover and the president's job and my job is not done until everybody gets back to work."

That was one of the things he campaigned on and he delivered. I've been with the president to Arlington on Memorial Day. Let me tell you, I've listened to him there, I've watched him go visit sites there. I've been with him to the anniversary of World War II. It was a very emotional experience. So, no, quite the contrary, I think this president has enormous respect for the military and for the generals, and I've been at the tank at the Pentagon with him. I've been at 9/11 at Pentagon with him. This president respects and supports the U.S. military."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right. Last thing, the CBO says the national debt will reach about the size of the U.S. economy by the end of the year. I've interviewed you many times before and ask you about the growing size of the debt. You look at it, it's approaching $27 trillion. The deficit and the debt are a concern. You've always said it's, quote, manageable. But after this pandemic, if the president is reelected, would you see a second term, some serious administration plan to address the debt?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "I would, Bret. I think before we got into COVID, I thought the debt was very manageable. We were having extraordinary growth. We were creating growth that would pay down the debt over time. Unfortunately, this China virus has cost us trillions of dollars, and as I've said before, this is like a war. In a war, you've got to spend whatever you need to spend. So, that's the reason why we spent $3 trillion. We'd spend another trillion dollars. The speaker wants to just spend unlimited amounts of money. I think the former vice president, if you were elected, would have socialist economic policies that would take the debt out of control. But there's no question in a second term, once the economy is back, we will focus on this issue."

Now, economists are starting to call this recovery a K-shaped recovery, mean it is going well and up for folks at the top, but folks who are middle-class or below, it's going down. And so, the question it really is, is this working for working families? And the answer is no. Look, one in six small businesses have shuttered their doors. You know, if you work, 30 -- I think more than 24 million people have noted that they are teleworking. So, if you work a job that has you working on a laptop and you are working at a desk, you're less at risk for COVID. But I'm thinking, Bret, and Joe Biden's thinking but the folks who are truck drivers, who work as cashiers, who are working in the grocery stores, auto workers. Those are folks that are at higher risk of shortened hours, but also higher risk of being exposed to COVID. So I just really think we have to think about the pain and the working families across this country are experiencing right now."

We know that African-American and Latino folks in this country are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Will those neighborhoods and communities across the country have the opportunity to receive the vaccine? That is the question. And if we look at just frankly how this White House and how the administration has handled the mitigation or the lack thereof of COVID-19, has handled, you know, disturbing personal protective equipment to folks across this country, there have been real issues. So, I -- we are -- we would hope that if a vaccine is available, that it is safe, but it's a question of can the Trump administration distributed equitably?

You know, the White House has testing, Bret. You know, folks are tested very regularly coming in and out of the White House, anyone who's around the president.

In this moment, he is calling for calm and we have also noted throughout the week, Bret, that he, you know, asked the president to join him in condemning violence, regardless of who is causing it.

And I can also tell you this, that when you ask the American people looking at these polls, who do voters trust to keep them safe in this country, overwhelmingly, they say Joe Biden. And so, I think this \"law and order\" campaign, if you will, that President Trump and his campaign are trying to gin up and run, I don't think it's working, because the question is, are you safe in Donald Trump's America?

Let's set the table for this race as the RealClearPolitics average of polls, since we have Tom on we'll show these, RCP. Biden up 7 in the average of recent polls, if you look at the key battleground states, also Biden with an advantage. Some of those closing slightly in recent days. Back with the panel.

Florida, for example, which is a key -- key state, Biden's lead pre-convention was over five. It's now under two. There's been some tightening in places like Pennsylvania. We've had some polls there showing some tightening. In other states, not as much. But if you look overall, if you take an average of Biden's lead in the top six battleground states in this election, it is at 3.0 percent. That is exactly where Hillary Clinton's lead was four years ago. So I think despite the national polls showing Biden with a bigger lead than Hillary Clinton had at this point in time, in the battle ground states it's still very, very competitive."

If you remember, Joe Biden was supposed start traveling in earnest after Labor Day, but he's been out on the road. There were a few polls out of Wisconsin that showed that independent voters were paying more attention to this law and order or crime issue and people were really pushing the vice president to show up in Kenosha, which he did, and met with Jacob Blake's family as well and even spoke with Mr. Blake from his hospital bed. So it's very clear that the Biden campaign is reading the tea leaves that Tom just laid out for us there. They know exactly where they need to go and they also are working really hard to protect a number of different routes to 270 electoral votes. With the Fox News poll in Arizona, for instance, that's looking better than anyone expected and really great for Mark Kelly, I should say, running against Martha McSally there. But they know that Florida's getting tight, Pennsylvania's getting tight, and they need to make sure that Wisconsin and Michigan go their way this time around versus what happened to Hillary Clinton."

But there's more than a dozen law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police, 355,000 members, the National Association of Police Organizations, the International Union of Police Associations. Clearly they're going one way. Some of them enforced to Obama-Biden ticket in 2008. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": This is probably going to be the first time that you don't see any major cop backing for Joe Biden. He's historically had quite a lot of it in terms of all of his past runs. And I do think that, to Jessica's point, one of the reasons that the campaign is kind about on the trail earlier than maybe expected is because that they saw some of these law and order messages having significant impact, potentially, in the states. When you look at these polls generally, it's kind of interesting situation though because I wouldn't say that the Biden campaign is acting like they have the lead that these national polls indicate that they do. They're behaving as if it's much closer, as if it is, to Tom's point, you know, something that is just a couple of points separating him from the president. And I think that there's a real concern on the part of Democrats that, you know, this race was lost last time, perhaps in the last 60 days after what happened on the 9/11 ceremonies with Secretary Clinton and I think the debates, obviously, went well for president -- for then Candidate Trump.

I thought Symone Sanders actually did -- made an interesting angle during her interview, Bret, where she said, look, we're -- you know, we're worried this isn't going to be equitably distributed and that the coronavirus has -- has disproportionately impacted African-Americans, Latinos. So they're going to actually, I think, based on what she said, not politicize the vaccine, the safety of the vaccine, they may question a little bit, but actually politicize Trump's handling of the distribution of the vaccine to communities of color."

That's kind of where he's put, you know, all his eggs into that basket, that -- well, after he said that it was just going to go away, now at least we'll have a vaccine. And I do think that Symone Sanders' answer was incredibly smart and nuanced and also avoided talking about Kamala Harris' mention of being suspicious of the vaccine. I know a lot of people who also feel that way, though, especially in light of the CDC pushing convalescent plasma and then having them walk that back. And the fact that the president has boosted Hydroxychloroquine, for instance, on TV a number of times, where Dr. Fauci has had to contradict him to ensure that people are not just taking it for sport. I personally, if the FDA approves it, will be taking that vaccine if I can get my hands on it. I want to go back to normal life, like the rest of us."

The president has been hammering away on the idea, as you heard from Secretary Mnuchin, that the Obama-Biden years were -- were a stagnant recovery, one where wages really didn't grow. That he's proven that he can do that and that he's going to do it again.

And we've gotten away from that and particularly with Donald Trump the use of anonymous sources has -- has really, by factions within the government that have really tried to hurt him politically and undermine his administration, I think we need to really get back to that. If you've got something to say derogatory about the president or you've got a story to tell about the president, go on the record.

It's always hurtful. It's never fun. But I would say that this is also beef that lasted for several years. This is now two years that we mark since the senator's passing. And, at a certain point, we feel like the media entered an area where they're more interested in pouring salt on the wound, trying to get the president to go back and -- and continue his beef long after the point where the senator passed and that that -- and, honestly, it's -- it's reached a point where it's like, breaking news, they had beef. You know, this is not a new story for us. On the other hand, on the -- on the story itself, I have to say, \"The Atlantic\" has not really covered itself in glory these past couple of years. They were carrying water for the Russia collusion hoax and the Steele dossier. They smeared Brett Kavanaugh. Their most recent higher than announced was E. Jean Carroll, who lost her job at \"Elle\" magazine given the outrageous nature of her allegations against the president and they actually had to retract and correct a major piece recently thanks to our own reporting at \"The Federalist\" about a police shooting. I do believe that the first paragraph in this piece is false. There is a paper trail to prove that there was, in fact, a weather-related reason for this delay. And I believe John Bolton when he says that if this was true, it would have been an entire chapter in his book. He has no reason to lie. That doesn't mean that the president doesn't say terrible things often about people with whom I think he should have more respect and more acknowledgment of the sacrifices that they've made for our country, particularly those who served in harm's way."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, former National Security Advisor John Bolton wrote a very negative book, if you're looking for President Trump's point of view, about his time serving there. Here he is talking about this incident."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN BOLTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "I didn't hear either of those comments or anything even resembling them. I -- I was there at the point in time that morning when it was decided that -- that he would not go to Aisne-Marne Cemetery. He decided not to do it because of John Kelly's recommendation. It was entirely a weather-related decision and I thought the proper thing to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Jessica, I understand the Biden campaign jumping on this. I understand that the former vice president and -- and his passion about -- talking about it with the caveat, if true, when he delivered those remarks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "What I don't understand is the campaign surrogates who are out going after Donald Trump for his deferment to the Vietnam War because of bone spurs. That seems interesting because Joe Biden had deferments too to avoid the draft. In fact, he had five of them because of a diagnosis of asthma as a teenager."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Bone spurs, asthma, that's very much in the past. I don't think that's necessarily the relevant point right now. Joe Biden speaks about this issue passionately, not only because he cares about our troops, and he famously carries around a card that's updated on a daily basis of how many lives we have lost of servicemen and women abroad, but as the father of someone who fought honorably for the United States, Beau Biden, who passed away a few years ago. So I don't really want to talk about bone spurs versus asthma. I don't think that's the issue. I think that there are really two issues at play here. One, to Tom's point about sources. Deep Throat was an anonymous source. It was not revealed who he was for decades. I don't think that anyone on this panel or in the world would deny the fact that that account mattered and that it certainly carried weight. And has Jennifer Griffin defended her own reporting yesterday with Neil Cavuto, her sources are very real, they are not anonymous to any of these reporters, and she even said, I'm sure they're not anonymous to the president himself. This isn't an account that came out of a left-wing rag. \"The Atlantic's\" reporting has been confirmed by us, by \"The Washington Post,\" by \"The New York Times,\" by the Associated Press, all by very good reporters at those outlets as well. So to say that this is anonymous and it's a hoax is --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We should have a caveat in there. Now, I agree with you, there are elements of that reporting that Jennifer confirmed from -- from sources."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Yes, but -- absolutely. And -- and John Bolton is saying the decision was because of weather, that's fine. He also said he didn't spend the entire day with him. And the president said, oh, I called Melania to tell her how upset I was about this. She was back home. Guess what, Melania was with him in Paris and they went to dinner that night with the Macrons. He also said it's a hoax and then he said, but it could have been John Kelly. He was super fatigued and bad at his job. I don't think John Kelly has ever been bad at anything or super fatigued and not capable of doing it. So I think John Kelly would probably come out and say he didn't say this thing at my son's grave if that were the case. So pushing this aside as a hoax and something that isn't --"

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Yes. I welcome him to do either of those things. I think it would help a lot. But that \"Military Times\" poll that showed that Biden is getting more support amongst active service members than Donald Trump shows that they're running scared here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So, Tom, I guess that's where I want to wrap up, is the political impact of something like this. There is a lot of things that we thought were going to move the needle ahead of the 2016 election. A lot of things, including all kinds of things that were said, let alone the \"Access Hollywood\" -- people thought that the thing was -- his campaign was cratering a number of different times. Where are we on this? Does this not fall into some of that category?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "I think it absolutely does. I mean if you're a supporter of Donald Trump, you look at this piece and you think it's a total hit job. The president's denied it. His folks have denied it. They're not going to believe it. And if you're a Biden supporter, you look at it and say, of course he said it. This is absolutely true. So what does that small slice of folks in the middle, what -- what do they think? How do they react to this story and particularly the folks who are sitting in the states that are going to matter? I -- I don't think we know, but I think this does fall into that category, that bucket of things that, in the final analysis, it's not going to move the needle and it's not going to matter on Election Day."
