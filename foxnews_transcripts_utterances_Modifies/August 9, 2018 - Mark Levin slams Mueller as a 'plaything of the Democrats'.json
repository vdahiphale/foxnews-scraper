The story of corrupt DOJ official, ex-foreign spies working together, literally to stop Donald Trump from becoming president, and then after his election to destroy him. We have more major breaking news surrounding Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele and now Steele's boss, Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson. Now, The Hill's John Solomon has now uncovered additional disturbing communications and for the first time, we have them, handwritten notes from Bruce Ohr, detailing how he coordinated with Clinton's team of op researchers, all in the lead up to the election. We need to get to the bottom of it.  We have new details surrounding just how deep state of Christopher Steele's Russian ties are.  By the way, Robert Mueller, please tune in. We have found more actual real Russian collusion that you might want to investigate, if you care about truth and equal justice under the law.  Also tonight, we will bring you the unusual case of what looks like a Chinese spy and Senator Dianne Feinstein, it fits perfectly and highlights our two tiered system of justice. This went on for over 20 years, coming up. And don't expect, by the way, to hear this over at conspiracy TV MSNBC where their top left of Mao, their words, conspiracy theorist, Rachel Maddow, is pushing, and busy pushing, more bizarre anti-Trump conspiracy theories and lies. This is 24/7. Tom Brokaw, pay attention, this is your NBC News.  And, last night's show, well, she broke another bombshell report because there is a secret recording from the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes where he warned about the consequences if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take back the House in November. The horror! He told the truth. And meanwhile, over at fake news CNN, yes, so-called reporter, B.S. artist, Jim Acosta, is basking in the anti-Trump limelight and appeared on Stephen Colbert's show last night. We'll show you the worst of the worst.  Buckle up, time for an important breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right. Tonight, once again, John Solomon has a major breaking report. This time, he's exposing how Fusion GPS literally coordinated with Obama's Justice Department all in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Now, remember, Fusion GPS was the consulting firm. It was hired by the DNC, and the Clinton campaign. They are the ones that dug up the dirt on then candidate Trump that was full of Russian lies. And according to now newly unearthed, handwritten notes that we now have, senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, he knew about Glen Simpson's effort to leak the dirty dossier to the press prior to the election. He wrote, quote: it was Glen's Hail Mary attempt. Hail Mary attempt, of course, to defeat Trump with Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies.   And it gets worse. Now, Bruce Ohr also wrote that Glen Simpson gave him a memory stick during a discrete meeting at a coffee shop. By the way, where is that a stick? Is that acid washed? Did they beat it up with a hammer? Now, to put this simply, this new, clear evidence is showing Hillary Clinton's op research team was working with the Department of Justice in the Obama years to malign an opposition party candidate and Bruce Ohr, Barack Obama's number four at the DOJ, represented team Clinton's efforts to use your government as a weapon against the Trump campaign. And as we speak, the House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, he is now preparing subpoenas for Bruce Ohr, Nelly Ohr, and Glen Simpson. And, meanwhile, we are also learning new details about Christopher Steele and his shady ties to a Russian oligarch. Byron York uncovered emails from 2016 showing that Christopher Steele was in fact lobbying on behalf of a Russian aluminum tycoon -- oh, guess what, with close ties to Vladimir Putin.  Robert Mueller, Jeff Sessions, where are you people?   And Steele even pressed Bruce Ohr to help rectify those Russian oligarchs U.S. visa status after he was already banned from the United States. And Steele even pressed Bruce Ohr to help rectify the oligarch's status and after he was banned, guess what? He got to come back. So, here what we have is an ex-foreign spy working for a Putin-linked oligarch, gets him into the United States after being banned, by using his connection, the number four guy at the DOJ, during an election, where Steele, being paid by Hillary and the DNC, they literally are using Russian lies and propaganda, they create the oppo research against the president, then you have Fusion GPS, then you have Christopher Steele, disseminating that information to influence the American people what are outright lies because this is their Hail Mary pass.  Robert Mueller, you have no interest in investigating this? You don't think that's part of your mandate? But Paul Manafort's 2005 taxes that have nothing to do with the campaign, Russian-Trump, or the election? That's in your mandate? This is why we on this show, this is why the president rightly is calling this a witch hunt. This is a politically motivated prosecution of a man they never wanted to be president. They were going to stop him. And after every dirty trick, that they used to defeat Donald Trump, and it failed, well, then, they tried to destroy the president. Why? Because you voted for him.  I could go on and on but I think Rudy Giuliani said it best last night right here on this program. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Yes, he does. Without a doubt, this witch hunt is the pinnacle of a two tiered system of justice alive and well in this country, the United States of America. Hillary Clinton commits multiple, obvious, serious felonies.  We've said it a million times, mishandling top secret intel on a private server, deleting it, acid washing it, busting up devices with hard -- with hammers, obstructing justice. She got a get out of jail free card from her friends who wrote an exoneration before investigation, Comey, Strzok, and others.  And then you have shifty Schiff. Remember, we played it. He colluded on tape, conspired on tape with a Russian to get dirt on Donald Trump. Robert Mueller, where are you? Meanwhile, President Trump, all of his allies, they are slammed with the full force weight of the FBI and the DOJ based on what is Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies put together by a spy who is friends with a Russian oligarch and working on his behalf to get him into the country after he's been kicked out. Paul Manafort, old, big case, trial of the century. Facing life in prison over a 2005 tax case on bank and tax charges that had nothing to do with Trump, Russia, or the campaign.   Lieutenant General Flynn, coerced into a plea deal after exculpatory evidence was withheld, and then he has to sell his house because he can't afford to pay for his defense. And don't forget about even Carter Page, 2016, the FBI thought he was a Russian spy. And what did they do? They used Steele, friend of the Russian oligarch, his dirty dossier, that even he doesn't stand by. He doesn't even think it's true -- misleading four separate FISA judges to spy on a Trump campaign associates.  This is all happening. You can't make this up in a spy novel. But was President Trump, was he ever notified by our federal government that a possible spy might have infiltrated his campaign so he could help our government, help the FBI? Not a chance.  Meanwhile, very different story plays out if you are a Democrat, by the name of Senator Dianne Feinstein. Look at the shocking revelations, 2013, Feinstein, notified by the FBI. One of her top aide is investigated as a Chinese spy. In other words, the FBI sought to protect Feinstein, not Trump. Perhaps because the highest levels of the FBI are wrought with anti-Trump corrupt bias and are trying to take down the candidate, stop him with an insurance policy, if, God forbid, he does win. Not Senator Feinstein. Look, night after night on this program, we are breaking important news, investigative reporting. I have said many times, we are peeling back the layers of corruption, the biggest abuse of power in our country's history, at the highest levels of our government.   Now that's not the case and the rest of the news media. Let's take, for example, conspiracy TV MSNBC. You are going to love this tape. Now, this is not the case. They are more interested in pushing salacious rumors, lies, accusations.  Tom Brokaw, you spent your entire career. This is your NBC News. And nowhere is this more true than their chief conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow. Last night, after her old tricks, literally making something out of nothing, whipping these left-wing viewers into a frenzy over a secret recording of the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, where he warned a room full of donors that if Republicans lose, all deep state investigations will be halted and Democrats will try to impeach Trump. We've been saying this literally every night on this program, they also, by the way, want open borders, to eliminate ICE, keep Obamacare, and they want the crumbs back.  Now, of course, making a big deal out of nothing, well, that's kind of their M.O. over there at fake news MSNBC.  We can't forget about their big scoop. Remember, they got one page of Donald Trump's 2005 tax return for 45 minutes, we got it, here it is -- here, and what did we discover? He paid millions and millions and millions in taxes. And then, of course, there is Rachel's favorite conspiracy, Trump is an agent of Russia. I'm not making this up. Watch.",

One, Simpson acknowledged he encouraged Steele to leak a story just before the election as a Hail Mary attempt, obviously, to throw the election. Now, remember, Glen Simpson testified that he only pursue this information because he thought it was good citizenship, wasn't about politics, it was about being a good citizen. Here you see him telling his friend who takes a note, it's about elections. Here's s another one. He doesn't have any sources in Moscow where this alleged plot is. It's an intelligent agent who is now living in United States. That's a red flag for all the intelligence people that I talk to. Sounds like kompromat, not a real intelligent source. And he goes on. He talks about this incredible theory he has, which is really -- there were three spies in the Trump campaign. First, it was Manafort, he got booted. Then it was Carter Page, he got booted. So, then Michael Cohen must have been the third link because, well, he is married to somebody who knows someone in Russia. And then he puts all this down and, you know, Ohr is taking it and two days later, Ohr takes it and he runs it over to the FBI and he does an interview and tells them what it is. And why is this important? The FBI fired Christopher Steele and said it was not going to take any more information from this political operation research operation, but Bruce Ohr is the guy walking in the door after the firing.

Instead, it's about China allegedly infiltrating the office of a powerful Democrat in Senator Dianne Feinstein. This involves one of her staffers, his name is Russell Lowe. He was her driver, as you say, for a couple of decades but also, her liaison to the Asian-American community out in her home state of California. He visited relatives a few years ago, overseas, and became acquainted on the trip with someone who it turns out was connected to China's ministry of state security. Basically, a spy. As \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" says, quote: He didn't even know what was happening, that he was being recruited, he just thought it was some friend. Well, no, it wasn't a friend. So five years ago, FBI agents showed up at Feinstein's office here in Washington, and revealed that her staffer was actually under investigation. It does not appear the driver actually revealed anything of major substance, but the contact with China was so serious that Feinstein forced the aid into retirement and tried to keep all this quiet until \"The Chronicle\" blew the story up in about a week or so ago. Bottom line is the president has been trying to bring more attention to it, tweeting, among other things, quote: Dianne is the person leading our nation on collusion with Russia, only done by Dems, will she now investigate herself?  Well, the senator fired back in a tweet, basically declaring that after being contacted by the FBI, quote, I took those concerns seriously, learn the facts, and made sure the employee left my office immediately. Well, Republican Lindsey Graham is demanding to know in the cases of Carter Page or George Papadopoulos, the FBI did not give the president a similar heads up and allow them to just leave the campaign, instead they launched an investigation.

This had nothing to do with criminal activity or anything else. They hated Donald Trump. They didn't like Republicans. Why do you think they didn't give a defensive briefing to Donald Trump's campaign about attempted Russian influence? Because they wanted to investigate Donald Trump, not help him. They wanted to frame him. In the case of Dianne Feinstein, they wanted to help the little Democrat who didn't know she had a Chinese spy on her staff for 20 years. I must say, the pathetic nature of the partisanship of the FBI and DOJ under Obama really lays bare the simpleton-like remarks of the president -- the former president, when he said, there was not a scintilla, not an ounce of scandal and his administration.

So he's not a target, he doesn't need to be questioned about that. According to the Department of Justice, president can't be indicted. A president cannot be questioned by a subordinate, like Mr. Mueller, about his prerogatives as president, that is the firing of a subordinate like Mr. Comey. what questions exactly does Mr. Mueller have?

Exactly what questions that you have where you seek to turn this country upside down and disenfranchise the over 60 million people who voted for this president of United States? You are a plaything of the media. You are a plaything of the Democrats. You are a plaything of people within the Obama administration who sought from day one to take this president down.

The unemployment rate is at 3.9 percent, more blacks and Hispanics are employed than ever before, the gross -- the GDP hit a new level at 4.1 percent. The deregulatory state is going down, the judiciary is getting remade. I mean, all of these things, no matter how hard the press tries to go against the president, he continues to get results for the American people. So I get that it is frustrating for someone like Mr. Friedman to see that no matter how much they fight against him, that he continues to succeed. And I think the American people are smarter than he understands, and they are actually showing it with their approval rating. So no matter how hard they try, he is getting results.",

The story of corrupt DOJ official, ex-foreign spies working together, literally to stop Donald Trump from becoming president, and then after his election to destroy him. We have more major breaking news surrounding Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele and now Steele's boss, Fusion GPS founder Glen Simpson. Now, The Hill's John Solomon has now uncovered additional disturbing communications and for the first time, we have them, handwritten notes from Bruce Ohr, detailing how he coordinated with Clinton's team of op researchers, all in the lead up to the election. We need to get to the bottom of it. We have new details surrounding just how deep state of Christopher Steele's Russian ties are. By the way, Robert Mueller, please tune in. We have found more actual real Russian collusion that you might want to investigate, if you care about truth and equal justice under the law. Also tonight, we will bring you the unusual case of what looks like a Chinese spy and Senator Dianne Feinstein, it fits perfectly and highlights our two tiered system of justice. This went on for over 20 years, coming up. And don't expect, by the way, to hear this over at conspiracy TV MSNBC where their top left of Mao, their words, conspiracy theorist, Rachel Maddow, is pushing, and busy pushing, more bizarre anti-Trump conspiracy theories and lies. This is 24/7. Tom Brokaw, pay attention, this is your NBC News. And, last night's show, well, she broke another bombshell report because there is a secret recording from the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes where he warned about the consequences if Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take back the House in November. The horror! He told the truth. And meanwhile, over at fake news CNN, yes, so-called reporter, B.S. artist, Jim Acosta, is basking in the anti-Trump limelight and appeared on Stephen Colbert's show last night. We'll show you the worst of the worst. Buckle up, time for an important breaking news opening monologue."

This time, he's exposing how Fusion GPS literally coordinated with Obama's Justice Department all in the lead-up to the 2016 election. Now, remember, Fusion GPS was the consulting firm. It was hired by the DNC, and the Clinton campaign. They are the ones that dug up the dirt on then candidate Trump that was full of Russian lies."

      "utterance": "it was Glen's Hail Mary attempt. Hail Mary attempt, of course, to defeat Trump with Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies. And it gets worse. Now, Bruce Ohr also wrote that Glen Simpson gave him a memory stick during a discrete meeting at a coffee shop. By the way, where is that a stick? Is that acid washed? Did they beat it up with a hammer? Now, to put this simply, this new, clear evidence is showing Hillary Clinton's op research team was working with the Department of Justice in the Obama years to malign an opposition party candidate and Bruce Ohr, Barack Obama's number four at the DOJ, represented team Clinton's efforts to use your government as a weapon against the Trump campaign. And as we speak, the House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, he is now preparing subpoenas for Bruce Ohr, Nelly Ohr, and Glen Simpson. And, meanwhile, we are also learning new details about Christopher Steele and his shady ties to a Russian oligarch. Byron York uncovered emails from 2016 showing that Christopher Steele was in fact lobbying on behalf of a Russian aluminum tycoon -- oh, guess what, with close ties to Vladimir Putin. Robert Mueller, Jeff Sessions, where are you people? And Steele even pressed Bruce Ohr to help rectify those Russian oligarchs U.S. visa status after he was already banned from the United States. And Steele even pressed Bruce Ohr to help rectify the oligarch's status and after he was banned, guess what? He got to come back. So, here what we have is an ex-foreign spy working for a Putin-linked oligarch, gets him into the United States after being banned, by using his connection, the number four guy at the DOJ, during an election, where Steele, being paid by Hillary and the DNC, they literally are using Russian lies and propaganda, they create the oppo research against the president, then you have Fusion GPS, then you have Christopher Steele, disseminating that information to influence the American people what are outright lies because this is their Hail Mary pass. Robert Mueller, you have no interest in investigating this? You don't think that's part of your mandate? But Paul Manafort's 2005 taxes that have nothing to do with the campaign, Russian-Trump, or the election? That's in your mandate? This is why we on this show, this is why the president rightly is calling this a witch hunt. This is a politically motivated prosecution of a man they never wanted to be president. They were going to stop him. And after every dirty trick, that they used to defeat Donald Trump, and it failed, well, then, they tried to destroy the president. Why? Because you voted for him. I could go on and on but I think Rudy Giuliani said it best last night right here on this program. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Yes, he does. Without a doubt, this witch hunt is the pinnacle of a two tiered system of justice alive and well in this country, the United States of America. Hillary Clinton commits multiple, obvious, serious felonies. We've said it a million times, mishandling top secret intel on a private server, deleting it, acid washing it, busting up devices with hard -- with hammers, obstructing justice. She got a get out of jail free card from her friends who wrote an exoneration before investigation, Comey, Strzok, and others. And then you have shifty Schiff. Remember, we played it. He colluded on tape, conspired on tape with a Russian to get dirt on Donald Trump. Robert Mueller, where are you? Meanwhile, President Trump, all of his allies, they are slammed with the full force weight of the FBI and the DOJ based on what is Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies put together by a spy who is friends with a Russian oligarch and working on his behalf to get him into the country after he's been kicked out. Paul Manafort, old, big case, trial of the century. Facing life in prison over a 2005 tax case on bank and tax charges that had nothing to do with Trump, Russia, or the campaign. Lieutenant General Flynn, coerced into a plea deal after exculpatory evidence was withheld, and then he has to sell his house because he can't afford to pay for his defense. And don't forget about even Carter Page, 2016, the FBI thought he was a Russian spy. And what did they do? They used Steele, friend of the Russian oligarch, his dirty dossier, that even he doesn't stand by. He doesn't even think it's true -- misleading four separate FISA judges to spy on a Trump campaign associates. This is all happening. You can't make this up in a spy novel. But was President Trump, was he ever notified by our federal government that a possible spy might have infiltrated his campaign so he could help our government, help the FBI? Not a chance. Meanwhile, very different story plays out if you are a Democrat, by the name of Senator Dianne Feinstein. Look at the shocking revelations, 2013, Feinstein, notified by the FBI. One of her top aide is investigated as a Chinese spy. In other words, the FBI sought to protect Feinstein, not Trump. Perhaps because the highest levels of the FBI are wrought with anti-Trump corrupt bias and are trying to take down the candidate, stop him with an insurance policy, if, God forbid, he does win. Not Senator Feinstein. Look, night after night on this program, we are breaking important news, investigative reporting. I have said many times, we are peeling back the layers of corruption, the biggest abuse of power in our country's history, at the highest levels of our government. Now that's not the case and the rest of the news media. Let's take, for example, conspiracy TV MSNBC. You are going to love this tape. Now, this is not the case. They are more interested in pushing salacious rumors, lies, accusations. Tom Brokaw, you spent your entire career. This is your NBC News. And nowhere is this more true than their chief conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow. Last night, after her old tricks, literally making something out of nothing, whipping these left-wing viewers into a frenzy over a secret recording of the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, where he warned a room full of donors that if Republicans lose, all deep state investigations will be halted and Democrats will try to impeach Trump. We've been saying this literally every night on this program, they also, by the way, want open borders, to eliminate ICE, keep Obamacare, and they want the crumbs back. Now, of course, making a big deal out of nothing, well, that's kind of their M.O. over there at fake news MSNBC. We can't forget about their big scoop. Remember, they got one page of Donald Trump's 2005 tax return for 45 minutes, we got it, here it is -- here, and what did we discover? He paid millions and millions and millions in taxes. And then, of course, there is Rachel's favorite conspiracy, Trump is an agent of Russia. I'm not making this up. Watch."

The worse case scenario is that the president is a foreign agent suddenly feels very possible (ph). What would change the world is if, you know, Russia was interfering in the election and they weren't doing it on their own, and he was in on it.

The perception that the president may have ordered these strikes in part because of scandal will affect the impact on the effectiveness of these military strikes. Unavoidably, they pulled their troops out starting Friday, September 29th. That would be the Friday after the Trump administration made this baffling decision to insult and harm our closest military ally in that region, those troops from Chad got pulled out the 29th. Well, right after that, that's when four U.S. army soldiers got attacked by a large contingent of ISIS fighters in Niger.

It is one month after Donald Trump has won the election. It's one month after Christopher Steele, the opposition researcher, British intelligence agent, has been fired by the FBI, the Democrats are still in shock, I assume Lisa Page and Strzok are sorting through their feelings after the election. And all of a sudden, Bruce Ohr goes to a coffee shop in Washington and he meets Glen Simpson. That's Christopher Steele's boss, the owner of Fusion GPS, the Clinton research firm. He gets a memory card, a thumb drive of documents coming to Bruce Ohr. Bruce Ohr is not in the counterintelligence chain. He's not an FBI counterintelligence person. And in fact, his wife worked for the Fusion GPS, so he might have a conflict of interest under the Justice Department rules."

And he gets a series of admissions and he writes down in his nice notes -- I think they are important. Let's go them quickly. One, Simpson acknowledged he encouraged Steele to leak a story just before the election as a Hail Mary attempt, obviously, to throw the election. Now, remember, Glen Simpson testified that he only pursue this information because he thought it was good citizenship, wasn't about politics, it was about being a good citizen. Here you see him telling his friend who takes a note, it's about elections. Here's s another one. He doesn't have any sources in Moscow where this alleged plot is. It's an intelligent agent who is now living in United States. That's a red flag for all the intelligence people that I talk to. Sounds like kompromat, not a real intelligent source. And he goes on. He talks about this incredible theory he has, which is really -- there were three spies in the Trump campaign. First, it was Manafort, he got booted. Then it was Carter Page, he got booted. So, then Michael Cohen must have been the third link because, well, he is married to somebody who knows someone in Russia. And then he puts all this down and, you know, Ohr is taking it and two days later, Ohr takes it and he runs it over to the FBI and he does an interview and tells them what it is. And why is this important? The FBI fired Christopher Steele and said it was not going to take any more information from this political operation research operation, but Bruce Ohr is the guy walking in the door after the firing. It has to concern people at the FISA court, has to concern professional intelligence people like I talked to today who look at these notes and said this is the worst form of intelligence gathering we've ever seen."

The bigger question here, I think after all of this information has been released, is who authorized Bruce Ohr at the Department of Justice to be the back channel for the FBI, Sean. And another question is, who at the FBI was authorizing this? It had to be McCabe, could it have been McCabe? Could it have been someone above McCabe like Comey, to use Bruce Ohr as the back channel for Christopher Steele? They knew he had been fired. He had violated their protocol. He had violated all of the rules. He had been dismissed, but they were still using him. I think these are some of the biggest questions. And John is right because the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that's something that I have been looking at, they will be very, very -- and they are very, very concerned about what happened, because this affects the ability to trust the bureau, the ability to trust those people and counterintelligence that are giving them the information. This is supposed to be factual. They are supposed to have facts. They attributed everything in that FISC, if you read the application, what's been released, they say, this absolute fact.

But you got them saying, we are going to stop them and they have an insurance policy. Then you got Glenn Simpson here. Now, he wants to throw a Hail Mary with, again, unverified Steele dossier. Steele doesn't even stand -- he doesn't even stand by his own dossier when under oath. But now, we got an oligarchy from Russia kicked out of the country, you've got Ohr, Steele talking about bringing him back in and spreading misinformation, lying to the American people to sway an election, and now lying to a FISA court, getting into the Trump campaign, and using the information after to take down the president after he beats all of this crap."

Instead, it's about China allegedly infiltrating the office of a powerful Democrat in Senator Dianne Feinstein. This involves one of her staffers, his name is Russell Lowe. He was her driver, as you say, for a couple of decades but also, her liaison to the Asian-American community out in her home state of California. He visited relatives a few years ago, overseas, and became acquainted on the trip with someone who it turns out was connected to China's ministry of state security. Basically, a spy. As \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" says, quote: He didn't even know what was happening, that he was being recruited, he just thought it was some friend. Well, no, it wasn't a friend. So five years ago, FBI agents showed up at Feinstein's office here in Washington, and revealed that her staffer was actually under investigation. It does not appear the driver actually revealed anything of major substance, but the contact with China was so serious that Feinstein forced the aid into retirement and tried to keep all this quiet until \"The Chronicle\" blew the story up in about a week or so ago."

Now we got Bruce Ohr, Steele, Fusion GPS, what have we got there?

      "utterance": "Well, from the beginning of this entire episode, it has been very clear that there was a brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton, illegally, and if she lost the election, to frame Donald Trump with false crimes. Why did that happen? It happened because the FBI and the DOJ during the Obama administration were pro-Democrat and anti-Republican. I repeat, this was a partisan decision. This had nothing to do with criminal activity or anything else. They hated Donald Trump. They didn't like Republicans. Why do you think they didn't give a defensive briefing to Donald Trump's campaign about attempted Russian influence? Because they wanted to investigate Donald Trump, not help him. They wanted to frame him. In the case of Dianne Feinstein, they wanted to help the little Democrat who didn't know she had a Chinese spy on her staff for 20 years. I must say, the pathetic nature of the partisanship of the FBI and DOJ under Obama really lays bare the simpleton-like remarks of the president -- the former president, when he said, there was not a scintilla, not an ounce of scandal and his administration. Obama's administration, as far as the FBI and DOJ are concerned, will go down as the single most corrupt FBI and DOJ in the history of the United States. Thank you very much, President Obama."

He is threatening to take down the president of the United States. Now let's walk through this quickly. The president is not a witness to any crime. How do we know that? Because we don't know what crimes they are even talking about. So he doesn't need to be questioned as a witness. The president did not commit a crime. What crime did he commit? So he's not a target, he doesn't need to be questioned about that. According to the Department of Justice, president can't be indicted. A president cannot be questioned by a subordinate, like Mr. Mueller, about his prerogatives as president, that is the firing of a subordinate like Mr. Comey. what questions exactly does Mr. Mueller have? I'm talking to you, Mr. Mueller. Exactly what questions that you have where you seek to turn this country upside down and disenfranchise the over 60 million people who voted for this president of United States? You are a plaything of the media. You are a plaything of the Democrats. You are a plaything of people within the Obama administration who sought from day one to take this president down. Now the president of United States is not an ordinary citizen. He must protect the Constitution. He has to protect the Office of the Presidency. He has to protect the president's prerogatives. He has to protect the separation of powers. That's what this president is doing against this rogue prosecutor! It is Trump who has the white hat. It is a Mueller who has the black cat. And the president's lawyers should this go to court, should have a fantastic opportunity to expose Mr. Mueller, to question Mr. Mueller, to question, where does he have his constitutional power under the Appointments Clause. To question him about whether he thinks a president can be indicted even though the Department of Justice says no. To question him to explain why despite public report, public report, public report about the FBI, the CIA, the FISA report, the dossier, Hillary Clinton's association with Russians, we have Russians everywhere!

The fact of the matter is, ladies and gentlemen of the court, the president wasn't a witness to a crime, wasn't surrounded by Russian, the president didn't commit a crime, the president cannot be indicted, so, as I keep saying on this program, Mr. Mueller, you can leave the room and don't let the door hit you on the ass on the way out.

These questions thought to be asked at all have to be very, very narrow. I wouldn't sit down with him and answer any questions. The fact of the matter is, there is no obstruction of justice, he wasn't a witness to a crime, he didn't commit a crime, he can't be indicted, Mr. Mueller can't question him about presidential prerogatives.

The unemployment rate is at 3.9 percent, more blacks and Hispanics are employed than ever before, the gross -- the GDP hit a new level at 4.1 percent. The deregulatory state is going down, the judiciary is getting remade. I mean, all of these things, no matter how hard the press tries to go against the president, he continues to get results for the American people. So I get that it is frustrating for someone like Mr. Friedman to see that no matter how much they fight against him, that he continues to succeed. And I think the American people are smarter than he understands, and they are actually showing it with their approval rating. So no matter how hard they try, he is getting results."

And I'm wondering, let's just flip the script and say that, a conservative set these things. All these groups that get paid millions and millions of dollars to silence and boycott and attack and go to advertisers, they are kind of silent over this. I'm shocked."

      "utterance": "None of them are journalists. All those people, my former colleague Sean Spicer, how to deal with at the podium, they're activists, they are political activists. It doesn't matter whether it's the New York Times, the Daily Beast, Huffington Post, they are all activists. Thomas Friedman is why Donald Trump is president. This opinion piece tells you everything you need to know, Sean. What does he actually say in that piece? He says, don't focus on the facts. Don't actually focus on the economy, the lack of unemployment, the roaring trade, economics, we've got to take him down. That is the left. They haven't learned anything in the last two years and the results in these special elections this week in the primaries tell you everything that they have not learned. But hey, it's great. Roll on November and roll off--"

Impeach the president, you know, no vision to help the forgotten men and women of this country, no consideration, Obama failed and Trump has great economic success, foreign policy success, keep Obamacare, eliminate ICE, keep open borders, they want their crumbs back, and they want these investigations to stop. And, yes, Devin Nunes was right."

Yes, And here's the reality, that if you -- if the Democrats were going to take control of the House, all you are going to do is add more and more investigations, 24 hours a day. That is what their agenda is. And all of the ability of President Trump to get his agenda with a Republican House is going to stop. People have to understand that President Trump may not be on the ballot this November but his agenda certainly is. We need to go out there with the same fervor that we elected the president with this November and keep a Republican House."

The president is right to hit back, ignore them, get on social media, repost the president, find the facts out for yourself and ask yourself one thing, what do you think of the last year and a half? If you like it, that's what we need to vote for."

This is the problem. Anybody who is with this president right now, they will do whatever they can to destroy them. And I think we have to make it very clear right now what we're up against."

So many keep asking me when are we going to get to the end of this deep state? Remember, it's now worse than we ever thought. It's unappealing layers of an onion. We are not stopping it. And I can tell you this. I promise you it's getting much worse. We'll get to the bottom of it. We will always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled.
