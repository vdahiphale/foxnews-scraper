But this feud draws quite the contrast, if there's anyone who reminds you of the past, one of murky sleaze, it's a Clinton. Their favorite smear, Russian assets. They've said Trump was one. And now, they're saying it's a young clear-eyed female veteran who served her country while rejecting conventional ideology.  There's lots to disagree with on Tulsi, but at least you know she's real, which is why the Dems fear her. The party of identity politics can't figure her identity out.   Maybe that's why so many Republicans like her. She's isn't manufactured to please the bots at MSNBC, but Hillary is. Her bitter idiotic commentary keeps reminding you of why Trump won. Think about it. She says this so- called Russian asset would split the Democratic vote if she went rogue? No. She'll likely pull more R's than D's. Despite what Hillary claims, Tulsi is no Jill Stein. She's sane of that with a libertarian bent, one that's not to the left of the Dems, but to the right of the Dems. So not only is Hillary stupidly wrong about Tulsi, she makes it clear who the Republican asset really is. It's Hillary. Everytime she opens her mouth she makes the Dems looks sad. Are we sure she's not on Trump's payroll?  Dagen, I have a theory. I haven't named it yet, but I call it smear by external preference. That means you can be in a punk band, right? A very popular punk band, but among your fans are skinheads. So someone could say, oh, you're a skinhead band, or you're a skinhead asset. So she could have a ton of fans, some of them are Russian. Some of them are Canadian.  She can't help, likewise, we can't help who our fans are. So, if Canadians like you, are you a Canadian asset? Do you see my point?",

To her fans, and there're still a few, she should have been able to beat Trump as easy as driving through a McDonald's drive-thru, but she can't.   And in that puff podcast that she did, of course, she has to go after Fox News. But she longs for the day where there were just three television networks and a few newspapers, and she actually had the audacity to say it was a much more controllable environment. She said, so it's a lot harder for Americans to know what they're supposed to believe. That's how she views the world that she's out there to -- the American people know what they believe in, and they don't believe in you. Bye.",

But this feud draws quite the contrast, if there's anyone who reminds you of the past, one of murky sleaze, it's a Clinton. Their favorite smear, Russian assets. They've said Trump was one. And now, they're saying it's a young clear-eyed female veteran who served her country while rejecting conventional ideology. There's lots to disagree with on Tulsi, but at least you know she's real, which is why the Dems fear her. The party of identity politics can't figure her identity out. Maybe that's why so many Republicans like her. She's isn't manufactured to please the bots at MSNBC, but Hillary is. Her bitter idiotic commentary keeps reminding you of why Trump won. Think about it. She says this so- called Russian asset would split the Democratic vote if she went rogue? No. She'll likely pull more R's than D's. Despite what Hillary claims, Tulsi is no Jill Stein. She's sane of that with a libertarian bent, one that's not to the left of the Dems, but to the right of the Dems. So not only is Hillary stupidly wrong about Tulsi, she makes it clear who the Republican asset really is. It's Hillary. Everytime she opens her mouth she makes the Dems looks sad. Are we sure she's not on Trump's payroll? Dagen, I have a theory. I haven't named it yet, but I call it smear by external preference. That means you can be in a punk band, right? A very popular punk band, but among your fans are skinheads. So someone could say, oh, you're a skinhead band, or you're a skinhead asset. So she could have a ton of fans, some of them are Russian. Some of them are Canadian. She can't help, likewise, we can't help who our fans are. So, if Canadians like you, are you a Canadian asset? Do you see my point?"

All of her failings, all of her failures, she can't take ownership of them. To her fans, and there're still a few, she should have been able to beat Trump as easy as driving through a McDonald's drive-thru, but she can't. And in that puff podcast that she did, of course, she has to go after Fox News. But she longs for the day where there were just three television networks and a few newspapers, and she actually had the audacity to say it was a much more controllable environment. She said, so it's a lot harder for Americans to know what they're supposed to believe. That's how she views the world that she's out there to -- the American people know what they believe in, and they don't believe in you. Bye."

The Democrat wants to impeach, but they want to do it in the dark. Republicans aren't going to stand for it. But, to be honest with you, going after Schiff is a legitimate thing. I mean, the guy wants to run for senate when Feinstein retires. That's his move. He fabricated quotes on national television. He worked with the whistle blower beforehand. The guy is totally corrupt. No one trusts him, OK? And I think he's leading the Democrats over a cliff and Nancy is allowing it to happen, because if you look around the country -- you know, we had Watergate, even Iran-contra, or Lewinsky, this scandal was consuming the nation.

I think that the Republicans are focused on process to defend the president because that's their best argument right now. And I don't think it's so much Schiff, himself, because his name I.D. isn't high enough, but it's the -- that the whole process seems to be geared to hurt the president, and that it's all being done in secret. People in that right now -- everything is out in the open about everything, all the time, we're all over-sharing, and this is the one thing that can't be done in public. Like, you hear about these witnesses going behind closed doors. You maybe hear a little bit about the testimony, but you don't see transcripts. You don't actually see the people. I think that their process point to the extent that they have a good one right now is that I do think the president will continue to be very frustrated.

You know, they know that he's got a lot of baggage, so they can slow him down and use him against him. But I'm not going to fault the Democrats on this because when you're out of power, this is what you do. It's like, Reagan was demonized, Bush was demonized, Clinton was demonized, Bush was demonized, Obama was demonized, now Trump. The engine of demonization begins with being out of power. You've got to keep busy. Why help these guys? You're hoping to get them out of the White House. But what's new, I think, is that for every large effort unleashed by the Democrats, there's an equally large response. The ideal old world was -- it was a one-way street. You could just hammer away at Reagan. You could hammer away at Bush. And, you know, they called Bush a warmonger. And Bush has said, you know, you can't do that.

Take a look at some of my newfound four-legged friends. The bark ball held in Washington at the Washington Hilton, and it was a black-tie event. Here is a greyhound in black tie and cuffs. Here's my wife meeting her match, a poodle with purple hair. And here is some of the prominent sponsors, Senator Dole and his wife, Elizabeth Dole. Roberta McCain, who is Senator McCain's 108-year-old mom, and former D.C. City Council member Carol Schwartz. The Humane Rescue Alliance has been in the nation's capital for 150 years. The first multi-state animal welfare group in the country, they care for animals in need. Pull them out of storms and the like and stop animal cruelty. I want to thank my friend Cynthia (ph) for inviting me. It was a great evening."

Isn't that cute? Also, I sat down with Ben Shapiro for his show, The Daily Wire that was released yesterday. And you can go to the dailywire.com.

Look at that. Anytime. Get some kittens and strobe lights together. They love every minute of it. They were doing so many drugs in the bathroom. Unbelievable. But that's Studio 54. All right.
